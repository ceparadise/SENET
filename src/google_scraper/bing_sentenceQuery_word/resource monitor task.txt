In case chose CPU monitor show graph like one
Tip You use Options Always Top option make Task Manager stay top every window really helpful displaying mini graph view
The App History tab show resource usage time application whether currently running
This really useful troubleshooting something might happened front PC
The one problem default App History tab show process belong Windows Metro apps make sense considering need use Task Manager desktop see tab first place
Luckily go Options Show history process see everything list including regular Windows apps
Much written Microsoft added ability manage startup application Task Manager Startup tab pretty simple use
So today going mention Startup impact column important understanding slowing system boot time monitoring PC somebody else take look
One new option added Task Manager recent version Analyze Wait Chain option task Details view
This allows see process waiting resource used another process
What mean application hanging reason analyze wait chain see whether waiting something use
For instance printed Word used option print process happening see would happen
In case Word waiting handle printing application
It worth noting Word written properly GUI interface actually hang waiting process

There lot information overwhelming curious anything select find information
Learning use Task Manager must anyone want full control PC
The tutorial let know every part application really master system going take experimentation
Monitor thing closely look process name confused gain much deeper understanding Windows work time
Enjoy

One fact life Windows every awhile computer slow freeze program wo work way expect
Would nice way finding gone wrong whether CPU use memory use program behaving badly something else
Yes would definitely nice know thing
And Resource Monitor exists Windows
This tutorial show everything need know great tool use We know natural many people start playing new program without reading direction first
In case fine
In case Resource Monitor cause kind trouble experiment without knowing
That see pretty emphatic warning
Please heed warning
This guide work Windows Windows Windows
We honestly think ever encountered Windows program offered many different way launch
Clearly Microsoft intends Resource Monitor used
There may even way found know another gateway Resource Monitor love hear
Here way I found Type Resource Monitor resource Start Menu search box click appropriate search result
Another way open Resource Monitor type Start Menu search box press Enter
Or could open Start Menu go All Programs Accessories System Tools Resource Monitor
If prefer using keyboard press
This action open Task Manager
Inside go Performance tab click Resource Monitor button
Whichever method choose see Resource Monitor Overview screen series constantly changing list graph giving window computer behind scene
Unfortunately finding Resource Monitor Windows easy task
If search Start screen resource resource monitor wo get shortcut tool search result
But still launch
If want use search search executable file click tap search result displayed
Alternatively first open new Task Manager
If know tutorial help
Then go Performance tab
At bottom tab find link saying Open Resource Monitor
Click tap
In Windows Resource Monitor window look like The fastest way launch Windows use Cortana search power
Enter word search field taskbar click tap shortcut
If prefer also use window order launch
pressing key simultaneously enter command text field press
Another way open tool involves use
quickly pressing simultaneously key keyboard
Then open detailed view select tab click tap shortcut bottom window
This window look like Windows Because tool look work modern Windows version Windows Windows Windows use screenshots taken Windows
The Overview window show CPU activity default
You see tab Memory Disk Network
In lower section window collapsed window Disk Network Memory idea order different really matter
Clicking arrow right end title bar expand list
You may want expand whole Resource Monitor window size see going
You also drag bottom border individual window left show le data time
Each window show list program currently using resource graph right give visual representation total
You change size graph clicking tapping Views button
The default view Large
Watch changing list graph see program using resource
We found interesting executable Opera web browser show multiple time list tab executable
However easy correlate jump graph exact time set active resource
Let start exploring CPU window default view
It easier see information expand Resource Monitor window size click Tile box upper right corner
Click CPU tab find Processes window expanded
Beneath collapsed window Services Associated Handles Associated Modules
We wo discussing Associated Handles Associated Modules detail
They get populated data select running process service
For want know module handle module helper file program library DLL file used process select handle pointer refer system element file registry key event directory used selected process
On right see graph CPU usage scroll show data real time
If multicore CPU first two graph show average data core others independent core
Let look Processes window
On left see list process PID process identifier name process helpful identifying status running otherwise thread core element Windows process people concern CPU CPU usage right one moment average CPU usage averaged time
If ca read column heading content grab column divider title bar slide right one one everything visible
If hover cursor column heading description column pop
If process responding name show red
What list
Like many Windows program Resource Monitor let sort content column ascending descending order
Average CPU list sort process using resource top
Chances good wo see big resource hog since Windows program well behaved
But find computer slowing unexpectedly take look column
If something taking lot CPU resource may want consider shutting restarting
If sure something tap hold name choose Search online list
That pull search default browser search engine find name represents
If process show red status Not Responding something similar shut process process name choosing End Process
Do use End process unless absolutely sure know
Windows ask sure want end process shuts wo protect say yes something think know going
Some process interlinked shutting one wreak havoc others
Also definitely want end SYSTEM process Windows process critical functioning
When ending process make sure know
The Services section similar Processes window
Try expanding without collapsing Processes window take look
You see list name different name Processes window also change watch
The difference thing running Windows internal service
If select one running process Service window show service associated process
This pretty handy information time
If tap hold service name see option stop service restart case malfunctioning need use search information online
Next click tap Memory tab
At top see list program process using memory space bottom bar graph showing available memory use
The column labeled Hard Commit Working Set Shareable Private followed KB meaning memory space kilobyte
You probably wo see anything zero Hard column
The term hard fault somewhat misleading really fault memory instance Windows ran space RAM use swap file hard drive space set aside Windows used physical memory run
If see lot hard fault good indication need buy memory computer
The Commit column show much memory space Windows allots program default
The program may may using space
If column already sorted click one show using memory
The Working Set column show much memory program actually using moment
The Shareable column show much memory allotted program actually shared program Private column show much memory allotted program used program
If program show using way much memory decide close
The bar graph memory use graph shown right side Resource Monitor window
The Disk section probably know show using hard drive resource
This useful hard drive light stay sure
There three window labeled Processes Disk Activity Disk Activity Storage
Expand take look
You probably also want expand column heading see whole title
In column heading stand byte per second
There lot information section
You might surprised see much disk activity favorite program require since Windows program usually well behaved would uncommon see something really going crazy making hard drive keep churning away except program used download file
As Resource Monitor section tap hold name know Search online get explanation work Processes Disk Activity section
You also end process menu recommended unless know
In Disk Activity section name nothing curious look
The bottom section Storage show list drive information Logical Disk Physical Disk Active Time Available Space Total Space Disk Queue Length
The first
Disk Queue Length indication many request disk space waiting fulfilled
Unless something ordinary software seriously misbehaving column data mostly zero
Which
The final tab Network
When open one see section Processes Network Activity Network Activity TCP Connections Listening Ports
The first section one anything others information manipulate change anything
TCP Connections Listening Ports contain information useful advanced user good networking knowledge wo talking much
Take look Processes Network Activity section
Here find list program running connecting network internet
You probably wo find surprise since likely list browser apps network connection process program like Dropbox rely cloud storage
If name cryptic use excellent Search Online command menu see
One useful thing tab select one process group process interested data lower section automatically filtered see Network Activity TCP Connections Listening Ports selection made
The graph right pretty show overview network activity TCP connection activity local area connection
The Resource Monitor excellent way open window Windows speak
It let look going behind scene stop activity causing problem
As long proceed caution play around thing sake playing around learn lot happening inside computer especially spent time dealing older version Windows definitely appreciate well Windows Windows Windows designed work

There saying granddaddy taught
You never much money happiness RAM said truer word spoken
Of course I might add thing list like pizza puppy bandwidth another time
With Windows growing popularity program continuing consume RAM knowing great tool use prove valuable skill sysadmin work PowerUser home
So article take close look Resource Monitor specifically around Memory
Microsoft state version version know minimum chump
Of course sometimes deal company issue u budget afford always RAM disposal
In time keeping close eye consuming precious RAM even important
Enter Resource Monitor
For starter let talk Resource Monitor actually
It rather like computer Hyde Performance Monitor Jekyll seen BBC production
And seen trust
The Resource Monitor hidden part Performance Monitor come play cat away
And much fun two
You use Resource Monitor get much point time view going system ever could Task Manager readily PerfMon
But want technical definition system application Microsoft Windows operating system display information use hardware CPU memory disk network software file handle module resource real Perhaps explanation point accurate
Resource Monitor run process totally ironic since actually get Resource Monitor Performance Monitor
Like I said Jekyll Hyde
It five tab display overview current system consumption big four resource category CPU Memory Disk Network along drill down
While display detail real time also display running second history
It replacement Task Manager though get replacement Performance Monitor
But serve niche many third party application developed past including several
Don think complete replacement tool already use familiar pocket lot easy carry form often enough need bring whole toolbox
There several way get Resource Monitor running
I usually launch Task Manager click Performance tab click button bottom Open Resource Arguably slowest possible way get I roll
You also No matter way choose go look Task Manager see Resource Monitor look like process
Go Details though see run
You use Resource Monitor keep eye resource consumption run application test configuration setting well troubleshoot various performance issue
In post going focus memory related task
Let look three main section help
Clicking memory tab show three key piece information
At top see list process currently running system well quick peak percentage overall memory use
It small might miss right top Processes bar
Each column give insight happening system
Let take look
These case Image name file executable program run PID Process ID program service
Each rest column indicates value specific process table graph two section show aggregate running system
If enough RAM process generate hard fault need go disk get data page file
When trying evaluate program run well particular system pay attention
Low hard fault mean thing good RAM perspective
Lots hard fault mean need RAM
Almost program ever hard fault ever think badly system program see occasional hard fault
But consistently see several per second definitely want upgrade
Is program memory hog delicate flower
Commit represents total amount physical RAM page file space Windows allocated process
Allocated may much lower actually used expect lower Working Set
Working set show amount physical RAM process using page file total two type allocated memory shareable private
Sharing good say program learned manner kindergarten
Shareable memory much physical RAM process sharing process
Think shareable memory whenever related process operating system member suite common element like Word Outlook
This number represents physical memory process process using
Private always le equal Commit Working Set best indicator much memory specific program monopolizes
For starter click column name column sort ascending click sort descending
This help find looking either name determine PID sort largest smallest value column
You also check process keep top display
That also generate orange line histogram left see running second indicator change
It process thing get interesting
You end process process tree like Task Manager
You also suspend resume process though sometimes either work make system unstable search online information
The interesting thing analyze wait chain tell process waiting process release resource access
You may think program performing poorly wait chain help determine really another process problem
Next graphical representation memory including much physical RAM installed much available using like
Again note quick peak value top bar section
Here mean
They add almost installed expect come little short
This BIOS system driver virtual interrupt etc
go
There really much interesting see
Just sound like total memory use system
This memory still held used recently
Eventually flushed written page file called service quickly resource demand require
This paged memory cleared yet used recently
They linked working set owning process go active process request data also cleared free RAM demand climb
This memory free clear ready allocated process needed
The rest underneath bar chart exactly think
Again look number add perfectly
Finally see running second histogram system usage left side including Used Physical Memory Commit Charge Hard
Here
Used Physical Memory pretty straightforward
Of X GB RAM system much using moment
Obviously lower percentage better
Having graphical representation update every second help evaluate system experience peak surge also see action take program launch affect memory consumption
Commit Charge look make enough RAM namely using virtual memory
The Commit Charge number percentage total memory using including physical RAM page file
This help see whatever happening moment impact system particularly surge launch upon particular action settle
Hard sound bad mostly
No fault Earth going open swallow hold
A hard fault happens process need data data RAM page file meaning must fetched disk
That horribly slow compared RAM way avoid either RAM run le stuff
Seeing number best way evaluate really need memory system max hardware support need upgrade disk
Remember page file stored hard drive
The slower disk drive worse experience hard fault occur
Solid state drive definitely help offset bad performance lower maximum memory system
Windows run well much le RAM expect system better
Windows use much RAM see lower value Free Memory assume mean enough
Between allocated memory Modified Standby probably plenty memory
If Hard Faults surest sign
Resource Monitor cool tool use get better idea going memory consumption system aware also evaluate process disk network
We may cover future post enough interest leave comment would like
August pm Is way adjust graph show data period second
Thanks August pm Hi Zev

Scott Lowe provides overview metric Windows Resource Monitor
Find use tool troubleshoot CPU performance issue
By In part one series Windows Resource Monitor tool I explained
In column I discus various metric view Resource Monitor explain graph see provide context around metric
Let start overall look console
The statistic area occupies window
In section I provide detail metric
I wo repeat metric one type metric appears multiple area I list
This section window list running process using CPU resource
You shown name executable number performance statistic
The Services section list service running
In Figure A notice service related two selected process listed
This design provides way see process service interrelated also eas troubleshooting
You listed service manage service
Have ever needed determine process holding file open
With Resource Monitor Associated Handles section
Handles pointer reference file registry key directory thing
Modules helper file program DLL file used process perform task
You use section drill looking potential performance issue
The right side window number graph depicting performance metric
On graph see two metric depicted blue line green area graph
The blue line show total processing power CPU frequency available system green area show current utilization available resource
Resource Monitor run many different version Windows many computer day processor step clock speed way conserve power lower temperature
When happens blue line change reflect change CPU frequency green area adjusts meet new reality
This graph indicates much CPU horsepower dedicated background resource process
For CPU core much CPU use
Some CPU marked Parked mean shut temporarily nothing present
These screenshots article taken hour student campus Exchange server basically twiddling thumb couple month

Greg Shultz explores Windows Resource Monitor feature goal teach tool used troubleshoot performance
By After last week blog posted I received message reader described Reliability Monitor chart full Windows Miscellaneous failure seemed occurring regular basis
The reader suspected malfunctioning process cause wanted detail using Resource Monitor keep tab system resource used running process service
While I able help reader comment made feeling overwhelmed amount detailed information number feature packed Windows Resource Monitor stuck day
After taking detailed look around Resource Monitor talking user I discovered many folk access Resource Monitor use like Windows Task Manager Processes Performance tab
In word I found many user paying attention watching graph looking process list using Resource Monitor feature manipulate display focus specific information could help troubleshoot isolate problem
In edition I provide overview Resource Monitor feature
My goal help learn use Resource Monitor tool determine system resource used process service
Once know Resource Monitor work future article I show use Resource Monitor delve specific problem tracking unresponsive process analyzing heavy resource consumer investigating memory usage
There actually several way launch Resource Monitor
If happen Task Manager click button Performance tab
You access Resource Monitor Start menu navigating All Programs Accessories Systems Tools
Or click Start button type Start Search box press Enter
As see Figure A Overview tab display basic system resource usage information four main tab CPU Memory Disk Network
You also see base graph four category
As name implies Overview tab provides basic overview system current status
As see CPU graph display total percentage CPU capacity currently use green CPU Maximum Frequency blue
The Disk graph display total current green highest active time percentage blue
The Network graph display current total network traffic Kbps green percentage network capacity use blue
The Memory graph display current Hard Faults per second green percentage physical memory currently use blue
If seeking detailed data specific component select associated tab
The first table displayed tab called key table display complete list process using resource associated tab
For example process displayed key table Figure B specifically tied CPU
You hide show table clicking arrow right side table title bar
As see Associated Handles Associated Modules table currently hidden
Each table contains multiple column display pertinent data
You view definition data hovering mouse pointer column title want information
When analyzing data presented table manipulate column focus specific data using several technique On tab see set pertinent graph right panel
These graph display minute worth activity run continuously
If want take closer look activity particular graph scroll view pull Monitor menu select Stop Monitoring command
Select Start Monitoring command resume
You hide graph panel clicking arrow left side title bar
On hand choose size graph clicking Views button choose small medium large graph
In Figure D I using graph
You also see small bar graph many table title bar show current result corresponding graph
For example Physical Memory table title bar contains two bar graph one showing memory use showing available memory
When tracking specific problem use Filtering feature highlight certain process service
When select process process filtered easy see selected process coming play
This make easier focus tracking ultimately solving problem hand
In key table tab notice check box adjacent listed process
If select process place particular process occurs highlighted orange tab process service come play
There many way reconfigure Resource Monitor display pinpoint specific area want look
As experiment Resource Monitor save configuration setting designed specific monitoring operation separate file
Unfortunately Filtering selection saved part configuration setting
As using Resource Monitor keep tip mind
As see Windows Resource Monitor powerful tool lot feature
In future article explore use Resource Monitor delve specific problem tracking unresponsive process analyzing heavy resource consumer investigating memory usage
Have used Resource Monitor track resource usage troubleshoot problem

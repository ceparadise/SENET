Databases structured storage retrieval modification deletion data conjunction various operation
A DBMS extract information database response query
A brief treatment database follows
For full treatment
A database stored set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Using keywords various sorting command user rapidly search rearrange group select field many record retrieve create report particular data
Database record file must organized allow retrieval information
main way user retrieve database information
The power DBMS come ability define new relationship basic one given table use get response query
Typically user provides string character computer search database corresponding sequence provides source material character appear user request example record content field person word
The many user large database must able manipulate information within quickly given time
Moreover large business organization tend build many independent file containing related even overlapping data activity often require linking data several file
Several different type DBMS developed support requirement flat hierarchical network relational
Early system arranged sequentially alphabetically numerically chronologically development storage device made possible random access data via index
In flat database record organized according simple list entity many simple database personal computer flat structure
The record organized treelike structure level record branching set smaller category
Unlike hierarchical database provide single link set record different level create multiple linkage set placing link pointer one set record another speed versatility network database led wide use within business
used association file record expressed link simple flat list becomes one row table relation multiple relation mathematically associated yield desired information
Various Structured Query Language widely employed DBMS relational database
database store manipulate complex data structure called object organized hierarchical class may inherit property class higher chain database structure flexible adaptable
The information many database consists text document database primarily contain information statistic table financial data raw scientific technical data
Small database maintained system may used individual home
These larger database become increasingly important business life part commonly designed office software including program
Typical commercial database application include airline reservation function medical record hospital legal record insurance company
The largest database usually maintained governmental agency business organization university
These database may contain text material abstract report legal statute wire service newspaper journal encyclopaedia catalog various kind
Reference database contain bibliography index serve guide location information book periodical published literature
Thousands publicly accessible database exist covering topic ranging law medicine engineering news current event game classified advertisement instructional course
Increasingly formerly separate database combined electronically larger collection known
Businesses government agency employ software analyze multiple aspect data various pattern
For example government agency might flag human investigation company individual purchased suspicious quantity certain equipment material even though purchase spread around country various subsidiary
early adopter computer database technology
In United States National Crime Information Center NCIC established police record subsequently computerized made available police agency throughout country
The NCIC database enables local police department apprehend offender might otherwise evade advent database marketing individual customer characteristic purchase history retained company information system

A short macroinstruction rule specifies certain input sequence often sequence mapped replacement output sequence also often sequence character according defined procedure
The mapping process instantiates transforms macro use specific sequence known
A facility writing macro may provided part part
In former case macro used make task using application le repetitive
In latter case tool allows programmer enable even design
Macros used make sequence computing instruction available single program statement making programming task le tedious le
Thus called macro big block code expanded small sequence character
Macros often allow positional keyword parameter dictate program generates used create entire program suite according variable factor
The term derives expansion originally used generating code
allow short sequence keystroke mouse action transform usually sequence keystroke mouse action
In way frequently used repetitive sequence keystroke mouse movement
Separate program creating macro called
During macro program originally SuperKey KeyWorks Prokey popular first mean automatically format variety user input task
These program based TSR mode operation applied keyboard input matter context occurred
They extent fallen obsolescence following advent user interface availability keyboard mouse macro application making possible create keyboard macro
Keyboard macro recent time come life method exploiting economy MMORPGs
By tirelessly performing boring repetitive low risk action player running macro earn large amount game currency resource
This effect even larger player operates multiple account simultaneously operates account large amount time day
As money generated without human intervention dramatically upset economy game
For reason use macro violation MMORPGs administrator MMORPGs fight continual war identify punish macro user
Keyboard mouse macro created using application macro feature sometimes called
They created carrying sequence letting application record action
An underlying macro programming language commonly direct access feature application may also exist
The programmer text editor short editing macro follows idea conclusion
In effect editor made macro
Emacs originally devised set macro editing language later ported dialect
Another programmer text editor descendant also full implementation macro
It record register macro person type keyboard replayed edited like macro Microsoft Office
Vim also scripting language called create macro
VBA programming language included Office
However function evolved replaced macro language originally included application
access executes document opened
This make relatively easy write VBA commonly known
In became one common type computer virus
However late date patching updating program
In addition current program immediately counteract attack
Languages rudimentary macro system implemented compiler assembler
macro work simple textual token rather character level
A classic use macro computer typesetting system derivative functionality based macro
experimental system seek reconcile macro system
typed syntax macro one productive way think syntax macro
Other example Some language embedded text source code language
The mechanism code fragment recognised instance bracketed similar textual macro language much powerful fully featured language
Macros language written subset compiler executes statement compilation time output execution form part code compiled
The ability use familiar macro language give power much greater text substitution macro expense larger slower compiler
frame macro command syntax also contain text language
Each frame generic component hierarchy nested subassemblies procedure integrating subassembly frame recursive process resolve integration conflict favor higher level subassemblies
The output custom document typically compilable source module
Frame technology avoid proliferation similar subtly different component issue plagued software development since invention macro subroutine
Most assembly language le powerful procedural macro facility example allowing block code repeated N time completely different syntax actual assembly language
Macro C preprocessor described work level lexical token preserve lexical structure reliably
Syntactic macro system work instead level preserve lexical structure original program
The widely used implementation syntactic macro system found language
These language especially suited style macro due uniform parenthesized syntax known
In particular uniform syntax make easier determine invocation macro
Lisp macro transform program structure full language available express transformation
While syntactic macro often found language also available language
They also available extension

Before Lisp macro operator whose input value computed argument rather syntactic form argument whose output value used computation
In word FEXPRs implemented level EVAL provided window layer
This generally found difficult model reason effectively
In Timothy Hart proposed adding macro Lisp AI Memo MACRO Definitions LISP
In number paper introduced notion expansion system syntactic environment macro definition macro use distinct allowing macro definers user worry inadvertent variable capture cf

Hygienic macro standardized Scheme standard
The upcoming standard also include hygienic macro
A number competing implementation hygienic macro exist explicit renaming syntactic closure
Both standardized Scheme standard
Recently combined notion hygienic macro syntactic expansion time one macro system ordinary runtime another block code showed apply interleaved expansion parsing language
A number language Scheme either implement hygienic macro implement partially hygienic system
Examples include
conjecture three category make primary legitimate us macro system
Others proposed alternative us macro macro system unhygienic allow selective unhygienic transformation
The interaction macro language feature productive area research
For example useful programming interaction macro construct must defined use together
Module interact macro proposed Scheme language macro
For example language extends notion macro system syntactic tower macro written language including macro using hygiene ensure syntactic layer distinct allowing module export macro module
Macros normally used map short string macro invocation longer sequence instruction
Another le common use macro reverse map sequence instruction macro string
This approach taken Mobile Programming System used rudimentary macro compiler called SIMCMP map specific instruction set given computer counterpart macro
Applications notably compiler written macro run without change computer equipped rudimentary macro compiler
The first application run context sophisticated powerful macro compiler written macro language
This macro compiler applied fashion produce compiled much efficient version
The advantage approach complex application ported one computer different computer little effort target machine architecture writing rudimentary macro compiler
The advent modern programming language notably compiler available virtually computer rendered approach superfluous
This however one first instance first

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Cyber security includes controlling physical access hardware well protecting harm may come via network access data code injection
Also due operator whether accidental security susceptible deviating secure procedure various method
The field growing importance due increasing reliance computer system growth including tiny device part Internet Things
A vulnerability weakness design implementation operation internal control
Most vulnerability discovered documented CVE database
An vulnerability one least one working attack exists
Vulnerabilities often hunted exploited aid manually using customized script
To secure computer system important understand attack made typically classified one category A computer system algorithm secret method bypassing normal authentication security control
They may exist number reason including original design poor configuration
They may added authorized party allow legitimate access attacker malicious reason regardless motif existence create vulnerability
DoS designed make machine network resource unavailable intended user
Attackers deny service individual victim deliberately entering wrong password enough consecutive time cause victim account locked may overload capability machine network block user
While network attack single IP address blocked adding new firewall rule many form DDoS attack possible attack come large number point defending much difficult
Such attack originate range technique possible including innocent system fooled sending traffic victim
An unauthorized user gaining physical access computer likely able directly copy data
They may also compromise security making modification installing software using wireless mouse
Even system protected standard security measure may able booting another operating system tool bootable medium
designed prevent attack
act surreptitiously listening private conversation typically host network
For instance program used eavesdrop system
Even machine operate closed system contact outside world eavesdropped upon via monitoring faint transmission generated hardware specification NSA referring attack
act masquerading valid entity falsification data username order gain access information resource one otherwise unauthorized obtain
There several type spoofing including describes malicious modification product
security service planting surveillance capability router example
describes situation attacker level restricted access able without authorization elevate privilege access level
For example standard computer user may able fool system giving access restricted data even full unrestricted access system
attempt acquire sensitive information usernames password credit card detail directly user
Phishing typically carried often directs user enter detail fake website whose look feel almost identical legitimate one
Preying victim trust phishing classified form
also known UI redress attack User Interface redress attack malicious technique attacker trick user clicking button link another webpage user intended click top level page
This done using multiple transparent opaque layer
The attacker basically click meant top level page routing irrelevant page likely owned someone else
A similar technique used hijack keystroke
Carefully drafting combination stylesheets iframes button text box user led believing typing password information authentic webpage channeled invisible frame controlled attacker
aim convince user disclose secret password card number etc
example impersonating bank contractor customer
A common scam involves fake CEO email sent accounting finance department
In early reported scam cost US business two year
In May team victim type cyber scam perpetrator impersonating team president resulting handover team employee tax form
Employee behavior big impact information security organization
Cultural concept help different segment organization work effectively work effectiveness towards information security within Relationship Organizational Culture Information Security provides following definition information security culture totality pattern behavior organization contribute protection information Andersson Reimers found employee often see part organization Information Security effort often take action ignore organizational Information Security best interest
Research show Information security culture need improved continuously
In Security Culture Analysis author commented never ending process cycle evaluation change To manage information security culture five step taken strategic planning operative planning implementation
The growth number computer system increasing reliance upon individual business industry government mean increasing number system risk
The computer system financial regulator financial institution like SWIFT investment bank commercial bank prominent hacking target cybercriminals interested manipulating market making illicit gain
Web site apps accept store brokerage account information also prominent hacking target potential immediate financial gain transferring money making purchase selling information
payment system also tampered order gather customer account data
Computers control function many utility including coordination valve opening closing water gas network
The Internet potential attack vector machine connected worm demonstrated even equipment controlled computer connected Internet vulnerable
In division investigated hacking incident energy company
Vulnerabilities many use local radio cellular communication cause problem billing fraud
The industry reliant series complex system could attacked
A simple power outage one airport cause repercussion worldwide much system relies radio transmission could disrupted controlling aircraft ocean especially dangerous radar surveillance extends mile offshore
There also potential attack within aircraft
In Europe NewPENS US NextGen program moving create dedicated network
The consequence successful attack range loss confidentiality loss system integrity outage loss aircraft even loss life
Desktop computer laptop commonly targeted gather password financial account information construct attack another target
device like sensor camera microphone GPS receiver compass could exploited may collect personal information including sensitive health information
Wifi Bluetooth cell phone network device could used attack vector sensor might remotely activated successful breach
The increasing number device also potential target
Large corporation common target
In many case aimed financial gain identity theft involves loss million client credit card detail recent breach
Some cyberattacks ordered foreign government government engage intent spread propaganda sabotage spy target
Many people believe Russian government played major role US presidential election using Twitter Facebook affect result election whether true ultimately determined congress
Medical record targeted use general identify theft health insurance fraud impersonating patient obtain prescription drug recreational purpose resale
Although cyber threat continue increase organization increase security training business
Not attack financially motivated however example security firm suffered serious series attack group retaliation firm CEO claiming infiltrated group motive appears embarrass data leak cripple company wiping workstation server
Vehicles increasingly computerized engine timing seat belt tensioners door lock many model
Additionally may use bluetooth communicate onboard consumer device cell phone network

All system carry security risk issue gained wide attention
Simple example risk include malicious used attack vector car onboard microphone used eavesdropping
However access gained car internal danger much greater widely publicised test hacker remotely carjacked vehicle mile away drove ditch
Manufacturers reacting number way pushing security fix air car computer system
In area autonomous vehicle September announced initial safety standard called state come uniform policy
Government computer system commonly attacked activist foreign power
Local regional government infrastructure control police intelligence agency communication student record financial system also potential target largely computerized
government control access facility use vulnerable
The IoT network physical object device vehicle building enables collect exchange data concern raised developed without appropriate consideration security challenge involved
While IoT creates opportunity direct integration physical world system also provides opportunity misuse
In particular Internet Things spread widely cyber attack likely become increasingly physical rather simply virtual threat
If front door lock connected Internet phone criminal could enter home press button stolen hacked phone
People could stand lose much credit card number world controlled device
Thieves also used electronic mean circumvent hotel door lock

There many report hospital hospital organization getting hacked including attack exploit virus sensitive data stored hospital server
On December US released recommendation medical maintain security device structure enforcement
Serious financial damage caused standard model estimating cost incident data available made public organization involved
Several computer security consulting firm produce estimate total worldwide loss attributable attack hostile digital act general
The loss estimate firm range billion worm virus billion form covert attack
The reliability estimate often challenged underlying methodology basically anecdotal
Security breach continue cost business billion dollar survey revealed security staff believe senior leadership take cyber precaution strategic priority
However reasonable estimate financial cost security breach actually help organization make rational investment decision
According classic analyzing optimal investment level information security one conclude amount firm spends protect information generally small fraction expected loss loss resulting
As motivation breach computer security vary attacker
Some activist others criminal looking financial gain
attacker common well resourced started amateur hacked recounted
A standard part particular system identify might motivate attack system might motivated breach
The level detail precaution vary depending system secured
A home military face different threat even underlying technology use similar
In computer security countermeasure action device procedure technique reduces eliminating preventing minimizing harm cause discovering reporting corrective action taken
End user security habit
Reimers Andersson conducted number study end user security habit found type repeated security best practice marked effect perception compliance good end user network security habit especially concerning malware ransomeware
Some common countermeasure listed following section alternately secure design mean software designed ground secure
In case security considered main feature
Some technique approach include The Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture design describe security control security countermeasure positioned relate overall
These control serve purpose maintain system quality attribute confidentiality integrity availability accountability
Techopedia defines security architecture unified security design address necessity potential risk involved certain scenario environment
It also specifies apply security control
The design process generally reproducible
The key attribute security architecture A state computer security conceptual ideal attained use three process threat prevention detection response
These process based various policy system component include following Today computer security comprises mainly preventive measure like firewall
A firewall defined way filtering network data host network another network implemented software running machine hooking case operating system built operating system provide real time filtering blocking
Another implementation physical firewall consists separate machine filtering network traffic
Firewalls common amongst machine permanently connected
Some organization turning platform extend data accessibility detect
However relatively organisation maintain computer system effective detection system fewer still organised response mechanism place
As result Reuters point Companies first time report losing electronic theft data physical stealing asset
The primary obstacle effective eradication cyber crime could traced excessive reliance firewall automated detection system
Yet basic evidence gathering using put criminal behind bar
Vulnerability management cycle identifying remediating mitigating especially
Vulnerability management integral computer security
Vulnerabilities discovered analyzes computer system search known vulnerability insecure software configuration susceptibility Beyond vulnerability scanning many organisation contract outside security auditor run regular system identify vulnerability
In sector contractual requirement
While correctness computer system possible yet common
Operating system formally verified include make small percentage market
properly implemented virtually impossible directly break
Breaking requires input stolen key stolen plaintext either end transmission extra cryptanalytic information
method mitigating unauthorized access system sensitive information
It requires something know password PIN something card dongle cellphone piece hardware
This increase security unauthorized person need gain access
The tight security measure le unauthorized hack
Social engineering direct computer access physical attack prevented mean difficult enforce relative sensitivity information
Training often involved help mitigate risk even highly disciplined environment
military organization social engineering attack still difficult foresee prevent
Enoculation derived seek prevent social engineering fraudulent trick trap instilling resistance persuasion attempt exposure similar related attempt
It possible reduce attacker chance keeping system date security patch update using security scanner hiring competent people responsible security
The effect data reduced careful
While hardware may source insecurity microchip vulnerability maliciously introduced manufacturing process assisted computer security also offer alternative computer security
Using device method case drive lock disabling USB port access may considered secure due physical access sophisticated required order compromised
Each covered detail
One use term computer security refers technology used implement secure
In DoD used standard current international standard defines number progressively stringent
Many common operating system meet standard Methodically Designed Tested Reviewed required highest level mean uncommon
An example Semiformally Verified Design Tested system used several military jet
In software engineering aim guard accidental introduction security vulnerability
It also possible create software designed ground secure
Such system
Beyond aim prove underlying system important example
Within computer system two many capable enforcing privilege separation ACLs
Using ACLs confine program proven insecure many situation host computer tricked indirectly allowing restricted file access issue known
It also shown promise ACLs giving access object one person never guaranteed practice
Both problem resolved capability
This mean practical flaw exist system designer certain utility must take responsibility ensure introduce flaw

It also revealed NSA deliberately inserted backdoor standard encryption tapped link data centre
In hacking ring known Rescator broke computer stealing roughly million credit card computer stealing million credit card number
Warnings delivered corporation ignored physical security breach using believed played large role
The malware utilized absolutely unsophisticated uninteresting say Jim Walter director threat intelligence operation security technology company McAfee meaning heist could easily stopped existing administrator responded warning
The size theft resulted major attention state Federal United States authority investigation ongoing
In April year earlier data breach resulting theft approximately million personnel record handled office
The Office Personnel Management hack described federal official among largest breach government data history United States
Data targeted breach included name date place birth address fingerprint current former government employee well anyone undergone government background check
It believed hack perpetrated Chinese hacker motivation remains unclear
In July hacker group known The Impact Team successfully breached extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison
The group claimed taken company data user data well
After breach The Impact Team dumped email company CEO prove point threatened dump customer data unless website taken permanently
With initial data release group stated instructed take Ashley Madison Established Men offline permanently form release customer record including profile customer secret sexual fantasy matching credit card transaction real name address employee document email
The website may stay online
When Avid Life Media parent company created Ashley Madison website take site offline The Impact Group released two compressed file one second
After second data dump Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman resigned website remained functional
Conflict law cyberspace become major cause concern computer security community

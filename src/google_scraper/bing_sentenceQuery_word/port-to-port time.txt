In endpoint communication
While term also used hardware device see software logical construct identifies specific type
A port always associated host type communication thus completes destination origination communication session
A port identified address protocol number commonly known
For example address may protocol TCP IP address port number may written protocol known context
Specific port number often used identify specific service
Of thousand enumerated port reserved convention identify specific service type host
In application architecture port network client connect service initiation provide service
After initial communication bind port number port freed switching instance service request dedicated port number additional client serviced
The protocol primarily use port protocol TCP UDP
Ports unnecessary direct link computer end could run one program time
Ports became necessary computer became capable connected modern network
Network protocol TCP UDP transfer data using PDUs
The PDU called TCP UDP
The PDUs protocol field source destination port number specified
A port number unsigned integer thus ranging
A associate input output channel via type transport protocol port number
This known enables process send receive data via network
The networking software task transmitting outgoing data application port onto network forwarding arriving network packet process matching packet IP address port number
Only one process may bind specific IP address port combination using transport protocol
Common application failure sometimes called occur multiple program attempt bind port number IP address using protocol
Applications implementing common service often use specifically reserved receiving service request client
This process known involves receipt request port establishing dialog using local port number
Other client may continue connect listening port work TCP connection identified tuple consisting local address local port remote address remote port
The port defined convention overseen IANA
The core network service typically use port number
In many operating system special privilege required application bind port often deemed critical operation IP network
Conversely client end connection typically us high port number allocated short term use therefore called
The port number encoded transport protocol packet header readily interpreted sending receiving computer also component networking infrastructure
In particular commonly configured differentiate packet based source destination port number
example application
The practice attempting connect range port sequence single computer commonly known
This usually associated either malicious attempt network administrator looking possible vulnerability help prevent attack
Port connection attempt frequently monitored logged computer
The technique us series port connection knock client computer enable server connection
An example use port
A server used sending receiving email generally need two service
The first service used transport email server
This accomplished SMTP
The SMTP service application usually listens TCP port incoming request
The second service usually either POP IMAP used application user personal computer fetch email message server
The POP service listens TCP port number
Both service may running host computer case port number distinguishes service requested remote computer user computer another mail server
While listening port number server well defined call port client port number often chosen dynamic port range see
In application client server use specific port number assigned IANA
A good example client always us UDP port server always us UDP port
Port number sometimes seen web URLs
By default HTTP us port HTTPS us port URL like specifies connects instead port HTTP server
The IANA responsible global coordination DNS Root IP addressing Internet protocol resource
This includes registration commonly used port number Internet service
The port number divided three range
The port also known
The requirement new assignment range stricter registration example include The registered port
IANA maintains official list registered range
The dynamic private port
One common use range
The concept port number established early developer informal software author system administrator
The term yet used time
It preceded use term early development stage network
A socket number remote host quantity
The first bit similar today address time bit host number
The portion socket number bit entity called abbreviated AEN
Today refers related distinct concept namely internal address endpoint used within node see also
On March called documenting usage establishing socket number catalog
Network administrator asked submit note place phone call
This catalog subsequently published December included list host port number corresponding function used host network
This first registry function served primarily documentation usage indicated port number usage conflicting host
The document promised resolution conflict based standard Postel published May first proposed official assignment port number network service suggested dedicated administrative function called maintain registry
The value AEN divided following range The service received first official assignment value
In detail first set assignment In early ARPANET AEN also called used Initial Connection Protocol ICP component NCP
NCP forerunner modern Internet protocol
Today terminology still closely connected port number former text string used network function represent numerical port number

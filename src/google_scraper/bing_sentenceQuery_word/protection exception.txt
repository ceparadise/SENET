process responding occurrence anomalous exceptional condition requiring special processing often changing normal flow
It provided specialized construct mechanism like facility like
In general exception break normal flow execution executes
The detail done depends whether hardware software exception software exception implemented
Some exception especially hardware one may handled gracefully execution resume interrupted
Alternative approach exception handling software error checking maintains normal program flow later explicit check contingency reported using special return value auxiliary global variable C floating point status flag input validation preemptively filter exceptional case
Hardware exception mechanism processed CPU
It intended support error detection redirects program flow error handling service routine
The state exception saved stack
Exception handling hardware standard refers general exceptional condition defines exception event occurs operation particular operand outcome suitable every reasonable application
That operation might signal one exception invoking default explicitly requested alternate handling
By default IEEE exception resumable handled substituting predefined value different exception
infinity divide zero exception providing later checking whether exception occurred see typical example handling IEEE exception
An style enabled use status flag involves first computing expression using fast direct implementation checking whether failed testing status flag necessary calling slower numerically robust implementation
The IEEE standard us term trapping refer calling routine exceptional condition optional feature standard
The standard recommends several usage scenario including implementation value followed resumption concisely handle
The default IEEE exception handling behaviour resumption following default value avoids risk inherent changing flow program control numerical exception
For example ended catastrophic explosion due part programming language exception handling policy aborting computation arithmetic error case floating point integer conversion
In Ariane Flight case programmer protected four seven critical variable overflow due concern computational constraint computer relied turned incorrect assumption possible range value three unprotected variable Ariane assumption correct
According loss Flight would avoided IEEE policy default substitution used overflowing conversion caused software abort occurred piece code turned completely unnecessary Ariane
The official report crash conducted inquiry board headed noted An underlying theme development Ariane bias towards
The supplier SRI following specification given stipulated event detected exception processor stopped
The exception occurred due random failure design error
The exception detected inappropriately handled view taken software considered correct shown fault
Although failure due systematic software design error mechanism introduced mitigate type problem
For example computer within SRIs could continued provide best estimate required information
There reason concern software exception allowed even required cause processor halt handling equipment
Indeed loss proper software function hazardous software run SRI unit
In case Ariane resulted two still healthy critical unit equipment
From processing point view hardware similar resumable exception though typically unrelated user program
The may provide facility handling exception program via
Typically interrupt caused execution process handled interrupt service routine operating system operating system may send process may asked operating system register signal handler called signal raised let operating system execute default action like terminating program
Typical example
Software exception handling support provided software tool differs somewhat understood exception handling hardware similar concept involved
In programming language mechanism exception handling term typically used specific sense denote data structure storing information exceptional condition
One mechanism transfer control exception known
The exception said
Execution transferred catch
From point view author raising exception useful way signal routine could execute normally example input argument invalid
value outside resource relies unavailable like missing file hard disk error error
In system without exception routine would need return special
However sometimes complicated user routine need write extra code distinguish normal return value erroneous one
Programming language differ substantially notion exception
Contemporary language roughly divided two group Kiniry also note Language design partially influence use exception consequently manner one handle partial total failure system execution
The major influence example use typically core library code example technical book magazine article online discussion forum organization code standard
Contemporary application face many design challenge considering exception handling strategy
Particularly modern enterprise level application exception must often cross process boundary machine boundary
Part designing solid exception handling strategy recognizing process failed point economically handled software portion process
Software exception handling developed
This originated exception keyword returned case error instead terminating program entering debugger
Error introduced late via keyword
This rapidly used error raising control flow thus augmented two new keywords MacLisp June reserving error handling
The cleanup behavior generally called finally introduced New Implementation LISP
This adopted
Contemporary Scheme handled exception closure
The first paper structured exception handling
Exception handling subsequently widely adopted many programming language onward
Originally software exception handling included resumable exception resumption semantics like hardware exception exception termination semantics
However resumption semantics considered ineffective practice see standardization discussion quoted longer common use though provided programming language like Common Lisp Dylan
Exception handling mechanism contemporary language typically termination semantics opposed hardware exception typically resumable
This based experience using theoretical design argument favor either decision extensively debated standardization discussion resulted definitive decision termination semantics
On rationale design mechanism note A Palo Alto standardization meeting November heard brilliant summary argument termination semantics backed personal experience data Sun formerly Xerox PARC
Jim used exception handling half dozen language period year early proponent resumption semantics one main designer implementers Xerox system
His message He backed statement experience several operating system
The key example It written people liked used resumption ten year use one use resumption left half million line system context inquiry
Because resumption actually necessary context inquiry removed found significant speed increase part system
In every case resumption used ten year become problem appropriate design replaced
Basically every use resumption represented failure keep separate level abstraction disjoint
A contrasting view safety exception handling given describing plethora feature notational convention many unnecessary like exception handling even dangerous
Do allow language present state used application reliability critical
The next rocket go astray result programming language error may exploratory space rocket harmless trip Venus It may nuclear warhead exploding one city
Exception handling often handled correctly software especially multiple source exception million line Java code found exception handling defect
Citing multiple prior study others result Weimer Necula wrote significant problem exception create hidden path difficult programmer reason
initially released exception handling explicitly omitted developer arguing obfuscated
Later mechanism added language Go author advise using unrecoverable error halt entire process
One case early criticism exception handling dealing resource leak state inconsistency escaping section locked one temporarily holding file open
The one approach handle
Many computer language support exception exception handling
This includes
like version language
Exception handling commonly resumable language exception thrown program search back function call exception handler found
Some language call stack search progress
That function containing handler exception call function turn call function exception occurs function may terminated handle
An language without unwinding
Common Lisp call exception handler unwind stack
This allows program continue computation exactly place error occurred example previously missing file become available
The stackless implementation programming language support exception handling without stack unwinding
Excluding minor syntactic difference couple exception handling style use
In popular style exception initiated special statement exception object
Java Object Pascal value special extendable enumerated type
Ada SML
The scope exception handler start marker clause language block starter end start first handler clause
Several handler clause follow specify exception type handle name us exception object
A language also permit clause used case exception occurred end handler scope reached
More common related clause executed whether exception occurred typically release resource acquired within body block
Notably provide construct since encourages RAII technique free resource using
In whole exception handling code might look like note exception type called would need declared somewhere As minor variation language use single handler clause deal class exception internally
According paper Westley Wiemer syntax block Java contributing factor software defect
When method need handle acquisition release resource programmer apparently unwilling nest enough block due readability concern even would correct solution
It possible use single block even dealing multiple resource requires correct use another common source bug type problem
Regarding semantics construct general Wiemer Necula write While conceptually simple complicated execution description language specification Gosling et al
requires four level nested official English description
In short contains large number programmer often overlook
C support various mean error checking generally considered support exception handling although used implement exception semantics
optional support structured exception handling
support exception handling pervasive consistent
It difficult write robust Python program without using keywords
The implementation exception handling programming language typically involves fair amount support code generator accompanying compiler
It addition exception handling ended useful lifetime original compiler
Two scheme common
The first generates code continually update structure program state term exception handling
Typically add new element know handler available function method associated frame exception thrown pointer layout directs runtime appropriate handler code
This approach compact term space add execution overhead frame entry exit
It commonly used many Ada implementation example complex generation runtime support already needed many language feature
Dynamic registration fairly straightforward define amenable
The second scheme one implemented many compiler approach
This creates static table relate range program state respect exception handling
Then exception thrown runtime system look current instruction location table determines handler play need done
This approach minimizes executive overhead case exception thrown
This happens cost space space allocated data section loaded relocated exception actually thrown
This second approach also superior term achieving
Other definitional implementation scheme proposed well
For language support approach involve overhead advanced
A different view exception based principle supported particular
The idea provide rigorous basis exception handling defining precisely normal abnormal behavior
Specifically approach based two concept The Safe Exception Handling principle introduced Bertrand Meyer hold two meaningful way routine react exception occurs In particular simply ignoring exception permitted block must either retried successfully complete propagate exception caller
Here example expressed Eiffel syntax
It assumes routine normally better way send message may fail triggering exception algorithm next us fail le often
If fails routine whole fail causing caller get exception
The boolean local variable initialized False start
If fails body clause executed causing execution
If execution fails clause execute end clause final causing routine execution whole fail
This approach merit defining clearly normal abnormal case abnormal case causing exception one routine unable fulfill contract
It defines clear distribution role clause normal body charge achieving attempting achieve routine contract clause charge reestablishing context restarting process chance succeeding performing actual computation
Although exception Eiffel fairly clear philosophy Kiniry criticizes implementation Exceptions part language definition represented INTEGER value exception STRING value
Additionally basic value object inherent semantics beyond expressed helper routine necessarily foolproof representation overloading effect one differentiate two integer value
If exception thrown caught operationally exception thrown applicable handler specified uncaught exception handled runtime routine called
The common default behavior terminate program print error message console usually including debug information string representation exception
This often avoided handler example catch exception reach runtime
Note even though uncaught exception may result terminating abnormally program may correct exception caught notably rolling back partially completed transaction releasing resource terminates normally assuming runtime work correctly runtime controlling execution program ensure orderly shutdown process
In multithreaded program uncaught exception thread may instead result termination thread entire process uncaught exception handler caught handler
This particularly important server example running thread terminated without server overall affected
This default uncaught exception handler may overridden either globally example provide alternative logging reporting uncaught exception restart thread terminate due uncaught exception
For example Java done single thread via globally via Python done modifying
The designer Java devised checked exception special set exception
The checked exception method may raise part method
For instance method might throw must declare fact explicitly method signature
Failure raise error
Kiniry note however Java library often inconsistent approach error reporting Not erroneous situation Java represented exception though
Many method return special value indicate failure encoded constant field related class
Checked exception related exception checker exist programming language
The external tool OCaml invisible
require syntactic annotation optional
possible compile run program without checked exception although recommended production code
The feature interface closer Java introduced later
A function could raise exception listed type leaking exception called function would automatically turned sole runtime exception instead resulting error
Later similar feature
These feature include compile time checking central concept checked exception incorporated major programming language Java
Early version programming language included optional mechanism checked exception called
By default function could throw exception limited clause added function signature specified exception function may throw
Exception specification enforced
Violations resulted global function called
An empty exception specification could given indicated function throw exception
This made default exception handling added language would required much modification existing code would impeded interaction code written language would tempted programmer writing many handler local level
Explicit use empty exception specification could however allow compiler perform significant code stack layout optimization generally suppressed exception handling may take place function
Some analyst viewed proper use exception specification difficult achieve
In recent language standard use exception specification specified version standard removed language
A function throw exception denoted noexcept keyword
In contrast Java language like C enforce exception caught
According Hanspeter Mössenböck distinguishing checked exception unchecked exception make written program convenient le robust uncaught exception result abort
Kiniry note however Java JDK version throw large number unchecked exception one every line code whereas Eiffel us much sparingly one thrown every line code
Kiniry also writes As Java programmer know volume code typical Java application sometimes larger comparable code necessary explicit formal parameter return value checking language checked exception
In fact general consensus among Java programmer dealing checked exception nearly unpleasant task writing documentation
Thus many programmer report resent checked exception
This lead abundance exception
Kiniry also note developer C apparently influenced kind user experience following quote attributed via Eric Gunnerson Examination small program lead conclusion requiring exception specification could enhance developer productivity enhance code quality experience large software project suggests different result decreased productivity little increase code quality
According fairly broad agreement design group checked exception language feature C
Hejlsberg explained interview The throw clause least way implemented Java necessarily force handle exception handle force acknowledge precisely exception might pas
It requires either catch declared exception put throw clause
To work around requirement people ridiculous thing
For example decorate every method throw Exception
That completely defeat feature made programmer write gobbledy gunk
That help Checked exception reduce incidence unhandled exception surfacing given application
Unchecked exception object remain unhandled
However checked exception either require extensive declaration revealing implementation detail reducing encourage coding poorly considered block hide legitimate exception appropriate handler
Consider growing time
An interface may declared throw exception X Y
In later version code one want throw exception Z would make new code incompatible earlier us
Furthermore one body code declares interface implemented different body code code plugged called first adapter code may rich set exception describe problem forced use exception type declared interface
It possible reduce number declared exception either declaring potentially thrown exception defining declaring exception type suitable level abstraction called method mapping lower level exception type preferably wrapped using order preserve root cause
In addition possible example changing interface calling code would need modified well since sense exception method may throw part method implicit interface anyway
Using declaration usually sufficient satisfying checking Java
While may use essentially circumvents checked exception mechanism Oracle discourages
Unchecked exception type generally handled except possibly outermost level scope
These often represent scenario allow recovery frequently reflect programming defect generally represent unrecoverable JVM failure
Even language support checked exception case use checked exception appropriate
The point exception handling routine ensure code handle error condition
In order establish exception handling routine sufficiently robust necessary present code wide spectrum invalid unexpected input created via software also sometimes referred
One difficult type software write exception handling routine protocol software since robust protocol implementation must prepared receive input comply relevant specification
In order ensure meaningful regression analysis conducted throughout exception handling testing highly automated test case must generated scientific repeatable fashion
Several commercially available system exist perform testing
In runtime engine environment exist tool attach runtime engine every time exception interest occurs record debugging information existed memory time exception thrown value
These tool called error interception tool provide information exception
Somewhat related concept checked exception
Synchronous exception happen specific program statement whereas raise practically anywhere
It follows asynchronous exception handling ca required compiler
They also difficult program
Examples naturally asynchronous event include pressing interrupt program receiving stop suspend another
Programming language typically deal limiting asynchronicity example Java deprecated use ThreadDeath exception used allow one thread stop another one
Instead exception raise suitable location program synchronously
see encompasses aforementioned exception handling system
In language environment advent condition generalisation error according implies function call late exception handler decision unwind stack may taken
Conditions generalization exception
When condition arises appropriate condition handler searched selected stack order handle condition
Conditions represent error may safely go unhandled entirely purpose may propagate hint warning toward user
This related exception handling exception said permitted return expression signaled exception taken corrective action handler
The condition system generalized thus within handler condition
possible jump predefined restart point
lie signaling expression condition handler
Restarts function closed lexical environment allowing programmer repair environment exiting condition handler completely unwinding stack even partially
Condition handling moreover provides
Restarts provide various possible mechanism recovering error select mechanism appropriate given situation
That province condition handler since located code access broader view
An example Suppose library function whose purpose parse single file entry
What function entry malformed
There one right answer library could deployed program many different purpose
In interactive browser right thing might return entry unparsed user see automated program right thing might supply null value unreadable field abort error many entry malformed
That say question answered term broader goal program known library function
Nonetheless exiting error message rarely right answer
So instead simply exiting error function may offering various way instance skip log entry supply default null value unreadable field ask user missing value unwind stack abort processing error message
The restarts offered constitute available recovering error selection restart condition handler supply

The behaviour I get removed JCL message The special register never referenced current content indicated sort merge operation program line number unsuccessful
When I add back JCL program run successfully
When I take add DISPLAY SORT program work
This JCL first DISPLAY executed cause one dynamically created output appear spool though separate JOB name jobnumber
In case DFSORT complaining missing
With DISPLAY missing time DFSORT start
I assume SYNCSORT facing similar issue COBOL message produced SYNCSORT fails next RELEASE
Although seems like simple common issue always copy piece JCL make new piece JCL always
Consult Enterprise COBOL Programming Guide Chapter I think see use confirm SORT completed successfully
I pretty sure include JCL longer get abend whether DISPLAY
The reason high offset abend processor unable identify SORT product keep searching backwards find something identify locates program calculates incorrect offset
This also happen CALLing Assembler program
Firstly Protection Exception mean attempting access storage belong access want
You getting program
You cunningly obliterated name posting probably helped
program
The abend Abnormal End offset failing program
That mean start program Entry Point instruction one attempted bad thing
That offset decimal indicates fairly large program
Your program small
There many way come
For instance may copied JCL somewhere else failed change
You may program name earlier concatenation
You may compiled wrong program
Etc
When get abend always confirm compile listing program abended
An easy useful way yourname replace text following
The output like That match heading page compile listing
If run program get output get output output expected know program one running
Now program
To simply SORT file COBOL program look use compiler option FASTSRT possible
You yet aware implication paragraph SECTIONs EXIT statement
When using SORT execution transferred code paragraph return control next paragraph reached
Your exit paragraph coded never used someone looking code assume silly lot people make assumption used stick exit paragraph
Then surprised program behaves badly luck eventually work used GO TO transfer control range
If local standard enforce use must use THRU PERFORM PROCEDURE statement
entirely useless nothing provide GO TO meaning someone future likely use GO TO convenience
Here original program removed I also changed GOBACK much flexible removed first unnecessary people new COBOL implies much COBOL concept main may pertinent language may know

Learn basic essay writing guide Extracts document Introduction The Data Protection Act Public concern computerised information centre upon
How sure information held u accurate

If information used one purpose sure used something else

How access information guaranteed certain people
IV
Should individual concerned bank example tell Inland Revenue account receives interest year
The Act serf help calm fear making hold computerised record register fact also enabling individual see held receive compensation material inaccurate The Data Protection Act demand Personal data Processed Fairly Lawfully Only Registered Purposes Or Disclosed Registered Recipients Kept Up Date No Longer Than Necessary Stated Purpose Within Appropriate Security
Data Protection information contained personal data shall obtained personal data shall processed fairly lawfully
data shall held one specified lawful purpose
data held purpose purpose shall used disclosed matter incompatible purpose purpose
data held purpose purpose shall adequate relevant excessive relation purpose purpose
data shall accurate necessary kept date
data held purpose purpose shall kept longer necessary purpose purpose
individual shall entitled reasonable interval without undue delay expense informed Data User whether hold personal data individual subject
Middle This enable code decimal hex
This code received computer know able commence transmitting data modem
This XON condition
If incoming traffic modem sends ASCII character
This XOFF condition decimal hex
The computer receives code stop transmitting data Note This method used serial printer
It sends XOFF code intemal buffer full
As print reduces amount character buffer
When buffer sufficient space sends DC code computer resume transmission data printer
The ASCII code DC stand Device Control Device Control
This method transmit receive text file since printable ASCII set range I Binary file
containing machine code contain full range possible numeric value
This would include value DC signal mean suitable transmitting receiving binary file
Pins A summary us main pin computer serial port shown following table
DTR Data Terminal ready The computer informs modem powered ready active switching pin state
Most modem require receive signal operate DSR Data Set Ready The modem informs computer powered ready active switching pin state
Most computer port require signal operate CTS Clear Send Conclusion Wire Leased Half Duplex Two Wire Switched Full Duplex Four Wire Leased Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Half Duplex Two Wire Switched Full Duplex Two Wire Switched Full Duplex Two Wire Switched Bell Full Duplex Two Wire Switched Data Comp Even Parity The sending device count number bit character Panty Bit transmitted
If number data bit even top diagram parity bit set zero
If number bit odd lower diagram parity bit set one
Thus total number byte Parity Bit always even matter many character If data bit parity bit accidentally altered transmission receiving device detect problem counting number bit
If total even number corruption data
This provides elementary check data error
Odd Parity Here sending device count number bit byte transmitted
If number data bit even top diagram parity bit set one
If number bit already odd lower diagram parity bit set zero
In way total number group always maintained odd value
Note Parity checking useful facility foolproof
For example two bit byte altered zero one would produce correct parity check although data byte corrupted
In practice larger block data examined corruption see section later Error Detection

Defining computer security trivial
The difficulty lie developing definition broad enough valid regardless system described yet specific enough describe security really
In generic sense security freedom risk danger
In context computer science security prevention protection This Security ability system protect information system resource respect confidentiality integrity
Note scope second definition includes system resource include CPUs disk program addition information
Computer security frequently associated three core area conveniently summarized acronym CIA A strong security protocol address three area
Take example Netscape SSL Secure Sockets Layer protocol
It enabled explosion ecommerce really trust precisely lack trust
SSL overcomes lack trust transacting party ensuring confidentiality encryption integrity checksum authentication via server certificate see Chapter
Computer security restricted three broad concept
Additional idea often considered part taxonomy computer security include These additional element neatly integrate singular definition
From one perspective concept privacy confidentiality security quite distinct posse different attribute
Privacy property individual confidentiality property data security property assigned computer hardware software system
From practical perspective concept interwoven
A system maintain data confidentiality individual privacy could theoretically even mathematically secure probably would wise deploy anywhere real world
Computer security also analyzed function
It broken five distinct functional area Analyzing security function valuable part security planning process strong security policy address five area starting recovery
This book however primarily concerned prevention detection
Computer security also frequently defined term several interdependent domain roughly map specific department job title This text solely concerned latter two
System network security difficult impossible separate UNIX system
Nearly every UNIX distribution past fifteen year included protocol implementation well numerous network service FTP Telnet DNS recently HTTP
In spirit practicality I like straightforward definition promulgated Simson Garfinkel Gene Spafford Practical UNIX Internet Security A computer secure depend software behave expect
In essence computer secure trust
Data entered today still tomorrow unaltered form
If made service x z available yesterday still available today
I also like practical definition offered Tomas Olovsson narrowed bit A secure system system enough trust put use together sensitive information
These practical definition circumvent obvious element secure system hard unauthorized person break value work necessary unauthorized person break exceed value protected data
Increasing attacker workload risk detection critical element computer security

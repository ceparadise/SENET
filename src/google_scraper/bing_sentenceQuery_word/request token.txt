I problem catch real meaning term
In term software development define generically
Does different meaning term different context language
Thanks
If google get amongst others following two definition seem applicable If combine two land somewhere near commonly meant talking token programming
Pretty vague yes used many different context
One example authentication system user log
When system authenticated user instead repeating process every request token created represents fact user authenticated
This token used subsequent request
In case fact user authenticated token represents fact
Tokens identifier keywords literal operator punctuators
But ca consider White space comment token though act separator token
One meaning term Software Development authentication signature issued server defined time interval In compiler Lexical analyzer scanner Reads input stream fuse character source text token language
sequence character collective meaning
The character sequence forming token called
Consider following assignment statement newvalue oldvalue rate The lexical analyzer generate following token
A token object value Wikipedia disambiguation term refer Computing section Token seen seal middle age courrier representig king duke bishop pope anything went riding realm realm needed authenticated true representative claim passing gate kingdom

already pointed several definition add
In security protocol one side want make sure side opposed impostor one side previous session
Replay attack generally carried unauthorized user replaying session legitimate user try imitate
So first side sends number string supposed parrot back either securely performing kind transformation preferably requiring secret side expected
Both original item transformed item sometimes called token
However cause confusion cryptographic token RSA keyfobs generally use algorithm determine proper response display human type
So sense term often used like nonce challenge original simply response answer transformed version
Then computer networking
Granted exactly programming got program network work overlap
One style networking flow control generally considered obsolete called
Rather configuration common Ethernet day token ring arranged surprise surprise ring formation
Each station could essentially agreement among station
long since looked sure whether supposed station designate current
When done limit would token next workstation along ring defined direction
This referring seemed associated rather likely something else
As see one many word huge number definition
think least English many word could make meaning would ruin SO many good
Smallest individual element program called Token
Everything see inside program token
There generally five type token Keyword reserved word whose meaning already defined programming language
We use keyword purpose inside programming
Every programming language set keywords
Examples int void return etc Note These keywords common C C influenced language
Identifiers name given different programming element
Either name given variable function programming element follow basic naming convention listed num Num etc
number add num etc
Operators symbol given arithmetical logical operation
Various programming language provides various set operator
Separators used separate different programming element
The various type separator used programming Space Tab New line
Literals constant value used performing various operation calculation
There basically three type literal A programming token basic component source code
Characters categorized one five class token describe function constant identifier operator key word separator accordance rule programming language

I currently studying compiler construction book Compilers Principles Techniques Tools Edition page
understand kind method
E conversion pair
technical term associated
I know proper name seeing standard way lexically analyze text
You divide token specific type
For sake parsing next step parsing chain need lexeme step road need know semantic content sometimes called lexeme
For example parser care number need know number
Further road suffice know number
Even would need know integer specifically
Some lexeme example various operator though principle could group say together
We need separate syntactically different different due operator precedence
These need annotation

I want implement oauth website I wondering I change request token exchange access token
Thanks advance Request token meant temporary unique
After giving one forget either minute passed b used request access token
Allowing reuse request token would open http replay attack

A token special frame passed node node around ring network
When get node need transmit data node change token data frame transmits recipient
A token essential inner working token ring network
The token handled single node time
The bearer token one allowed send data around network recipient node within network
The bearer token writes address recipient data sent sends next node series
When sender node sends token next node node read address
If node intended recipient sends data next node
Finally recipient node read data know recipient take data sends token back sender address message indicating data received
The token sent around ring reach token
After using token node release back network node able use
Although token ring transmission seems slow process user rarely notice data communication occurs rapidly

The author recommends DO NOT STORE THE PERSISTENT LOGIN COOKIE TOKEN IN YOUR DATABASE ONLY A HASH OF IT
use strong salted hashing bcrypt phpass storing persistent login token
I impression login cooky served two purpose It seems author invalidating second point make wonder bother authentication token
Instead mapping authentication token simply pas per request using cookie
Assuming accept author recommendation use bcrypt per request When use authentication token simple presentation token client grant access long token deemed valid server
If store token server database attacker could get glimpse database immediately learn token allowing send request name user valid token still exists database
This bad
Hence recommendation storing authentication token
The advice bcrypt misguided
Bcrypt like function dedicated meant used
Passwords weak vulnerable dictionary attack
To cope inherent weakness password hashing function must salted prevent parallel attack precomputed table must also awfully slow huge number internal iteration
This make password hashing function
So want use password hashing function unless need
hash password
An authentication token password random value generated remembered computer without human brain involved process
As generated token properly least bit obtained need salt iteration use plain hash function even would fine
This efficient
As using random authentication token instead request two main reason explained authentication token verified safely simple hash vastly efficient heavy bcrypt call
You want keep precious CPU cycle really useful particular applying bcrypt actual password
authentication token stored client cookie value
If login password sent back every request stored cookie client
People get nervous password written file storage equivalent security point view storage authentication token human user bad habit reusing password multiple system whereas authentication token inherently

operation refers actively sampling status synchronous activity
Polling often used term also referred
Polling process computer controlling device wait check readiness state often hardware
For example connected via computer wait printer received next character
These process minute reading
Τhis sometimes used synonymously polling
In situation operation required computer nothing check status device ready point device accessed
In word computer wait device ready
Polling also refers situation device repeatedly checked readiness computer return different task
Although wasteful cycle busy waiting generally efficient alternative polling
In simple system even perfectly appropriate action possible access often traditionally consequence simple hardware
Polling often intimately involved
For example polling parallel printer port check whether ready another character involves examining little one
That bit represents time reading whether single wire printer cable low high voltage
The instruction read byte directly transfer voltage state eight real world wire eight circuit make one byte CPU register
Polling disadvantage many device check time required poll exceed time available service device
Polling described following step add pic A time element monitored
The optimal polling cycle vary according several factor including desired speed response overhead processor time bandwidth polling
In polling device process query element list fixed sequence
Because wait response element timing mechanism necessary prevent caused element
Roll call polling inefficient overhead polling message high numerous element polled polling cycle element active
In also referred token polling element poll next element fixed sequence
This continues first element reached time polling cycle start
Polling employed various computing context order control execution transmission sequence element involved
For example multitasking operating system polling used allocate processor time resource various competing process
In network polling used determine node want access network
It also used routing protocol retrieve routing information case EGP exterior gateway protocol
An alternative polling use signal generated device process indicate need attention want communicate etc
Although polling simple many situation multitasking operating system efficient use interrupt reduce processor usage bandwidth consumption
A message
In multidrop line arrangement central different terminal share single communication line computer system us polling arrangement whereby central computer sends message called polling message specific terminal outgoing line
All terminal listen outgoing line terminal polled reply sending information ready transmission incoming line
In simplest form consists one central computer act conduit transmit message polling required avoid chaos line often used allow master acquire input orderly fashion
These poll message differ multidrop line case site address needed terminal receives poll directed

In particular interactive information interchange also known dialogue conversation meeting two communicating device computer user see
A session set established certain point time torn later point
An established communication session may involve one message direction
A session typically always meaning least one communicating part need save information session history order able communicate opposed communication communication consists independent request response
An established session basic requirement perform
A session also basic step transmit mode
However unidirectional transmission define session
may implemented part protocol service
In case transport protocol implement formal session layer session application layer generally HTTP session maintained higher level program using method defined data exchanged
For example HTTP exchange browser remote host may include identifies state unique information user preference authorization level
thought allow single request response one Session
Protocol version improved completing CGI making easier maintain Web Session supporting file uploads
Most session maintained transport layer single connection single session
However transaction phase session creates separate connection
Maintaining session continuity phase requires
The embedded within A HREF FORM link passed back CGI
CGI us ensure session continuity transaction phase
One advantage one work well low bandwidth modem connection
TCP session typically implemented software using new process thread created computer establishes join session
HTTP session typically implemented using one thread per session mean database information state session
The advantage multiple process thread relaxed complexity software since thread history encapsulated variable
The disadvantage large overhead term system resource session may interrupted system restarted
When client may connect server cluster server special problem encountered maintaining consistency server must maintain session state
The client must either directed server duration session server must transmit session information via shared file system database
Otherwise client may reconnect different server one started session cause problem new server access stored state old one
session handy efficient become difficult handle conjunction system usable embedded system storage
The problem solved using shared storage applying forced peering client single server cluster although compromise system efficiency load distribution
A method using session system without reserve portion RAM storage session data
This method applicable server limited number client
router access point infrequent disallowed access one client time
session use cooky cryptographic technique maintain state without storing much data server
When presenting dynamic web page server sends current state data client web browser form cookie
The client save cookie memory disk
With successive request client sends cookie back server server us data remember state application specific client generate appropriate response
This mechanism may work well context however data stored client vulnerable tampering user software access client computer
To use session confidentiality integrity required following must guaranteed To accomplish server need encrypt session data sending client modification information party prevented via cryptographic mean
Transmitting state back forth every request practical size cookie small
In essence session trade server disk space extra bandwidth web request require
Moreover web browser limit number size cooky may stored web site
To improve efficiency allow session data server may compress data creating cookie decompressing later cookie returned client
A session token unique identifier generated sent identify current interaction session
The client usually store sends token sends parameter GET POST query
The reason use session token client handle session data stored server usually client direct access linked identifier
Examples name programming language use naming HTTP cookie include JSESSIONID PHPSESSID CGISESSID ASPSESSIONID
In process keeping track user activity across session interaction
Typical session management task include keeping track application open document application opened state restored user log log later
For website session management might involve requiring user session expired certain time limit passed without user activity
It also used store information HTTP request
A desktop session manager program save restore desktop session
A desktop session window currently running current content
Session management system provided
On system session management provided Session Manager Subsystem user session functionality extended application like
Session management particularly useful user save open page setting restore later date
To help recover system application crash page setting also restored next run
example web browser support session management
Session management often managed application
HTTP stateless client computer running web browser must establish new TCP network connection web server new HTTP GET POST request
The web server therefore rely established TCP network connection longer single HTTP GET POST operation
Session management technique used web developer make stateless HTTP protocol support session state
For example user authenticated web server user next HTTP request GET POST cause web server ask user account password
For discussion method used accomplish see In situation multiple web server must share knowledge session state typical environment session information must shared cluster node running web server software
Methods sharing session state node cluster include multicasting session information member node see one example technique sharing session information partner node using sharing session information node using network socket storing session information shared file system storing session information outside cluster
If session information considered transient volatile data required transaction contain data subject compliance auditing example see example two law necessitate compliance auditing method storing session information used
However session information subject audit compliance consideration given method used session storage replication clustering
In Simple Object Access Protocol message constructed Extensible Markup Language message used consumer application cause web server create session
Just HTTP stateless protocol
As SMS became interoperable across rival network text messaging started ascent towards becoming ubiquitous global form communication various enterprise became interested using SMS channel commercial purpose
Initial service require session management since communication example
Today application referred distinct messaging
The development interactive enterprise application required session management SMS stateless protocol defined GSM standard early implementation controlled enter command service identifier manually

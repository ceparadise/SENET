In case impossible predict prevent failure making type maintenance option
In instance system require repair result insufficient situation people may opt focus corrective rather preventive repair part maintenance strategy
The process corrective maintenance begin failure diagnosis failure determine appeared
The diagnostic process include physical inspection system use diagnostic computer evaluate system interview user number step
It important determine caused problem order take appropriate action aware multiple failure component software may occurred simultaneously
The next step replacement damaged component software
In case damage may repairable either situ removing item question repair site
In instance full replacement new item may required restore system functionality
For example optical drive computer fails technician may determine replacing part drive repairing part may sufficient may find entire drive need scrapped new one inserted
After maintenance performed technician verifies fix worked testing system
This may done several stage confirm system operational slowly overloading task
Verification especially important system sent facility repair technician want sure sent back user happy standard work performed
For older system may make sense rely corrective maintenance
Preventive maintenance expensive system may practical may cost effective simply repair system component go wrong
By contrast newer system preventive maintenance save money long term extend life system preventing system failure much possible happen
sunnySkys I glad lesson preventative maintenance least expensive
I would love friend could repair computer free
I think preventative maintenance even important large computer system
I imagine would bit difficult time consuming perform corrective maintenance multiple computer instead one
I learned lesson corrective maintenance I first computer
I bought desktop computer right I left freshman year college
I happily took dorm used surf Internet download thing wild abandon
Had I thought install software
No
Did I disk defrag awhile
Not life
Eventually computer slow virus ridden barely worked
Luckily I made friend guy computer repair computer store
I able get computer fixed free plus software
Ever since I big believe preventative maintenance versus corrective maintenance
One editor review suggestion make change warranted
Note depending number suggestion receive take anywhere hour day
Thank helping improve wiseGEEK

Corrective maintenance maintenance task operation done order identify isolate separate rectify particular fault
This performed order restore failed machine equipment system operational condition
Corrective maintenance either planned unplanned
Corrective maintenance subdivided Corrective maintenance form maintenance performed fault problem emerges system goal restoring operability
In case impossible predict prevent failure making type maintenance option
Corrective maintenance refers action taken system component failure occurred
It thus retroactive strategy
The task maintenance team scenario usually effect repair soon possible
Costs associated corrective maintenance include Corrosion maintenance cost represent significant portion operating budget industrial sector particularly aging involved
The process corrective maintenance begin diagnosis failure determine occurred
The diagnostic process include It important determine caused problem order take appropriate action aware multiple component system failure may occurred simultaneously

Most system imperfection
The initial testing system find many obscure error may encountered user interact system day day
Part system include way customer user report problem
Also error log included system maintenance staff spot problem even reported
Almost commercial software system seem need fixing even released
Software code complex even diligent test regime fails find error
The way fixed often form user downloads sent computer IT staff company Another common corrective maintenance action fix security vulnerability code
Again usual way software patch
This system behaving way intended programming error coder misunderstood needed support business first place
For example database may storing data way causing problem system within company
These type error may much harder fix compared straight forward programming error may fundamental part system
This robust requirement document needed avoid logical business process error

In computer science corrective maintenance accomplished removing bug software hardware network adaptive maintenance describes adaptive modification existing code address new task business opportunity
Corrective maintenance generally categorized emergency situation network outage virus attack preventive one repair maintenance prevent repetition event
Adaptive maintenance used proactive reactive response changing business trend need
In short corrective maintenance fixing wrong adaptive maintenance used upgrade system better confront challenge lie ahead
While knowledge method certainly important technological infrastructure business idea also applied workforce management style
What factor make web maintenance particularly challenging system maintenance task
Explain
Factors influence system maintainability Latent defect Number customer given system Quality system documentation Maintenance personnel Tools program Discuss potential impact quality documentation system maintenance cost Documentation contributing factor maintenance cost quality system documentation
Without quality documentation maintenance effort increase exponentially Defects customer documentatio n quality The number latent defect refers number unknown error existing system installed
Because corrective maintenance account maintenance activity number latent defect system influence cost associated maintaining system
If error system installed maintenance cost relatively low
If large number defect system installed maintenance cost likely high
A second factor influencing maintenance cost number customer given system
In general greater number customer greater maintenance cost

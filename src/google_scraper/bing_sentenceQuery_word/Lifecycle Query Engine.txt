Whereas early query language originally complex interacting electronic database could done specially trained individual modern interface allowing casual user access database information
The main type popular query mode technique structured query
Particularly suited novice menu requires person choose several displayed monitor
The technique one user prompted enter key word search statement
The structured query approach effective relational database
It formal powerful fact programming language able accommodate logical operator
One implementation approach SQL form field Fa Fb

Fn database Da Db

Dn field Fa abc field Fb def
Structured query language support database searching operation using command find delete print sum forth
The sentencelike structure SQL query resembles natural language except syntax limited fixed
Instead using SQL statement possible represent query tabular form
The technique referred QBE display empty tabular form expects searcher enter search specification appropriate column
The program construct query table executes
The flexible query language course
The use sentence constrained form search database allowed commercial database management software
These program parse syntax query recognize action word synonym identify name file record field perform logical operation required
Experimental system accept query spoken voice developed however ability employ unrestricted natural language query unstructured information require advance understanding natural language particularly technique representing semantic idea

A designed help find information stored
The search result usually presented list commonly called
Search engine help minimize time required find information amount information must consulted akin technique managing
The public visible form search engine search information
Search engine provide group item enables user specify criterion item interest engine find matching item
The criterion referred
In case text search engine search query typically expressed set word identify desired one may contain
There several style search query vary strictness
It also switch name within search engine previous site
Whereas text search engine require user enter two three word separated search engine may enable user specify entire document picture sound various form
Some search engine apply improvement search query increase likelihood providing quality set item process known
method used standardize query language
The list item meet criterion specified query typically sorted ranked
Ranking item relevance highest lowest reduces time required find desired information
search engine rank item based measure item query typically scale similar sometimes see use
search engine typically return item match exactly without regard order although term may simply refer use syntax use operator NOT probabilistic context
To provide set matching item sorted according criterion quickly search engine typically collect group item consideration beforehand process referred
The index typically requires smaller amount search engine store indexed information full content item instead provide method navigating item
Alternatively search engine may store copy item user see state item time indexed archive purpose make repetitive process work efficiently quickly
Other type search engine store index
Crawler spider type search engine
search engine may collect ass item time search query dynamically considering additional item based content starting item known seed seed URL case Internet crawler
store neither index cache instead simply reuse index result one search engine provide aggregated final set result

Query another word question
In fact outside computing terminology word query question used interchangeably
For example need additional information someone might say I query
In computing query also used retrieve information
However query sent computer system processed software rather person
One type query many people perform multiple time day search query
Each time search something using perform search query
When press Enter sent search engine processed using retrieves related result search
The result query appear search engine result page
Another common type query query
Databases store structured format accessed using query
In fact structured query language designed specifically purpose
Users create SQL query retrieve specific information database
For example human resource manager may perform query employee database selects employee specific department hired month ago
The result might used provide department head current candidate annual review
While may always notice computer query happening time
For instance query database time visit new page
Software often contain background perform query based
While many type computer query exist basic purpose receive answer question
The word query used either noun verb
For example perform search query query database
Both example correct us word query

Information integration across company border becomes increasingly important success product lifecycle management industry complex supply chain
Semantic technology play crucial role integrative process
However data exchange requires mechanism enable access control definition enforcement preventing unauthorized leakage confidential data across company border
Currently available semantic repository sufficiently equipped satisfy important requirement
This paper present infrastructure controlled sharing semantic data cooperating business partner
First motivate need access control semantic data federation case study industrial service sector
Furthermore present architecture controlling access semantic repository based newly developed SemForce security service
Finally show practical feasibility architecture implementation several performance experiment

Lifecycle Query Engine LQE utilizes protocol index lifecycle data Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager RELM provides function visualize analyze organize resource
Additionally Open Services Lifecycle Collaboration OSLC used remotely view lifecycle resource detail navigate consistent regardless hosted
A TRS resource OSLC provider order indexed searchable
Eclipse Lyo provides make easier implement TRS provider
The us SDK provides reference implementation TRS Provider Bugzilla
This workshop provides foundation skill required developing Tracked Resource Set Provider implementation article serf supplement workshop help explain The instruction setup necessary instruction prepare TRS Adapter Bugzilla
The instruction installation RELM v RELM
To learn RELM please read technical article
The content article Note If change value property need remove consumer key
Before try RELM please add several Bugzilla bug
By default Bugzilla requires field filled
At moment field enough
For example After bug created please fill See Also field Bugzilla bug
For example In field need type Bugzilla Bug ID value property

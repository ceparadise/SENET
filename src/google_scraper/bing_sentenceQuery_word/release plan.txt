Fortunately growing movement led parent teacher state district private sector expand CS education
The President Computer Science All Initiative build effort Building progress made state raising standard help student graduate high school ready college career President Obama signed bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA December
This law cement progress requiring student America taught high academic standard prepare succeed career college
Furthermore nine ten parent surveyed last year say want CS taught child school
They understand today elementary middle high school student tomorrow engineer entrepreneur leader must equipped strong computational thinking skill ability solve complex problem
Access CS education limited wide disparity exist even access course
For example fewer percent high school offered Advanced Placement AP CS course percent took exam girl percent Latino student
Media portrayal stereotype exacerbate dynamic far men woman depicted technology role film television role
As highlighted disparity get included feel included one reason woman compose le technical employee le three percent America largest innovative technology company
Providing access CS critical step ensuring nation remains competitive global economy strengthens cybersecurity
Last year tech job open across United States percent STEM job projected field
The Federal government alone need additional IT cybersecurity professional private sector need many
CS important tech sector also growing number industry including transportation healthcare education financial service using software transform product service
In fact tech job outside tech sector
CS also active applied field STEM learning allows student engage interaction key math science engineering principle
It give student opportunity producer consumer digital economy active citizen world
CS also help foster computational thinking skill relevant many discipline career breaking large problem smaller one recognizing new problem relate one already solved setting aside detail problem le important identifying refining step needed reach solution
CS also complement President initiative focus growing democratization hardware software tool needed design make anything
Over past seven year President Obama led ambitious effort expand science technology engineering math STEM opportunity American student
From starting tradition launching initiative President effort helping new STEM teacher get trained catalyzed billion investment STEM education expanded opportunity student traditionally underrepresented STEM field

The San Francisco Unified School District SFUSD plan teaching computer science student school preschool grade
Last night San Francisco Board Education unanimously adopted resolution expand Computer Science class citing knowledge skill learned class help student understand underlying technology faced profession
Information technology fastest growing job sector San Francisco student currently access learn Computer Science skill crucial career said Board President Emily Murase
We proud forefront creating curriculum build knowledge skill student need starting early Learning creatively use computer technology solve problem optional next generation San Franciscans
All student must access opportunity Computer Science coding school make reality said Board Matt Haney led charge resolution
This bold essential move ensure young people live thrive century San SFUSD work closely City County San Francisco organization technology company private industry foundation implement plan
Implementation also close partnership SFUSD teacher educator include significant investment professional development ensure current SFUSD teacher expertise support credentialing teach Computer Science
There incredible support community rally around implement critical fund said Superintendent Richard Carranza
We want student able live work thrive San Francisco
This part take make The Salesforce Foundation major contributor expansion computer science education SFUSD
Of hundred SFUSD student took Advanced Placement Computer Science exam spring percent female three percent African American Latino Native American
Teaching Computer Science grade level vastly increase exposure make AP class possibility student
The SFUSD educator leading effort develop new curriculum recognized offering Computer Science high school would yield success especially reaching district diverse student population
By beginning youngest grade district provide foundational knowledge skill increasingly critical century student increase diversify student currently pursuing Computer Science high school college career
We affect change high school level working high school
We start younger child normalize Computer Science said Jim Ryan SFUSD Executive Director STEM Science Technology Engineering Math
Only something rather something small subset population For example preschool age student likely using block build robot introduce concept procedural thinking cause effect decomposition complex task pattern recognition well ability notice similarity common difference abstraction algorithm design ability develop strategy solving problem
Next year middle school offering course reaching approximately percent middle school age student hour Computer Science instruction one percent middle school student participated computer science course school year
Given uniqueness school budgetary constraint district staff predicts take several year every student every grade learning computer science

A group nonprofit educator want student even kindergartner know fundamental
More job knowledge computer work
Not start one surf web actually run simplest series input lead series particular output
Yet across United States child taught even
It discipline left largely YouTube watcher kid lucky enough born family resource
According Google Gallup half student attend school offer dedicated class
Black student le likely white peer access course teacher parent likely tell boy would good computer science girl
That technical worker company like Google Apple Facebook white male surprise
But group nonprofit educator tech company state district want change
And year work carefully crafted yet adaptable framework education look like grade level went live week
The writer hope help state craft standard ultimately bring subject classroom across country
The response history inequity computer science said Pat Yongpradit chief academic officer one organization steering initiative
People different motivation participating
Some wanted make sure state strong pipeline worker fill local tech job
Others think basic coding reading writing skillset American student need posse
And still others hope creating framework help roll back mindset computer science select begin diversify largely white male space
Yongpradit see computer science literacy modern Right many people use dating apps idea algorithm could literally help meet future spouse work pointed
It hard understand talk around mean without basic understanding server added
Equipping young people fundamental understanding computer science provide richer experience citizen modern age said
According group involved first time people across spectrum come together broad task
Perhaps contrary discipline teacher exactly clamoring someone tell teach educator background computer science state district seem welcoming input
Mark Saunders director Office Technology Virtual Learning Virginia Department Education one handful state actively working develop standard
The state plan use framework basis standard
It bigger preparing student potential job Saunders said
At core computer science computational thinking computational thinking algorithmic process key skill every student use lot different profession everyday And framework help state teacher particularly elementary level computer science likely integrated day framed class think teach concept
Most concept even require computer learn early stage said Rebecca Dovi director education Virginia nonprofit CodeVA work teacher student improve education
At recent camp Dovi whose group reviewed framework said team worked programming concept essentially hinge cheer routine group young girl planning fun
On piece paper girl drew symbol describe different movement
Two line clap
A dot foot stomp
Then learned could use symbol describe routine paper
That algorithmic Dovi said necessarily needing States nonprofit like Dovi working train teacher teach computer science
But general acknowledgement lack savvy among asked teach subject state work standard curriculum present significant hurdle
I think low supply right Saunders said
While number state including Virginia nonprofit provide teacher training existing teacher still pathway state certification teacher
Yongpradit pointed new teacher come prepared teach computer science pipeline still sparse
There also acknowledged challenge losing teacher highly qualified teach computer science tech industry salary often higher
Some district offer signing bonus certain teacher generally pretty small
But Leigh Ann DeLyser national director education research characterized idea teacher likely leave classroom teacher complete And last six month said around teacher city trained teach basic computer science
One trickier challenge getting parent broadly community board idea computer science everyone
For many year education broadly codified AP course level
There assumption DeLyser said student special smarter She hope framework help change
But work
According survey whopping percent parent say see computer science good use resource percent told teacher school official feel way
And parent often cite lack interest subject key reason woman underrepresented computer science yet perhaps unconsciously le likely tell girl would good
Saunders Virginia Education Department also said counselor may likely think student high math aptitude succeed computer science think limited view
Sepi Hejazi Moghadam head research development education Google support new framework find mindset concerning mask fact real difference access encouragement school home creating gap
It kind suggesting higher representation motivated said
Moghadam think school principal beginning look incorporating computational skill lesson though hope framework accelerate pace
That framework developed something minor miracle given writer hundred people periphery offering different opinion
They always agree
DeLyser one framework writer said instance technical thing routing protocol included early simplified pointed minute detail necessarily thing every child need know
But framework computer science maybe moment emphasis maybe even people want desperately happen say early tell
Last year every student opportunity learn computer science
He called federal government approve funding state make goal reality
The nation new education law name computer science core subject writing
And last several year Yongpradit said definitely wave activity federal state Arkansas Indiana Florida made major push level major city like New York Chicago
California toward standard
So Virginia South Carolina Washington state
What designing necessarily ideal
Activists think state focused cranking programmer instead teaching every student think computationally
But ultimately said Dovi CodeVA framework chance show teacher introduce every child every grade level computer science
We really beautiful opportunity really disrupt inequity place said
That hope draw student select conversation lesson big data cybersecurity privacy critical issue today child grapple adult

The White House want every child United States learn computer science
The president plan reach goal
Ask Congress fund new billion program state another million district train teacher purchase tool elementary middle high school provide opportunity learn computer science student weekly address January
With Congress approval billion spent three year train teacher connect school corporate nonprofit partner expand instructional material
States would apply slice billion five year use money
The funding program appear president forthcoming budget proposal latest effort White House
The Obama Administration hopeful recent passage Every Student Succeeds Act replaced No Child Left Behind signal support additional education spending
But advocacy plan relying faulty notion economy need coder
And price tag enough underwrite president ambitious goal
The United States spends magnitude educating nation student money White House proposing go toward education spending amounting roughly per tenth coming federal resource
On instruction alone federal state local government spent billion
With million student public school billion proposal additional million would translate per kid
Among administration official acknowledgment federal spending alone enough teach every student computing
This investment accelerate state local effort said acting Secretary Education John B
King call Friday reporter
It need accompanied continued investment part state Still White House hopeful initiative get ball rolling exposing nation student coding related skill
During press call Megan Smith administration chief technology advisor said initiative ambitious effort get every student America early start skill need part new The White House also enlisted advocacy chop heavyweight back proposal
Microsoft president Brad Smith stressed reporter call United States lagging behind country producing talented worker fill position
The country problem said skill gap leading many job He noted half million new job next decade created require agriculture manufacturing traditional form information technology
But loud chorus researcher education labor market question notion worker unqualified growing sophistication tech job
For several year academic pushed back concern labor market dearth employee Science Technology Engineering Math STEM field experiencing spike economist say would need happen labor shortage show employer willing pay attract talent need
Michael Teitelbaum scholar history STEM audience education reporter period dotted repeated cycle alarm boom He went say many people attracted boom phase major graduate degree field end graduating finding attractive career Ron Hira scholar Howard University study labor technology one vocal skeptic shortage informational technology field
He argues employer want saturate labor market foreign work visa typically earn le American goal
Others argued recent rash layoff tech company worker shortage sector
STEM skeptic detractor including Robert Atkinson president Information Technology Innovation Foundation written Hira others motivated boost wage worker
Atkinson also argued without warning worker shortage public policy improve STEM outcome lag
If say shortage drive improvement said job future largely require bachelor degree higher percent job suggesting debate around link college job may tell incomplete picture STEM workforce landscape
But even among critical idea skill shortage scholar like Teitelbaum believe education system could educate student science
Indeed national figure suggest computing widely taught traditional course
offer student Advanced Placement class computer roughly high school nation
By comparison student took biology chemistry history AP course school respectively
And roughly student took AP exam sat biology chemistry history
There diversity problem among AP student
Last year crop overwhelmingly male percent percent either black Latino
In nine state one black student took test
A review indicates biology chemistry physic popular several physic AP higher rate black Latino
Some data suggests studying computer science high school lead major field student enter higher education
In College Board maker AP program released data suggesting student took AP course study field college
Megan Smith said addition funding education White House initiative would disseminate recent research different student learn coding computing
One child might interested earth science one child might interested gaming one might interested social justice said
The initiative would also encourage state begin offering education younger student kid stereotype already built much society delivers To effect said popular depiction computer science could use update tell fuller story code
She noted Obama State Union Speech year included nod Grace Hopper rear admiral Navy credited first computer language
The National Science Foundation funded call equitable instructional guide attract wider array student
It also backer push
NSF curriculum design embraced College Board effort expand education
Joan assistant director NSF said We ready know help teacher develop especially field necessarily deeply expert know lot support introduction computing concept computer science school conjunction subject well Corporations nonprofit also contributing financial support train teacher student computer science
Microsoft Smith said company employee taken part training state plus District Columbia

Microsoft tech company advocating course count toward graduation requirement
White House official said state allow class count toward diploma
The White House Smith said recent year state made switch class count toward graduation requirement

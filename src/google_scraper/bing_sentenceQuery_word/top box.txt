discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

study theory experimentation engineering form basic design use computer
It scientific practical approach application systematic study feasibility structure expression mechanization methodical underlie acquisition representation processing storage communication access information
An alternate succinct definition computer science study automating algorithmic process scale
A specializes theory computation design computational system
Its field divided variety theoretical
Some field explores fundamental property intractable problem highly abstract field emphasize visual application
Other field still focus challenge implementing computation
For example considers various approach description computation study investigates various aspect use
considers challenge making computer computation useful usable human
The earliest foundation would become computer science predate invention modern
Machines calculating fixed numerical task existed since antiquity aiding computation multiplication division
Further performing computation existed since antiquity even development sophisticated computing equipment

Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


In
used type make look like
Some make distinction often referred object platform complex value type exist reason runtime efficiency syntax semantic issue
For example corresponding etc
Languages like little notion thus use object type little interest
Boxing otherwise known wrapping process placing primitive type within object primitive used reference object
For example Java change size array must fixed size
One might desire class list reference dynamic list primitive type value type
To circumvent boxed dynamic object added
Using parameterized type introduced type represented
On hand primitive wrapper class allows boxing value type returning generic reference
The boxed object always copy value object usually
Unboxing object also return copy stored value
Note repeated boxing unboxing object severe performance impact since boxing new object unboxing boxed value longer used make eligible
However modern garbage collector default Java HotSpot garbage collector efficiently collect object boxed object performance impact may bad
There direct equivalence unboxed primitive type reference immutable boxed object type
In fact possible substitute primitive type program boxed object type
Whereas assignment one primitive another copy value assignment one reference boxed object another copy reference value refer object first reference
However cause problem object immutable semantically real difference two reference object different object unless look physical equality
For operation assignment arithmetic comparison logical operator one unbox boxed type perform operation result needed
Thus possible store primitive type
Autoboxing term getting reference type value type either implicit explicit
The compiler automatically supply extra source code creates object
For example version Java prior following code compile Compilers prior would accept last line
reference object surface different forth
To convert one manually instantiate Integer object
As compiler accept last line automatically transform Integer object created store value
This mean something like compile b unboxed integer value summed result autoboxed new finally stored inside variable
Note equality operator used way since equality operator already defined reference type equality reference test equality value boxed type one must still manually unbox compare primitive use method
Another example allows programmer treat collection contained value instead object
This contradict said collection still contains reference dynamic object list primitive type
It must instead
However compiler automatically transforms code list silently receive object source code mention primitive value
For example programmer write think added list compiler actually transformed line
Unboxing refers getting value associated given object type conversion either implicit explicit
The compiler automatically supply extra source code retrieves value object either invoking method object mean
For example version Java prior following code compile C support automatic unboxing meaning Java since separate set primitive type object type
All type primitive object version Java automatically implemented C compiler either primitive value type object reference type
In language automatic boxing downcast automatically
following code wo compile C Java Modern Object Pascal yet another way perform operation simple type close boxing called type helper record helper Delphi mode
Note dialect mentioned Object Pascal language miss feature C Java implement
Notably type inference strongly typed variable
But feature related boxing
It allows programmer use construct like

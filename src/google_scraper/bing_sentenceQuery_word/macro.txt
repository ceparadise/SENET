In reference computer stand macroinstruction programmable pattern translates certain sequence preset sequence

In computer programming tool allow developer code
For instance example simple definition incorporates define square x x x After defined like macro used code body find square number
When code preprocessed macro expanded time occurs
For instance using macro like int num square writing int num declare named set value
Note function require special instruction computational overhead safely pas argument return value macro way repeat line code
In simple case using macro instead function improve performance requiring fewer instruction system resource execute

What Macro available

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In Microsoft Word program macro saved sequence keyboard stroke stored recalled single command keyboard stroke
In computer macro large opposite micro programming user interface used expands something larger
The original use macro macro definition computer language language became common
In assembler language macro definition defines expand single language statement computer instruction number instruction
The macro statement contains name macro definition usually variable parameter information
Macros useful especially sequence instruction used number time possibly different programmer working project
Some also use macro concept
In general however language language statement easy write assembler macro statement
Assembler macro generate inline rest program
More elaborate sequence instruction used frequently one program programmer encoded branched assembled program

I think Wikipedia article answer question
In practice I meet two one mentioned Also sometimes people use substitute one topic Macroeconomics
There article A macro small piece automation repetitive task
How built depends application run
For example MS Excel may use VBA scripting language
For Adobe Photoshop record set step macro
Macro derives greek word mean long large
The antonym Micro derives Greek word mean short small
In computer science macro abbreviation macroinstruction
As word suggests sequence instruction occur together
In economics investigate economy whole
Macroeconomists spend time investigate unemployment fiscal monetary policy inflation money circulation total consumption
hand focus independent economic agent individual market
Although Macro micro two face coin therefore assumption produce outcome
Still question
Ask

Macro two definition involve making computer experience efficient
The term macro often used synonymously
Keyboard shortcut key combination perform command saving file closing window data
For list keyboard shortcut available Mac Windows view page A macro also small program automates common task
These script usually run within program often created user
For example user might record macro Microsoft Word insert entire address press custom key combination
A Microsoft Excel user might record macro format data selected column spreadsheet
While Word Excel make easy create custom macro many program allow user create macro well
However program refer automated command macro
For example Photoshop allows user record change made image save series step action
These action applied image
Regardless called macro save lot time automating repetitive task
If find thing using certain program may want simplify process recording macro
Updated October Cite definition This page contains technical definiton Macro
It explains computing terminology Macro mean one many software term TechTerms dictionary
All definition TechTerms website written technically accurate also easy understand
If find Macro definition helpful reference using citation link
If think term updated added TechTerms dictionary please
Tech Factor

A macro set command expands larger simpler set
In assembly language simple mnemonic instruction map binary hex value
But macro assembler let write complex statement map multiple instruction
This quite compilation us higher level abstraction
See Still question
Ask

A symbol represents list action
Many allow create macro enter single word perform whole series action
Suppose example editing want indent every third line five space
If macro create one consists following keystroke Move Beginning Line Move Cursor Down Line Move Cursor Down Line Move Cursor Down Line Spaces Now enter name macro word processor perform command
You also use macro enter word phrase use frequently
For example could define macro contain keystroke necessary begin letter name address code insert current date
Then whenever write letter press macro key include letter header
In way macro like simple program
Some support sophisticated macro even allow use structure
In program macro variable point another variable actually
In application would called

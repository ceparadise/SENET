As shareholder key player world corporate governance
But corporate governance
refers structure method company manages process
The primary goal corporate governance achieve effective efficient balance among corporate consideration shareholder earnings managerial power
A secondary goal corporate governance provide method making decision conflict
Let explore detail
When first corporation created general rule one shareholder got cast one vote
However rule problem voting disproportionate ownership
In word shareholder one share power corporation shareholder many share
Over time rule changed one vote per share allowing shareholder vote proportionately ownership
However new rule problem
Now shareholder many share often involved vote regularly corporate issue
However shareholder like small number share case AAPL stock involved vote rarely
For reason shareholder many share often make important decision without input smaller shareholder
These decision always best interest individual small shareholder like key player
Additionally decision may truly representative ownership small shareholder group may larger shareholder may goal interest
A corporation decision action affect many people entity known include shareholder director employee creditor supplier interested party
As noted corporate governance involves way corporation stakeholder interact one another make corporate decision
However stakeholder opportunity participate corporate governance
Within corporate governance typically three key group stakeholder involved shareholder director officer
In practice key player power corporate governance
You already know owner AAPL stock shareholder participate corporate governance voting important issue
However shareholder people like
Some shareholder generally commercial legal entity like mutual fund insurance company trust investment bank etc
They often invest large quantity stock strong corporation behalf others
As noted previously shareholder many share often power shareholder share
Directors often referred often appointed elected shareholder
These stakeholder legally accountable many action corporation
The board director decides important issue develops strategy corporation
Officers employee serve director CEO CFO COO
These stakeholder often make decision corporation
These decision intended carry shareholder directive board director
It uncommon officer also member board director
It crucial corporation health officer board director work together
Due conflicting interest often disagreement shareholder director officer
In corporate boardroom example director often disagree particularly director serve role company shareholder officer
Directors seeking meet shareholder expectation reducing risk sometimes prefer innovation
Officers hand often seeking sale growth sometimes expense shareholder earnings risk director feature like sale growth often tie officer earnings bonus structure
Shareholders often one interest stock price seek protect increase way

The power key group make decision generally limited legal document created corporation set basic structure
Decisions action key group may also limited law corporation location including city country
As example limitation shareholder board director specific voting rule making decision often included corporate majority majority
However voting rule limitation power found corporate document
When board director officer power limited charter usually regarding right concern considered making certain decision
There many type corporate discus two extreme example
For instance one corporation may allow major decision made benefit shareholder
In word decision best shareholder negatively affect stakeholder even corporation corporation director officer must choose effectuate option best shareholder
These governing changed shareholder vote amend
As alternative example different corporation may require corporation act responsible way serf best interest stakeholder involved perhaps even including planet population large
In word making decision everyone everything affected must considered
Although corporation may consider others decision process shareholder interest still remain highest priority
At basic level corporate governance way key stakeholder interact one another make corporate decision
In corporate governance corporate charter set rule limitation limit power certain key stakeholder
Key stakeholder including shareholder director officer must function within corporate rule limitation

This aspect particularly present contemporary public debate development regulatory
Ways mitigating preventing conflict interest include process custom policy law institution affect way company controlled
An important theme governance nature extent
A related discussion macro level focus effect corporate governance system strong emphasis shareholder welfare
This resulted literature focussed economic analysis
Corporate governance also narrowly defined system law sound approach corporation directed controlled focusing internal external corporate structure intention monitoring action management director thereby mitigating agency risk may stem misdeed corporate officer
Corporate governance also defined Is act externally directing controlling evaluating corporation related definition Governance The act externally directing controlling evaluating entity process resource

Different model corporate governance differ according variety capitalism embedded
The model tends emphasize interest shareholder
The coordinated Multistakeholder Model associated Continental Europe Japan also recognizes interest worker manager supplier customer community
A related distinction model corporate governance
Some continental European country including Germany Austria Netherlands require Board Directors mean improving corporate governance
In board Executive Board made company executive generally run operation supervisory board made entirely director represent shareholder employee hire fire member executive board determines compensation review major business decision
The Committee Corporate Governance defines corporate governance acceptance management inalienable right shareholder true owner corporation role trustee behalf shareholder

In United Kingdom generally also serve Chairman Board whereas US dual role norm despite major misgiving regarding effect corporate governance
The number US firm combining role declining however
In United States corporation directly governed state law exchange offering trading security corporation including share governed federal legislation
Many US state adopted dominant state law publicly traded corporation continues place incorporation majority publicly traded corporation
Individual rule corporation based upon le authoritatively corporate
Shareholders initiate change corporate charter although initiate change corporate bylaw
It sometimes colloquially stated USA UK shareholder company
This however misconception argued Eccles Youmans Kay
Corporations created law regulation particular jurisdiction
These may vary many respect country corporation legal person status fundamental jurisdiction conferred statute
This allows entity hold property right without reference particular real person
It also result perpetual existence characterizes modern corporation
The statutory granting corporate existence may arise general purpose legislation general case statute create specific corporation method prior century
In addition statutory law relevant jurisdiction corporation subject country various law regulation affecting business practice
In jurisdiction corporation also constitution provides individual rule govern corporation authorize constrain
This constitution identified variety term jurisdiction usually known Corporate Charter Memorandum Articles Association
The capacity shareholder modify constitution corporation vary substantially
The passed FCPA subsequent modification
This law made illegal bribe government official required corporation maintain adequate accounting control
It enforced Department Justice Securities Exchange Commission SEC
Substantial civil criminal penalty levied corporation executive convicted bribery

The modern practice corporate governance root
The first recorded corporate governance dispute history took place notably VOC world first formally
argues governance early corporation existed superior corporation late early century early corporation governed like republic replete numerous check balance fraud usurpation power manager large shareholder
The term became particularly associated US corporate figure late century
In immediate aftermath legal scholar Edwin Dodd pondered changing role modern corporation society
From introduced notion transaction cost understanding firm founded continue behave
US economic expansion emergence multinational corporation saw establishment
Several management professor studied wrote new class entrepreneurship business history organizational behavior Elizabeth MacIver organizational behavior
According Lorsch MacIver many large corporation dominant control business affair without sufficient accountability monitoring board director
In established way understanding corporate governance firm seen series contract
In period corporate director duty expanded beyond traditional legal responsibility duty loyalty corporation shareholder
In first half issue corporate governance received considerable press attention due spate CEO dismissal example board
The led wave shareholder activism something rarely seen way ensuring corporate value would destroyed traditionally cozy relationship CEO board director example unrestrained issuance stock option infrequently
In early massive bankruptcy criminal malfeasance well lesser involving led increased political interest corporate governance
This reflected passage
Other trigger continued interest corporate governance organization included level CEO pay In severely affected economy exit foreign capital property asset collapsed
The lack corporate governance mechanism country highlighted weakness institution economy
In November CMA issued corporate governance code
The Kingdom made considerable progress respect implementation viable culturally appropriate governance mechanism Johnson
Johnson found strong relationship efficiency corporate governance structure bank performance using performance measure one exception government local ownership group significant
However using performance measure revealed weak positive relationship efficiency corporate governance structure bank performance
Key party involved corporate governance include stakeholder board director management shareholder
External stakeholder creditor auditor customer supplier government agency community large also exert influence
The agency view corporation posit shareholder forgoes decision right control entrusts manager act shareholder best joint interest
Partly result separation two investor manager corporate governance mechanism include system control intended help align manager incentive shareholder
Agency concern risk necessarily lower
In private corporation shareholder elect board director represent interest
In case nonprofit stakeholder may role recommending selecting board member typically board decides serve board board
The degree leadership board organization varies practice large organization executive management principally CEO drive major initiative oversight approval board
Former Chairman Board John Smale wrote The board responsible successful perpetuation corporation
That responsibility relegated management
A expected play key role corporate governance
The board responsibility CEO selection succession providing feedback management organization strategy compensating senior executive monitoring financial health performance risk ensuring accountability organization investor authority
Boards typically several committee Compensation Nominating Audit perform work
The OECD Principles Corporate Governance describe responsibility board summarized All party corporate governance interest whether direct indirect corporation
Directors worker management receive salary benefit reputation investor expect receive financial return
For lender specified interest payment return equity investor arise dividend distribution capital gain stock
Customers concerned certainty provision good service appropriate quality supplier concerned compensation good service possible continued trading relationship
These party provide value corporation form financial physical human form capital
Many party may also concerned
A key factor party decision participate engage corporation confidence corporation deliver party expected outcome
When category party stakeholder sufficient confidence corporation controlled directed manner consistent desired outcome le likely engage corporation
When becomes endemic system feature loss confidence participation market may affect many stakeholder increase likelihood political action
There substantial interest external system institution including market influence corporate governance

This development part broader trend towards fully exercised asset ownership notably part trustee large UK Dutch Scandinavian Canadian pension investor In Britain The widespread social disenchantment followed impact stakeholder including board member investment manager
Many UK largest pension fund thus already active steward asset engaging speaking think necessary
Control ownership structure refers type composition shareholder corporation
In country Continental Europe ownership necessarily equivalent control due existence

Ownership typically defined ownership cash flow right whereas control refers ownership control voting right
Researchers often measure control ownership structure using observable measure control ownership concentration extent inside control ownership
Some feature type control ownership structure involving include pyramid ring web
German concern Konzern legally recognized corporate group complex structure
Japanese 系列 South Korean tend corporate group consist complex interlocking business relationship shareholding

Forget celebrity CEO
Look beyond Six Sigma latest technology fad
One biggest strategic advantage company blood tie according study The significance institutional investor varies substantially across country
In developed country Australia Canada New Zealand institutional investor dominate market stock larger corporation
While majority share Japanese market held financial company industrial corporation institutional investor holding largely group
The largest pool invested money mutual fund largest investment management firm corporation designed maximize benefit diversified investment investing large number different corporation sufficient
The idea strategy largely eliminate individual firm risk
A consequence approach investor relatively little interest governance particular corporation
It often assumed institutional investor pressing change decide likely costly effort required simply sell investment
Corporate governance mechanism control designed reduce inefficiency arise
There internal monitoring system external monitoring system
Internal monitoring done example one large shareholder case privately held company firm belonging
Furthermore various board mechanism provide internal monitoring
External monitoring manager behavior occurs independent third party
attests accuracy information provided management investor
Stock analyst debt holder may also conduct external monitoring
An ideal monitoring control system regulate motivation ability providing toward corporate goal objective
Care taken incentive strong individual tempted cross line ethical behavior example manipulating revenue profit figure drive share price company
Internal corporate governance control monitor activity take corrective action accomplish organisational goal
Examples include In publicly traded corporation board director largely often take Chair Board position make much difficult institutional owner fire
The practice CEO also Chair Board fairly common large American corporation
While practice common relatively rare elsewhere
In successive code best practice recommended duality
External corporate governance control encompass control external stakeholder exercise organization
Examples include The board director primary responsibility corporation internal external function
The crucial participant board usually high degree reliance integrity supply accounting information
They oversee internal accounting system dependent corporation
Current accounting rule allow manager choice determining method measurement criterion recognition various financial reporting element
The potential exercise choice improve apparent performance increase user
Financial reporting fraud including deliberate falsification value also contributes user information risk
To reduce risk enhance perceived integrity financial report corporation financial report must audited independent issue report accompanies financial statement
One area concern whether auditing firm act independent auditor management consultant firm auditing
This may result conflict interest place integrity financial report doubt due client pressure appease management
The power corporate client initiate terminate management consulting service fundamentally select dismiss accounting firm contradicts concept independent auditor
Changes enacted United States form following numerous corporate scandal culminating prohibit accounting firm providing auditing management consulting service
Similar provision place clause Standard Listing Agreement India
Increasing attention regulation brought executive pay level since
Research relationship firm performance identify consistent significant relationship executive remuneration firm performance
Not firm experience level agency conflict external internal monitoring device may effective others
Some researcher found largest CEO performance incentive came ownership firm share researcher found relationship share ownership firm performance dependent level ownership
The result suggest increase ownership cause management become entrenched le interested welfare shareholder

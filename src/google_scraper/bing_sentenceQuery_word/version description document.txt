These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch
As discipline computer science span range topic theoretical study algorithm limit computation practical issue implementing computing system hardware software
formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation made representative ACM IEEE CS four area considers crucial discipline computer science
In addition four area CSAB also identifies field software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking communication database system parallel computation distributed computation interaction computer graphic operating system numerical symbolic computation important area computer science

Its aim understand nature consequence understanding provide efficient methodology
All study related mathematical logic formal concept method could considered theoretical computer science provided motivation clearly drawn field
Data structure algorithm study commonly used computational method computational efficiency
According fundamental question underlying computer science What efficiently automated
Theory computation focused answering fundamental question computed amount resource required perform computation
In effort answer first question examines computational problem solvable various theoretical
The second question addressed study time space cost associated different approach solving multitude computational problem
The famous problem one open problem theory computation
Information theory related quantification information
This developed find fundamental limit operation compressing data reliably storing communicating data
Coding theory study property system converting information one form another fitness specific application
Codes used recently also
Codes studied purpose designing efficient reliable method
Programming language theory branch computer science deal design implementation analysis characterization classification individual
It fall within discipline computer science depending affecting software engineering
It active research area numerous dedicated academic journal
Formal method particular kind based technique development software system
The use formal method software hardware design motivated expectation engineering discipline performing appropriate mathematical analysis contribute reliability robustness design
They form important theoretical underpinning software engineering especially safety security involved
Formal method useful adjunct software testing since help avoid error also give framework testing
For industrial use tool support required
However high cost using formal method mean usually used development safety utmost importance
Formal method best described application fairly broad variety fundamental particular calculus also problem software hardware specification verification
Computer architecture digital computer organization conceptual design fundamental operational structure computer system
It focus largely way central processing unit performs internally access address memory
The field often involves discipline computer engineering electrical engineering selecting interconnecting hardware component create computer meet functional performance cost goal
Computer performance analysis study work flowing computer general goal improving controlling using resource efficiently eliminating predicting performance anticipated peak load
Concurrency property system several computation executing simultaneously potentially interacting

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Before I get started I need issue apology We currently transitioning development department people Agile
The why wherefore pro con well beyond scope question
This development department contains Architecture Service team made people officially known Solution Architects
In reality cover solution technical people cover every technical architectural aspect project
hardware software security governance etc
They also provide function development team code review standard guidance etc wider business technical input tender pre contract technical preview customer requirement As part transition I tasked creating Kanban board purpose getting view work activity Architecture Service team accountable
There myriad example board development coding team none I find Architecture
So I taken various source created something I would really appreciate genuine feedback
It also worth noting presented team starting point work progress
It board I want I setting foundation guy build change necessary So far I something like The main board hold active backlog project active work board
This short reviewed daily architectural scrum review end every week
The column description purpose Projects person initial technical analysis
running technical option product owner determining size project
As example Evaluation project may Architect evaluating new technology working customer produce mutually agreed technical solution
Projects actively development coding testing etc person acting SA function wider project team
As example could development coding aspect mutually agreed technical solution mentioned equally could also architecturally overseeing implementation new hardware
All weird wonderful stuff come ca put two column
As example strange recursive world card column create KanBan board
Fairly self explanatory person owns card row
To make thing little fun actually contains avatar person choice
Is effectively backlog card ordered top bottom priority
As space person cell becomes available take top todo
Fairly self explanatory Items completed since last full board review Friday afternoon every week Rather
give work somebody squeal I would like main board work objective evidence based WIP limit
The intention size board card The size much Architects workload perspective example project requires year coding people minimal Architectural input would XS However project massive Architectural input minimal coding could XL
Over time able work WIP limit person
So know Jonny Smith work velocity point therefore allocate project level
As done intention set initial limit high idea person squeal team look objectively determine genuinely much process etc onerous streamlined
In order keep track random thing fly team also funnel board
This relatively simple board look like As team made aware project yet officially sanctioned
put Todo column Main Board go onto funnel board
Items allocated person
The idea track random thing come ensure forgotten
Also person completes evaluation project move Main Board Evaluation Done Implementation funnel board unless immediately becomes implementation project A member team occasionally tasked following everything funnel board
quick phone call product owner asking still relevant would project main board This simple board track done last X month
It hold card Funnel Main board The idea occasionally get around board give mutual pat back The card board contain following information As notice granularity card fairly high Project level I planning developer style board split task thought welcome
Also worth mentioning depending card section applicable
I also planning colour coding card first stab I Yellow Anything customer contractual Pink Anything internal
end user facing Green Anything company group project The card magnetic rather I hoping find like mini white board make life easier thing change Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Wow
That took time fully digest understand
Congratulations deciding adopt Kanban Agile initiative
Really nice analysis modeling far
Thanks sharing allowing u help contribute initiative
I thought suggestion hope help
A
First get overall I gather three board shown ONLY tracking work rest Development work correct
B
Given way described would appear Funnel Board column essentially column corresponding section Main Board
Is necessary separate Funnel board
Would simpler single board column section Main Board
Similarly Successes Board seen large column right Main Board successfully completed work accumulates period time
So depending number project funnel progress stage time would simpler manage single Board following design Of course likely already evaluated decided might big manage single Board
You could consider dropping lane section since Funnel lane might serve purpose
In term Main Board design really depends overall goal implementing Kanban
Some question board design Do want improve Cycle Times individual would easy current design different type Projects might tricky much given
If latter might prefer lane defined people Project type similar class service
Is ever possible might two architect working single project
If lane people would make difficult model unless two card project person
Is possible different type Projects may different workflow
For example might customer project require greater scrutiny validation testing review others
If Kanban allows different workflow different type work would possible design
If point make sense situation I would suggest might want consider lane based people aspect
From talked Project Type seems one option I sure criterion possible well
Another suggestion intuitive visualization since people associate flow part world direction flow think Ad Hoc section right Implementation column might confusing
My preference would Ad Hoc project separate Swim Lane
So Main Board might look follows In could show architect work project could stick Project card
If needed legend one side board might explain avatar Architect
Finally bigger question stated initially board meant track project Architects accountable
These project I presume part larger project done overall Development department
How planning show dependency bigger project work
On WIP Limits based I seen number customer sweat much initially
But go critical establish WIP Limits change needed rather WIP Limits
If already data many project Architect entire Architect team handled last several month could use define initial WIP limit already
If consider going virtual Kanban board future might easier manage change play around I hope help least throwing idea consider
Best Mahesh Interesting read mostly make sense
The one immediate thing I would comment Kanban board meant represent flow work left right
As I imagine work flow Implementation really work board
A better imo option would horizontal lane Evaluation Implementation card contain name people
This advantage allowing one person work activity tho maybe need
In addition poster say considered external dependency
It might worth column show work waiting someone something outside team

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
We start working Kanban instead Scrum product development
We identified ahve following flow Backlog Analyze Development Test Nothing strange
For story small beginning problem
But happens epic Analyze split story
Some move Development might go back backlog
How measure moving story forward backward
Another dimenson problem different story different size want small story break small part
But stakeholder interested whole story
He want epic go Analyze column long take whole epic complete
Your process may missing intermediate queue making estimate harder need
You may also need work closely stakeholder decompose epic order provide meaningful estimate
And finally may need provide team organization education estimate performed Kanban
Kanban measure number thing well
Some metric Kanban help team measure include Kanban work efficiently consistent batch size optimizes system flow
High variability average size user story lead unpredictability cadence iteration making accurate estimation difficult
In Kanban scheduling estimate typically based two thing Scrum provides explicit fixed work scheduled
In contrast Kanban provides continuous flow input queue output queue fixed
This requires slightly different providing estimate specific feature
So team I would provide estimate BDD style making calculation assumption explicit
For example User story cycle time epic simple reason never pulled system
It fine put epic onto backlog must decompose reach WIP stage
It sound like current process missing couple important queue
I would suggest instead Backlog Queue Ready Queue Development WIP Test WIP Completed Work Apply sensible queue limit Analysis Ready queue pull backlog need
Respect global WIP limit keep mind limit applied column board
Without clear understanding epic acceptance criterion would difficult determine completeness
Therefore first action committing develop epic moment begin measure lead time define criterion
About splitting issue IME use size estimation techiques define suitable range actionable size within defined timeframe epic maximun month work
I used portfolio slicing success
Here example portfolio kanban board implemented By posting answer agree

When using KANBAN board JIRA I change status EPIC IN PROGRESS either changing status status field moving card IN PROGRESS column respective card disappears board
I still see filter issue view kanban board
Does anyone know happen
And way show EPICS IN PROGRESS KANBAN board
The Kanban board mapping status column board configuration
It possible column mapped In Progress status
That mean issue status In Progress appear board
It also possible trigger associated transition In Progress something might make epic invisible

agile scrum kanban See Agile

Stephen worked Project Manager PMP certified well certified Scrum Alliance
Want watch later
The development team Dan software company extremely productive
However would productive without disruption come moving project phase
They decided use agile development method focus continuous flow work
As make transition Dan look help team understand origin Kanban principle behind well importance Kanban board bring together
The concept Kanban two source inspiration
The first involves approach grocery store use inventory
They focus keeping item shelf restocking purchased since inefficient costly stockpile inventory
The concept action occur triggered action
Specifically purchase action trigger action restocking trigger additional inventory purchased
The second inspiration way Toyota managed factory based method
Their goal action occur response applicable triggering action
The contribution software development involves way action relayed
A Japanese card passed team signal new action
The principle Kanban based concept inventory kanban card
These principle include visual display continuous flow limit ensure efficiency
They form basis Kanban integral Kanban board
The first principle Kanban involves visual display
This directly derived Toyota use card factory
From project work various state progress Kanban visual methodology
The purpose keep everyone page focused making everything visual
Another principle Kanban maintaining continuous flow
This come approach inventory based completed action triggering action
In contrast methodology think process sequence set start endpoint
The last principle involves using limit ensure efficiency
Specifically Kanban us limit number item allowed point progress
Items allowed advance many next progress point
The goal prevent item piling point
This another element continuous flow
Once Dan team understanding Kanban look implement using provides visual display project work various point progress leading completion
The Kanban board main component Kanban enables various principle accomplished
The design Kanban board focus primary concern project project work status
These two element relevant everyone involved project stakeholder development team member
The project work status also main identifier project success
The project work displayed Kanban board using card
These work item take one two form depending level definition
The first defines benefit outcome specific user
User story form item developed tested team
The second description functionality thought user story large complex
Epics must better defined broken user story order taken initially displayed card board
Get FREE access day create account
The progress work item substance Kanban board forming vertical lane board user story card move
The first lane work yet started next available item head line
This known often label column
However could also labeled something like Do
This column contain epic addition user story although must broken user story order progress
The next lane lane depending work best team current work
For team prefer use single lane status label often Progress
If team prefers multiple lane provide detail use label like
These lane continuous flow principle applicable WIP limit used
A user story move Testing Development Development WIP limit
The final lane contains user story completed
This lane typically labeled user story fully developed tested
The key lane everyone common understanding done mean
The goal user story move quickly possible
inspiration approach inventory used grocery story Toyota factory adopted practice added use card signal trigger needed action
The use card facilitates visual display principle continuous flow made efficient use
The enables principle carried
The project work take form displayed using card
The card advance various status lane board Do column Progress column finally column

I would like start saying I read I still trouble implementing filter based filter process Estimation Board app
Currently I trying add item filter query object cardboard
The query object call return array item filter
As far I tell query call function load second two display result
Any input suggestion alternative solution welcomed
Here code Mark answer caused obscure crash filteredItems called
However since filtering code actually manipulating actual reference turn setItems method actually needed
I pulled filter properly
Per hint Here I approached following Charles hint Rally Catalog Kanban
First modify fetch statement inside cardboardConfig includes Children collection thusly Next statement And statement Add following event listener callback This callback filter item
Not sure problem cardboard config set field
The fetch type data retrieve want filter add query value config object
Something like Where fullQuery constructed using Rally query object
You find searching SDK
Hope maybe help

Adopting Scaled Agile Framework SAFe tricky part others
Here biggest challenge suggest technique make potential problem area easier overcome
Note We assuming familiarity SAFe
If simply need refresher see posted last month
So top problem area
There element need addressed including prove SAFe measurably benefiting organization create transformation team move portfolio budgeting
I share thought passion area road
For let focus following four problem area I seen client stall process defining initial epic
Because defined epic fuel train stalling failing understand part process derail thing quickly
But defining initial epic hard
First let clear misconception
There technically four category epic combination two category Each cause confusion let clear
Before SAFe came along people used word indicate user story big fit one sprint otherwise exactly even written way
A user As I want
But SAFe case
Clear definition mind
Instead SAFe defines epic enterprise initiative sufficiently substantial warrant analysis understanding potential ROI implementation
SAFe also advocate creating lightweight business case epic
This sound familiar
In world would similar definition software project program
Both require business case
Both require ROI analysis fund allocated
The big difference project funded team must created work
In SAFe approved epic pulled train
This follows pattern see scrum asking dedicated team usual SAFe much larger scale
For example team people instead people
There strong misconception every program epic must child portfolio epic
But real definition simple A portfolio epic span multiple agile release train ARTs
A program epic belongs single ART
That
The portfolio epic broken program epic generally one per train involved portfolio epic people seem get confused
But exception norm
Imagine zero overlap train ideal state train design
There would portfolio epic program epic
The extreme train poorly designed every epic requires multiple train deliver value
In case percent program epic would trace back portfolio epic would defeat whole idea train dedicated team delivering concept cash value
To add confusion program epic portfolio epic generally kept one backlog called portfolio backlog
Portfolio epic originate program portfolio management team program epic originate train
A train create program epic epic may see portfolio epic part create program epic scope part portfolio epic
Both however go portfolio Kanban think project pipeline ensure transparency good metric throughput
So recap important part
From ART perspective epic program epic
Only link back portfolio epic
Now realistic blend program portfolio epic
Think percent portfolio
In fact SAFe talk train create budget reserve portfolio epic keeping rest local program epic
That budget could easily split along line
There le confusion business architectural epic category
Business epic provide value customer architectural epic improve portfolio ability deliver value well quality value delivered
But one spot confusion I see also architectural feature team believe originate architectural epic
In fact architectural feature come either business architectural epic
So clear least clearer focus identify epic
Most company I work already pipeline project yet funded
They intake process new project
Some call proposal flip project funded
The fastest way get initial epic set convert current proposal project program epic
This also help start realize train might
Think permanent program team instead assembling team
Your current program project already team working could actually become initial train dedicated resource well
More part SAFe client seem confused real definition value stream
But example unlock answer
But one important thing remember purpose train SAFe
Traditional unscaled scrum ask dedicated team ensure stable velocity
SAFe asks dedicated large team ensure stable project throughput
These team dedicated people
And noted call team agile release train ART
And like agile team goal completely
Or close
OK example everyone understand
Imagine company called Nanosoft three major profit center productivity software operating system consulting
What three idea become
The immediate thought would great value stream since separate source value
The truth SAFe size
SAFe solves problem large team multiple team functional dependency
And sweet spot people
So example imagine developer three value stream
It would make sense three train
In fact may need SAFe since mark
Of course people SAFe experience would likely still steal lot best practice SAFe despite team size
But let imagine developer three value area
Now choice You could one value stream three train productivity software train operating system train consulting train
You may asking What consulting train develop software
That topic another article SAFe development
Or could three value stream single train
My advice start simple expand evidence show
So case create one train
Now let scale even
Imagine value stream whole lot developer
Imagine productivity software four major product NanoEdit NanoSheet NanoPresenter NanoPlanner
Further operating system includes PC mobile cloud
Each seven product area developer
Now case creating three value stream multiple train
The train dedicated team people number one driver many train value stream need
Start simple possible one train one value stream unless people
If look current line business guidance
If developing software internal client value stream either internal product client type
Ensure put skill growth system place find skill gap train close much possible
Many team gotten release planning session found readiness lacking momentum le hoped
Others hit ground running
To figure latter group need study agenda planning meeting
Take look
If click find middle tier right center yellow inverted tab called Release Planning may seem overwhelming least first
I big fan simplification
So simplification
Each two day understood three identical part breakout
It simply matter understanding three part differ day
On day one focus four thing sharing business context epic vision architecture vision top feature program increment along explaining breakout
That
We need prep want strong release planning event
The day one breakout fairly straightforward
Teams allocate story across four sprint adjust four recommendation SAFe
Right I expect ton agilists leaping seat
Four sprint
That waterfall
Further SAFe mention percent story ready release planning event start fly face two big agile concept creating story together since conversation critical understanding story story sprint due
Yes folk team never story refine story sprint within sprint
So definitely extreme
However team still collaborate form estimate acceptance criterion task story adjust story breakout session
Also part breakout abstract many feature smaller set program increment PI objective team
Teams also identify risk impediment
Scrum master meet
The day one team present PI objective risk
Contrary might think objective rolled program team
They abstraction story make thing digestible program level bunch team lot story team level
They also present risk likely done work
Also part team take senior management stick around create action plan mitigate risk presented team draft plan
Day two share pattern
Characteristics part follow
On day two management present risk solution
The team break finish work
But time business owner come around put value score PI objective
Finally updated plan presented confidence vote taken confident deliver came
retrospective run event event
I hope simplification three identical part per day make default calendar SAFe lot le intimidating master lot easier prepare
The fourth challenge I want discus ensuring code quality
With sprint I seen ugly engineering shortcut happen
But one thing I worry encourage look story really unit business value
A story represent value business
It refined understood requirement developed according good architecture tested deployed environment
If story fragment missed boat
I seen four sprint sprint requirement sprint test work
Hello waterfall
So improve
I theory start asking question What happens teach agile team poor engineering practice
Poor technique requirement architecture development test deployment
You probably guessed
It bad work whole lot faster
So first piece advice ensure team strong modern engineering practice let go agile
What practice
I enough room single article go depth mastering practice critical going agile effectively
It much easier master agile ceremony release planning sprint planning stand ups collaboration session sprint review demo retrospective
It much harder excellent engineering two week
Ensure base engineering practice strong make effort improve
Ensure team really understand spirit agile collaboration high trust environment team
When ignored three alone turn agile adoption nightmare
Ask often say team idea
Can sprint
No
Can story original way user
No
Can count task instead estimating hour metric
No
Can publish library practice vetted review board
No
The list go instead saying say yes thing
Embracing spirit agile mean embracing innovation trusting team make best choice
Of course I recommend measuring team ensure fly far rail
Measuring innovation done another topic I like write later
If team strong engineering discipline embraced role ceremony agile spirit adoption SAFe incredibly smooth
As colleague Ali Ali Blue Agility say layer SAFe Team Program Portfolio fractal basic agile scrum idea
The role ceremony value scaled team size responsible ROI
So four biggest challenge
I doubt I addressed issue may face I hope find nugget actionable idea pursue adoption

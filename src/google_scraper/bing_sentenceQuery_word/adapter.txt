The adapter pattern used client class call incompatible provider class
Let imagine MailingClient class need call method LegacyEmployee class already call class implement interface implement
We could add new method implement interface legacy code ca changed
We could modify class call need change every call
The formatting code would duplicated everywhere
Moreover wo able call provider class implement interface
So solution code formatting code another independent class adapter also called implement interface
call
format data call
This type adapter called
The type adapter
Describe class adapter
The JavaScript library implement adapter pattern
This library used canvas element
The canvas element two interface WebGL
The first one simple use second much complex optimized faster
The WebGL interface interface client call interface
Think twice implementing pattern
This pattern planned design time
If plan use project scratch mean understand pattern
It used legacy code
It least bad solution
Its implementation easy expensive
You refactor code client provider able work together yet
This worst part
Most code redundancy le without pattern
The modern interface always provide much information legacy interface need work
If one information missing modern interface call pattern question
This pattern easily removed automatic refactoring operation easily remove existence
Our company created merger
One list employee available database access via class One list employee available LDAP access via class To access former employee company A former employee company B define interface used two adapter We create adapter code former company A We create adapter code former company B Add illustration

In also known Wrapper alternative naming shared allows existing used another interface
It often used make existing class work others without modifying
An example adapter convert interface document tree structure displayed
The Adapter design pattern one describe solve recurring design problem design flexible reusable software object easier implement change test reuse
Often already existing class ca reused interface conform interface client require
The key idea pattern work separate adapts interface already existing class without changing
Clients know whether work class directly class interface
See also UML class diagram
An adapter allows two incompatible interface work together
This definition adapter
Interfaces may incompatible inner functionality suit need
The Adapter design pattern allows otherwise incompatible class work together converting interface one class interface expected client
An adapter used wrapper must respect particular interface must support behavior
Alternatively make possible add alter behavior interface used easier simpler interface underlying object desired
In class requires depends interface reuse class directly interface conform interface
Instead work class implement interface term In adapter pattern adapter contains instance class wrap
In situation adapter make call instance wrapped
This adapter pattern us multiple implementing inheriting interface expected interface
It typical expected interface created pure class especially jdk support class
There form runtime adapter pattern follows It desired supply data let u suppose data
A compile time solution However suppose format string data must varied
A compile time solution use inheritance perhaps create correctly formatting object runtime mean
A solution using adapter proceeds follows Define intermediary Provider interface write implementation Provider interface wrap source data example output data formatted appropriate ii Write Adapter class return specific implementation Provider iii Register global registry looked runtime iv In code wishing transfer data write concisely v The advantage seen desired transfer data second format look different vi And desired output data say image data vii In way use adapter provider allows multiple view without alter class hierarchy
In general permit mechanism arbitrary data flow object retrofitted existing object hierarchy
When implementing adapter pattern clarity one apply class name provider implementation example
It constructor method adaptee class variable parameter
This parameter passed instance member
When clientMethod called access adaptee instance allows accessing required data adaptee performing operation data generates desired output
Output

The circuitry required particular
For example enable support enable computer attach network

In especially device device
This may link two part computer example computer controller external device manages operation connection device
The term sometimes used opposite sense refer device user control operation computer
In desktop computer controller may plug board single integrated circuit external device
In controller usually either separate device attached integrated peripheral
Early desktop computer used expansion board expansion card controller handling specific type device
Examples expansion board controller As chip density improved controller implemented single chip often located motherboard
Examples Further integration enabled development chip single chip could control variety device floppy disk parallel port serial port keyboard mouse
In IBM terminology device decodes channel command effect operation device
In mainframe system usually attache CPU controller control unit implement logic attaching specific device
The function performed control unit similar function performed program smaller system
Some device integrated control unit logically discrete included device rather requiring separate box
Often control unit attach multiple channel connected single multiple system
Some mainframe control unit

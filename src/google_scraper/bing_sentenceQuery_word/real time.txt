In describes system subject constraint example
program must guarantee response within specified time constraint often referred deadline
The correctness type system depends temporal aspect well functional aspect
response often understood order millisecond sometimes microsecond
A system specified operating real time usually response within timeframe although response time may given
A system described one control environment receiving data processing returning result sufficiently quickly affect environment time
The term also used mean simulation clock run speed real clock mean without significant delay
software may use one following network provide essential framework build software application
Systems used many application must control aircraft vehicle must produce maximum deceleration intermittently stop braking prevent skidding
processing completed within specified deadline relative event deadline must always met regardless
The term derives use early process simulated rate matched real process called avoid ambiguity
often capable simulating much faster pace situation could dangerous slow simulation also recognized accounted
Minicomputers particularly onwards built dedicated DOG scanner increased need response important interaction incoming data operating system RTOS well date era
scheduling allowed low priority task CPU time foreground task needed execute gave absolute priority within foreground highest priority
operating system would also used multiuser duty
For example could run foreground background RDOG would introduce additional element scheduling algorithm make appropriate people interacting via
Once used later used popular anybody could use home computer system
The possibility deactivate interrupt allowed loop defined timing low allowed implementation operating system giving user interface disk drive lower priority thread
Compared Intel CPUs generates large latency Windows operating system neither operating system allow program take CPU completely use without using native machine language thus surpassing interrupting Windows code
However several coding library exist offer real time capability high level language variety operating system example
The subsequent family member etc
also became popular manufacturer industrial control system
This application area one control offer genuine advantage term process performance safety
A system said total correctness operation depends upon logical correctness also upon time performed
system well deadline classified consequence missing deadline Thus goal ensure deadline met goal becomes meeting certain subset deadline order optimize criterion
The particular criterion optimized depend application typical example include maximizing number deadline met minimizing lateness task maximizing number high priority task meeting deadline
Hard system used imperative event reacted within strict deadline
Such strong guarantee required system reacting certain interval time would cause great loss manner especially damaging surroundings physically threatening human life although strict definition simply missing deadline constitutes failure system
For example control system hard system delayed signal may cause engine failure damage
Other example hard embedded system include medical system heart industrial process controller
Hard system typically found interacting low level physical hardware
Early video game system vector graphic hard requirement nature graphic timing hardware
In context system normally priority driven scheduler
Other scheduling algorithm include ignoring overhead sufficient system load le
New overlay scheduling system assist managing large system mixture hard non application
Soft system typically used solve issue concurrent access need keep number connected system changing situation
An example software maintains update flight plan commercial flight plan must kept reasonably current operate latency second
Live system also usually soft violation constraint result degraded quality system continue operate also recover future using workload prediction reconfiguration methodology
In DSP process analyzed input generated output sample processed generated continuously time take input output set sample processing delay
It mean processing delay must bounded even processing continues unlimited time
That mean processing time per sample including greater sampling period reciprocal
This criterion whether sample grouped together large segment processed block processed individually whether long short
Consider example process requires second process second sound
However take second made DSP process
A common life analog standing line waiting checkout grocery store
If line asymptotically grows longer longer without bound checkout process
If length line bounded customer processed output rapidly average inputted process
The grocer might go business must least lose business make checkout process thus fundamentally important process
A signal processing algorithm keep flow input data output falling farther farther behind input
But delay output relative input bounded regarding process operates unlimited time signal processing algorithm even throughput delay may long
signal processing necessary sufficient live signal processing required
Live audio digital signal processing requires operation sufficient limit throughput delay tolerable performer using noticeable audience also directly watching performer
Tolerable limit latency live processing subject investigation debate estimated millisecond
bidirectional le m round trip twice unidirectional delay considered acceptable avoid undesired conversation
computing sometimes misunderstood accurate classification
For example massive executing scientific simulation may offer impressive performance yet executing computation
Conversely hardware software braking system designed meet required deadline performance gain obligatory
Furthermore network server highly loaded network traffic response time may slower case still succeed time hit deadline
Hence network server would considered system temporal failure delay etc
typically small compartmentalized limited effect catastrophic failure
In system beyond limit would often considered catastrophic application context
Therefore important requirement system predictability performance
Some kind software many fall either category
For instance chess program designed play tournament clock need decide move certain deadline lose game therefore computation chess program allowed run indefinitely moving
In case however high performance desirable work tournament chess program allotted time better move faster unconstrained chess program run sooner able move
This example also illustrates essential difference computation computation tournament chess program make decision next move allotted time loses fails scenario meeting deadline assumed necessary
indicative amount processing performed given amount time ability get done processing yield useful output available time
The term NRT refers time introduced automated transmission occurrence event use processed data display control purpose
For example display depicts event situation existed current time minus processing time nearly time live event
The distinction term near real time real time somewhat nebulous must defined situation hand
The term implies significant delay
In many case processing described would accurately described near
Near also refers delayed transmission voice video
It allows playing video image approximately without wait entire large video file download
Incompatible database common flat file database scheduled basis common data near
The distinction near varies delay dependent type speed transmission
The delay near typically order several second several minute
Several method exist aid design system example old successful method represents structure system

Suppose program work stream image
It get image make edits store image
What maximum latency one still speak real time application
Please give source answer There one answer question
Real time mean different thing depending kind sensor sensor using trying
By way editing storing image may even qualify computer vision
Computer vision extracting information image video meaning real time depends kind information trying extract
A typical video camera acquires image frame per second fps
So definition
able process image rate acquire
On hand goal detect track object video function fast object move
For example often sufficient tracking people walking street probably tracking car going mile per hour highway
In computer science system one guarantee response previously set deadline
For stream image implies system one guarantee finished processing image previously set timing constraint latency
There latency one still speak real time application
Each system fixed maximum latency generally differs maximum latency system
RealTime simply meeting timing constraint
Those timing constraint might microsecond might hour
EmbeddedSystems engineer use exactly one definition real time A real time system employ task execute completion guaranteed amount time
system provide result correct also delivered time
Instead average behavior standard computing system allow guarantee temporal requirement met
System computing system whose correct behavior depends value computation also time output produced
In soft real time application system miss dead line without causing failure overall system
As example losing video frame fail Common miconceptions computing equivalent fast computing
Rather fast important property system predictability
Predictability speed foremost goal design

Misconceptions Computing A Serious Problem Systems

If subsystem handle one frame video time video streaming frame per second buffered meet constraint subsystem must handle frame second le qualify system
However often pipeline subsystem one job second le total latency frame video introduced one end result end full second yet pipeline still qualifies guaranteed meet timing constraint
The definition usually dependent requirement system
Some system might deem might think etc
However rate system need operate often upper bound fast algorithm Computer Vision something else need run
So system need operate expect Computer Vision algorithm need faster Hz

The design system becoming increasingly important
Computers incorporated car aircraft manufacturing assembly line application control process real It practical instance provide input computer allow compute indefinite length time examine output
The computer output must available timely fashion processor processor must carefully chosen task specially scheduled deadline met
Frequently task repeat fixed time interval example every many second sensor data gathered analyzed control signal generated
In case scheduling theory utilized system designer determining task scheduled given processor
A good example system requires action ABS newer vehicle critical ABS instantly react pressure begin program pumping brake application said hard deadline
Some system said soft deadline although deemed important meet disaster happen system response slightly delayed example ocean shipping tracking system
The concept best effort arises system design soft deadline may sometimes slipped hard deadline may sometimes met computing le optimal result
For example detail air traffic controller screen altitude need displayed nearest interfere air
Computer program software becoming part growing complicated requiring team programmer year effort develop
As consequence new subdiscipline software engineering arisen
The development large piece software perceived engineering task approached care construction skyscraper example attention cost reliability maintainability final product
The process usually described consisting several phase variously defined general consisting identification user requirement development system specification hardware software software design perhaps several successively detailed level implementation actual coding testing maintenance
Even engineering place process expensive
Since early increasingly sophisticated tool built aid software developer automate much possible development process
Such CASE tool span wide range type carry task routine coding given appropriately detailed design specification language incorporate enforce design rule eliminate software defect prior coding phase
As size complexity software grown concept reuse become increasingly important software engineering since clear extensive new software created cheaply rapidly without incorporating existing program module subroutine piece computer code
One attractive aspect see written term object readily reused
As aspect computer system rather vaguely defined likelihood system operate correctly reasonably long period key goal finished software product
Sophisticated technique testing software therefore designed
For example large software product might deliberately seeded artificial fault discovered testing high actual fault likely cause computational error discovered well
The need better trained software engineer led development educational program software engineering either specialization within separate program
The recommendation software engineer like engineer licensed certified gaining increasing support momentum toward accreditation software engineering degree program

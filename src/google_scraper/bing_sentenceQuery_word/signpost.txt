discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Signpost card set card developed Russell Deal Innovative Resources
They based upon original photograph inspire exploration importance purpose belonging everyday life
One important regularly unspoken question career counselling session point
As Amundson point client often seek career counselling feel stuck
This sense going nowhere sometimes result obvious barrier frequently reason diffuse connected lack sense purpose failure appreciate personally meaningful matter
Sometimes people seek counselling assistance finding outlet purpose
Signposts card resource support counsellor client bringing forefront addressing issue relating meaning mattering
In card provide valuable tool effective career conversation topic go heart idea fulfilling career
Not client ready consider weighty matter indeed sometimes client may present suspicious whole counselling process reluctant cooperate nature somewhat withdrawn
In case lack cooperation arise perceived power imbalance instance authority figure like Manager Teacher older counsellor working le senior client younger person
Similarly client attend voluntarily present meet requirement perhaps behest someone else like partner parent enough hesitant untrusting early part counselling
Signpost card useful device provide immediate shared context counsellor client move focus attention away interaction card
The extensive use visual metaphor reduces pressure client respond verbally extensively provides alternative ready made language articulate feeling
In way Signpost card provided valuable flexible resource begin foster meaningful career conversation
The Chaos Theory Careers Pryor Bright Bright Pryor explicitly incorporates spirituality career decision making
Bright Pryor Wilkenfeld Earl reported young Australians commonly offered spiritual reason career decision making behaviour
Savickas argues role Career Counsellor foster client spirit
By emphasising complexity influence career well inherent uncertainty action Chaos Theory Careers provides natural inclusive home rational spiritual career planning
Chaos theory know indeed know control never control confronting dauntingly complex reality instead intimidated awestruck humbled Pryor Bright b
Chaos theory view reality term complex dynamical system number distinctive characteristic result complex dynamical systemic
Complexity recognition reality comprehended totality despite challenge investigation pose Lewin
The complex chaotic system likely random unplanned unpredicted event begin appear course functioning system
The unpredictability weather classic illustrative case
The dynamical nature chaotic system consequence complex system sensitivity change quite disproportionate alteration initial condition
This popularly known butterfly effect line recent movie title change one thing change everything
More serious contemporary example impact terrorist may whole continent computer virus Internet potential bring literally million computer worldwide perhaps one gifted maladjusted hacker
Up point chaos theory may appear chaos disorder fact also order Kellert
The systemic component chaos theory emphasis interconnectedness element functioning system begin display characteristic pattern order
Chaos theory recognises order emergent often synergistic property system functioning Morowitz
The leaf particular specie gum tree produce recognisably similar configuration leaf
Order consequence boundedness functioning system
This known mathematical system theory attractor
Chaos theory introduces idea strange attractor essentially patterning system repeat way always predicted Kellert
That mean complex dynamical system
But Theory Everything intersect career development theory practice consequent implication
The accepted wisdom among psychologist used two domain human experience much overlap psychology may contribute understanding religious behaviour spirituality really nothing tell hardnosed empiricist conceptually confined theoretician
In career development field unless discussing career clergy spirituality simply neglected purposely omitted consideration
The resurgence interest spirituality general community becoming increasingly reflected career development literature
Counselling strategy assessment technique abound deal spiritual concept purpose meaning balance harmony passion mission commitment contribution integrity Anderson Bloch Bolles Johnston
Chaos theory stress pattern emergent order characteristic functioning complex dynamical system
The pattern fractal person life career development function individual strange attractor
The strange attractor understood term really matter someone ultimate concern paradigm perceiving understanding acting world
Thus chaos theory draw distinction scientific spiritual
They element functioning complex dynamical system call human existence Morowitz

The Signpost card provide interactive natural way address spiritual issue career
The card designed provide simple set prompt help u reflect talk search meaning significance
As Deal Masman point rule using card imagination limiting factor
Here though suggestion using context vocational counselling
In case card used group individual counselling teaching scenario
Introduce card client group brief background These set card contain statement different aspect life value important many people
What I interested today statement card see relevant past future career
Remember wrong right answer required think statement card consider relates important
Here exercise consider Shuffle card front client convey pattern way card displayed
Lay card x grid
Now ask client look card select least jump saying something work value career
Ask client place card front collect card distract client
Now ask client consider selected card turn ask selected card
Some question prompt include Why select card
Can tell story relates card
How incorporate statement card career career plan next job life
Can see pattern across card chosen
What pattern relate career
Take pack card shuffle
Now deal two card top deck
Ask client select one card
After selection ask chose card relates career statement might useful future career
Repeat process next card Spread card table ask client write story reflects person career unfolded using card reflect aspect career
They make explicit reference card chose relate career
Optional Ask client essential plot Pryor Bright applies Rags rich Overcoming monster Voyage Return The Quest Tragedy Comedy Rebirth
Then ask client story within another plot
Ask client repeat Cards mean something exercise occasion eye significant person card would decide mattered client
Rapidly present one card time client ask whether like card like card
Then place card one two pile like dislike
Alternatively get client counsellor one way maintain rapid pace
Once sorted two pile take like pile normally lot larger dislike pile spread liked card large table seen clearly
Now tell client minute select top favourite set
Make point timing watch stop watch mobile phone timer
Most client feel little challenged exercise impose strict time limit
The idea encourage client make hunch instinctive selection without overthinking choice
You may find client stubbornly refuse choose may pick couple
This fine
The main aim reduce number choice workable number
Once chosen ask client chosen particular card
Typically client spontaneously commence explaining choice may need prompting
If appropriate write commentary
If client spontaneously offered explanation link choice together next ask client see common theme emerging selection
Client A sent see appeared reluctant withdrawn
She late teen parent concerned disconnection education work
She left school prematurely worked series labouring role appeared well potential satisfy
Having initially tried engage conversation past evident forthcoming maintained guarded defensive attitude
At stage I introduced card saying Ok I like look pick like
I deliberately underplayed exercise attempt avoid provoking suspicion withdrawal
As sorted card I observed approached task
It apparent quite engaged card particular made emphatic gesture pushing away card like
From general demeanour I formed hypothesis fairly sure like perhaps tentative unsure deciding like
I say hypothesis stage counselling session I want explore tentatively construct understanding client
I try stay open possible often form several hypothesis sometimes many prove wrong
As continued exercise began spontaneously provide commentary decision
Once negative choice likely accompany commentary
Interestingly perhaps half choice explained based upon response imagery card rather written sentiment
Furthermore response often related aesthetic card layout colour scheme juxtaposition rather meaning conveyed imagery
Once completed task I asked choice decided start rejected seemed comfortable talking negative
This confirmed operating heightened aesthetic sensitivity often described response term emotional response visual imagery
This turn lead discussion Art transpired spontaneously enrolled Arts night school course withdrawn parent criticised choice impractical
From point began open told story dominant parent strongly encouraged study subject would lead working Personal Assistant role Mother occupied many year
However interest area interested Arts school done well subject school parent encouraged drop
It time interest school began wane began feel alienated parent friend understand
Despite apparent interest made link interest career
Indeed rather preoccupied sense rejection alienation closest given much thought career choice may play role resolving conflict providing viable outlet passion
From point counselling session transformed opened became trusting could express interest area without fear criticism introduction discussion practicality term apparently used often parent
This turn lead development plan idea finding way pursuing interest sort course might enrol
As process continued developed sufficient confidence explain situation parent found surprisingly supportive agreeable
Once appreciated interest soundly based genuine new perspective view apparently antagonistic behaviour

That Herculean task want undertake
Being Computer Engineering graduate almost eligible everything
And place might even face slightly lesser competition GATE lesser burden due better placement
This applies IT grad many govt club together
So help I try list various option Various bank like SBI recruit people background position
With advent digital focus apps SBI Buddy UPI increased
Although I seen wo get develop apps per se
Often developed various vendor like TCS TechM Accenture etc
But IT officer one charge position Team Lead sort Business Analyst overlook multiple application
The recruitment done basis vacancy
But expect yearly recruitment
It might pay well almost everything reimbursed
The exam often happen around second half year
This tricky
Many PSUs based traditional engineering stream like Mechanical Civil Chemical
CS IT vacancy fewer number
But even like IOC ONGC BSNL recruit GATE
BARC recruit GATE well exam conduct around March
I think DRDO follows similar approach
Clearing exam one step round interview
You take good score open gate major institute country
Keep mind solely performing well GATE enough
You go additional screening done respective institute
IISC IITs rest shortlist student basis screening
In round coding test interview
So preparing make sure holistic approach
There coaching class well online lecture
I prepare GATE I take help YouTube video semester exam
I found helpful Comps student
But I ca say good GATE
Ok humongous sea option
As fresher wo much trouble IIMs clear clear ile general category student disability
As per admission criterion released IIMs year highest weightage term year experience year IIMC
But two year treated year
Being engineering background face stiff competition engineer
Institutes like XLRI XAT Symbiosis SNAP IIFTs Narsee Monjee NMAT examination
XLRI value work experience
Institutes like Jamnalal Bajaj SP Jain take basis exam FMS relies CAT
ISB Hyderabad entertain fresher
You need year experience
And give
There early bird option though
You give GMAT secure seat
Then deferred admission gaining relevant experience
GMAT helpful securing admission foreign university
Return Investment ROI matter lot
Because many MBA institute top great placement
The fee high
So make sure careful choosing college
Depending upon choice country selection criterion varies
But country happens US majority US university accept GRE score well TOEFL score English proficiency required
Please mindful finance involved
Taking GRE cost around varying per dollar rupee conversion
There European university might require either GRE TOEFL
They consider academic record selecting
TOEFL alternative like IELTS
But yes careful regarding ROI
This altogether different ball game
For Civil Services need persistent preparation least year
There multiple round
There preliminary round come main obviously interview
Rankings declared based cumulative score main interview
In Civil Services various branch beaurocracy like Indian Foreign Services Indian Administrative Services Indian Police Services Indian Railway Services
A graduate degree necessary
Although mandatory optional subject one graduated
IFS age limit year IAS year
You check UPSC website clarity eligibility service
There coaching class well online lecture video
You find expert Quora doubt
I think college placement book like useful
If sufficient programming knowledge start move
As mentioned detail preference govt job I highly recommend follow main focus
Civil Services bank job Intelligence Agent recruitment GATE even CAT covered
Since want attempt everything sun keep mind path give different outcome
If want prestige working country opt Civil Services

From September every undergraduate course one year duration Key Information Set KIS
The KIS allows compare piece information individual course different higher education institution
However please note superficially similar course often different structure objective teaching support learning environment best suit determined identifying interest need expectation goal comparing detailed information
We recommend look thoroughly course University information contained webpage consider coming visit u Open Day rather relying solely statistical comparison
You may find following note helpful considering information presented KIS
The KIS relies superficially similar course coded way
Whilst work one level lead anomaly
For example Music course Music Technology course exactly code despite different programme quite distinct educational career outcome
Any course combine several discipline many course Cambridge tends compared nationally course one discipline case KIS comparison may accurate fair reflection reality either
For example may find considering degree embrace range discipline biology physic chemistry geology instance Natural Sciences Cambridge comparison provided course institution primarily focus one smaller combination subject
The list exhaustive may important factor relevant choice making hope useful starting point help delve deeper face value KIS data

In mechanism enforcing limit access resource environment many
A lock designed enforce policy
Generally lock thread cooperates acquiring lock accessing corresponding data
Some system also implement attempting unauthorized access locked resource force entity attempting make access
The simplest type lock binary
It provides exclusive access locked data
Other scheme also provide shared access reading data
Other widely implemented access mode exclusive
Another way classify lock happens prevents progress thread
Most locking design requesting lock allowed access locked resource
With thread simply wait spin lock becomes available
This efficient thread blocked short time avoids overhead operating system process
It inefficient lock held long time progress thread holding lock depends preemption locked thread
Locks typically require hardware support efficient implementation
This support usually take form one instruction
These instruction allow single process test lock free free acquire lock single atomic operation
architecture option using special instruction instruction prefix disable interrupt technique work machine
Proper support lock multiprocessor environment require quite complex hardware software support substantial issue
The reason required concurrency one task executes logic
For example consider following code The example guarantee task lock since one task testing lock time
Since task detect lock free task attempt set lock knowing task also setting lock
possible substitute atomic locking operation available
Careless use lock result
A number strategy used avoid recover deadlock livelocks
The common strategy standardize lock acquisition sequence combination lock always acquired specifically defined cascade order
Some language support lock syntactically
An example follows The code lead problem instance accessed publicly
Similar C also synchronize entire method using attribute
Before introduced lock granularity one need understand three concept lock There tradeoff decreasing lock overhead decreasing lock contention choosing number lock synchronization
An important property lock
The granularity measure amount data lock protecting
In general choosing coarse granularity small number lock protecting large segment data result le single process accessing protected data worse performance multiple process running concurrently
This increased
The coarse lock higher likelihood lock stop unrelated process proceeding
Conversely using fine granularity larger number lock protecting fairly small amount data increase overhead lock reduces lock contention
Granular locking process must hold multiple lock common set lock create subtle lock dependency
This subtlety increase chance programmer unknowingly introduce
In example lock could protect order increasing granularity part field field record data page entire table
Coarse granularity using table lock tends give best performance single user whereas fine granularity record lock tends give best performance multiple user
used mean ensuring transaction synchronicity

making transaction processing concurrent interleaving transaction using ensures concurrent execution transaction turn equivalent serial ordering transaction
However deadlock become unfortunate locking database
Deadlocks either prevented locking order transaction detected using
An alternate locking database synchronicity avoiding deadlock involves use totally ordered global timestamps
There mechanism employed manage action multiple purpose prevent lost update dirty read
The two type locking resource protection synchronization many disadvantage Some strategy avoid problem
For example avoid biggest problem deadlock
Alternatives locking include method like programming technique
However alternative method often require actual lock mechanism implemented fundamental level operating software
Therefore may relieve level detail implementing lock problem listed still needing dealt beneath application
In case proper locking depends CPU providing method atomic instruction stream synchronization example addition deletion item pipeline requires contemporaneous operation needing add delete item pipe suspended manipulation memory content required add delete specific item
Therefore application often robust recognizes burden place upon operating system capable graciously recognizing reporting impossible demand
One programming biggest problem lock hard combine small correct module equally correct larger program without modifying module least knowing internals
advocate give following example banking application design class allows multiple concurrent client deposit withdraw money account give algorithm transfer money one account another
The solution first part problem The second part problem much complicated
A routine correct would In concurrent program algorithm incorrect one thread halfway another might observe state withdrawn first account yet deposited account money gone missing system
This problem fixed completely taking lock account prior changing two account lock taken according arbitrary global ordering prevent deadlock This solution get complicated lock involved function need know lock
Programming language vary support synchronization

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Suppose I application two thread use resource
Normally synchronized block keep thread messing resource way user expect
I understand I need explanation done especially following part
How come acquiring lock never result race condition
For Example Let thread synchronized object obj
How prevented
Almost every modern processor special memory instruction built specifically deal problem
For example many processor instruction
This swap value local variable thread global variable shared thread
Under cover local variable stored machine register global variable stored memory
Suppose lock stored global variable value mean unlocked value mean locked
Then critical section It also possible solve locking problem even machine atomic instruction instruction little bit complicated
One well known way using something called
This requires variable used indicate thread trying acquire lock used indicate thread B trying acquire lock used indicate priority trying acquire lock
Even though race place algorithm accounting possibility
If one thread want get critical section thread variable false variable even get checked
But thread try acquire critical section simultaneously whichever one set variable lose

In computer system issue performance degradation due idle wait time spent
Software lockout major cause degradation multiprocessor system posing limit maximum useful number processor
To mitigate phenomenon kernel must designed short possible therefore decomposing smaller substructure
In multiprocessor system processor schedule control therefore supervisor processor kernel globally shared section code access shared data structure
This design choice made improve scaling reliability modularity
Examples kernel data structure
A conflict happens one trying access resource memory portion time
To prevent one processor given time allowed access particular memory portion CPUs trying access time waiting idle status
Three case distinguished idle wait either necessary convenient convenient
The idle wait necessary access ready list low level operation
The idle wait necessary convenient case critical section operation require le time executing another avoid idle wait
Idle wait instead convenient case kernel critical section present
A instead fall first two case
In multiprocessor system conflict conflict due access kernel level critical section thus idle wait period generated major impact performance degradation
This idle wait time increase average number idle processor thus decrease
Taking parameter average time interval spent kernel level critical section time locked state average time interval spent processor task outside critical section ratio crucial evaluating software lockout
Typical value range
In system ratio instance CPUs expected average CPU always idle CPUs idle CPUs idle CPUs idle
Therefore adding CPUs system would useless
In general value threshold maximum number useful CPUs
To reduce performance degradation software lockout reasonable level kernel operating system must designed accordingly
Conceptually valid solution decompose kernel data structure smaller independent substructure shorter elaboration time
This allows one CPU access original data structure
Many system estimated spend time performing supervisor mode operation
If system adapted setting lock access supervisor state would easily greater resulting system bandwidth uniprocessor despite number CPUs

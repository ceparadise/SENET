User interface design basically way designing user interact different device machine
An effective software interface improve user productivity satisfaction reduce error
But designing often difficult
Good user interface design facilitates finishing task hand without paying unnecessary attention
ABSTRACT As know TheÂ designÂ user interface affect amount effort user must expend provide input system take output system much effort take gain task
Under use term Â UsabilityÂ degree design particular user interface take account humanÂ physiologyÂ user make process using system effective efficient satisfying
It also includes total user experience may include aesthetic appearance device response time content presented user within context user interface
It includes many principle type element different significance
THEORY USER INTERFACE A term refers way program present user look like screen command put user disposal level user communicate program
It may also defined aspect computer system perceived user often displayed screen also User Interface way product designed interact user term text menu checkboxes clickable image etc
It determines command given computer theÂ programÂ howÂ informationÂ displayed screen
For example famous apple iphone touchscreen interface interact phone touching finger
USER INTERFACE DESIGN As already told interact computer machine use input device mouse keyboard touch screen remote control joy stick game controller data glove etc
make better interface design
User interface design also known Interaction HCI
Military aircraft vehicle airport audio equipment computer peripheral product extensively apply User Interface
According Gillian Crampton Smith director Ivrea Interaction Design Institute Italy Â Information technology computer network transforming practically aspect world live
User interface design determines quality experience use system therefore determines value User interface designÂ always aim enhance visual usability technological quality interface
It add satisfaction user using particular product service
A best interface following quality usefulness learnability efficiency ease memorization reliability SIGNIFICANCE OF THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN Even intuitive user interface easier use easier use le expensive use
Nowadays Increasing number website developing creative user interface design taking advantage user increasing level faster connection
These new interface often allow user view manipulate huge quantity data
graphical user interface allows user remain user free learning complex command language
A good user interface design tell difference acceptance software failure market
FOUR TYPES OF USER INTERFACE On contemporary computational environment four kind ofÂ integrated environment Â use
These The shell orÂ command line interface asÂ sh Â orÂ bash
The shell integrator run program l grep piped
It technique interacting computerÂ operating systemÂ Â typing command perform specific task
This interface contrast use aÂ mouse pointerÂ aÂ graphical user interfaceÂ GUI click option menu select option
This method instructing computer referred entering command
Here system wait user conclude submitting text command pressing Enter key
AÂ interpreterÂ receives Â analysis executes requested command
CLIs often used programmer system administrator engineering scientific environment technically advanced personal computer user
Programming language like Â BASIC Â Python Â LISP Â Forth Â TclÂ also provide interactive command line particular task
TheÂ virtual Lisp machine Emacs Emacs integrator pulling together many library including editor
EmacsÂ group ofÂ text editor usually characterized extensibility
Emacs command allows user combine command intoÂ macrosÂ automate work
Emacs provides command manipulateÂ Â paragraphsÂ deleting moving forth Â syntax highlightingÂ makingÂ source codeÂ easier study
Emacs used anÂ Integrated Development EnvironmentÂ IDE furthur allows programmer edit Â compile andÂ debugÂ code within single interface
TheÂ graphic user interface Gnome KDE It aÂ programÂ interfaceÂ take useofÂ computer sÂ graphicsÂ capability make program easier use also allows user toÂ interact program way typingÂ asÂ computer Â player portable medium player rather text command
A major advantage GUIs make computer operation intuitive thus easier learn use
GUI easier use requires le experience le training tends look nicer CLI
For eg
GNOME KDE
GNOME aÂ graphical user interface desktop environmentÂ run top computerÂ operating system
It used withÂ operating system mostly Â GNOME project provides two thing
Firstly The GNOME desktop environment intuitive attractive desktop user secondly GNOME development platform extensive framework building application integrate rest screen
Similarly KDEÂ alos Â free softwareÂ give u lot Â application run onÂ different operating system like Linux Â Microsoft Windows Â Solaris It basically provides basicÂ desktopÂ function application daily need well tool documentation developer write application system
TheÂ auditory interface Emacspeak Emacspeak truly different previous three type interface even though built Emacs
Â Its approach separate computation user interface integrates speech interaction
The Auditory User Interface work directly computational core application GUI
USER INTERFACE DESIGN PRINCIPLES The structure principle The structure principle concerned overall user interface strucuture
How design look differentiating different thing also integrating similar
The simplicity principle In design make simple common task simple simply user language
The visibility principle In design keep needed option material given task visible without distracting important information
The feedback principle In take feedback design developed also design keep user informed action interpretation change state condition error
The tolerance principle In design flexible tolerant reducing cost mistake misuse preventing error wherever possible tolerating varied input sequence
The reuse principle Here design reuse internal external component behavior maintaining consistency purpose thus reduce need user rethink remember
ADVANTAGES Good UIs critical success UI programming easy straightforward rational
They user friendly also increase user speed
graphical user interface free user learning complex command language
On hand many user find work effectively interface especially already know command language
Command Line Interface requires le memory disk space processor video capacity
Even GUI generally easier
It look professional also
DISADVANTAGES When properly built difficult work generally requires memory resource graphical one
Also It might require installation additional software eg
run time environment case java
And depending programmer might require time implemented
FUTURE SCOPES The user interfacesÂ crucial good user experience
It matter good technology technology hardly reach breakthrough
To gain interest new product technology user need understand advantage find impressed involved

The field space interaction human machine occur
The goal interaction allow effective operation control machine human end whilst machine simultaneously feed back information aid operator process
Examples broad concept user interface include interactive aspect computer hand operator control control
The design consideration applicable creating user interface related involve discipline
Generally goal produce user interface make easy efficient enjoyable operate machine way produce desired result
This generally mean operator need provide minimal input achieve desired output also machine minimizes undesired output human
With increased use relative decline societal awareness heavy machinery term user interface generally assumed mean industrial control panel machinery control design discussion commonly refer interface
Other term user interface machine question computer
The user interface part machine handle interaction
Membrane switch rubber keypad touchscreen example physical part Human Machine Interface see touch
In complex system interface typically computerized
The term refers kind system
In context computing term typically extends well software dedicated control physical element used
The engineering interface enhanced considering
The corresponding discipline HFE UE part
Tools used incorporating human factor interface design developed based knowledge
Nowadays use expression interface computer nearly using graphic
There difference user interface operator interface interface HMI
In HMI sometimes used refer better described
However latter usage seeing increasing application use medical artificial extension replaces missing body part
In circumstance computer might observe user react according action without specific command
A mean tracking part body required sensor noting position head direction gaze used experimentally
This particularly relevant
The history user interface divided following phase according dominant type user interface In batch era computing power extremely scarce expensive
User interface rudimentary
Users accommodate computer rather way around user interface considered overhead software designed keep processor maximum utilization little overhead possible
The input side user interface batch machine mainly equivalent medium like
The output side added medium
With limited exception system human being interact batch machine real time
Submitting job batch machine involved first preparing deck punched card describing program dataset
Punching program card done computer specialized machine notoriously bulky unforgiving prone mechanical failure
The software interface similarly unforgiving strict syntax meant parsed smallest possible compiler interpreter
Once card punched one would drop job queue wait
Eventually
operator would feed deck computer perhaps mounting supply another dataset helper software
The job would generate printout containing final result often abort notice attached error log
Successful run might also write result magnetic tape generate data card used later computation
The single job often spanned entire day
If one lucky might hour response unheard
But worse fate card queue computer actually required even tedious process toggling program binary code using console switch
The earliest machine actually partly rewired incorporate program logic using device known
Early batch system gave currently running job entire computer program deck tape include would think code talk device whatever housekeeping needed
Midway batch period various group began experiment system
These used always resident computer
Programs could call monitor service
Another function monitor better error checking submitted job catching error earlier intelligently generating useful feedback user
Thus monitor represented first step towards operating system explicitly designed user interface
CLIs evolved batch monitor connected system console
Their interaction model series transaction request expressed textual command specialized vocabulary
Latency far lower batch system dropping day hour second
Accordingly system allowed user change mind later stage transaction response feedback earlier result
Software could exploratory interactive way possible
But interface still placed relatively heavy mnemonic load user requiring serious investment effort learning time master
The earliest system combined computer adapting mature technology proven effective mediating transfer information wire human being
Teleprinters originally invented device automatic telegraph transmission reception history going back already become newsroom elsewhere
In reusing economy certainly consideration psychology mattered well teleprinter provided point interface system familiar many engineer user
The widespread adoption terminal VDTs ushered second phase system
These cut latency character could thrown phosphor dot screen quickly printer head carriage move
They helped quell conservative resistance interactive programming cutting ink paper consumables cost picture first TV generation late even iconic comfortable teleprinter computer pioneer
Just importantly existence accessible screen display text could rapidly reversibly modified made economical software designer deploy interface could described visual rather textual
The pioneering application kind computer game text editor close descendant earliest specimen still live part tradition
In beginning IBM created called SAA standard include CUA derivative
CUA successfully created know use today Windows recent DOS Windows Console Applications use standard well
This defined pulldown menu system top screen status bar bottom shortcut key stay common functionality Open example would work application followed SAA standard
This greatly helped speed user could learn application caught quick became industry standard
Primary method used interface design include prototyping simulation
Typical interface design consists following stage interaction specification interface software specification prototyping All great interface share eight quality characteristic The POLA general principle design kind interface
It based idea human being pay full attention one thing one time leading conclusion novelty minimized
If interface used persistently user unavoidably develop using interface
The designer role thus characterized ensuring user form good habit
If designer experienced interface similarly develop habit often make unconscious assumption regarding user interact interface

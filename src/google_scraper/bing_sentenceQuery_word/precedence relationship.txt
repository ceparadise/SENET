By Part process building project schedule involves breaking work smaller activity Work Breakdown Structure sequencing activity
When sequence activity make sure every activity related least one activity
In many case relationship involve two activity
There couple way represent relationship
Perhaps common technique called Precedence Diagramming Method PDM
This technique sometimes called Activity Node AON
In PDM technique activity placed box box connected arrow show precedence relationship
The common precedence relationship one activity start another activity finished
In schedule relationship exists almost case
This referred relationship
However three way one activity related another one
All four described
First let assume two activity A B
It matter exact activity
It matter relationship
There four possible relationship
This mean Activity B start Activity A completed
This far common relationship multiple activity
In schedule relationship
Example mean Activity A must start Activity B finish
This rare relationship
Example Let assume want fertilize garden plant must wet fertilizer applied
This mean Activity A must start Activity B start
Example Assume wall painted one room wallpaper hung another room
You want minimize total disruption want make sure activity happen time
This mean Activity A must finish Activity B finish
Example Assume cooking dinner want turkey finish cooking potato

Precedence C rule specifies order certain operation need performed expression
For given expression containing two operator determines operation calculated first
While evaluation expression performed human start left work toward right C expression evaluated operator precedence
Precedence help describe expression contains different kind operator without parenthesis expression parenthesis applying predefined rule set C Language Specification CLS
A C expression sequence one operand combined using operator also contain literal value method invocation variable etc
This type expression evaluated single value object method
Precedence play vital role determining order expression evaluated
The precedence C operator similar used algebraic formula
The list category C operator order precedence includes For example expression evaluated first quotient subtracted division higher precedence subtraction
By using parenthesis expression need evaluated first precedence overridden

In sphere project management term precedence relationship follows fairly typical pattern viewing came first determine come next
Specifically speaking project management team project management team leader begin process developing ultimate design utilized course project term precedence relationship exactly project management team project management team leader us represent term
There however slightly altered usage current project management terminology
In current usage multiple term logical relationship precedence relationship used extremely interchangeable manner often time particular diagramming method utilized deciding factor deciding use

According Project Management Institute PDM technique used constructing schedule activity represented node linked one logical relationship show sequence activity performed
This also known activity node diagram
The input go scheduling include scope deliverable
A project manager gather team schedule planning meeting
During meeting project manager review scope deliverable date importance
The project management team list activity needed complete project
The project manager project management team also list activity milestone
item significance project
A milestone could first prototype rolling assembly line inspection tied funding framing inspection tied loan draw building house
There four common type dependency precedence diagram method
The first common dependency called
This one activity start another finish
The next common dependency known activity start another activity start
The third common dependency named completion activity depends another activity finishing
The final common dependency type called one activity finish another activity start
Each dependency mandatory discretionary external internal
In addition depending type dependency lead lag may needed help schedule activity
A lead example finish start dependency would allow activity start day prior activity completing
A lag example start start hand would starting activity day predecessor start
The include variety activity represented pictorially node
Each node Get FREE access day create account
Here example node diagram key includes acronym example node precedence diagram method Once project manager project management team compiled list activity milestone begin sequence activity add duration activity
The duration realistic achievable
If duration achievable thing may happen
The project manager reporting bogus information project budget customer dissatisfied
So trying fix project gotten control first item need review schedule determining realistic
You want use precedence diagram method help sort schedule schedule correct start look budget execution
As see achievable realistic schedule really critical
So project manager realistic list activity duration begin sequence activity pictorial
This help determine project management team missed item
As project manager build node node linked based type dependency relationship activity fall sequencing seen example The PDM important project manager pictorial representation project schedule
The PDM representation allow project manager communicate activity duration relationship allow work issue management reviewer
The precedence diagram method also allows project manager project management team determine missed activity duration skewed
In lesson learned pictorial representation project activity node linked logical relationship
You also learned precedence diagram method especially important project manager help determine activity missed duration realistic
The project manager also us precedence diagram method communicate schedule project review

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I basic question I find answer anywhere Web
I following grammar rule The part interested rule
I calculated First O Last O
So First C Last C
Also First C Last C I build precedence table I want parse input So parse I first top stack
Then I look I push top stack
So I compare higher precedence according rule I must pop
The last part trivial lead thus accepting sentence
clearly see rule sentence accepted enough form order reduce
I noticed happens symmetrical rule rule case mean verify indeed
What solution problem
How handle special case symmetrical precedence relation overlap
sure must one grammar conceptually close programming language parsing problem
Thank time
It symmetry rule problem whatever mean symmetry
The problem le inherent operator precedence algorithm
parsing dropped Dragon book first second edition presumably author longer believed useful parsing technique Note
So I quoting first edition I still bookshelf odd sentimental reason Note
And say As general parsing technique number since relationship grammar language parsed parser tenuous one always sure parser accepts exactly desired language
And case
grammar tend accept superset desired language need augment number check ensure invalid sentence like one threw parser actually get recognized
The classic construction one I think referring use First Last two problem one inherent parsing mostly avoided
The first problem look grammar
That essence parsing technique much done
The problem First Last even distinguish presence absence
For reason First O confused LL algorithm function includes First C includes
In case terminal would LL FIRST set appear exactly beginning side rather immediately following beginning
Given First function ca distinguish terminal follow terminal start production hardly surprising parser really care whether argument
Regardless whether expression grammar simply see
And consequently complain two token consecutive
Now parser us precedence relation find handle
Once parser find grammar rule handle side throw error
But I rarely seen description parsing actually
Instead simplifying assumption made figure rule reduce looking last terminal stack input correct Note
It actually pretty easy extend get around problem
The basic idea divide relation two class apply adjacent terminal apply terminal separated
Since grammar operator grammar two possibility
I refer relation number refers number intervening
To compute relation start compute two group First Last set using subscript notation
So N set terminal start side N N set terminal immediately follow immediately start two set necessarily disjoint example case operator like either prefix infix union classic First N set
More precisely using standard convention letter b c represent terminal letter A B C represent P Q represent production greek letter represent sequence grammar symbol either terminal define N N N N B N N N N Correspondingly define two precedence relationship
b N B N B b B b N B N B b B b N A N A b A b N A N A b A b N N b b N X N X b For production N A x add A x A x To parse use essentially standard algorithm taking account presence absence
Conceptually store terminal stack
In practice I would keep separate stack use flag terminal indicate whether top one operator grammar
At step compare incoming terminal topmost terminal stack
If actual top stack use relation otherwise use relation
As relation exists two terminal error signalled catch error
Now assist identification production corresponding handle store little bit information stack
When push terminal onto stack either relation previous stacked terminal case starting side relation previous terminal must part side
In either case record prefix appropriate RHS curren point instead terminal
That two advantage
let u distinguish prefix infix operator natural way really let u assign different precedence actually define precedence relation relation RHS location incoming terminal instead terminal incoming terminal thereby allowing bit discrimination
That needed give unary minus tighter binding
Now rush start coding parser generator based idea please Note point way rediscovering LR parsing
I really believe follow algorithm closely gain useful intuition understanding LR parsing
And obvious small step extended parsing LALR parser point might well haul bison let build parser
Note Personally I would dropped I judge It parsing useful LALR construction algorithm known
It problem case point
Any language parseable parsed correctly unambiguously LALR computational complexity
Indeed essentially amount time space
The reason keep hanging around opinion thinking parsing think right way lead key insight lead LR parsing
I like
In practice another classic problem parsing mentioned text I replaced Dragon book quote algorithm described ca distinguish prefix infix us
The usual hack used fix problem use small state machine two state typically sufficient reveal whether operator preceded operand
That also sufficient throw error operator used prefix operator practical parser really problem
A back I described algorithm I sure I first person thought idea several decade clever people thinking parsing algorithm I ever seen described anywhere
As I said I worked I trying grasp mechanic parsing afterwards seemed bit redundant
But anyone passing happens know literature reference I appreciate pointer

Java rule specifying order operator expression evaluated expression several operator
For example multiplication division higher precedence addition subtraction
Precedence rule overridden explicit parenthesis
There explicit operator precedence table Java Language Specification
Different table web textbook disagree minor way

When using conditional operator Java evaluate second operand unless necessary resolve result
This allows statement like work reliably
Programmers rarely use non version expression
respectively
The operator left associative whether string concatenation addition

Project Management When one task must completed another task started first task said precedence
The term used logical relationship
In current usage however precedence relationship logical relationship dependency widely used interchangeably regardless diagramming method use
There four form precedence relationship A network diagramming technique activity represented box node
Activities linked precedence relationship show sequence activity performed
A network diagramming technique activity represented arrow
The tail arrow represents start head represents finish activity length arrow represent expected duration activity
Activities connected point called node usually drawn small circle illustrate sequence activity expected performed Images taken

Advanced degree certification may required academic clinical position

In software engineering domain never need math beyond learned high school algebra
But software engineering one aspect computer science
In system start asking question like Given simplifying assumption fast program run program remotely like
In algorithm asking How fast run machine I today conceivable machine
And theoretical computer science leave concept machine behind entirely
In example making leap thinking particular application run box front much wider set application algorithm box
Making leap requires mathematical tool
Still question

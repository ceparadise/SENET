The principle locality guideline
Way back day people wrote C Assembly Fortan enterprising computer scientist noticed code generally written next instruction next
In word could organize code commonly executed instruction right next previous instruction
This would let use le code mean This also held true data people would write data storage stuff belonged together together
So seeing thing people designed computer system grabbing instruction instead grab instruction
Or instruction matter
When reading storage medium like disk time take grab next thing disk much le grabbing somewhere else wait disk rotate
Often resulted performance boost
So principle locality remains meme organize stuff close together stuff also computer designed optimal operating mode
The principle locality also people

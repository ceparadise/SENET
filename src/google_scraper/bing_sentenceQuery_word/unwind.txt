In store information active
This kind stack also known often shortened stack
Although maintenance call stack important proper functioning detail normally hidden automatic
Many computer provide special instruction manipulating stack
A call stack used several related purpose main reason one keep track point active subroutine return control finish executing
An active subroutine one called yet complete execution control handed back point call
Such activation subroutine may nested level recursive special case hence stack structure
If example subroutine call subroutine four different place must know return execution completes
To accomplish following call pushed onto call stack call
Since call stack organized caller push return address onto stack called subroutine finish return address call stack transfer control address
If called subroutine call yet another subroutine push another return address onto call stack information stacking unstacking program dictate
If pushing consumes space allocated call stack error called occurs generally causing program
Adding subroutine entry call stack sometimes called winding conversely removing entry unwinding
There usually exactly one call stack associated running program accurately although additional stack may created handling
Since one important context referred stack implicitly task however accessed explicitly call stack commonly referred stack see
In specific call stack usually hidden programmer
They given access set function memory stack
This example
Most hand require programmer involved manipulating stack
The actual detail stack depend upon available
As noted primary purpose call stack
When subroutine called location address instruction calling routine later resume need saved somewhere
Using stack save return address important advantage alternative
One task stack thus subroutine active simultaneously different task different thing
Another benefit automatically supported
When function call recursively return address need stored activation function later used return function activation
Stack structure provide capability automatically
Depending language machine environment call stack may serve additional purpose including example The typical call stack used return address local parameter known
In environment may fewer function assigned call stack
In example ordinarily return address counted loop parameter index possibly local variable stored call stack environment named although data temporarily placed using special handling code long need call return respected parameter ordinarily stored separate typically called stack Forth terminology even though call stack since usually accessed explicitly
Some Forths also third stack parameter
A composed also called
These data structure containing subroutine state information
This data sometimes referred CFI Call Frame Information
Each stack frame corresponds call subroutine yet terminated return
For example subroutine named currently running called subroutine top part call stack might laid like picture right
A diagram like drawn either direction long placement top direction stack growth understood
Furthermore independently architecture differ whether call stack grow towards higher address towards lower address
The logic diagram independent addressing choice
The stack frame top stack currently executing routine
The stack frame usually includes least following item push order When stack frame size differ different function invocation particular function popping frame stack constitute fixed decrement
At function return stack pointer instead restored value stack pointer function called
Each stack frame contains stack pointer top frame immediately
The stack pointer mutable register shared invocation
A frame pointer given invocation function copy stack pointer function invoked
The location field frame defined relative either top frame negative offset stack pointer relative top frame positive offset frame pointer
The location frame pointer must inherently defined negative offset stack pointer
In system stack frame field contain previous value frame pointer register value caller executing
For example stack frame would memory location holding frame pointer value us shown diagram
The value saved upon entry subroutine restored upon return
Having field known location stack frame enables code access frame successively underneath currently executing routine frame also allows routine easily restore frame pointer frame return
Programming language support also field call frame point stack frame activation procedure closely encapsulates callee
immediate callee
This called keep track static nesting dynamic recursive call provides routine well routine may invoke access local data encapsulating routine every nesting level
Some architecture compiler optimization case store one link enclosing level immediately enclosing deeply nested routine access shallow data traverse several link strategy often called display
Access link optimized away inner function access local data encapsulation case pure function communicating via argument return value example
Some historical computer special display register support nested function compiler modern machine ubiquitous simply reserve word stack pointer needed
For purpose stack frame subroutine caller considered overlap overlap consisting area parameter passed caller callee
In environment caller push argument onto stack thus extending stack frame invokes callee
In environment caller preallocated area top stack frame hold argument supply subroutine call
This area sometimes termed
Under approach size area calculated compiler largest needed called subroutine
Usually call stack manipulation needed site call subroutine minimal good since many call site subroutine called
The value actual argument evaluated call site since specific particular call either pushed onto stack placed register determined used
The actual call instruction branch link typically executed transfer control code target subroutine
In called subroutine first code executed usually termed since necessary housekeeping code statement routine begun
The prologue commonly save return address left register call instruction pushing value onto call stack
Similarly current stack pointer frame pointer value may pushed
Alternatively instruction set architecture automatically provide comparable functionality part action call instruction environment prologue need
If frame pointer used prologue typically set new value frame pointer register stack pointer
Space stack local variable allocated incrementally changing stack pointer
The allows explicit winding call stack called return stack
When subroutine ready return executes epilogue undoes step prologue
This typically restore saved register value frame pointer value stack frame pop entire stack frame stack changing stack pointer value finally branch instruction return address
Under many calling convention item popped stack epilogue include original argument value case usually stack manipulation need done caller
With calling convention however caller responsibility remove argument stack return
Returning called function pop top frame stack perhaps leaving return value
The general act popping one frame stack resume execution elsewhere program called must performed control structure used used
In case stack frame function contains one entry specifying exception handler
When exception thrown stack unwound handler found prepared handle catch type thrown exception
Some language control structure require general unwinding
allows global statement transfer control nested function previously invoked outer function
This operation requires stack unwound removing many stack frame necessary restore proper context transfer control target statement within enclosing outer function
Similarly C function act gotos
allows control happens stack unwound using special operator
When applying stack logically unwound rewound stack continuation
This way implement continuation example using multiple explicit stack application continuation simply activate stack wind value passed
The allows arbitrary executed specified point unwinding rewinding control stack continuation invoked
The call stack sometimes inspected program running
Depending program written compiled information stack used determine intermediate value function call trace
This used generate automated test case like Ruby Smalltalk implement continuation
As example GDB implement interactive inspection call stack running paused C program
Taking sample call stack useful profiling performance program subroutine pointer appears call stack sampling data many time likely code bottleneck inspected performance problem
In language free pointer array writes C mixing control flow data affect execution code return address saved frame pointer simple program data parameter return value call stack security risk possibly common type
One attack involves filling one buffer arbitrary executable code overflowing buffer overwrite return address value point directly executable code
As result function return computer executes code
This kind attack easily blocked
Similar attack succeed even protection enabled including attack coming
Various mitigation proposed storing array completely separate location return stack case Forth programming language

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

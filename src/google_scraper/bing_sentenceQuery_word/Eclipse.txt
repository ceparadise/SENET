No one know exactly total look like actually happens Monday
But stopped computer scientist guessing
Nearly anyone US see moon partially block sun Monday
However lucky enough see moon completely
last two minute August time onlooker view darkest shadow moon also sun corona dim outer atmosphere solar particle normally invisible day
The corona somewhat unpredictable though since sun giant dynamic ball plasma
The star constantly feeding corona particle changing appearance
To figure corona look scientific research company called Predictive Science enlisted help three supercomputer simulate visual forecast totality
This final prediction solar corona August total solar eclipse Predictive Science wrote Thursday
The simulation take currently known sun magnetic field output particle rotation rate use mathematical model push fast forward button according posted University Texas Austin
That university helped power imagery supercomputer addition San Diego Supercomputer Center Comet NASA Pleiades

More year darken sky astronomer ancient Greece developed supercomputer predict eclipse like one
The called used identify astronomical event could anchor calendar
Sponge diver discovered mysterious gearbox took shelter nearby storm island Antikythera
The diver unearthed ancient shipwreck archaeological investigation revealed Antikythera shipwreck likely sank year ago way Rome Asia Minor Live Science previously reported
When explorer looked wreckage found contraption covered dial filled gear made bronze
Though mysterious object fragmented dozen piece archaeologist soon figured enigmatic object used The gearbox would allowed ancient Greek astronomer figure position sun moon star given time future
Though mysterious astronomical calculator year sea corroded scientist used imaging reveal text box provides instruction use according study published
Before could make isolated word lot noise letter misread gap text Alexander Jones professor history science New York University
Now something actually read ancient Greek
We tell text saying ancient observer
For instance new information reveals zodiac chart front gearbox showing planet moving different constellation study found
In scientist reported deciphered dial algorithm used predict eclipse
It turned spiral revealed eclipse using specific glyph denote time type eclipse
Lunar eclipse instance denoted glyph Σ short moon goddess ΕΛΗΝΗ Selene denoted H short sun god ΗΛΙΟΣ Helios
The English word eclipse come Greek word ekleipsis meaning abandonment ancient believed sun literally abandoning Earth time
What Greek computer surprisingly sophisticated
The Antikythera mechanism could predict timing eclipse also reveal characteristic eclipse amount obscuration angular diameter moon angle covered diameter full moon position moon time eclipse study found
Though full meaning eclipse event Greek culture entirely clear evident
For instance ancient historian Herodotus claimed eclipse Thales allegedly
literally stopped war Median king Cyaxares Lydian king Alyattes saw darkness sign stop fighting
However many scholar doubt truly occurred according paper published journal
Ancient Greek astronomer also used eclipse event calculate distance celestial object
Many ancient culture long tied eclipse civilizational cataclysm
For instance historical text reveal Assyrians believed king rule jeopardy lunar eclipse Jupiter obscured Tia interned Science News Milwaukee Journal Sentinel written Center Investigative Reporting Scientific American ScienceNow

An occurs temporarily obscured either passing shadow another body another body pas viewer
This alignment three celestial object known
Apart syzygy term eclipse also used spacecraft reach position observe two celestial body aligned
An eclipse result either completely hidden partially hidden
The term eclipse often used describe either Moon shadow cross Earth surface Moon move Earth shadow
However also refer event beyond system example planet moving shadow cast one moon moon passing shadow cast host planet moon passing shadow another moon
A system also produce eclipse plane orbit constituent star intersects observer position
For special case solar lunar eclipse happen two time year plane Earth orbit around Sun cross plane Moon orbit around Earth
The happens season whether total annular hybrid partial depends Sun Moon
If orbit Earth around Sun Moon orbit around Earth plane eclipse would happen every month
There would lunar eclipse every full moon solar eclipse every new moon
And orbit perfectly circular solar eclipse would type every month
It difference eclipse common event
Lunar eclipse viewed entire nightside half Earth
But solar eclipse particularly total eclipse occurring one particular point Earth surface rare event span many decade one next
The term derived noun mean abandonment downfall darkening heavenly body derived verb mean abandon darken cease exist combination prefix preposition verb absent
For two object space line extended first second
The latter object block amount light emitted former creating region shadow around axis line
Typically object moving respect surroundings resulting shadow sweep region space passing particular location region fixed interval time
As viewed location shadowing event known eclipse
Typically object involved astronomical eclipse roughly disk shaped
The region object shadow eclipse divided three part A occurs observer within umbra annular eclipse observer within antumbra partial eclipse observer within penumbra
During lunar eclipse umbra penumbra applicable
This Earth apparent diameter viewpoint Moon nearly four time Sun
The term may used analogously describing eclipse antumbra Deimos crossing Mars Phobos entering Mars penumbra
The occurs eclipsing object disc first start impinge light source disc move completely within light source start move light finally leaf light source disc entirely
For spherical body occulting object smaller star length umbra shadow given radius star occulting object radius distance star occulting object
For average equal much larger Moon km
Hence umbral cone Earth completely envelop Moon
If occulting object atmosphere however luminosity star volume umbra
This occurs example eclipse Moon faint illumination Moon even totality
On Earth shadow cast eclipse move approximately km per sec
This depends location shadow Earth angle moving
An take place eclipse series separated certain interval time
This happens orbital motion body form repeating harmonic pattern
A particular instance result repetition solar lunar eclipse every day little year
Because whole number day successive eclipse visible different part world
An eclipse involving Sun Earth Moon occur nearly straight line allowing one hidden behind another viewed third
Because tilted respect orbital plane Earth eclipse occur Moon close intersection two plane
The Sun Earth node aligned twice year eclipse occur period two month around time
There four seven eclipse calendar year repeat according various
Between maximum seven eclipse Excluding penumbral lunar eclipse maximum seven eclipse As observed Earth occurs Moon pass front Sun
The type solar eclipse event depends distance Moon Earth event
A total solar eclipse occurs Earth intersects umbra portion Moon shadow
When umbra reach surface Earth Sun partially occulted resulting annular eclipse
Partial solar eclipse occur viewer inside penumbra
The fraction Sun diameter covered Moon
For total eclipse value always greater equal one
In annular total eclipse eclipse magnitude ratio angular size Moon Sun
Solar eclipse relatively brief event viewed totality along relatively narrow track
Under favorable circumstance total solar eclipse last minute second viewed along track km wide
However region partial eclipse observed much larger
The Moon umbra advance eastward rate longer intersects Earth surface
During solar eclipse Moon sometimes perfectly cover Sun size nearly Sun viewed Earth
A total solar eclipse fact annular solar eclipse
When observed point space Earth surface Sun eclipsed body Moon
Two example include crew observed observed
Lunar eclipse occur Moon pass Earth shadow
This happens Moon far side Earth Sun
Unlike solar eclipse eclipse Moon observed nearly entire hemisphere
For reason much common observe lunar eclipse given location
A lunar eclipse last longer taking several hour complete totality usually averaging anywhere minute hour
There three type lunar eclipse penumbral Moon cross Earth penumbra partial Moon cross partially Earth total Moon cross entirely Earth umbra
Total lunar eclipse pas three phase
Even total lunar eclipse however Moon completely dark
Sunlight refracted Earth atmosphere enters umbra provides faint illumination
Much sunset atmosphere tends strongly scatter light shorter wavelength illumination Moon refracted light red hue thus phrase Moon often found description lunar event far back eclipse recorded
Records solar eclipse kept since ancient time
Eclipse date used historical record
A clay tablet Ugaritic language record solar eclipse occurred March Paul Griffin argues stone Ireland record eclipse November
Positing astronomer use Babylonian eclipse record mostly century BC provides feasible mathematically consistent explanation Greek finding three lunar mean motion synodic anomalistic draconitic precision one part million better
Chinese historical record solar eclipse date back year used measure change Earth rate spin
By European astronomer publishing book diagram explaining lunar solar eclipse occurred
In order disseminate information broader audience decrease fear consequence eclipse bookseller printed broadside explaining event either using science via astrology
The planet many moon thus frequently display eclipse
The striking involve four large moon low making eclipse frequent body pas shadow larger planet
Transits occur equal frequency
It common see larger moon casting circular shadow upon Jupiter cloudtops
The eclipse Jupiter became accurately predictable orbital element known
During discovered event occurring minute later expected Jupiter far side Sun
deduced delay caused time needed light travel Jupiter Earth
This used produce first estimate
On three eclipse occur certain period planet orbit due higher orbit moon planet
The moon example orbital plane tilted Saturn equatorial plane
But Saturn axial tilt nearly
The orbital plane Titan cross line sight Sun two point along Saturn orbit
As orbital period Saturn year eclipse possible every year
The timing Jovian satellite eclipse also used calculate observer upon Earth
By knowing expected time eclipse would observed standard longitude time difference could computed accurately observing local time eclipse
The time difference give longitude observer every hour difference corresponded around Earth equator
This technique used example
On partial solar eclipse possible neither moon large enough respective orbital radius cover Sun disc seen surface planet
Eclipses moon Mars possible commonplace hundred occurring Earth year
There also rare occasion Deimos eclipsed Phobos
Martian eclipse photographed surface Mars orbit
proportionately largest moon also site many eclipse
A series mutual eclipse occurred
These daily event led first accurate measurement physical parameter object
Eclipses impossible moon
However observed transit across face Sun
There average transit Mercury century
Transits Venus occur pair separated interval eight year pair event happen le century
According NASA next pair transit occur December December
Transits Mercury much common
A system consists two star orbit around common
The movement star lie common space
When plane closely aligned location observer star seen pas front
The result type extrinsic system called
The maximum eclipsing binary system equal sum luminosity contribution individual star
When one star pass front luminosity system seen decrease
The luminosity return normal two star longer alignment
The first eclipsing binary star system discovered star system constellation
Normally star system
However every day magnitude decrease nine hour
This caused passage dimmer member pair front brighter star
The concept eclipsing body caused luminosity variation introduced

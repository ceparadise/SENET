Accessibility link Monday January By BST Aug I six year old I found brother book BASIC programming started experimenting house PC machine
A mild booting error missing core system file later followed touch computer anymore old one AMSTRAD CPS marked beginning relationship computer
I grew ultimate goal pursue BSc Computer Science took goal met mistake submitting country required choice study education system document I
I ended enrolled BSc Economics course I particularly interested
My specific situation might generally applicable worldwide audience Internet technical study becoming ubiquitous
Computer Science however stop flying around mind I sure someone might facing dilemma I faced year ago point represent thought advice I believe might useful people The problem I learning thing I liked thing I try
The answer really simple stop thinking studying Computer Science probably study Computer Science
How know actually tried
You play safe
Start short online introductory course programming algorithm
Coursera time start get idea like code
Ruby would good language start simple avoids many complexity language
Watch video program along start getting excited would probably enjoy studying Computer Science
On hand like Computer Science get passionate coding possible area may suited Technical Writing
Writing documentation
This would require bit technical knowledge actually know writing spot error
Either way Computer Science change way think
During BSc I idea I would make possible convert computing
I realised however change line thinking either going back school another BSc rather finding role unrelated personality potential
It old saying picking something like well people pay
I knew I many year steer towards goal many year benefit advantage another degree I wanted take bigger risk find way exact moment
My thinking process fairly simple I experienced A lead believe B B true I take action I experienced studying something I like I change lead hypothesis faster I would graduate quicker I would dive thing I liked proper CS course
I accepted hypothesis true I graduated highest mark BSc I I wanted apply accepted really good BSc CS degree abroad
I time ready spend another year life starting moment I realised I could convert month
There Ivy League MSc Computer Science conversion course widely known
Their entry requirement involve good undergraduate degree strong passion Computer Science exactly I needed
These month course really intensive challenging life changing time
If passionate programming find course interesting logical importantly memorable
The actual studying homework programming assignment medium hard difficulty may seem paced bit fast push achieve great thing
Go designated prerequisite disastrous ignore prerequisite advise tremendously useful follow
Make sure understand code term math programming abstract thinking bug group project programming multiple computer language
A thing I realised converting Computing You WILL make mistake point find early learn identify even earlier next time move take personally
Make sure accept actively seek offer input colleague especially think input needed
New tool platform requirement APIs likely appear month month beauty technology
Just smile face new challenge
Attend hackathons competition coding finding smart solution interest problem coder know create something scratch
Having completed project show great way showcase work ability

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Generic sorting algorithm generally take set data sort comparator function compare two individual element
If comparator order output algorithm sorted
I wondering though sort algorithm would actually comparator order relation particular one return random result comparison
By work I mean continue return permutation input run typically quoted time complexity opposed degrading worst case scenario always going infinite loop missing element
The ordering result would undefined however
Even better resulting ordering would uniform distribution comparator coin flip
From rough mental calculation appears merge sort would fine maintain runtime cost produce fair random ordering
I think something like quick sort would however degenerate possibly finish fair
What sorting algorithm merge sort would work described random comparator
For reference comparator order relation proper function deterministic satisfies axiom order relation Assume input element distinct reflexivity issue
A random comparator violates rule
There however comparators order relation yet random example might violate perhaps one rule particular element set
So basically want know sorting algorithm would degrade average case given compare function similar method produce integer specified inclusive lower upper bound
The answer actually basic sorting algorithm perform according average case obey least one following two condition For instance SelectionSort iterates unsorted element find least greatest element comparing one greatest far place correct position repeat
As result even comparator end every iteration algorithm found value think least greatest swap element position trying determine never considers element thus obeys Condition
However A B compared multiple time process extreme example consider several pass SelectionSort array sorted reverse order violates Condition
MergeSort obeys Condition merged element left right side compared already determined element side array order among algorithm compare least unmerged element subarray determine lesser go next merged list
This mean two unique object A B compared maximum one time given element final index full collection known algorithm complete
InsertionSort obeys Condition well even though overall strategy complexity look like SelectionSort
Each unsorted element compared sorted element one found le element inspection
element inserted point next element considered
The result relative order A B determined one comparison comparison A B never performed final position element known element considered
QuickSort obeys Conditions
At level pivot chosen arranged left side contains element le pivot right side contains element greater pivot
The result level QuickSort left pivot QuickSort right basically mean position pivot element known one index greater length left side pivot never compared element chosen pivot may compared previous pivot element element also known included subarrays AND A B end opposite side pivot never compared
In implementation pure QuickSort base case one element point current index final index comparison made
The comparative sort I think would obey either condition BubbleSort
If sort accept X greatest element proper place running X pass us pas verify list sorted sort considered done random comparator returned every two adjacent element list pas thus swap performed event truly random would occur probability relatively small list element one chance element probability
As maximum absolute value result comparator increase probability one comparison return negative zero decrease towards making chance end algorithm much le likely chance coin flip landing head basically boil There sort designed specifically example incorporate random comparator perhaps famous BogoSort
Given list list order shuffle list check
Theoretically hit right permutation value like BubbleSort average case N birthday problem enough random permutation become likely encounter duplicate permutation unique one nonzero possibility algorithm never completing officially algorithm
Any algorithm compare two element twice clever algorithm particular algorithm would perform le well quicksort
Any algorithm compare pair element average runtime cost regardless behavior compare function
Otherwise least guarantee sorting algorithm worse running time le O decent sorting algorithm
I believe interesting question algorithm would perform compare function gave right answer say case average
By well would perform mean answer question average number misplaced item sorting list size n algorithm
Edit The problem interesting I first thought comment Suppose compare function compare x probability false probability also
Recall insertion sort functional style algorithm The average running time algorithm n f k n length l f k average running time insert list length k count application cost count destruction well formula similar
Now compare described quite small mean number step performed insertion given k This give average running time O insertion sort significantly better O given decent comparison function
It would fun work average running time different algorithm given uniform compare function
Mergesort fair random comparator fair
I proof I VERY strong empirical evidence
Fair mean uniformly distributed
By posting answer agree

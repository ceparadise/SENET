In also known word used name variable function reserved use
This definition reserved word may meaning
A closely related often conflated notion word special meaning particular context
This definition
By contrast name built language considered reserved word keywords
The term reserved word keyword often used interchangeably one may say reserved word reserved use keyword formal use varies language language article distinguish
In general reserved word keywords need coincide modern language keywords subset reserved word make parsing easier since keywords confused identifier
In language like C Python reserved word keywords coincide language like Java keywords reserved word reserved word keywords reserved future use
In yet language older language keywords reserved word keywords distinguished identifier mean
This make parsing difficult parser necessary
The set reserved word keywords language often coincide almost equal distinction subtle term often used interchangeably
However careful usage distinguished
Making keywords reserved word make easier string character unambiguously either keyword identifier without depending context thus keywords usually subset reserved word
However reserved word need keywords example Java reserved word meaning appear production rule grammar
This usually done reserved word may become keyword future version without breaking existing program
Conversely keywords need reserved word role understood context may distinguished another manner
For example phrase unambiguous grammar since control statement clause start thus allowed language
Alternatively keywords must stropped marked way distinguished strict language listing bold thus reserved word
Thus strict language following expression legal bold keyword conflict ordinary identifier However ALGOL also stropping regime keywords reserved word example distinct concept often coincide followed many modern language
A reserved word one look like normal word allowed used normal word
Formally mean satisfies usual syntax word identifier example sequence letter used identifier used
For example word commonly reserved word generally valid assignment
Keywords varied us primarily fall class part phrase grammar specifically various meaning often used word procedural language indicates take clause nonterminal symbol name primitive type language support primitive value Boolean true sometimes special command like
Other us keywords phrase
The distinct definition clear language analyzed combination lexer parser syntax language generated word phrase
This common analyzing modern language case keywords subset reserved word must distinguished identifier word level hence reserved word syntactically analyzed differently phrase level keywords
In case reserved word defined part lexical grammar tokenized separate type distinct identifier
In conventional notation reserved word example tokenized type respectively tokenized type
Keywords contrast syntactically appear phrase grammar
For example production rule conditional expression may
In case terminal symbol meaning token type respectively due lexical grammar mean string original source
As example primitive constant value may keyword representing boolean value true case appear grammar possible expansion production instance
Beyond reserving specific list word language reserve entire range word use private space future language version different dialect compiler extension internal use compiler notably
This often done using prefix often one
C notable respect reserve identifier start two underscore underscore followed uppercase letter reserve identifier start single underscore ordinary tag space use reserve identifier contain double underscore anywhere allows use double underscore separator connect user identifier instance
The frequent use double underscore internal identifier Python gave rise abbreviation coined independently Tim Hochberg within minute reply question
The list reserved word keywords language defined language developed form part language formal specification
Generally one wish minimize number reserved word avoid restricting valid identifier name
Further introducing new reserved word break existing program use word backwards compatible avoided
To prevent provide sometimes word reserved without current use reserved word keyword allows word used future without breaking existing program
Alternatively new language feature implemented predefineds overridden thus breaking existing program
Reasons flexibility include allowing compiler vendor extend specification including feature different standard dialect language extend future version language include additional feature
For example procedural language may anticipate adding capability future version dialect point one might add keywords like
To accommodate possibility current specification may make reserved word even currently used
A notable example reserved word meaning Java also used identifier
By reserving term implemented future version Java desired without breaking older Java source code
For example proposal add language possible using word since reserved currently unused however proposal rejected notably even though adding feature would break existing program using standard library notably collection break compatibility
also contains number reserved word without special functionality exact list varies version mode
Languages differ significantly frequently introduce new reserved word keywords name language conservative introducing new keywords rarely never avoid breaking existing program language introduce new keywords freely requiring existing program change existing identifier conflict
A case study given new keywords compared recall C identifier begin underscore followed uppercase letter reserved The C committee prefers create new keywords user name space generally expected revision C avoid breaking older C program
By comparison committee prefers make new keywords old keywords
For example defines new keyword designate static storage local one thread
defines new keyword In new header macro definition provide name That introduced keyword within existing set reserved word certain prefix used separate facility macro processing allow use new keyword without prefixing introduce keyword despite existing reserved word breaking program used without requiring macro processing
A related notion reserved word predefined function method subroutine variable particularly standard library
These similar part basic language may used similar purpose
However differ name predefined function method subroutine typically categorized identifier instead reserved word treated specially syntactic analysis
Further reserved word may redefined programmer predefineds often overridden capacity
Languages vary provided keyword predefined
Some language instance provide keywords operation whereas others library routine
In version earlier many dialect keyword
In contrast C Lisp Python equivalent function standard library
Similarly Python prior predefined variable reserved word Python made reserved word
Some use term keyword reserved word interchangeably others distinguish usage say using keyword mean word special certain context reserved word mean special word used name
The meaning keywords indeed meaning notion differs widely language language
Concretely ALGOL keywords stropped strict language written bold reserved word unstropped word used ordinary identifier
The Specification us term keyword
The ISO standard us term keyword
In many language similar environment like reserved word identifies syntactic form
Words used construct keywords
In language keywords also used name variable function
In language keywords written verbatim must
This mean keywords must marked somehow

quoting prefixing special character
As consequence keywords reserved word thus word used normal identifier
However one stropping regime strope keywords instead simply reserved word
Some language extremely liberal approach allowing core keywords redefined specific purpose
In term keyword keyword symbol used special sort identifier
Unlike symbol usually stand variable function keywords package
Keywords usually used label named argument function represent symbolic value
The symbol name function variable special form macro package named basically reserved word
The effect redefining undefined ANSI Common Lisp
Binding possible
For instance expression possible local variable
The leftmost refers operator remaining symbol interpreted variable name
Since separate namespace function variable could local variable
In Common Lisp however two special symbol keyword package symbol
When evaluated expression evaluate
They used name function variable de facto reserved
expression operator permit usage
Typically programmer attempt use keyword variable function name compilation error triggered
In modern editor keywords automatically set particular text colour remind inform programmer keywords
In language control flow construct implemented macro function
In language without expressive feature generally keywords
Not language number reserved word
For example Java derivative rather sparse complement reserved whereas approximately
At end spectrum pure none
The number reserved word language little powerful language
COBOL designed business language made using structural element verb clause sentence section division
C hand written terse syntactically get text screen
For example compare equivalent block code C COBOL calculate weekly earnings Pure Prolog logic expressed term relation execution triggered running query relation
Constructs loop implemented using recursive relationship
All three language solve type problem even though differing number reserved word
This power relates belonging set language
Definition reserved word language raise problem
The language may difficult new user learn long list reserved word memorize ca used identifier
It may difficult extend language addition reserved word new feature might invalidate existing program conversely overloading existing reserved word new meaning confusing
Porting program problematic word reserved one might reserved another
Microsoft specification allows code written different programming language combined together final product
Because word collision occur code implemented one language try execute code written another language
For example library may contain definition If compiled distributed part toolbox programmer wishing define variable type would encounter problem reserved word C
Thus following compile C A similar issue arises accessing member overriding virtual method identifying namespaces
This resolved
In order work around issue specification allows programmer C place identifier force considered identifier rather reserved word compiler For consistency usage also permitted setting local variable parameter name private member

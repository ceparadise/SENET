In style building structure element treat evaluation avoids data
It paradigm mean programming done declaration instead
In functional code output value function depends passed function calling function twice value argument produce result time contrast depending may produce different result different time called argument different program state
Eliminating change state depend function input make much easier understand predict behavior program one key motivation development functional programming
Functional programming origin developed investigate function definition
Many functional viewed elaboration lambda calculus
Another declarative programming paradigm based
In contrast change state command simplest example
Imperative programming mathematical sense
They may change value program state
Functions without therefore make sense
Because lack language expression result different value different time depending state executing program
Functional programming language largely emphasized rather commercial software development
However prominent programming language support functional programming also known used industrial commercial application wide variety organization
one world widely distributed language property untyped functional language addition imperative paradigm
Functional programming also supported like statistic financial analysis
Widespread declarative language like use element functional programming especially eschewing
Programming functional style also accomplished language specifically designed functional programming
For example imperative programming language subject book describing apply functional programming concept
This also true programming language
added construct facilitate functional style
The language also offer functional programming ability
An interesting case frequently written functional style presence side effect mutable state place grey area imperative functional language
provides theoretical framework describing function evaluation
It mathematical abstraction rather programming form basis almost current functional programming language
An equivalent theoretical formulation commonly perceived abstract lambda calculus preceded invention
Combinatory logic lambda calculus originally developed achieve clearer approach

presented lecture Can Programming Be Liberated From Style
A Functional Style Algebra Programs
He defines functional program built hierarchical way mean combining form allow algebra program modern language mean functional program follow
Backus paper popularized research functional programming though emphasized rather style associated functional programming
In created initially developed language later language
Also Edinburgh Burstall Darlington developed functional language
NPL based first introduced work program transformation
Burstall MacQueen Sannella incorporated polymorphic type checking ML produce language
ML eventually developed several dialect common
Meanwhile development simple impurely functional dialect Lisp described influential classic textbook brought awareness power functional programming wider community
In developed also called type theory associated functional program arbitrarily complex mathematical proposition expressed
This led powerful new approach influenced development many subsequent functional programming language
The began consensus form functional programming research implementation release ongoing since
A number concept paradigm specific functional programming generally foreign including
However programming language often hybrid several programming paradigm programmer using mostly imperative language may utilized concept
function either take function argument return result
In calculus example function return function
function closely related function function allow function argument result function
The distinction two subtle describes mathematical concept function operate function computer science term describes programming language entity restriction use thus function appear anywhere program entity like number including argument function return value
function enable technique applies function argument one time application returning new function accepts next argument
This let programmer succinctly express example addition operator partially applied one
expression memory
This mean pure function several useful property many used optimize code While compiler imperative programming language detect pure function perform elimination pure function call always library generally expose information thus preventing optimization involve external function
Some compiler add extra keywords programmer explicitly mark external function pure enable optimization
also let function designated
looping functional language usually accomplished via
invoke letting operation repeated reach
Though recursion requires maintaining stack recognized optimized compiler code used implement iteration imperative language
The language standard requires implementation recognize optimize tail recursion
Tail recursion optimization implemented transforming program compiling among approach
Common pattern recursion factored using higher order function fold unfolds obvious example
Such higher order function play role analogous control structure
Most general purpose functional programming language allow unrestricted recursion make cause unsoundness generally requires introduction logic expressed language
Some special purpose language allow recursion nonterminating computation expressed infinite stream value called
As consequence language fail Turing complete expressing certain function impossible still express wide class interesting computation avoiding problem introduced unrestricted recursion
Functional programming limited recursion constraint called
Functional language categorized whether use evaluation concept refer function argument processed expression evaluated
The technical difference expression containing failing divergent computation
Under strict evaluation evaluation term containing failing subterm fails
For example expression fails strict evaluation division zero third element list
Under lazy evaluation length function return value number item list since evaluating attempt evaluate term making list
In brief strict evaluation always fully evaluates function argument invoking function
Lazy evaluation evaluate function argument unless value required evaluate function call
The usual implementation strategy lazy evaluation functional language
Lazy evaluation used default several pure functional language including
argues lazy evaluation mechanism improving program modularity easing independent implementation producer consumer data stream
Launchbury describes difficulty lazy evaluation introduces particularly analyzing program storage requirement proposes aid analysis
Harper proposes including strict lazy evaluation language using language type system distinguish
Especially since development functional programming language tended use rejecting invalid program compilation time risking opposed accepts valid program compilation time risk used Lisp variant though reject invalid program runtime information enough reject valid program
The use make manipulation complex data structure convenient presence strong type checking make program reliable absence reliability technique like free programmer need manually declare type compiler case
Some functional language based let type depend term
Such type called
These type system decidable type inference difficult understand program
But dependent type express arbitrary proposition
Through program language become mean writing formal compiler generate
While language mainly interest academic research including begun used engineering well
subset written Coq formally verified
A limited form dependent type called GADT implemented way provides benefit dependently typed programming avoiding inconvenience
GADT available since version case class proposed addition language including Java C
Functional program assignment statement value variable functional program never change defined
This eliminates chance side effect variable replaced actual value point execution
So functional program referentially transparent
Consider assignment statement change value assigned variable
Let u say initial value two consecutive evaluation variable yield respectively
Clearly replacing either give program different meaning expression referentially transparent
In fact assignment statement never referentially transparent
Now consider another function transparent implicitly change input x thus
Functional program exclusively use type function therefore referentially transparent
It possible use functional style programming language traditionally considered functional language
For example explicitly support pure function
inception
Amrit Prem added support Python well closure Python though Python relegated reduce standard library module
function introduced mainstream language
In lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style
In sometimes used simulate however anonymous class always proper replacement limited capability
Java support lambda expression replacement anonymous class
However presence checked exception Java make functional programming inconvenient necessary catch checked exception rethrow problem occur JVM language checked exception Scala
In necessary lambda fully supported
Libraries language extension immutable data structure developed aid programming functional style C
Many expressible functional programming term example simply dictate use function pattern roughly corresponds
Similarly idea immutable data functional programming often included imperative programming language example tuple Python immutable array
Purely functional often represented different way counterpart
For example constant access update time basic component imperative language many imperative based array
Arrays replaced admit purely functional implementation access update time
Therefore purely functional data structure used language may efficient tool especially persistence required
Functional programming different
The significant difference stem fact functional programming avoids used imperative programming implement state
Pure functional programming completely prevents provides
function rarely used older imperative programming
A traditional imperative program might use loop traverse modify list
A functional program hand would probably use map function take function list generating returning new list applying function list item
There task example maintaining bank account balance often seem naturally implemented state
Pure functional programming performs task task accepting user input printing screen different way
The pure functional programming language implement using derived
Monads offer way abstract certain type computational pattern including limited modeling computation mutable state side effect imperative manner without losing purity
While existing monad may easy apply program given appropriate template example many student find difficult understand conceptually asked define new monad sometimes needed certain type library
Another way functional language simulate state passing around represents current state parameter function call
On function call copy data structure created whatever difference result function
This referred
Impure functional language usually include direct method managing mutable state
example us managed reference updated applying pure function current state
This kind approach enables mutability still promoting use pure function preferred way express computation
Alternative method developed track side effect program
Some modern research language use make presence side effect explicit
Functional programming language typically le efficient use memory imperative language
This related fact mutable data structure like array straightforward implementation using present hardware highly evolved Turing machine
Flat array may accessed efficiently deeply pipelined CPUs prefetched efficiently cache complex handled SIMD instruction
It also easy create equally efficient immutable counterpart
For purely functional language slowdown logarithmic number memory cell used mutable memory represented purely functional data structure logarithmic access time balanced tree
However slowdown universal
For program perform intensive numerical computation functional language slightly slower C according
For program handle large multidimensional functional language designed speed optimization
Immutability data many case lead execution efficiency allowing compiler make assumption unsafe imperative language thus increasing opportunity
may also speed program even asymptotically whereas may slow constant factor however may introduce used improperly
Launchbury discus theoretical issue related memory leak lazy evaluation give practical advice analyzing fixing
However general implementation lazy evaluation making extensive use dereferenced code data perform poorly modern processor deep pipeline cache cache miss may cost hundred cycle
Imperative program environment sequence step manipulating environment
Functional program expression successively substituted reach normal form

In Greek many much form shape provision single entity different
A one whose operation also applied value type type
There several fundamentally different kind polymorphism The interaction parametric polymorphism subtyping lead concept
Ad hoc polymorphism parametric polymorphism originally described set lecture note written British computer scientist
In paper introduced term model subtypes
However implementation subtyping inheritance predate term inclusion polymorphism appeared chose term refer polymorphic function applied argument different type behave differently depending type argument applied also known
The term context intended pejorative refers simply fact type polymorphism fundamental feature type system
In example function seem work generically various type looking invocation considered two entirely distinct function compiler intent purpose In language situation complex correct function need invoked might determinable run time
Implicit type conversion also defined form polymorphism referred coercion polymorphism
allows function data type written generically handle value without depending type
Parametric polymorphism way make language expressive still maintaining full static
The concept parametric polymorphism applies
A function evaluate applied value different type known A data type appear generalized type
element arbitrary type designated like generalized type specialization made
Parametric polymorphism ubiquitous functional programming often simply referred polymorphism
The following example show parametrized list data type two parametrically polymorphic function Parametric polymorphism also available several language
For instance D name C Java later formally developed notion polymorphism extension lambda calculus called polymorphic lambda calculus
Any parametrically polymorphic function necessarily restricted working shape data instead value leading concept
Some language employ idea also called restrict range type used particular case polymorphism
In language subtyping allows function written take object certain type also work correctly passed object belongs type subtype according
This type relation sometimes written
Conversely said
Subtype polymorphism usually resolved dynamically see
In following example make cat dog subtypes animal
The procedure accepts animal also work correctly subtype passed In another example type function written take work equally well passed passed
The actual type object hidden client accessed via object
In fact type may even possible get hand object whose type see
This particular kind type hierarchy context usually contains many type
offer subtype polymorphism using also known
In typical implementation class contains called table function implement polymorphic part class object contains pointer vtable class consulted whenever polymorphic method called
This mechanism example The go popular object system
Some however provide method call polymorphic argument
Row Polymorphism similar distinct concept subtyping
It deal
It allows usage value whose type certain property without losing remaining type information
A related concept
A polytypic function general polymorphic function though one provide fixed ad hoc case specific data type ad hoc combinator absent
Polymorphism distinguished implementation selected statically compile time dynamically run time typically via
This known respectively corresponding form polymorphism accordingly called
Static polymorphism executes faster dynamic dispatch overhead requires additional compiler support
Further static polymorphism allows greater static analysis compiler notably optimization source code analysis tool human reader programmer
Dynamic polymorphism flexible example dynamic polymorphism allows duck typing dynamically linked library may operate object without knowing full type
Static polymorphism typically occurs ad hoc polymorphism parametric polymorphism whereas dynamic polymorphism usual subtype polymorphism
However possible achieve static polymorphism subtyping sophisticated use namely

Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem

I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing

Software design process conceptualize software requirement software implementation
Software design take user requirement challenge try find optimum solution
While software conceptualized plan chalked find best possible design implementing intended solution
There multiple variant software design
Let u study briefly Structured design conceptualization problem several element solution
It basically concerned solution design
Benefit structured design give better understanding problem solved
Structured design also make simpler designer concentrate problem accurately
Structured design mostly based divide conquer strategy problem broken several small problem small problem individually solved whole problem solved
The small piece problem solved mean solution module
Structured design emphasis module well organized order achieve precise solution
These module arranged hierarchy
They communicate
A good structured design always follows rule communication among multiple module namely grouping functionally related element
communication different module
A good structured design high cohesion low coupling arrangement
In design system comprised many smaller known function
These function capable performing significant task system
The system considered top view function
Function oriented design inherits property structured design divide conquer methodology used
This design mechanism divide whole system smaller function provides mean abstraction concealing information
These functional module share information among mean information passing using information available globally
Another characteristic function program call function function change state program sometimes acceptable module
Function oriented design work well system state matter work input rather state
Object oriented design work around entity characteristic instead function involved software system
This design strategy focus entity characteristic
The whole concept software solution revolves around engaged entity
Let u see important concept Object Oriented Design A class generalized description object
An object instance class
Class defines attribute object method defines functionality object
In solution design attribute stored variable functionality defined mean method procedure
Software design process perceived series step
Though varies according design approach function oriented object oriented yet It may following step involved Here two generic approach software designing We know system composed one contains number component
Further component may set component creates hierarchical structure system
design take whole software system one entity decomposes achieve one component based characteristic
Each component treated system decomposed
This process keep running lowest level system hierarchy achieved
design start generalized model system keep defining specific part
When component composed whole system come existence
design suitable software solution need designed scratch specific detail unknown
The bottom design model start specific basic component
It proceeds composing higher level component using basic lower level component
It keep creating higher level component desired system evolved one single component
With higher level amount abstraction increased
strategy suitable system need created existing system basic primitive used newer system
Both approach practical individually
Instead good combination used

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I trying figure one I found CFG palindrome language
I ca work solution also cover c w
Find CFG language b c Reverse w c w
Would appreciate help Call b palindrome language b language string c
Then language Q CFL since know intersection CFL P regular language Q CFL
With way let get CFG L
You know grammar P given production Now let modify grammar generates palindrome c
The production cSc add two c string generated want limit ourself subsequent production generate one c
We changing cSc cTc forcing T generate palindrome one c
This simple enough add production So finally grammar eqnarray S T eqnarray By posting answer agree

Three CS ILLINOIS researcher among top woman engineer computer scientist worldwide attended academic career workshop MIT early November
presented research interacted faculty member top institution received useful career advice launching advancing faculty career
The workshop included practical advice leadership preparing academic statement application navigating faculty search promotion process well informal time network fellow participant workshop speaker MIT industry
According Kim workshop valuable helped understand importance able describe one research
You interesting work putting tremendous effort fail successfully convey value work academic career may suffer said
A doctoral student CS Professor research group Kim presented talk workshop new scheduling paradigm multicore system
Currently use one core multicore chip yet certified application avionics system
Kim novel approach synchronizes transaction assumes unknown task execution time employ budgeted generalized monotonic scheduling Budgeted GRMS may help enable safe use multicore processor system
I received good feedback work presentation participant faculty gave good energy motivation said Kim noting grateful opportunity
What I learned definitely impact career A postdoctoral researcher working Professor group Kordjamshidi working new programming paradigm called declarative programming
She designing new language Saul used build intelligent system since conventional programming language facilitate possibility learning messy way involves learning interdependent concept
This language target different type user particularly machine learning expert domain like biology example need program complex machine learning model application
I happy time space given Kordjamshidi said
This workshop helped encouraged think dream I plan A doctoral student CS Professor research group Ni presented research mitigating failure computing runtime technique workshop
She developing runtime system technique deployed make parallel execution robust
A fourth Illinois researcher doctoral student CS faculty member group invited attend unable participate

CS department colloquium Three student Computer Science Department received National Instruments Scholarships Fall
The scholarship funded BYU alumnus employed National Instruments
In group alumnus employed National Instruments came together give back Brigham Young University
Together created National Instruments Scholarship Computer Science made entirely fund donated BYU alumnus National Instruments
The alumnus chose use part donation create endowment designated rest fund available immediately
This unique manner appropriation allows donor bless life student immediately still creating scholarship exist perpetuity benefiting CS student generation come
We thought made lot sense alumnus National Instruments put something together could give back little said Jered Skousen BYU alum area sale manager National Instruments
All alumnus BYU pooled resource contributed money
The alumnus National Instruments said like idea continuing offer scholarship impressed recipient
We recruit better recruiting BYU school Skousen remarked
We excited see relationship work well side
As nine BYU student received scholarship
The recipient Fall Brock Judkins Michael Williams David Packard presented award reception September
Garth Black area sale engineer National Instruments BYU ECEN alum made presentation
CS faculty recipient family present
National Instruments software hardware company based Austin Texas
This year celebrating year

April The offer strategic look factor needed success
It developed Rapper
The model point strategist focus three key factor success
In construction celebrity strategy three main player must taken account Only integrating three sustained competitive advantage exist
Kanye refers key factor three C
There certain need arise medium end
They include gain follower money fame
Recognizing need industry offer basic product
To cater expectation also differentiate competitor tend buy fame celebs offer product
Also celebs competitor eventually start making unnecessary product money fame
There also new C model emerging center sustainability
This model The idea behind new C model revolves around concept shared value fame environment community
Clients base strategy according Ohmae
Therefore primary goal supposed interest customer shareholder example
In long run company genuinely interested customer interesting investor take care interest automatically
Segmentation helping understand customer
The differentiation done term different way various customer use product
Customer thinking one prime function consideration
This segmentation normally emerges study marketing cost versus
There appears always cost versus coverage relationship
The corporation task optimize range market coverage geographically channel wise
In fierce competition competitor likely dissecting market similar way
Over extended period time effectiveness given initial strategic segmentation tend decline
In situation useful pick small group customer reexamine really looking
A market segment change occurs market force altering distribution time influencing demography distribution channel customer size etc
This kind change mean allocation corporate resource must shifted absolute level resource committed business must changed
Competitor based strategy constructed looking possible source differentiation function purchasing design engineering sale servicing
The following aspect show way order achieve differentiation A favorite phrase Japanese business planner standing people money thing
They believe streamlined corporate management achieved three critical resource balance without surplus waste
For example Cash beyond competent people intelligently expend wasted
Of three critical resource fund allocated last
The corporation firstly allocate management talent based available mono thing plant machinery technology process functional strength
Once hito people developed creative imaginative idea capture business upward potential kane money given specific idea program generated individual manager
The corporation excel every function win
If gain decisive edge one key function eventually able improve function average
In case rapidly rising wage cost becomes critical decision company subcontract major share assembly operation
If competitor unable shift production rapidly subcontractor vendor resulting difference cost structure company ability cope demand fluctuation may significant strategic implication
In essence company seek stay ahead competition either outsourcing activity quite costly direct value addition apply backward integration technique core business area

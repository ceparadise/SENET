I trying use epipolar geometry concept estimate relative pose camera two image
I currently using simulator get camera image distortion zero I know camera parameter beforehand
I using OpenCV findEssentialMat recoverPose solvePnP function programming
My pipeline Detect feature match find relative pose triangulate scale point cloud using initial scale estimate run PNP subsequent image camera move get metric pose
When two image taken position displaced along X axis essential matrix based estimation work perfectly I get translation matrix like
But camera moved along Z axis I see matrix contains higher usual value Y axis whereas X Z correct
And fashion I move purely X Y translation estimate show erroneous movement Z axis
Example result solvePnP two case unit I understand Y axis coming
The simulator accurate term physic absolutely movement magnitude Y axis
The behavior reflected relative output essential matrix decomposition
On hand I generate perfect set point take projective transformation using intrinsics matrix compute point compute essential matrix I get expected R I reading David Nister paper point algorithm I using say
The result quite good result method virtually useless
As noise grows large method swamped begin placing epipole somewhere inside image regardless true position
This phenomenon observed previously

It particularly marked point method

This partly due slight deterioration result method mainly due vast improvement result method

I wonder optimal solution kind world scenario
Has anyone worked similar problem share wisdom

amount work accomplished computer system
Depending context high computer performance may involve one following The performance computer system evaluated measurable technical term using one metric listed
This way performance Whilst definition relates scientific technical approach following definition given would useful audience performance performance particularly response time aspect important
Performance engineering within system engineering encompasses set role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase system development life cycle ensures solution designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement defined solution
Performance engineering continuously deal type performance
Occasionally find way make CPU better overall performance improving one aspect performance presented without sacrificing CPU performance area
For example building CPU better faster transistor
However sometimes pushing one type performance extreme lead CPU worse overall performance important aspect sacrificed get one number example chip see
Application Performance Engineering APE specific methodology within designed meet challenge associated application performance increasingly distributed mobile cloud terrestrial IT environment
It includes role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase application lifecycle ensure application designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement
Computer performance thing measure include
benchmark available
Availability system typically measured factor reliability reliability increase availability le
Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication
In reliable communication system latency limit maximum rate information transmitted often limit amount information one moment
In field interaction perceptible latency delay user command computer provides result strong effect user satisfaction usability
Computers run set instruction called process
In operating system execution process postponed process also executing
In addition operating system schedule perform action process commanding
For example suppose process command computer card voltage output set rate Hz
The operating system may choose adjust scheduling transition based internal clock
The latency delay process instruction commanding transition hardware actually transitioning voltage high low low high
System designer building system want guarantee response
That easier CPU low deterministic response
In computer networking bandwidth measurement available consumed data communication resource expressed bit per second multiple etc
Bandwidth sometimes defines net bit rate aka
peak bit rate information rate physical layer useful bit rate channel capacity maximum throughput logical physical communication path digital communication system
For example bandwidth test measure maximum throughput computer network
The reason usage according Hartley law maximum data rate physical communication link proportional bandwidth hertz sometimes called frequency bandwidth spectral bandwidth RF bandwidth signal bandwidth analog bandwidth
In general term throughput rate production rate something processed
In communication network throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth consumption
In unit maximum system throughput aggregate throughput divided analog bandwidth measure system coverage area
In integrated circuit often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis
Scalability ability system network process handle growing amount work capable manner ability enlarged accommodate growth The amount electricity used computer
This becomes especially important system limited power source solar battery human power
System designer building pick CPUs based speed per watt power cost powering CPU outweighs cost CPU
Compression useful help reduce resource usage data storage space transmission capacity
Because compressed data must decompressed use extra processing imposes computational cost decompression situation far free lunch
Data compression subject complexity
This important performance feature mobile system smart phone keep pocket portable embedded system spacecraft
The effect computer computer environment manufacturing recycling well use
Measurements taken objective reducing waste reducing hazardous material minimizing computer
Because many program test CPU aspect performance developed
The famous benchmark SPECint benchmark developed benchmark developed Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium
In software engineering performance testing general testing performed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
Performance testing subset performance engineering emerging computer science practice strives build performance implementation design architecture system
In profiling program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
The common use profiling information aid program
Profiling achieved instrumenting either program binary executable form using tool called
A number different technique may used profilers statistical instrumented simulation method
Performance tuning improvement performance
This typically computer application method applied economic market bureaucracy complex system
The motivation activity called performance problem real anticipated
Most system respond increased degree decreasing performance
A system ability accept higher load called modifying system handle higher load synonymous performance tuning
Systematic tuning follows step Perceived performance computer engineering refers quickly software feature appears perform task
The concept applies mainly user acceptance aspect
The amount time application take start file download made faster showing startup screen see Splash screen file progress dialog box
However satisfies human need appears faster user well providing visual cue let know system handling request
In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design
For given instruction set therefore fixed N semiconductor process maximum performance requires balance brainiac technique speedracer technique

If two set A B refer Cartesian Product A x B
This mean A B b c A x B
It set pair value first A second B
A relation A B subset A x B
A relation said connect value together way showing relationship
As example let take two set
A B
Because two set say relation A
Now consider relation described greater
We start looking A x B
Now relation R subset
One way work relation look value turn
So look first value
The first value second value relation greater
This true part relation
The true say greater say greater
But get see yes greater value relation
In end find relation subset A x B
We show digraph follows say b related R arrow going b
If related b relation R also say aRb
So case
There number different property relation
Let R subset A x R said reflexive true every possible value A true aRa
This mean everything map onto
On digraph shown fact every node loop attached point back
An example relation type could height Everything height still height thing
The key feature though aRa always true
R said transitive true every possible value b c A aRb true bRc true must case aRc true
An example kind relation smaller
If object smaller b object b smaller c obviously object must smaller object This hard spot digraph basically whenever arrow b arrow b c also arrow R said symmetric relation work backwards
For example two node relation b true aRb relation symmetric must also true bRa
height good example symmetric relation If height b obviously b height true object
On digraph shown fact wherever arrow two node another one going opposite direction
R said antisymmetric true b A aRb bRa must equal ie
relation work reverse two node
An equivalence relation relation reflexive symmetric transitive
To show look three feature show The idea equivalence relation aRb b sense
This usually divide set A seperate part
The idea part contains element equivalent b part aRb
So let assume A set natural number R relation state b equal mod
true true etc
true true etc
The digraph look like So see continued would partition odd number even number
The odd number equivalent relation even number equivalent relation
We say divided two class
We talk class set node equivalent
So case set set
This way see set natural number N consists element partition exactly
N
Similarly say conjunction always equal empty set value also appear
In fact equivalence relation following true A partition set subset make set
For example set partition make set There number operation possible relation set
Let relation A The union described set theory every pair thing either
For example family take union relation mother father get relation parent
The intersection described set theory every pair thing
For example intersection relation mother father empty nobody mother father child
The complement described R basically set pair A x A
For example inverse parent parent The inverse described R every pair backwards
For example relation true R
For example inverse parent child
If consider two relation parent mother define another relation grandmother combining finding value mother b b parent Then grandmother In general two relation A B B C relational composition described relation A C b B
For relation R property P say relation S P closure R S property P R another relation property P R subset R S subset R well
For example let assume P property transitivity
The P closure R transitive closure When P reflexivity known reflexive closure P symmetry known symmetric closure
The P closure constructed adding R minimum number pair b make new relation property For example let u consider relation consisting
The reflexive closure relation consisting
All added minimum pair required make reflexive
All rest left alone
The transitive closure harder find
But consider pair pair turn see way get straight
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
needed
needed already
And
The transitive closure relation
The symmetric closure much easier minimum pair ensure every pair work backwards
In case
We added
Another common type relation set relation share property le equal
Such relation called order relation
The simplest kind order relation called partial order follows A partial order relation R reflexive antisymmetric transitive
A partially ordered set poset additional property
Namely integer x either x le equal le equal x
We say two integer comparable relationship le equal
A partial order relation two element comparable called total order
Given ordering set define maximal minimal element
An element poset A partial order said least element element
An element poset A partial order said greatest element element
A minimal element partial order set A element b b
A maximal element partial order set A element b b
In basic term minimal element one another element smaller maximal element element another element bigger
That say minimal element smallest maximal element biggest two element may comparable partial order
A partial order lot minimal maximal element
In general poset A drawn partial order placing larger element top le large element
Draw minimum number line x le sequence line descending x
This called Hasse Diagram
And basically know relation
I recommend reading page note order relation minimal maximal element partial order stuff make tiny bit sense

Computer simulation pioneered scientific tool meteorology nuclear physic period directly following World War II since become indispensable growing number discipline
The list science make extensive use computer simulation grown include astrophysics particle physic material science engineering fluid mechanic climate science evolutionary biology ecology economics decision theory medicine sociology epidemiology many others
There even discipline chaos theory complexity theory whose existence emerged alongside development computational model study
After slow start philosopher science begun devote attention role computer simulation science
Several area philosophical interest computer simulation emerged What structure epistemology computer simulation
What relationship computer simulation experiment
Does computer simulation raise issue philosophy science fully covered recent work model generally
What computer simulation teach u emergence
About structure scientific theory
About role fiction scientific modeling
No single definition computer simulation appropriate
In first place term used narrow broad sense
In second place one might want understand term one point view
In narrowest sense computer simulation program run computer us method explore approximate behavior mathematical model
Usually model system although system question might imaginary hypothetical one
Such computer program
One run program computer computer simulation system
The algorithm take input specification state value variable time It calculates system state time
From value characterizing second state calculates system state time
When run computer algorithm thus produce numerical picture evolution system state conceptualized model
This sequence value model variable saved large collection data often viewed computer screen using method visualization
Often certainly always method visualization designed output scientific simulation appears measuring system interest
Sometimes method computer simulation used model interest contains continuous differential equation specify continuous rate change time solved principle perhaps practice
This underwrites spirit following definition given Paul Humphreys method exploring property mathematical model analytic method available
But even narrow definition one read carefully taken suggest simulation used analytically unsolvable equation model
Computer simulation often used either original model contains discrete directly implemented algorithm suitable original model consists something better described
In former case equation discretized turning equation describe continuous rate change discrete equation emphasized although common speak simulation solving equation discretization best find something approximates solution continuous equation desired degree accuracy
Finally speaking computer simulation narrowest sense speaking particular implementation algorithm particular digital computer written particular language using particular compiler etc
There case different result obtained result variation particular
More broadly think computer simulation comprehensive method studying system
In broader sense term refers entire process
This process includes choosing model finding way implementing model form run computer calculating output algorithm visualizing studying resultant data
The method includes entire make inference target system one try well procedure used sanction inference
This le definition computer simulation Winsberg
Successful simulation study compute number
They make use variety technique draw inference number
Simulations make creative use calculational technique motivated
As unlike simple computation carried computer result simulation automatically reliable
Much effort expertise go deciding simulation result reliable When philosopher science write computer simulation make claim epistemological methodological property computer simulation usually mean term understood broad sense computer simulation study
Both definition take computer simulation fundamentally using computer solve approximately solve mathematical equation model meant represent real hypothetical
Another approach try define simulation independently notion computer simulation define computer simulation compositionally simulation carried programmed digital computer
On approach simulation system believed hoped dynamical behavior similar enough system former studied learn latter
For example study object believe sufficiently dynamically similar basin fluid u learn basin fluid studying provides simulation basin fluid
This line definition simulation find Hartmann something imitates one process another process
In definition term process refers solely object system whose state change time
Hughes objected Hartmann definition ruled simulation imitate structure rather dynamic
Humphreys revised definition simulation accord remark Hartmann Hughes follows Note Humphreys defining computer simulation simulation generally spirit defining compositional term
It noted Humphreys definition make simulation success term seems unfortunate
A better definition would one like one last section included word like believed hoped address issue
In philosophical discussion computer simulation useful concept one defined
The exception explicitly goal discussion understand computer simulation example simulation generally see section
Examples simulation computer simulation include famous physical model San Francisco Bay Huggins Schultz
This working hydraulic scale model San Francisco Bay Joaquin River Delta System built Army Corps engineer study possible engineering intervention Bay
Another nice example discussed extensively Dardashti et al
forthcoming use acoustic dumb hole made condensate study behavior Black Holes
Physicist Bill Unruh noted certain fluid something akin black hole would arise region fluid moving fast wave would move faster speed sound something order escape Unruh
Such region would effect sonic event horizon
Unruh called physical setup dumb hole dumb mute proposed could studied order learn thing know black hole
For time proposal viewed nothing clever idea physicist recently come realize using condensate actually build study dumb hole laboratory
It clear think setup simulation dumb hole simulates black hole
Instead finding computer program simulate black hole physicist find fluid dynamical setup believe good model model fundamental mathematical similarity model system interest
They observe behavior fluid setup laboratory order make inference black hole
The point definition simulation section try understand sense computer simulation sort activity specie genus
We might better situation understand simulation sense happens run computer overlap simulation sense
We come back section
Barberousse et al
however critical analogy
They point computer simulation work way Unruh simulation work
It case computer material object target system follow differential equation
A good reference simulation computer simulation Trenholme
Two type computer simulation often distinguished
Computer Simulations type used three different general sort purpose prediction pointwise understanding exploratory heuristic purpose
simulation commonly used physical science science governing theory guide construction mathematical model based differential equation
I use term equation based refer simulation based kind global equation associate physical opposed rule evolution discussed next section
Equation based simulation either n many discrete body set differential equation governing interaction set equation governing time evolution continuous medium field
An example former simulation galaxy formation gravitational interaction finite collection discrete body discretized time space
An example latter simulation fluid meteorological system like severe storm
Here system treated continuous field representing distribution relevant variable space discritized space updated discrete interval time
simulation common social behavioral science though also find discipline artificial life epidemiology ecology discipline networked interaction many individual studied
simulation similar simulation represent behavior discrete individual
But unlike simulation global differential equation govern motion individual
Rather simulation behavior individual dictated local rule To give one example famous groundbreaking simulation Thomas Schelling model The agent simulation individual lived chessboard
The individual divided two group society
two different race boy girl smoker etc
Each square board represented house one person per house
An individual happy certain percent neighbor group
Happy agent stay unhappy agent move free location
Schelling found board quickly evolved strongly segregated location pattern agent happiness rule specified segregation heavily favored
Surprisingly however also found initially integrated board tipped full segregation even agent happiness rule expressed mild preference neighbor type
In section discussed model based particle method based field method
But simulation model hybrid different kind modeling method
Multiscale simulation model particular couple together modeling element different scale description
A good example would model simulates dynamic bulk matter treating material field undergoing stress strain relatively coarse level description zoom particular region material important small scale effect taking place model smaller region relatively modeling method
Such method might rely molecular dynamic quantum mechanic description matter offered treating material field
Multiscale simulation method broken serial multiscale parallel multiscale method
The traditional method serial modeling
The idea choose region simulate lower level description summarize result set parameter digestible higher level model pas part algorithm calculating higher level
Serial multiscale method effective different scale strongly coupled together
When different scale interact strongly produce observed behavior required approach simulates region simultaneously
This called parallel multiscale modeling
Parallel multiscale modeling foundation nearly ubiquitous simulation method called modeling
modelingrefers representation important physical process occur adequately resolved grid size particular simulation
Remember many simulation discretize continuous equation relatively arbitrary finite grid In study turbulence fluid example common practical strategy calculation account missing fall inside grid cell
This done adding motion characterizes transport dissipation energy feature occurs small scale captured grid
In climate science kindred discipline modeling called This refers method replacing complex physically represented simple mathematical description
This opposed flow calculated grid level accordance basic theory
It called parameterization various needed drive highly approximative algorithm compute value
Examples parameterization climate simulation include descent rate raindrop rate atmospheric radiative transfer rate cloud formation
For example average cloudiness km grid box cleanly related average humidity box
Nonetheless average humidity increase average cloudiness also could parameter linking average cloudiness average humidity inside grid box
Even though parameterizations cloud formation sophisticated basic idea well illustrated example
The use modeling method simulation important consequence understanding structure epistemology simulation
This discussed greater detail section
modelling method contrasted another kind parallel multiscale model algorithm theoretically principled motivated theory different level description
In example simulation bulk matter mentioned example algorithm driving smaller level description built
The algorithm driving smaller level actually theoretically principled higher level sense physic fundamental quantum mechanic molecular dynamic continuum mechanic
These kind multiscale model word cobble together resource theory different level description
So provide interesting example provoke thinking intertheoretic relationship challenge view inconsistent set law model
In scientific literature another large class computer simulation called Monte Carlo MC Simulations
MC simulation computer algorithm use randomness calculate property mathematical model randomness algorithm feature target model
A nice example use random algorithm calculate value π
If draw unit square piece paper inscribe circle randomly drop collection object inside square proportion object land circle would roughly equal
A computer simulation simulated procedure like would called MC simulation calculating π
Many philosopher science deviated ordinary scientific language shied away thinking MC simulation genuine simulation
Weirich offer following reasoning The Monte Carlo approach mimetic purpose It imitates deterministic system order serve surrogate investigated stead order offer alternative computation deterministic system property
This show MC simulation fit definition aptly
On hand divide philosopher ordinary language perhaps squared noting MC simulation simulate imaginary process might used calculating something relevant studying process
Suppose I modeling planetary orbit calculation I need know value π
If I MC simulation mentioned last paragraph I simulating process randomly dropping object square I modeling planetary orbit
This sense MC simulation simulation simulation system used study
However Beisbart Norton Other Internet Resources point MC simulation viz
use MC technique solve stochastic dynamical equation referring physical system fact simulation system study
There three general category purpose computer simulation put
Simulations used heuristic purpose purpose predicting data generating understanding data already
Under category heuristic model simulation subdivided used communicate knowledge others used represent information
When Watson Crick played tin plate wire latter first former showed result others
When army corp built model San Francisco Bay convince voting population particular intervention dangerous using kind heuristic purpose
Computer simulation used kind explore feature possible representational structure communicate knowledge others
For example computer simulation natural process bacterial reproduction tectonic shifting chemical reaction evolution used classroom setting help student visualize hidden structure phenomenon process impractical impossible costly illustrate wet laboratory setting
Another broad class purpose computer simulation put telling u expect system real world behave particular set circumstance
Loosely speaking computer simulation used prediction
We use model predict future retrodict past use make precise prediction loose general one
With regard relative precision prediction make simulation slightly finegrained taxonomy
There Point prediction Where planet Mars October
b Qualitative global systemic prediction Is orbit planet stable
What scaling law emerges kind system
What fractal dimension attractor system kind
c Range prediction It likely global mean surface temperature increase degree C year highly likely sea level rise least two foot implausible thermohaline shut next year
Finally simulation used understand system behavior
If already data telling u system behaves use computer simulation answer question event could possibly occurred event actually occur
When thinking topic next section epistemology computer simulation also keep mind procedure needed sanction result simulation often depend large part kind purpose purpose simulation put
As computer simulation method gained importance discipline issue trustworthiness generating new knowledge grown especially simulation expected counted epistemic peer experiment traditional analytic theoretical method
The relevant question always whether result particular computer simulation accurate enough intended purpose
If simulation used weather predict variable interested degree accuracy sufficient meet need consumer
If simulation atmosphere Midwestern plain used structure severe thunderstorm confidence structure one play explanatory role account storm sometimes split two sometimes form depicted accurately enough support confidence explanation
If simulation used engineering design prediction made simulation reliable enough sanction particular choice design parameter sanction belief particular design airplane wing function
Assuming answer question sometimes yes
kind inference least sometimes justified central philosophical question justifies
More generally claim simulation good enough intended purpose evaluated
These central question epistemology computer simulation EOCS
Given confirmation theory one traditional topic philosophy science might seem obvious latter would resource begin approach question
Winsberg however argued come topic related credentialing knowledge claim philosophy science traditionally concerned justification theory application
Most simulation hand extent make use theory tends make use theory
EOCS word rarely testing basic theory may go simulation often establishing credibility hypothesis part result application theory
Winsberg argued unlike epistemological issue take center stage traditional confirmation theory adequate EOCS must meet three condition
In particular must take account fact knowledge produced computer simulation result inference

EOCS must reflect fact large number case accepted scientific theory starting point construction computer simulation model play important role justification inference simulation result conclusion target system
The word downward meant signal fact unlike scientific inference traditionally interested philosopher move observation instance theory inference drawn part high theory particular feature phenomenon

EOCS must take account simulation result nevertheless typically depend theory many model ingredient resource well including parameterizations discussed numerical solution method mathematical trick approximation idealization outright fiction ad hoc assumption function library compiler computer hardware perhaps importantly blood sweat tear much trial error

EOCS must take account autonomy knowledge produced simulation sense knowledge produced simulation sanctioned entirely comparison observation
Simulations usually employed study phenomenon data sparse
In circumstance simulation meant replace experiment observation source data world relevant experiment observation reach principled practical ethical reason
Parker forthcoming made point usefulness condition somewhat compromised fact overly focused simulation physical science discipline simulation
This seems correct
In social behavioral science discipline simulation see norm model built absence established quantitative theory EOCS probably ought characterized term
For instance social scientist use simulation pursue methodology social phenomenon example observed pattern like segregation explained accounted generating similar looking phenomenon simulation Epstein Axtell Epstein
But raise sort epistemological question
What exactly accomplished kind knowledge acquired observed social phenomenon le reproduced simulation
Does count explanation phenomenon
A possible explanation
see
It also fair say Parker forthcoming condition outlined pay insufficient attention various differing purpose simulation used discussed
If using simulation make detailed quantitative prediction future behavior target system epistemology inference might require stringent standard involved inference made general qualitative behavior whole class system
Indeed also fair say much work could done classifying kind purpose computer simulation put constraint purpose place structure epistemology
Frigg Reiss argued none three condition new computer simulation
They argued ordinary paper pencil modeling incorporate feature
Indeed argued computer simulation could possibly raise new epistemological issue epistemological issue could cleanly divided question appropriateness model underlying simulation issue identical epistemological issue arise ordinary modeling question correctness solution model equation delivered simulation mathematical question one related epistemology science
On first point Winsberg replied simultaneous confluence three feature new simulation
We return second point section Some work EOCS developed analogy computer simulation order draw recent work epistemology experiment particularly work Allan Franklin
see entry
In work epistemology experiment Alan Franklin identified number strategy experimenter use increase rational confidence result
Weissart Parker argued various form analogy strategy number strategy available simulationists sanction result
The detailed analysis relationship found Parker also us analogy highlight weakness current approach simulation model evaluation
Winsberg also make use Ian Hacking work philosophy experiment
One central insight experiment captured slogan experiment life
Hacking intended convey two thing slogan
The first reaction unstable picture science come example Kuhn
Hacking suggests experimental result remain stable even face dramatic change part science
The second related point intended convey experiment organic develop change yet retain certain development make u talk repeating replicating experiment
Some technique simulationists use construct model get credentialed much way Hacking say instrument experimental procedure method credential develop extended period time become deeply
In Hacking language technique set assumption simulationists use become
Perhaps better expression would carry credential
This provides response problem posed understanding simulation could viable epistemology despite motley autonomous nature inference
Drawing inspiration another philosopher experiment Mayo Parker suggests remedy shortcoming current approach simulation model evaluation
In work Parker suggests Mayo approach understanding traditional make use notion severe test shed light epistemology simulation
The central question epistemology simulation perspective becomes What warrant taking computer simulation severe test hypothesis natural world
That warrant concluding simulation would unlikely give result fact gave hypothesis interest false
Parker belief much pass simulation model evaluation lack rigor structure Drawing explicitly upon Mayo work argues epistemology simulation ought instead offering account canonical error arise well strategy probing presence
Practitioners simulation particularly engineering context weapon testing climate science tend conceptualize EOCS term
said process determining whether output simulation approximates true solution differential equation original model
hand said process determining whether chosen model good enough representation system purpose simulation
The literature verification validation engineer scientist enormous beginning receive attention philosopher
Verification divided solution verification code verification
The former verifies output approximates true solution differential equation original model
The latter verifies code written carry intended algorithm
Code verification mostly ignored philosopher science probably seen problem computer science empirical mistake
Part solution verification consists comparing computed output analytic solution called benchmark solution
Though method course help make case result computer simulation since simulation often used precisely analytic solution unavailable region solution space interest
Other indirect technique available important probably checking see whether rate computed output converges stable solution time spatial resolution discretization grid get finer
The principal strategy validation involves comparing model output observable data
Again course strategy limited case simulation run observable data sparse
But complex strategy employed including comparing output subsystem simulation relevant experiment Parker forthcoming Oberkampf Roy
The concept verification validation drawn criticism philosopher
Oreskes et al
article mostly critical terminology arguing validity particular property applies logical argument hence term applied model might lead overconfidence
Winsberg argued conceptual division verification validation misleading taken suggest one set method show solved equation right another set method show got right equation
He also argued misleading think epistemology simulation cleanly divided empirical part verification mathematical computer science part validation
But misleading idea often follows discussion verification validation
We find work practitioner philosopher
Here standard line practictioner Roy Verification deal mathematics address correctness numerical solution given model
Validation hand deal physic address appropriateness model reproducing experimental data
Verification thought solving chosen equation correctly validation choosing correct equation first place Roy
Some philosopher put distinction work argument philosophical novelty simulation
We first raised issue section Frigg Reiss argued simulation could epistemologically novel feature since contained two distinct component component identical epistemology ordinary modeling component entirely mathematical
We distinguish two different notion reliability answering two different question
First solution computer provides close enough actual unavailable solution useful purely mathematical question fall within class problem mentioned
So nothing new philosophical point view question indeed one number crunching
Second computational model basis simulation represent target system correctly
That simulation result externally valid
This serious question one independent ﬁrst problem one equally arises connection model involve intractable mathematics ordinary experiment Frigg Reiss
But verification validation strictly speaking cleanly separable
That method validation much weak establish validity simulation
And model equation chosen simulation straightforward sense right equation model equation would choose ideal world
We good reason think word model equation enjoy better empirical support abstract
The equation choose often reflect compromise think best describes phenomenon computational tractability
So equation chosen rarely well validated
If want understand simulation result taken credible look epistemology simulation integrated whole cleanly divided verification would look inadequate task
So one point verification validation separable activity
But point two independent entity onto activity directed model chosen discretized method discretizing
Once one recognizes equation solved sometimes chosen cancel discretization error etc
Lenhard nice example involving Arakawa operator later distinction get harder maintain
So success achieved simulation kind piecemeal adjustment model method calculation
And case hard even know mean say simulation separately verified validated
No one argued V V useful distinction rather scientist overinflate pragmatically useful distinction clean methodological dictate misrepresents messiness practice
Collaterally Frigg Reiss argument absence epistemological novelty simulation fails reason
It purely mathematical question whether solution computer provides close enough actual unavailable solution useful
At least respect question answered pragmatic matter entirely using mathematical method
And hence issue arise ordinary modeling
Working scientist sometimes describe simulation study experimental term
The connection simulation experiment probably go back far von Neumann advocating early use computer physic noted many difficult experiment conducted merely determine fact ought principle derivable theory
Once von Neumann vision became reality experiment began replaced simulation became somewhat natural view version experiment
A representative passage found popular book simulation The idea silico experiment becomes even plausible simulation study designed learn happens system result various possible intervention What would happen global climate amount carbon added atmosphere
What happen airplane wing subjected strain
How would traffic pattern change onramp added location
Philosophers consequently begun consider sense computer simulation like experiment sense differ
A number view emerged literature centered around defending criticizing two thesis
Computer simulation study literally instance experiment

The identity thesis would true good reason weak version best reason stronger version reason strongest version necessary condition believe simulation provide warrant belief hypothesis support
A consequence strongest version identity thesis true reason believe simulation confer warrant believing hypothesis
The central idea behind epistemological dependence thesis experiment canonical entity play central role warranting belief scientific hypothesis therefore degree ought think simulation also play role warranting belief depends extent identified kind experiment
One find philosopher arguing identity thesis early Humphreys Hughes
And least implicit support stronger version epistemological dependence thesis Hughes
The earliest explicit argument favor epistemological dependence thesis however Norton Suppe
According Norton Suppe simulation warrant belief precisely literally experiment
They detailed story tell sense experiment supposed work
According Norton Suppe valid simulation one certain formal relation call realization hold base model modeled physical system computer running algorithm
When proper condition met simulation used instrument probing detecting real world phenomenon
Empirical data real phenomenon produced condition experimental control
One problem story formal condition set much strict
It unlikely many real example computer simulation meet strict standard
Simulation almost always far idealizing approximating enterprise
So simulation experiment probably way Norton Suppe imagined
More generally identity thesis drawn fire quarter
Gilbert Troitzsch argued major difference experiment one controlling actual object interest example chemistry experiment chemical investigation simulation one experimenting model rather phenomenon Gilbert Troitzsch
But seem right
Many Guala Morgan Parker Winsberg pointed problem claim
If Gilbert Troitzsch mean simulationists manipulate model sense abstract object claim difficult manipulate abstract entity
If hand simply mean point fact physical object simulationists digital actual object interest clear differs ordinary experiment
It false real experiment always manipulate exactly target interest
In fact real experiment simulation complex relationship manipulated investigation one hand system target investigation
In case experiment simulation therefore take argument substance establish external validity investigation establish learned system manipulated applicable system interest
Mendel example manipulated pea plant interested learning phenomenon heritability generally
The idea biology make idea perspicuous
We experiment interested understanding organism general use gene control development genealogy
We experiment provides useful model mutation genetic inheritance
But idea limited biology
Galileo experimented inclined plane interested object fall would behave absence interfering inclined plane experiment even actually instantiate
Of course view experiment uncontested
It true quite often experimentalists infer something system distinct system interfere
However clear whether inference proper part original experiment
Peschard mount criticism along line hence seen defender Gilbert Troitzsch
Peschard argues fundamental assumption experimentation simulation manipulated system standing target confused
It confuses Peshard argues experiment She argues epistemic motivation experiment might quite proper epistemic target experiment worm
In simulation according Peschard however epistemic target never digital computer
Thus simulation distinct experiment according epistemic target opposed merely epistemic motivation distinct object manipulated
Other opponent identity thesis include Giere Beisbart Norton Other Internet Resources
It clear adjudicate dispute seems revolve primarily around difference emphasis
One emphasize experiment simulation following Gilbert Troitzsch Peschard insisting experiment teach u first epistemic target secondarily allow inference behavior system
experiment worm teach u first instance worm secondarily allow u make inference genetic control generally
This would make conceptually different computer simulation thought teach u first instance behavior computer second instance storm galaxy whatever
Or one emphasize opposite way
One emphasize degree experimental target always chosen surrogate really interest
Morrison probably forceful defender emphasizing aspect similarity experiment simulation
She argues experimental practice indeed measurement practice involve kind modeling practice simulation
In case pace Peschard nothing debate maybe appeal ordinary language use scientist always compelling kind prevent u saying epistemic target storm simulation computer storm merely epistemic motivation studying computer
Be may many philosopher simulation including discussed section chosen latter way drawing attention way message lurking behind Gilbert Troitzch quoted claim paint overly simplistic picture experiment
It seem overly simplistic paint picture according experiment get world whereas situation
And picture one seems get Gilber Troitzsch quotation
Peschard sophisticated picture involving distinction epistemic target epistemic motivation go long way towards smoothing concern without pushing u territory thinking simulation experiment regard
Still despite rejecting Gilbert characterization difference simulation experiment Guala Morgan reject identity thesis
Drawing work Simon Guala argues simulation differ fundamentally experiment object manipulation experiment bear material similarity target interest simulation similarity object target merely formal
Interestingly Morgan accepts argument identity thesis seems hold version
She argues word difference experiment simulation identified Guala implies simulation epistemologically inferior real experiment intrinsically le power warrant belief hypothesis real world experiment
A defense epistemic power simulation Morgan argument could come form defense identity thesis form rejection epistemological dependency thesis
On former front seem two problem Guala argument identity thesis
The first notion material similarity weak second notion mere formal similarity vague required work
Consider example fact uncommon engineering science use simulation method study behavior system fabricated silicon
The engineer want learn property different design possibility silicon device develops computational model device run simulation behavior digital computer
There deep material similarity material cause work central processor computer silicon device studied
On Gaula line reasoning mark example real experiment seems wrong
The peculiarity example illustrate problem rather starkly problem fact quite general two system bear material similarity difference
On flip side idea existence formal similarity two material entity could mark anything interesting conceptually confused
Given two sufficiently complex entity many way formally identical mention similar
There also way formally completely different
Now speak loosely say two thing bear formal similarity really mean best formal representation two entity formal similarity

Paul Humphreys argued computer simulation profound implication understanding structure theory argues reveal inadequacy semantic syntactic view scientific theory
This claim drawn sharp fire Roman Frigg Julian Reiss
Frigg Reiss argue whether model admits analytic solution bearing relates world
They use example double pendulum show
Whether pendulum inner fulcrum held fixed fact determine whether relevant model analytically solvable bearing semantics element model
From conclude semantics model relates world unaffected whether model analytically solvable
This responsive however charitable reading Humphreys pointing
The syntactic semantic view theory account abstract scientific representation relate world
More particularly story relation particular model world rather relation world role model played relation
They also story lot say philosophically interesting action come scientific theorizing
The syntactic view suggested scientific practice could adequately rationally reconstructed thinking theory axiomatic system importantly logical deduction useful regulative ideal thinking inference theory world drawn
The syntactic view also omission made fairly clear modeling played anything role science
This feature syntactic view theory Frederick Suppe one ardent critic often railed
Theories nothing model theory could compared world without important role modeling play
The semantic view theory hand emphasize important role model also urged theory entity
It urged philosopher distracted contingency particular form linguistic expression theory might found say particular textbook
Computer simulation however seem illustrate theme misguided
It profoundly wrong think logical deduction right tool rationally reconstructing process theory application
Computer simulation show method theory application vastly outstrip inferential power logical deduction
The space solution example available via logical deduction theory fluid microscopic compared space application explored via computer simulation
On flip side computer simulation seem reveal Humphreys urged syntax matter
It wrong turn suggest semantic view particular linguistic form scientific theory expressed philosophically uninteresting
The syntax theory expression deep effect inference drawn kind idealization work well etc
Humphreys put point follows specific syntactic representation used often crucial solvability theory equation Humphreys
The theory fluid used emphasize point whether express theory Eulerian Lagrangian form deeply affect practice calculate affect idealization approximation calculational technique effective reliable circumstance
So epistemology computer simulation need sensitive particular syntactic formulation theory well particular formulation credentialed
Hence seem right emphasize Humphreys computer simulation revealed inadequacy syntactic semantic theory
Paul Humphreys Mark Bedau argued philosopher interested topic emergence learn great deal looking computer simulation
Philosophers interested topic consult entry contribution philosopher discussed
The connection emergence simulation perhaps best articulated Bedau
Bedau argued conception emergence must meet twin hallmark explaining whole depends part whole independent part
He argues philosopher often focus call strong emergence posit brute downward causation irreducible principle
But argues mistake
He focus instead call weak emergence reducibility whole part
Systems produce emergent property mere mechanism mechanism complex many independently interacting part
As result way figure exactly happen given specific set initial boundary condition except crawl causal web
It connection computer simulation arises
Weakly emergent property characteristic complex system nature
And also characteristic complex computer simulation way predict except let run
Weak emergence explains according Bedau computer simulation play central role science complex system
The best way understand predict real complex system behave simulate crawling web see happens
Models course involve idealization
But argued kind idealization play especially prominent role kind modeling involved computer simulation point deserve title This section discus attempt define fiction explore role computer simulation
There two different line thinking role fiction science
According one model fiction
This line thinking motivated considering role example ideal pendulum science
Scientists argued often make claim sort entity ideal pendulum period proportional length nowhere found real world hence must fictional entity
This line argument fictional entity science connect special way computer interested topic consult entry scientific representation forthcoming
Another line thinking fiction concerned question sort representation science ought regarded fictional
Here concern much ontology scientific model entity representational character various postulated model entity
Here Winsberg argued fiction special connection computer simulation
Or rather computer simulation contain element best typify might call fictional representation science even representation uniquely present simulation
He note first conception make representation contradicts reality fiction correspond ordinary use term rough map fiction
He proposes alternative definition nonfiction offered good enough guide part world fiction
But definition need refined
Take fable grasshopper ant
Although fable offer lesson world still fiction useful guide way world general sense rather specific guide way part world prima facie representational target singing grasshopper toiling ant
Nonfictions hand point certain part world guide part world
These kind fictional component model paradigmatically exemplified certain computer simulation
Two example silogen atom artificial Silogen atom appear certain nanomechanical model crack specie kind multiscale model blend quantum mechanic molecular mechanic mentioned section
The silogen containing model crack propagation silicon work describing crack using quantum mechanic region immediately surrounding crack using classical molecular dynamic
To bring together modeling framework two region boundary get treated contains silogen atom mixture property silicon hydrogen
Silogen atom fiction
They offered even good enough description atom prima facie representational target
But used overall model hoped get thing right
Thus overall model fiction one component
Artificial viscosity similar sort example
Fluids abrupt shock difficult model computational grid abrupt shock hide inside single grid cell resolved algorithm
Artificial viscosity technique pretend fluid highly shock shock becomes le abrupt blur several grid cell
Getting viscosity hence thickness shock wrong help get overall model work well Again overall model fluid fiction reliable enough guide behavior fluid
But component called artificial viscosity used reliably model shock
It incorporated larger modeling framework make larger framework reliable This account drawn two sort criticism
Toon argued definition fiction narrow
He give example historical fiction like argues fiction despite fact offered good enough guide people place event certain respect entitled take
Toon presumably support broader conception role fiction science according play particularly prominent heightened role computer simulation
Gordon Purves forthcoming argues example fiction computational model example imaginary crack elsewhere meet strict requirement discussed
Unlike Toon however also want delineate fictional modeling element one
His principal criticism criterion fictionhood term social norm Purves argues ought able settle whether piece modeling fiction absence norm
Thus want find intrinsic characterization scientific fiction
His proposal take constitutive model fiction fail characteristic Laymon called piecewise improvability PI
PI characteristic many model idealization say model becomes accurate
But silogen atom get accurate simulation silicon crack
But Purves take failure PI constitutive fiction rather merely symptomatic

two type experimental error
You need calculate type error science good understand difference calculate
Absolute error measure far measurement true value indication uncertainty measurement
For example measure width book using ruler millimeter mark best measure width book nearest millimeter
You measure book find mm
You report absolute error measurement mm mm
The absolute error mm
Note absolute error reported unit measurement
Alternatively may known calculated value want use absolute error express close measurement ideal value
Here absolute error expressed difference expected actual value
Absolute Error Actual Value Measured Value For example know procedure supposed yield liter solution obtain liter solution absolute error liter
You first need determine absolute error calculate relative error
Relative error express large absolute error compared total size object measuring
Relative error expressed fraction multiplied expressed percent
Relative Error Absolute Error Known Value For example driver speedometer say car going mile per hour mph actually going mph
The absolute error speedometer mph mph mph
The relative error measurement mph mph There error

type verifies software previously developed tested still performs way changed interfaced software
Changes may include software enhancement change etc
During regression testing new may uncovered
Sometimes software change impact analysis performed determine area could affected proposed change
These area may include area system
The purpose regression testing ensure change mentioned introduced new fault
One main reason regression testing determine whether change one part software affect part software
Common method regression testing include previously completed test checking whether program behavior changed whether previously fixed fault
Regression testing performed test system efficiently systematically selecting appropriate minimum set test needed adequately cover particular change
As software updated changed emergence new fault old fault quite common
Sometimes occurs fix get lost poor practice simple human error revision control
Often fix problem fix problem narrow case first observed general case may arise lifetime software
Frequently fix problem one area inadvertently cause another area
Finally may happen feature redesigned mistake made original implementation feature made redesign
Therefore software development situation considered bug located fixed record test expose bug test regularly subsequent change program
Although may done procedure using programming technique often done using tool
Such contains software tool allow testing environment execute regression automatically project even set automated system regression test specified interval report failure could imply regression test
Common strategy run system every successful compile small project every night week
Those strategy automated external tool
Regression testing integral part software development method
In method design document replaced extensive repeatable automated testing entire software package throughout stage
Regression testing done functional testing concluded verify functionality working
In corporate world regression testing traditionally performed team development team completed work
However defect found stage costly fix
This problem addressed rise
Although developer always written test case part development cycle test case generally either verify intended outcome
Developer testing compels developer focus unit testing include positive negative test case
The various regression testing technique This technique check test case current program check integrity
Though expensive need case ensures error modified code
Unlike Retest technique run part owing cost retest cost selecting part test suite le Retest technique
Prioritize test case increase test suite rate fault detection
Test case prioritization technique schedule test case test case higher priority executed test case lower priority
This technique hybrid Regression Test Selection Test Case Prioritization
Regression testing performed change made existing functionality software bug fix software
Regression testing achieved multiple approach approach followed provides certainty change made software affected existing functionality unaltered way
In agile project management process software development life cycle short resource scarce change software frequent Regression testing might introduce lot unnecessary overhead
Typically regression testing carried automation tool existing generation regression testing tool equipped handle application
For reason performing regression test database application could prove taxing would require great deal manual effort
Moreover software development environment tends use component third party performing regression testing tricky change third party component may interfere rest system performing regression testing third party component difficult unknown entity
Regression testing used testing program often also tracking quality output
For instance design regression testing could track code size time take compile execute test suite case
Also consequence introduction new bug program maintenance requires far system testing per statement written programming
Theoretically fix one must run entire batch test case previously run system ensure damaged obscure way
In practice must indeed approximate theoretical idea costly
Regression test broadly categorized
Functional test exercise complete program various input
Unit test exercise individual function object method
Both functional testing tool unit testing tool tend automated product part compiler suite
A functional test may scripted series program input possibly even involving automated mechanism controlling mouse movement click
A unit test may set separate function within code driver layer link code without altering code tested

Regression testing also referred selective retesting system modified ensure fixed previously working function failed result reparation newly added feature created problem previous version software
Regression testing initiated attempted fix recognized problem added program may inadvertently introduced error
It quality control measure ensure newly modified code still complies specified requirement unmodified code affected maintenance activity
This type software retesting common approach taken developer patch bug fix developed
In scenario regression testing ensure change adversely affect software system create problem elsewhere application

The significance software testing process affect software quality taken lightly
Software testing fundamental component software quality assurance represents review specification design coding
The greater visibility software system cost associated software failure motivating factor planning testing
Testing process executing program aim finding error
A good test case good chance finding undiscovered error
A successful test case uncovers new error
Software maintenance activity includes enhancement error correction optimization deletion obsolete capability
These modification software may cause software work incorrectly may affect part software developer maintain software system periodically regression test hoping find error caused change
To developer often create initial test suite reuse regression testing
Regression testing expensive maintenance process directed validating modified software
Regression Test Selection technique attempt reduce cost regression testing selecting test program existing test suite
The simplest regression testing method retest one conventional method regression testing test existing test suite
This method however expensive may require unacceptable amount time execute test test suite
An alternative method regression test selection rerun subset initial test suite
In technique instead rerunning whole test suite select part test suite rerun cost selecting part test suite le cost running test regression test selection allows u exclude
Of course approach unsatisfactory well test selection technique significant cost abandon test could disclose fault possibly reducing fault detection effectiveness
To reduce time cost testing process another approach Test Cases Prioritization testing procedure favorable engineer customer
In Test Case Prioritization technique test case executed way maximum objective function like rate fault detection achieved
In section paper described different type Regression Test Selection technique discussed various category type point various author moving detail selective prioritizing test case regression testing
In section also describe several technique prioritizing test case evaluate ability improve rate fault detection according various author
In next section particular describe Regression Test Selection technique Test Case Prioritization problem
Subsequent section present analysis conclusion During software development life cycle regression testing may start development phase system detection correction error program
Many modification may occur maintenance phase software system corrected updated
There three type modification arising different type maintenance
According corrective maintenance commonly called fix involves correcting software failure performance failure implementation failure order keep system working properly
Adapting system response changing data requirement processing environment constitutes adaptive maintenance
Finally perfective maintenance cover enhancement improve system processing efficiency maintainability
Based modification specification author identify two type regression testing Progressive regression testing involves modified specification
In corrective regression testing specification change
Corrective regression testing Progressive regression testing Specification changed Involves minor modification code adding deleting statement Usually done development corrective maintenance Many test case reused Invoked irregular interval Specification changed Involves major modification adding deleting module Usually done adaptive perfective maintenance Fewer test case reused Invoked regular interval Table Differences Corrective Progressive Regression Testing According table list major difference corrective progressive regression testing
Regression testing defined process retesting modified part software ensuring new error introduced previously tested code
There various regression testing technique given various researcher I Retest II Regression Test Selection III Test Case Prioritization
Technique reuses test existing test suite
It expensive compared technique
In report main focus Regression Test Selection Test Case Prioritization
Let P procedure program let P modified version P let T test suite A typical regression test proceeds follows
Select T C T set test execute P

Test P T establishing P correctness respect T

If necessary create T set new functional structural test P

Test P T establishing P correctness respect T

Create T new test suite test history P T T T
Although step involves important problem report restrict attention step involves Regression Test Selection problem
Regression Test Selection technique le expensive compare retest technique
Regression Test Selection technique reduce cost regression testing selecting subset existing test suite use retesting modified program
A variety regression test selection technique describing research literature
Authors describe several family technique consider five common approach often used practice
These technique attempt select minimal set test T yield coverage modified affected portion One technique requires every program statement added modified P executed possible least one test These technique select certain condition every test T expose one fault P
One technique selects every test T executed P exercised least one statement deleted P least one statement new modified P
These technique select test exercise data interaction affected modification
One technique selects every test T executed P exercised least one definition use pair deleted P least one pair modified P
When time constraint prohibit use approach test selection tool available developer often select test based hunch loose association test functionality
One simple technique randomly selects predetermined number test This technique reuses existing test
To test P technique selects test According Test Selection technique broadly classified three category
These consider test coverage criterion
These find coverable program part modified select test case work part
These similar coverage technique except select minimum set test case
These focus criterion coverage contrast select test case produce different output modified program compared original version
Regression test selection identifies negative impact modification applied software artifact throughout life cycle
In traditional approach code modified directly selective regression testing used identify negative impact modification
In approach modification first done model rather code
Consequently negative impact software quality identified mean selective regression testing
To date automated model based testing approach focus primarily automating test generation execution evaluation support regression test selection limited
regression test selection technique assume specification immutability technique select abstract test case based model modification
Thus model based Regression Test Selection technique existing test suite classified following three main type Reusable test case test case original test suite obsolete
Hence test case need
Test case test case traverse modified model element
Test case obsolete input modified
Regression Test Selection technique may create new test case test program area covered existing test case
Model based Regression test suite selection utilizes Unified Modeling Language UML based Use Case Activity Diagrams UCAD
The activity diagram commonly employed graphical representation behavioral activity software system
It represents functional behavior given use case
With behavior slicing built activity diagram
This diagram give u qualitative regression test
Using behavior slicing use case divided set behavior unit behavior represents user action

Initial node
User Action node
System Processing node
System Output node
Condition node
Final node The main purpose test case prioritization rank test case execution order detect fault early possible
There two benefit brought prioritization technique
First provides way find bug resource constraint condition thus improves revealed earlier engineer time fix bug
Zengkai Ma Jianjun Zhao propose new prioritization index called module TIM combine two prioritization factor fault proneness importance module
The main advantage prioritization approach twofold
First TIM value evaluated analyzing program structure call graph alone also evaluated incorporating program structure information available data source code change
Therefore approach applied regression testing also testing
Second analyzing program structure build mapping fault severity fault location
Those test case covering important part system assigned high priority executed first
As result severe fault revealed earlier system becomes reliable fast rate
The main contribution author They propose new approach evaluate testing importance module system combining analysis fault proneness module importance
They develop test case prioritization technique provide test case priority result handling multiple information program structure information source code change applied new developed software testing regression testing
They implement Apros tool test case prioritization based proposed technique perform experimental study approach
The result suggests Apros promising solution improve rate severe fault detection
Authors consider sample system consists six module exist call relationship module
A test suite includes six test case cover respectively
Some module dependent
They finding fault proneness fault severity using TIM system
They conclude prioritization result base analyzing structure system
For calculating result developed formula equation
They also experiment two Java program along JUnit test case jtopas
They select three sequential version two java program apply newly developed software testing regression testing
They perform experiment finding fault proneness severe fault
They also introduce importance module using weight fact
Authors explore approach prioritizing software system test objective improving software quality
Software testing strenuous expensive process
Research shown least total software cost comprised testing conclude approach prioritization test case work effectively regression testing analyzing program structure
They make reach prior TCP two goal improve customer confidence software quality cost effective way improve rate detection severe fault testing new code regression testing existing code
They present approach test case prioritization called Prioritization Requirements Test PORT
PORT based following four factor
Is based number time requirement changed development cycle
Is measure importance requirement customer
Is subjective measure difficult development team perceives implementation requirement
Of requirement FP allows development team identify requirement failure
They claim research paper Prioritization Requirement Test PORT great impact finding severe fault system level
They emphasis Customer priority TCP improve fault detection
Today software industry working neutral manner
They set neutral value requirement use case test case defect
To improve customer satisfaction software engineering world presenting approach system level testing
In day Regression Test Case Prioritization technique use structural coverage criterion select test case
They leading idea structure level code level TCP new Regression test
This Paper two main objective
Find severe fault earlier
Improve customer confidence particular system
Researchers describe several technique prioritizing test case empirically evaluate ability improve rate fault measure quickly fault detected within testing process
An improved rate fault detection regression testing provide earlier feedback system regression test let developer begin debugging correcting fault earlier might otherwise possible
Their result indicate test case prioritization significantly improve rate fault detection test suite
Furthermore result highlight tradeoff various prioritization technique
Test case prioritization address wide variety objective
In practice depending upon choice objective test case prioritization problem may intractable objective efficient solution problem would provide efficient solution knapsack problem
Authors consider nine different test case prioritization technique
One prioritization technique author consider simply application technique let u consider untreated test suite
Random prioritization author randomly order test test suite
An optimal ordering test case test suite maximizing suite rate fault detection
In practice course practical technique requires knowledge test case expose fault
We determine test case number decision branch program exercised test case
We prioritize test case according total number branch cover simply sorting order total branch coverage achieved
Total branch coverage prioritization schedule test case order total coverage achieved
However executed test case covered certain branch may gained subsequent test case covering branch yet covered
Additional branch coverage prioritization iteratively selects test case yield greatest branch coverage
prioritization consider whether statement branch exercised test case
This consideration may mask fact test case fault ability fault exposed test case depends whether test case reach executes faulty statement also probability fault statement cause failure test case
Although practical determination probability must approximation wished determine whether use approximation could yield prioritization technique superior term rate fault detection technique based simple code coverage
Analogous extension made total branch statement coverage prioritization additional branch statement coverage prioritization extend total FEP prioritization create additional FEP prioritization
This let u account fact additional execution statement may le valuable initial execution
In additional FEP prioritization selecting test case lower award value test case exercise statement exercised Total statement coverage prioritization total branch coverage prioritization except test coverage measured term program statement rather decision
Additional statement coverage prioritization additional branch coverage prioritization except test coverage measured term program statement rather decision
With technique require method prioritizing remaining test case complete coverage achieved work using total statement coverage prioritization
There many search technique test case prioritization developed unfolded various researcher field
Works next best search philosophy
It minimizes estimated cost reach particular goal
Its advantage cheap execution time implementation
The cost prioritization O mn program containing statement test suite containing n test case
This algorithm us feedback previous selection
It selects maximum weight element part already consumed previously selected element
Once complete coverage achieved remaining test case prioritized reapplying Additional Greedy algorithm
The cost prioritization O program containing statement test suite containing n test case
It one popular local search algorithm two variation steepest ascent next best ascent
It easy inexpensive execute
However con dividing O neighbor unlikely scale
Steps algorithm explained
Is search technique based Darwin theory survival fit test
The population set randomly generated individual
Each individual representing called gene chromosome
The basic step Genetic Algorithm Encoding Selection Cross Mutation
In paper discussed Regression test selection Test Case Prioritization Selection
Regression testing style testing focus retesting change made
In traditional regression testing reuse test regression test
In regression testing check module functionality use different test
Any test reused test become regression test
Regression testing naturally combine test technique
Therefore use Test Case Prioritization technique inside Regression Testing
Test prioritization make strengthen regression testing finding severe fault earlier stage
In paper discussed different factor prioritization
Customer priority great impact PORT
Our view test case selection First version test suite developed developer concrete test case
Also stage perform prioritization
With earlier prioritization test case reduce cost time effort maximize customer satisfaction Todd Graves Mary Jean Harrold Kim Adam Porters Gregg Rothermel An Empirical Study Regression Test Selection Techniques Proceedings International Conference Software Engineering April Page

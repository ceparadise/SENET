In simply classification data tell programmer intends use data
Most programming language support various type data example
A data type provides set value
variable function may take value
The type defines operation done data meaning data way value type type value expression may take value Data type used within type system offer various way defining implementing using
Different type system ensure varying degree
Almost programming language explicitly include notion data type though different language may use different terminology
Common data type include For example type represents set ranging value well operation performed integer addition subtraction multiplication
Colors hand represented three denoting amount red green blue one string representing color name allowable operation include addition subtraction multiplication
Most programming language also allow programmer define additional data type usually combining multiple element type defining valid operation new data type
For example programmer might create new data type named would include real imaginary part
A data type also represents constraint placed upon interpretation data describing representation interpretation structure stored computer memory
The type system us data type information check access manipulate data
Most data type statistic comparable type computer programming vice versa shown following table identified five definition type literature
Types including behavior align closely model whereas model would tend include code called
The five type The definition term representation often done imperative language definition term value space behaviour used language
typically type basic language implementation
All data computer based digital electronics represented alternative lowest level
The smallest addressable unit data usually group bit called usually bit
The unit processed instruction called typically bit
Most instruction interpret word word represent unsigned integer value signed integer value
Because machine language machine need distinguish unsigned signed data type part
There specific set arithmetic instruction use different interpretation bit word number
Machine data type need made available allowing control hardware
The instance supply integer type various width
If corresponding native type exist target platform compiler break code using type exist
For instance integer requested bit platform compiler tacitly treat array two bit integer
Several language allow convenient manipulation machine data
In higher level programming machine data type often hidden implementation detail would render code le portable exposed
For instance generic type might supplied instead integer specific
The represents value
Although two value possible rarely implemented single binary digit efficiency reason
Many programming language explicit Boolean type instead interpreting instance false value true
Boolean data simply refers logical structure language interpreted machine language
In case Boolean refers logic False
True always non zero especially one known Boolean
Such derived one primitive type
This done number way
The way combined called
Composing primitive type compound type generally result new type
different type
Many others possible tend variation compound
The distinct value compared assigned necessarily particular concrete representation computer memory compiler interpreter represent arbitrarily
For example four suit deck playing card may four enumerator named belonging enumerated type named
If variable declared data type one assign four value
Some implementation allow programmer assign integer value enumeration value even treat integer
Such Character string type store sequence character character set
Since character set include possible numeric string
However many language treat belonging different type numeric value
Character string type different subtypes according required character width
The original wide ASCII found limited superseded set encode wide variety alphabet symbol
Strings may either fixed size even programming language
They may also subtyped maximum size
Note string primitive language instance C may composed array character
Types based derived basic type explained
In language C type derived type
The main derived type data type whose value refers directly point another value stored elsewhere using
It primitive kind
In everyday term page number book could considered piece data refers another one
Pointers often stored format similar integer however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To ameliorate potential problem pointer considered separate type type data point even underlying representation
Any type specify implementation
For instance abstract type implemented array contiguous block memory containing multiple value set memory block linked
Abstract type handled code know care underlying type contained
Programming agnostic concrete data type called
Arrays record also contain underlying type considered concrete specify content element laid memory
Examples include For convenience language may supply real world data type instance even language allows built primitive type
A associate type computed value
By examining flow value type system attempt prove occur
The type system question determines constitutes type error type system generally seek guarantee operation expecting certain kind value used value operation make sense
A may use static type value optimize storage need choice algorithm operation value
In many compiler data type example represented accord
They thus use value addition multiplication etc
The depth type constraint manner evaluation affect language
A may associate operation varying concrete algorithm type case
study type system although concrete type system programming language originate practical issue computer architecture compiler implementation language design
Type system may variously forth

It arguable constructive type theory least based originated historically le influence design concrete programming language outside ML family
There also one application known linear type theory I find interesting I encountered recently
In short linear type theory thought variant constructive type theory hypothesis default rather default ca duplicated using prove word achieve particular goal
Recently I encountered implementation based linear type theory proof logical framework constructed based direct logical derivation set constant initial assumption set rule opposed kind inductive proof checked admissibility proof development system Coq Agda
The author said logical framework Chris Martens applying linear type theory interactive storytelling narrative generation I find quite interesting
For example possible model Shakespearian tragedy said logical framework use logical framework support automated proof search generate possible story play could end tragedy particular initial condition
link said project
I personally find exciting type theory also application like computer science
Straying slightly away computer science also application type theory computational linguistics I also find exciting
For example recently Jon Sterling Darryl McAdams haved applied type theory model pronoun binding presupposition resolution Continuing line work Jon lecture Darryl project
There also apparently used study formal syntax Ancient Greek interaction multilingual translation system name example
Overall I familiar application type theory computational linguistics however I find quite exciting potential type theory applied computional linguistics well
Still question
Ask

So I feel like lot people focusing computer c thing
That excite
The question computer people try leverage mathematics cool thing question answering
When getting degree computer science typically take lot calculus course form discrete mathematics likely course real analysis
Realistically people CS field use calculus often day day work
Discrete math boolean algebra logic important part regular software development
Being able manage boolean operator helpful creating sound branch statement regular programming help cleaner algorithm development
If work machine learning artificial intelligence probability statistic linear algebra hugely important
High level discrete mathematics number theory Little Theorem specifically extremely important cryptography study RSA security
If working low level subject like computer architecture system programming strong ability boolean algebra extremely helpful circuit design working operating system compiler
In general algorithmic analysis extremely important CS
This really pure math subject type thing Purdue entire course dedicated math surrounding proof analyzing algorithm complexity designing algorithm
From heard I taken class yet analysis algorithm important CS class anyone could take given applicable important concept industry research
answer extremely thorough well hit nail head term pure math CS
All
Every single area math used computer science
That new field heard going invented next Newton year

Computer Science IS Math
The math department considered safehaven day still seen something worthy degree
Now allow go tangent math thing way asking type question tend mathophobes I
If apply simply ignore follows
I already answered main question anyway
So good news
If need learn something program history largest library literally fingertip need learn linearly
Need know find distance two point
You probably already remember basic plotting cartesian coordinate skip get straight point spoiler pythagorean theorem reworded
Want learn standard deviation predictive algorithm want write
There ton website explain without archaic sigma symbol thrown
As learn concept either first time something apply already interested
It longer rote memorization instead start build intuitive understanding work perhaps even appreciate beauty elegance something considered another formula thousand teacher piling top
Additionally already know bit programming basic already understand math concept without even knowing
The sigma symbol I mentioned earlier
That basically set iteration
It say number set number return sum
So area math used computer science
All area math

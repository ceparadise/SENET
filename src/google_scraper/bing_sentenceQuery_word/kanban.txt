I curious kanban
I learned second ago reviewing another question
What involved would consider Kanban
b Also different process
I looked lot thread one related topic would one asking Kanban method developing product emphasis delivery overloading developer
It emphasizes developer pull work queue process definition task delivery customer displayed participant see
core property Personally I think one best fastest introduction Scrum Kanban
Here example whiteboard used Kanban What Kennethvr said
If familiar Scrum Agile methodology big difference The large takeaway team learn improve actually better long run one rely someone external change small change driven team may effective change like Scrum
My small experience Kanban applying principle even within loose Scrum framework bear
Kanban tool visualize waste work progress keep limited
Maybe go material slide share
There new presentation kanban
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

mean Japanese
It visual tool let work team literally see work process react based visual cue
Kan mean ban mean
In typical Kanban system card bin pallet visual cue let work team know current status workflow amount material system
Kanban historically pull though used wider set circumstance
A pull production control system one managed floor
As material needed factory floor pulled
The opposite type system would push one quota material pushed system based customer order whether floor ready yet
When shop grocery store see inventory shelf right store
It obvious grocer need see status inventory
Toyota management studied grocery store come Kanban system currently used factory
Kanban used goal eliminate waste making factory floor excess inventory unused material
Some key benefit Kanban system reduced storage requirement flexible production minimal waste minimized cost tied inventory reduced obsolete material material change made reduced overproduction
One simple type Kanban system called
In system manufacturer supplier cooperating sharing material management risk
The supplier keep one full bin
The manufacturer two bin one inventory one floor
When bin floor emptied one inventory get pulled onto floor
Then manufacturer supplier deliver bin inventory supplier know make another bin material ready go manufacturer
If use hamper laundry already using kanban system
Your hamper set fill dirty clothes
When hamper get full wash dry load clothes
The laundry process WIP
The hamper set back dirty clothes next cycle
The closet drawer hold clothes used currently

Another type system electronic concept material typically barcoded scanned specified point within manufacturing process
The system track much material used reorder point set visual cue
These electronic system eliminate problem traditional system like card lost manual entry error
A third type Kanban system project management
A used show much work system project
The rule system never allow much work one point system
The team manage workflow various stage
You ca much To Do list much work progress
began Toyota visual production control system tool card bin designed reduced waste minimize inventory factory
The benefit Kanban beyond waste inventory reduction also include reduced storage need flexible manufacturing reduced obsolescence reduced money tied
There different type Kanban system electronic system project management manages task project

literally system JIT
Kanban control
developed kanban improve manufacturing efficiency
Kanban one method achieve
Kanban became effective tool support running production system whole excellent way promote improvement
Problem area highlighted measuring lead time cycle time full process process step
One main benefit kanban establish upper limit inventory avoiding overloading manufacturing system
Other system similar effect example
A systematic study various configuration kanban system CONWIP important special case found Tayur among paper
An term capture meaning Japanese word kanban beneficial result
Operationally process problem dealt queue limit maximum reduced example former upper limit five piece reduced four queue time process reduced percent
In late Toyota started studying idea applying technique factory floor
In supermarket customer generally retrieve need required le
Furthermore supermarket stock expects sell given time customer take need future supply assured
This observation led Toyota view process customer one preceding process view preceding process kind store
Kanban aligns inventory level actual consumption
A signal tell supplier produce deliver new shipment material consumed
These tracked replenishment cycle bringing visibility supplier consumer buyer
Kanban us rate demand control rate production passing demand end customer chain process
In Toyota applied logic main plant machine shop
One key indicator success production scheduling based demand ability create
Kanban contrast part approach come demand
production determined according actual demand customer
In context supply time lengthy demand difficult forecast often best one respond quickly observed demand
This situation exactly kanban system accomplishes used demand signal immediately travel supply chain
This ensures intermediate stock held supply chain better managed usually smaller
Where supply response quick enough meet actual demand fluctuation thereby causing potential lost sale stock building may deemed appropriate achieved placing kanban system
Taiichi Ohno stated effective kanban must follow strict rule use
Toyota example six simple rule close monitoring rule task thereby ensuring kanban required
Toyota formulated six rule application kanban Kanban card key component kanban signal need move material within production facility move material outside supplier production facility
The kanban card effect message signal depletion product part inventory
When received kanban trigger replenishment product part inventory
Consumption therefore drive demand production kanban card signal demand kanban card help create system
It widely held proponent manufacturing system lead faster turnaround production lower inventory level helping company implementing system competitive
In last year system sending kanban signal electronically become widespread
While trend leading reduction use kanban card aggregate still common modern lean production facility find use kanban card
In various software system kanban used signalling demand supplier email notification
When stock particular component depleted quantity assigned kanban card kanban trigger created may manual automatic purchase order released predefined quantity supplier defined card supplier expected dispatch material within specified
Kanban card keeping principle kanban simply convey need material
A red card lying empty part cart conveys part needed
An example simple kanban system implementation system supplied part manufacturing
One bin factory floor initial demand point one bin factory store inventory control point one bin supplier
The bin usually removable card containing product detail relevant classic kanban card
When bin factory floor empty part used manufacturing process empty bin kanban card returned factory store inventory control point
The factory store replaces empty bin factory floor full bin factory store also contains kanban card
The factory store sends empty bin kanban card supplier
The supplier full product bin kanban card delivered factory store supplier keep empty bin
This final step process
Thus process never run could described closed loop provides exact amount required one spare bin never oversupply
This bin allows uncertainty supply use transport inventory system
A good kanban system calculates enough kanban card product
Most factory use kanban use coloured board system
Many manufacturer implemented sometimes referred system
These help eliminate common problem manual entry error lost card
system integrated ERP system enabling demand signaling across supply chain improved visibility
Data pulled system used optimize inventory level better tracking supplier lead replenishment time
signaling system us mix technology trigger movement material within manufacturing production facility
Electronic kanban differs traditional kanban us technology replace traditional element kanban card electronic message
A typical electronic kanban system mark inventory barcodes worker scan various stage manufacturing process signal usage
The scan relay message store ensure restocking product
Electronic kanban often us internet method routing message external supplier mean allow view inventory via portal throughout supply chain
Organizations used electronic kanban system improve process
Systems widespread single solution bolt module
In kanban system adjacent upstream downstream workstation communicate card container kanban associated
Economic Order Quantity important
The two important type kanbans

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
Kanban visual signal used trigger action
The word kanban Japanese roughly translated mean card Toyota introduced refined use kanban relay system standardize flow part production line
The approach inspired management team visit Piggly Wiggly supermarket United States Engineer Taiichi Ohno observed store shelf stocked enough product meet consumer demand inventory would restocked visual signal case empty space shelf
In manufacturing Kanban start customer order follows production downstream
At simplest kanban card inventory number attached part
Right part installed kanban card detached sent request another part
In environment part manufactured ordered kanban card
Because request part pulled order kanban sometimes referred pull system
There six generally accepted rule kanban
Downstream process may withdraw item precise amount specified kanban

Upstream process may send item downstream precise amount sequence specified kanban

No item made moved without kanban

A kanban must accompany item time

Defects incorrect amount never sent next downstream process

The number kanbans monitored carefully reveal problem opportunity improvement
The concept providing visual clue reduce unnecessary inventory also applied

The development team Dan software company extremely productive
However would productive without disruption come moving project phase
They decided use agile development method focus continuous flow work
As make transition Dan look help team understand origin Kanban principle behind well importance Kanban board bring together
The concept Kanban two source inspiration
The first involves approach grocery store use inventory
They focus keeping item shelf restocking purchased since inefficient costly stockpile inventory
The concept action occur triggered action
Specifically purchase action trigger action restocking trigger additional inventory purchased
The second inspiration way Toyota managed factory based method
Their goal action occur response applicable triggering action
The contribution software development involves way action relayed
A Japanese card passed team signal new action
The principle Kanban based concept inventory kanban card
These principle include visual display continuous flow limit ensure efficiency
They form basis Kanban integral Kanban board
The first principle Kanban involves visual display
This directly derived Toyota use card factory
From project work various state progress Kanban visual methodology
The purpose keep everyone page focused making everything visual
Another principle Kanban maintaining continuous flow
This come approach inventory based completed action triggering action
In contrast methodology think process sequence set start endpoint
The last principle involves using limit ensure efficiency
Specifically Kanban us limit number item allowed point progress
Items allowed advance many next progress point
The goal prevent item piling point
This another element continuous flow
Once Dan team understanding Kanban look implement using provides visual display project work various point progress leading completion
The Kanban board main component Kanban enables various principle accomplished
The design Kanban board focus primary concern project project work status
These two element relevant everyone involved project stakeholder development team member
The project work status also main identifier project success
The project work displayed Kanban board using card
These work item take one two form depending level definition
The first defines benefit outcome specific user
User story form item developed tested team
The second description functionality thought user story large complex
Epics must better defined broken user story order taken initially displayed card board

The progress work item substance Kanban board forming vertical lane board user story card move
The first lane work yet started next available item head line
This known often label column
However could also labeled something like Do
This column contain epic addition user story although must broken user story order progress
The next lane lane depending work best team current work
For team prefer use single lane status label often Progress
If team prefers multiple lane provide detail use label like
These lane continuous flow principle applicable WIP limit used
A user story move Testing Development Development WIP limit
The final lane contains user story completed
This lane typically labeled user story fully developed tested
The key lane everyone common understanding done mean
The goal user story move quickly possible
inspiration approach inventory used grocery story Toyota factory adopted practice added use card signal trigger needed action
The use card facilitates visual display principle continuous flow made efficient use
The enables principle carried
The project work take form displayed using card
The card advance various status lane board Do column Progress column finally column

I noticed Lean Kanban term appears quite frequently
I tried figure difference Lean Kanban Classic success
Maybe someone dealt could describe difference explain use
Lean Kanban agile Scrum
One concrete implementation
Using term lean kanban attempt court favour keyword density result copywriter rather actual thing
All Kanban Lean
But Lean Kanban Kanban lean methodology focused creating continuous flow work eliminating waste muda system
There difference Kanban Lean Kanban
Where difference however Kanban software development differs slightly classic Lean Kanban formulated Toyota used manufacturing environment
Here good book focus kanban software development get nuance
Kanban Successful Evolutionary Change Your Technology Business Paperback April David Anderson Author Donald G Reinertsen Foreword The basic process tool objective Kanban software development remain unchanged WIP JIT Slack Pull Model Cycle Time SLA Work Classes Flow Eliminate Waste Visualize work
However work visualized Kanban board bit flexible traditional kanban
Also work software kanban board necessarily sized forced sized
Its also fairly common see software team using Kanban adopting practice Scrum daily standup retrospective Product Owner concept etc
Some people call type team Scrumban team
Kanban Lean tool
There Kanban Lean Kanban

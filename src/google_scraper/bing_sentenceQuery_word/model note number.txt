A model generally constructed object process least partially understood difficult observe directly
Examples include stick ball representing molecule mathematical model planetary movement conceptual principle like ideal gas law
Because infinite variation actually found nature simplest vague model imperfect representation phenomenon
The ideal gas law excellent example model term usefulness imperfection
It state within particular volume gas particular temperature pressure number gas molecule atom exactly calculated regardless actual composition gas involved
However called ideal gas law reason
It assumes uniform condition throughout given volume gas condition almost never actually met
Bodies gas real world even within sealed container variation temperature pressure along accompanying current
Similarly equation volume sphere give good approximation volume roughly spherical object perfect sphere likely exist actual nature

A plural simply mathematical
It exactly one finite number given time
The FSM change one state another response external change one state another called
An FSM defined list state initial state condition transition
The behavior state machine observed many device modern society perform predetermined sequence action depending sequence event presented
Examples dispense product proper combination coin deposited whose sequence stop determined floor requested rider change sequence car waiting require input combination number proper order
The finite state machine le computational power model computation
The computational power distinction mean computational task Turing machine FSM
This FSM limited number state
FSMs studied general field
An example simple mechanism modeled state machine
A turnstile used control access subway amusement park ride gate three rotating arm waist height one across entryway
Initially arm locked blocking entry preventing patron passing
Depositing coin slot turnstile unlocks arm allowing single customer push
After customer pass arm locked another coin inserted
Considered state machine turnstile two possible state
There two possible input affect state putting coin slot pushing arm
In locked state pushing arm effect matter many time input given stay locked state
Putting coin giving machine input shift state
In unlocked state putting additional coin effect giving additional input change state
However customer pushing arm giving input shift state back
The turnstile state machine represented showing possible state transition based upon input given machine output resulting input The turnstile state machine also represented called
Each state represented
Edges show transition one state another
Each arrow labeled input trigger transition
An input cause change state input state represented circular arrow returning original state
The arrow node black dot indicates initial state
A description status system waiting execute
A transition set action executed condition fulfilled event received
For example using audio system listen radio system radio state receiving next stimulus result moving next station
When system CD state next stimulus result moving next track
Identical stimulus trigger different action depending current state
In machine representation also possible associate action state Several type used
The common representation shown combination current state
B input
Y show next state
C
The complete action information directly described table added using footnote
A FSM definition including full action information possible using see also
The notation describing state machine
overcome limitation traditional finite state machine retaining main benefit
UML state machine introduce new concept extending notion
UML state machine characteristic
They support depend state system triggering Mealy machine well associated state rather transition Moore machine
The standard includes graphical symbol describe action transition SDL embeds basic data type called Abstract Data Types action language execution semantic order make finite state machine executable
There large number variant represent FSM one figure
In addition use modeling reactive system presented finite state machine significant many different area including
Finite state machine class automaton studied
In computer science finite state machine widely used modeling application behavior design study computation language
Finite state machine subdivided transducer acceptor classifier sequencer
also called produce binary output indicating whether received input accepted
Each state FSM either accepting accepting
Once input received current state accepting state input accepted otherwise rejected
As rule input character action used
The example figure show finite state machine accepts string nice
In FSM accepting state state
A possibly infinite set symbol sequence aka
formal language called Finite State Machine accepts exactly set
For example set binary string even number zero regular language cf
Fig
set string whose length prime number
A machine could also described defining language would contain every string accepted machine none rejected one language accepted machine
By definition language accepted FSMs language regular FSM accepts
The problem determining language accepted given finite state acceptor instance generalization graph edge weighted element arbitrary
The start state also accepting state case automaton accepts empty string
An example accepting state appears DFA detects whether input string contains even number
also start state indicates state even number input
S therefore accepting state
This machine finish accept state binary string contains even number including binary string containing
Examples string accepted DFA etc
A generalization finite state machine similar acceptor produce single output termination two terminal state
generate output based given input state using action
They used control application field
In control application two type distinguished subclass acceptor transducer type
They produce one sequence seen output sequence acceptor transducer output
A distinction automaton
In deterministic automaton every state exactly one transition possible input
In automaton input lead one one transition given state
The algorithm transform nondeterministic automaton usually complex deterministic automaton identical functionality
A finite state machine one state called combinatorial FSM
It allows action upon transition state
This concept useful case number finite state machine required work together convenient consider purely combinatorial part form FSM suit design tool
There set semantics available represent state machine
For example tool modeling designing logic embedded controller
They combine usually one current state flow graph one language resulting different formalism set semantics
These chart like Harel original state machine support hierarchically nested state state action transition action
In accordance general classification following formal definition found For deterministic FSMs conventional allow
defined every combination
If FSM state next symbol defined announce error
reject input
This useful definition general state machine le useful transforming machine
Some algorithm default form may require total function
A finite state machine computational power restricted head may perform read operation always move left right
That formal language accepted finite state machine accepted kind restricted Turing machine vice versa
If output function function state input alphabet definition corresponds modelled
If output function depends state definition corresponds modelled
A machine output function known
If disregard first output symbol Moore machine readily converted Mealy machine setting output function every Mealy transition
labeling every edge output symbol given destination Moore state
The converse transformation le straightforward Mealy machine state may different output label incoming transition edge
Every state need split multiple Moore machine state one every incident output symbol
Optimizing FSM mean finding machine minimum number state performs function
The fastest known algorithm
Other technique include using
Additionally acyclic FSAs minimized linear time
In FSM may built using
More specifically hardware implementation requires store state variable block determines state transition second block combinational logic determines output FSM
One classic hardware implementation
In output directly connected state minimizing time delay output
Through state machine may optimized minimize power consumption
The following concept commonly used build software application finite state machine Finite automaton often used programming language compiler
Such frontend may comprise several finite state machine implement parser
Starting sequence character lexical analyzer build sequence language token reserved word literal identifier parser build syntax tree
The lexical analyzer parser handle regular part programming language grammar
Finite process also known

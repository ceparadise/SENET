In traditionally either kind variable
The latter may allow element mutated length changed may fixed creation
A string generally understood often implemented store sequence element typically character using
A string may also denote general sequence data type structure
Depending programming language precise data type used declared string may either cause storage memory statically allocated predetermined maximum length employ allow hold variable number element
When string appears literally known anonymous string
In used string finite sequence chosen called
Let Σ symbol alternatively called character called
No assumption made nature symbol
A Σ finite symbol Σ
For example Σ string Σ
The string number symbol length sequence often denoted
The unique string Σ length denoted
The set string Σ length denoted Σ
For example Σ Σ
Note Σ ε alphabet Σ
The set string Σ length Σ denoted Σ
In term Σ For example Σ Σ ε
Although set Σ element Σ string finite length
A set string Σ
Σ called Σ
For example Σ set string even number zero ε formal language important Σ
For two string Σ concatenation defined sequence symbol followed sequence character denoted
For example Σ b z
String concatenation operation
The empty string ε serf string ε ε
Therefore set Σ concatenation operation form generated Σ
In addition length function defines Σ integer function
A string said exist possibly empty string
The substring defines Σ empty string
A string said exists string
If nonempty said prefix
Symmetrically string said exists string
If nonempty said suffix
Suffixes prefix substring
Both relation prefix suffix
A string said rotation
For example Σ string rotation u v
The reverse string string symbol reverse order
For example abc b c symbol alphabet reverse cba
A string reverse madam called also includes empty string string length
It often useful define set string
If alphabet Σ cf
one define total order Σ called
For example Σ lexicographical order Σ includes relationship ε
The lexicographical order alphabetical order nontrivial alphabet even alphabetical order
See alternative string ordering preserve
A number additional operation string commonly occur formal theory
These given article
Strings admit following interpretation node graph The natural topology set string string discrete topology natural topology set infinite string viewing set infinite string set finite string
This construction used construction yield topology
string representation topology found normalizing according
A datatype modeled idea formal string
Strings important useful datatype implemented nearly every
In language available others
The programming language allows string usually quoted way represent instance string datatype called
Although formal string arbitrary finite length length string real language often constrained artificial maximum
In general two type string datatypes fixed maximum length determined compile time use amount memory whether maximum needed whose length arbitrarily fixed use varying amount memory depending actual requirement
Most string modern string
Of course even string limited length number bit available pointer size available
The string length stored separate integer may put artificial limit length implicitly termination character usually character value bit zero

String datatypes historically allocated one byte per character although exact character set varied region character encoding similar enough programmer could often get away ignoring since character program treated specially period space comma place encoding program would encounter
These character set typically based
If text one encoding displayed system using different encoding text often though often somewhat readable computer user learned read mangled text
language known collectively need far character limit one byte encoding reasonable representation
The normal solution involved keeping representation ASCII using representation CJK
Use existing code led problem matching cutting string severity depended character encoding designed
Some encoding family guarantee byte value ASCII range represent ASCII character making encoding safe system use character field separator
Other encoding make guarantee making matching byte code unsafe
These encoding also locating character boundary required backing start string pasting two string together could result corruption second string
simplified picture somewhat
Most programming language datatype Unicode string
Unicode preferred byte stream format designed problem described older multibyte encoding
require programmer know code unit different character main difficulty currently incorrectly designed APIs attempt hide difference make character due composing code
Some language like implement string used datatype exception rule
Some language normally allow content string changed created termed string
In language value fixed new string must created alteration made termed string
Strings typically implemented byte character code unit order allow fast access individual unit character fixed length
A language implement instead
Some language avoid implementing dedicated string datatype instead adopting convention representing string list character code
Representations string depend heavily choice character repertoire method character encoding
Older string implementation designed work repertoire encoding defined ASCII recent extension like series
Modern implementation often use extensive repertoire defined Unicode along variety complex encoding
The term usually indicates string byte rather string readable character string bit
Byte string often imply byte take value data stored meaning value interpreted termination value
Most string implementation similar entry storing corresponding character
The principal difference certain encoding single logical character may take one entry array
This happens example single code code point take anywhere one four byte single character take arbitrary number code
In case logical length string number character differs physical length array number byte use
avoids first part problem
The length string stored implicitly using special terminating character often NUL bit zero convention used perpetuated popular
Hence representation commonly referred
This representation string take space terminator thus
In terminated string terminating code allowable character string
Strings field limitation also store arbitrary
An example stored along modern representation The length string example character occupies byte
Characters terminator form part representation may either part data garbage
Strings form sometimes called original directive used declare
Using special byte null terminating string historically appeared hardware software though sometimes value also printing character
used many assembler system used system character value zero used since string delimiter BASIC language
Somewhat similar data processing machine like used special bit delimit string left operation would start right
This bit clear part string
This meant IBM word almost ever thought use feature override assignment seventh bit example handle ASCII code
Early microcomputer software relied upon fact ASCII code use bit set indicate end string
It must reset prior output
The length string also stored explicitly example prefixing string length byte value convention used many dialect consequence people call string
Storing string length byte limit maximum string length
To avoid limitation improved implementation use store string length
When field cover string limited
If length bounded encoded constant space typically machine word thus leading taking space number character word ASCII machine machine etc
If length bounded encoding length take log space see string encoding string length log space
In latter case field fixed length therefore actual string data need moved string grows length field need increased
Here Pascal string stored buffer along ASCII representation Many language including one implement string internal structure like However since implementation usually string must accessed modified member function
pointer dynamically allocated memory area might expanded needed
See also
Both character termination length code limit string For example C character array contain null NUL character handled directly C string library function Strings using length code limited maximum value length code
Both limitation overcome clever programming
It possible create data structure function manipulate problem associated character termination principle overcome length code bound
It also possible optimize string represented using technique replacing repeated character character value length
While representation common others possible
Using make certain string operation insertion deletion concatenation efficient
The core data structure one manages string sequence character represents current state file edited
While state could stored single long consecutive array character typical text editor instead us alternative representation sequence data line make certain string operation insertion deletion undoing previous edits efficient
The differing memory layout storage requirement string affect security program accessing string data
String representation requiring terminating character commonly susceptible problem terminating character present caused coding error deliberately altering data
String representation adopting separate length field also susceptible length manipulated
In case program code accessing string data requires ensure inadvertently access change data outside string memory limit
String data frequently obtained program
As responsibility program validate string ensure represents expected format
Performing limited validation cause program vulnerable attack
Sometimes string need embedded inside text file intended consumption machine
This needed example source code programming language configuration file
In case NUL character work well terminator since normally invisible difficult input via keyboard
Storing string length would also inconvenient manual computation tracking length tedious
Two common representation While character string common us string string computer science may refer generically sequence homogeneously typed data
A example may used represent retrieved communication medium
This data may may represented datatype depending need application desire programmer capability programming language used
If programming language string implementation data corruption may ensue
C programmer draw sharp distinction string aka string character definition always null terminated byte string pseudo string may stored array often null terminated
Using function byte string often seems work later lead
There many processing string various
Some category algorithm include Advanced string algorithm often employ complex mechanism data structure among
The name coined computer scientist issue algorithm data structure used string processing
Character string useful datatype several language designed order make string processing application easy write
Examples include following language Many utility perform simple string manipulation used easily program powerful string processing algorithm
Files finite stream may viewed string
Some like use string hold command interpreted
Recent including Perl Ruby Tcl employ facilitate text operation
Perl particularly noted regular expression use many language application implement
Some language Perl Ruby support permit arbitrary expression evaluated included string literal
used manipulate string change edit content string
They also used query information string
They usually used within context
The basic example string function function function return length string counting terminator character string internal structural information modify string
This function often named
For example would return
In alternative string
It ability altered adding appending whereas String normally fixed
standard way handle text use
Any given Java mean changed
A
Whenever must manipulated change require creation new turn involves creation new array character copying original array
This happens even original value intermediate used manipulation kept
Java provides two alternate class string manipulation called
Both like array hold character
They however mutable state altered
Their array character necessarily completely filled opposed String whose array always exact required length content
Thus capability add remove change state without creating new object without creation new array array copying
The exception array longer suitable length hold content case rarely happens default Dynamic memory allocation provided JVM
In case required create new array copy content
For reason Java would handle expression like like Generally String string handling
However necessarily case since StringBuffer required recreate character array run space
Theoretically possible happen number time new String would required although unlikely programmer provide length hint prevent
Either way effect noticeable modern desktop computer
As well shortcoming array inherent
In order insert remove character arbitrary position whole section array must moved
The method attractive environment low processing power take ability using much memory likely also premium environment
This point however trivial considering space required creating many instance Strings order process
As well StringBuffer optimized waste little memory possible
The class introduced differs

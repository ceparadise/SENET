Do cheat even struggling work
There lot CS major graduating right pathetic cheat everything
Do side project learn git use
Try fall trap shitty classmate
Does Sohn allow cheater get class
I recall year ago fought dept get Sohn instated hard as required graduation hoped would weed poor student thus increase quality resultant diploma
I really want know whats going got NJIT grad company took Sohn fuckin suck know shit
He know basic learn like class instantiate object
We put tech support good good anyway
I pissed I wanted tear head I constantly odds Director Engineering
He always joking good student come NJIT bother wasting time money going career fair
I fighting hard prove wrong shit come school I feel like hope lost
If need full time December let know nah I super sure actually CoE people get class
All need pas quiz least last semester assignment collected
So pas exam people without coding
As sure know knowing idea different actually coding
All need pas quiz least last semester assignment collected
Wait
Are referring Sohn class
Yes changed requirement
The midterm final
People scrape
I work full time ca go class I employed software engineer
The quality assignment lecture high I wish would require work completed
Wait saying assignment total grade
EDIT looked latest syllabus holy cow
How happen
After fighting department take I repeated class even though I took Ryon I could get as whooping assignment
Too many people must failing class
I disappointed
This explains new clown company got CS program
It starting feel like lost cause
Yeah pretty much gave transcript I saw last year feedback
It going hurt reputation NJIT
I made mission network outside school community
Many employer avoid NJIT like plague
We horrible reputation despite gem faculty student body
What feedback like last year
How see feedback
I rather say showed something along line need take away hope new student early possible computer science programming easy
Teach C Make CS program harder
I laughed feedback although I agree harder
I agree teach C industry better system language designed
Not really
C perfect middle ground embedded FPGA level coding logic interpreted language like python
I looked syllabus well I feel like kind policy NJIT whereby one item
final exam could worth XX final grade
I sure departmental thing number would came back superstorm Sandy took common exam schedule Physics professor changing course grade breakdown compensate
I taking another guy midterm final pop quiz never gave automatically get point Can tell career fair
Who come
Do people actually get hired
I graduating IT major go
A lot faculty great finding cheater even practice make cheating super easy
Online exam question taken googleable quiz
Exams change year year
Projects half people floor completed previous semester
It easy get work people done
Also easy group project nothing let everyone else carry
guy
I know many senior got job easily I know one confused struggling much
And actually learn anything despite well class
If enjoy CS outside class I learned everything I know IT programming stuff fun outside class
By participating community
Classes reinforce knowledge make concrete learning outside class building block build knowledge
Thank
This useful advice
Thank hit nail perfectly
We situation procrastinated chance fail assignment take someone el code
You want successful college think realize grade important need able thing thing well
Cheating never get
Any advice thing learn outside class
Again I would use git side project learn
Depending plan JavaScript side thing really popular Angular Node Backbone
I would try figure want life work thing project language technology
A fundamental language Assembly basic fortran COBOL scripting language BASH Kshell
Learn embedded programming future
Also learn adaptation
Would Python suffice scripting language
Assembly sound little low level taste
Would C suffice
I open learning new thing I want make sure I actually use point
C Python together along java NJIT make learn good want go coding software development
Any career requires extensive supplementation beyond NJIT offer
Coding Apps
really
Coding embedded IoT COE
Coding big data
NO Coding system testing maintenance
Nope maybe IT
How machine learning big data
Any tip
No NJIT CS class I aware teach coding level machine learning neural network fuzzy logic
That said
Embedded programming machine learning future worth teaching
embedded programming future Can elaborate
I working learning ARM side
The internet thing
Basically computing split large cloud based small efficient embedded system future
ARM good architecture learn
deleted When I took freshman A CS major even move deleted based Python right
version
The version really matter
The general programming concept syntax still across every version last year
Not sure rate Probably bunch major nothing programming stupidly forced take
Or people programming saw part assumed would easy elective required basic literacy skill rather programming
What I prepare Calc since I took AP Calc already HS
As struggling CS major make learn programming language understand
You make sure practice time well even even class
CS CS really easy CS everything else really good problem solving programming
Dont memory stuff learn understand
If hate math programming change major
Not enough I say
I IT major class IT CS major must take
I Java
As make use required tutoring hour
When studying exam I terribly first
But I changed studying habit redoing practice final til I could eye closed
This helped raise next two exam grade range
Always programming assignment
It tough reward knowing worth
Good luck
Be good math

In one hundred year Babbage impossible dream convinced IBM making kind punched card equipment also calculator business develop giant programmable calculator based Babbage Analytical Engine used card central computing unit
When machine finished hailed Babbage dream come true
During new powerful machine developed term came refer machine rather human predecessor
As became clear computer could used mathematical calculation field computer science broadened study general
Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch
As discipline computer science span range topic theoretical study algorithm limit computation practical issue implementing computing system hardware software
formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation made representative ACM IEEE CS four area considers crucial discipline computer science
In addition four area CSAB also identifies field software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking communication database system parallel computation distributed computation interaction computer graphic operating system numerical symbolic computation important area computer science

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

I bit confused meaning Maven Snapshot build one
A snapshot version Maven one released
The idea release release done exists
That version
It basically development
This might real release pretty far right release example
The difference real version snapshot version snapshot might get update
That mean downloading today might give different file downloading yesterday tomorrow
Usually snapshot dependency exist development released version
dependency snapshot version
The three others answer provide good vision version
I wanted add information regarding behavior Maven find dependency
When build application Maven search dependency repository
If stable version found search remote repository defined retrieve dependency
Then copy local repository make available next build
For example library considered version Maven find local repository use one current build
Now need library Maven know version stable subject change
That Maven try find newer version remote repository even version library found local repository
However check made per day
That mean
library generated local repository run Maven build day Maven check repository newer version
Maven provides way change update policy repository definition model found The SNAPSHOT term mean build snapshot code given time
It usually mean version version still heavy development
When come time release code want change version listed pom
So instead SNAPSHOT would something like
For help versioning check
A release final build version change
A snapshot build replaced another build name
It implies build could change time still active development
You different artifact different build based code

might one debugging one without
One Java one Java
Generally simpler one build everything need
This snapshot look like repository case enabled mean repository referred stable need update
Another case would mean Maven look update repository
You also specify interval update tag
usually maven two type build Snapshot build Release build snapshot build SNAPSHOT special version indicate current deployment copy like regular version maven check version every build remote repository snapshot build nothing maintainance build
Release build Release mean removing SNAPSHOT version build regular build version
Maven version contain string literal SNAPSHOT signify project currently active development
For example project version deploy artifact Maven repository Maven would expand version deploy release PM February UTC
In word deploy snapshot making release software component releasing snapshot component specific time
So mainly snapshot version used project active development
If project depends software component active development depend snapshot release Maven periodically attempt download latest snapshot repository run build
Similarly next release system going version project would version formally released
For example following dependency would always download latest development JAR spring An example maven release process By posting answer agree

Photo Scott Brauer n MIT researcher helping invent discipline computer science think computer scientist thought electrical engineer physicist mathematician
Operating system programming language tool needed order maximize productivity hugely complex new machine building
By however computer science developed enough autonomy MIT Department Electrical Engineering changed name becoming Department Electrical Engineering Computer Science EECS
Now Computer Science Artificial Intelligence Laboratory CSAIL largest lab MIT
EECS may midst similar expansion intellectual boundary
According department head Anantha Chandrakasan Joseph Nancy Keithley Professor Electrical Engineering exciting research lie intersection EECS discipline
That includes research technique making sense massive amount information unleashed Web biological medical physic research financial industry well energy biomedical research
More third faculty interested biomedical space Chandrakasan say
At time Chandrakasan say core EECS curriculum popular ever
EECS long drawn largest undergraduate enrollment MIT since day EE
But year Chandrakasan say enrollment department two introductory course MIT system reached high
Nearly half MIT undergraduate take regardless major Chandrakasan say
With big data field large part reaping sowed
Exponential increase computing power simpler tool exploiting led explosion online data
But rapidly computer improved machine improved even rapidly
Meanwhile physic experiment Large Hadron Collider generate petabyte data every day
Andrew Lo Charles Susan Harris Professor Finance MIT Sloan School Management MIT faculty since last year secondary appointment EECS became primary investigator CSAIL
Recently Lo used technique borrowed computer science mine data data transaction conducted customer financial institution risk default delinquency
Lo one researcher bigdata CSAIL new initiative led professor computer science engineering Sam Madden
Madden investigates technique interpreting sensor data among thing
Other project participant include professor computer science engineering Piotr Indyk whose calculating developed professor computer science engineering Dina Katabi broad range application context associate professor computer science engineering Rob Miller find way enlist execution large task
As people store data online however becomes vulnerable attack
Nickolai Zeldovich associate professor software technology another member bigdata CSAIL together Charles Piper Professor Computer Science Engineering researched way web application Zeldovich Katabi introduced new way wireless transmission
And cryptography luminary Shafi Goldwasser RSA Professor Computer Science Engineering winner Association Computing Machinery Gödel Prize theoretical computer science developed algorithm attack
Goldwasser colleague Cryptography Information Security Group CSAIL le illustrious
Ford Professor Engineering shared Gödel Prize Goldwasser development proof
The group faculty member adjunct professor computer science engineering Butler Lampson Andrew Erna Viterbi Professor Computer Science Engineering recipient Turing Award commonly referred Nobel Prize computer science
In nine researcher affiliated MIT Turing Award recently Institute Professor
Other CSAIL researcher associate professor computer science professor computer science engineering developing novel algorithm finding biologically informative pattern mountain genetic data
But another central area convergence computer science medicine analysis interpretation signal biomedical sensor
For instance CSAIL associate professor computer science engineering find correlation anomaly brain scan
Similarly George Verghese Research Laboratory Electronics RLE Henry Warren Ellis Professor Electrical Engineering developed algorithm could intracranial pressure data ultrasound scan blood pressure measurement rather requiring physician drill hole patient skull
CSAIL John Guttag Dugald Jackson Professor Computer Science Engineering RLE Collin Stultz associate professor biomedical engineering mined electrocardiogram data patient risk heart failure RLE Elfar Adalsteinsson associate professor electrical engineering computer science health science technology Vivek Goyal associate professor electrical engineering computer science developed algorithm could minute
The search alternative source energy squarely within purview classical electrical engineering RLE researcher associate professor electrical engineering Mark Baldo professor electrical engineering Vladimir Bulovic instance developing even solar cell Bulovic Jing Kong ITT Career Development Associate Professor Electrical Engineering showed graphene layer carbon atom could offer much way provide device
Tomás Palacios Microsystems Technology Laboratory Emanuel Landsman Career Development Associate Professor Electronics shown using gallium arsenide power converter switch alternating direct current could cut mechanical device power consumption
Associate department head Munther Dahleh professor electrical engineering computer science hand approaching energy problem le directly
Among Dahleh investigates type control principle studied Laboratory Information Decision Systems management power grid
The department undergraduate curriculum increasingly interdisciplinary flavor
Its introductory course concentrate robotics communication respectively canvassing wide range topic control theory algorithm signal processing circuit design
Chandrakasan say department planning offer third introductory course concentrate biomedical application EECS principle
The creation third introductory course element Chandrakasan strategic plan department EECS leader began developing soon became department head
The plan hallmark educational initiative however build MIT Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program UROP
Founded UROP offer funding academic credit undergraduate original research MIT lab
While majority UROP project last semester SuperUROP project last full year student required take yearlong course series outside speaker discus research topic entrepreneurship
Each student receives stipend year faculty supervisor get additional funding lab budget
The yearlong student commitment additional research funding make sponsoring SuperUROP student much attractive faculty Chandrakasan say greater faculty involvement turn enriches undergraduate experience
The SuperUROP program launched fall funding private donor roster corporate sponsor EECS undergraduate enrolled
At beginning year program website posted detailed list research project faculty willing supervise corporate sponsor posted second list
But several student opted instead create project find faculty sponsor
Indeed Chandrakasan say one program aim provide outlet entrepreneurship seems second nature many MIT student
The SuperUROP initiative illustrates another principle Chandrakasan argues crucial success EECS MIT corporate partnership
Both CSAIL MTL existing program corporate sponsor respectively Industry Affiliates Program Microsystems Industrial Group
Both program provide company opportunity sponsor research initiate joint project keep abreast lab research
In turn program help match MIT student prospective employer
Recently Chandrakasan point CSAIL professor begun engage industry novel way
Three year ago professor computer science engineering Charles Leiserson Saman Amarasinghe Performance Engineering Software Systems initiated recruit senior programmer Boston area review code written student class
In program first year Leiserson said Amarasinghe turn volunteer away
Similarly Miller recruited MIT alumnus help code review course teach Elements Software Construction
There however mechanism much different
Where volunteer Leiserson Amarasinghe course meet student pair Miller course code online whenever time
Indeed cultivating alumnus teaching network another aspect EECS strategic plan Chandrakasan say
We want engage broad network alumnus also expert industry say
The department also process building new Engineering Design Studio led professor mechanical electrical engineering computer science Steven Leeb
Chandrakasan describes lab student prototype mechanical electronic system including biomedical device
We wireless component device manufacturer
We tutorial industry people videoconferencing teaching student build use system
The studio would available lab assignment undergraduate course undergraduate pursuing independent project Chandrakasan say
Even EECS take step enhance educational experience MIT student also assumed leading role edX ambitious project make educational resource MIT Harvard University University California Berkeley University Texas system time university available
The first course offered edX EECS class x Circuits Electronics professor computer science engineering Anant Agarwal CSAIL head stepped become led group EECS researcher developing technological platform undergirds whole system
Since introduction Chandrakasan say enrollment gone percent
In addition educational initiative department strategic plan also aim increase number woman faculty electrical engineering computer science
The centerpiece project Rising Stars EECS annual workshop created Chandrakasan Golland brings talented woman nation top EECS graduate program MIT campus two day symposium talk research skill
The first workshop earlier month

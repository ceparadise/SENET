In specification defines property element file
It may also refer set specific given instance
For clarity attribute correctly considered
An attribute frequently generally property property
However actual usage term attribute often treated equivalent depending technology discussed
An attribute object usually consists name value element type class name file name extension
For example computer graphic line object attribute thickness real value color descriptive value brown green value defined certain color model RGB dashing attribute etc
A circle object defined similar attribute plus origin radius
In attribute attached field block code like equivalent
Attributes accessible compiler programmatically
Users language see many example attribute used address concern mechanistic platform us
This creates false impression sole intended purpose
With attribute possible extend attribute
Their specific use metadata left developer cover wide range type information given application class member
The decision expose given attribute property also left developer decision use part larger application framework
Attributes implemented class derived
They often used service like interoperability queried runtime
The example show attribute defined C Positional parameter like first parameter type string parameter attribute constructor
Name parameter like Boolean parameter example property attribute constant value
Attributes contrasted XML documentation also defines metadata included compiled assembly therefore accessed programmatically
Display checked attribute property checkbox change
On many database system relative SQL table file row item column attribute
Both database code attribute synonymous property variable although attribute defined contain value subvalues
The first database
Two current platform include
In markup construct consisting pair exists within
Markup language use attribute describe data formatting data
A good example process XML assigning value property element
Note element value found separate end tag element
The element may number attribute set
If element question could considered property another entity let say element zero attribute property

Before delve attribute computer programming sense word let u first define word
A simple explanation term describes something
In computer programming element field file data type manipulated referenced way attribute
Let consider portrait How would describe person image
Brunette attractive couple characteristic come mind
These characteristic also considered attribute
Now let consider image sandwich Besides attribute might assign image
So exactly portrait photo sandwich relate computer programming
In computer programming element entity field file specific characteristic
For example web programming element assigned unique attribute
Computer programming attribute describe characteristic data whether file paragraph field
Let take closer look
The language used render webpage HTML HyperText Markup Language comprised various element paragraph unordered list image
These element represent item displayed web page
Get FREE access day create account
The paragraph element includes specific group characteristic attribute assigned
In former version language one specific attribute paragraph element align attribute
This attribute could set left right center justify
If attribute set right paragraph would aligned right rendered page
In separate programming language CSS Cascading Stylesheet attribute may also referenced
In either example attribute alignment seen communicated code
In database world attribute may refer single field table even table
An attribute field could preferred data type
For example attribute social security number field could limit nine character
Let look back attribute example provided original photo brunette attractive
The woman portrait described brunette
When hear term automatically connect color hair
Keeping mind must acknowledge attribute apply data type
We would apply hair color attribute sandwich would
It important note attribute may reserved specific data type
For example computer world paragraph would attribute last modified date
Last modified date attribute file
The available attribute may vary depending data type referenced
With various type data available many way described
Data whether file text table field manipulated referenced way
Each data type specific set attribute addressed

In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
An instance programming specific realization object
An may varied number way
Each realized variation object instance
The creation realized instance called instantiation
Each time program run instance program

Imagine I following code My question code need put I call I get output I call I get output
I got feeling quite straightforward question I think main issue I worked state confusion thinking long
Seriously I defined realise part code must call
Where I getting confused pull value actual instance rather type level
Many thanks Pete This possible
For starter multiple different instance A reference B
Or instance B referenced
When set attribute field attaching attribute type class A instance class B stored field
The normal way go store data property B set either via property setter constructor parameter access property WriteSomethingUseful method
Since method within type B attribute declared within type able access based instance simply reference
The current instance might related without able retrieve type class instance contains current instance possible C general way

Jun AM Participant Points Jun AM Hi I reading difference const readonly
There point written Readonly declared static instance level attribute What Instance level attribute
Kindly advice
Regards Karan Contributor Points Jun AM Hi That mean readonly variable assigned value initialisation class calling constructor
I hope clarifies
Regards Suresh Kumar Goudampally Star Points Jun AM First correct term
What mean apply static instance field
Instance field unique instance
object
Static shared instance field static shared instance
There one unique field whole app marked opposed instance field
Each time object get unique instance

A characteristic
In underlined word would said In various attribute
For example contains numeric In term sometimes used synonym
In every indicate several file
For example indicate whether file whether need whether visible hidden
A language construct programmer use add additional information code element member type return value parameter extend functionality

I use Ruby
The difference look easily
Here quick summary As one choose My advice avoid attribute singleton much possible
Both globals disguise although might appropriate us application fact inappropriate introduced convenience one point source major headache later
In situation better alternative create regular type describe state would otherwise put class attribute singleton pas around
This way control exactly get modify state ever decide need one instance create one
The hassle carrying state object around minimal comparison
Class constant contrast fine constant risk unexpected change
They value access anywhere nothing wrong long code us break change value

I keep coming across use word I never understand use meaning conveyed
Phrases like add semantics read semantics semantic web semantically correctly way confuse I referring web
Is word another way say grammar syntax
Thanks
Semantics meaning various element program whatever
For example let look code Both variable integer
From compiler point view exactly
However judging name one width something count thing
Syntactically okay since assign integer
However semantically totally wrong since width number child probably relationship
In case say semantically incorrect even compiler permit
Syntax structure
Semantics meaning
Each different context give different shade meaning term
HTML example new tag meant provide meaning data wrapped tag
The tag conveys data contained within information around
See meaning markup
Take look
Contrast older familiar HTML tag like
Each one affect appearance HTML content rendered browser ca tell u
They contain information meaning
It mean meaning got left already accounted syntax grammar
For example defined grammar valid statement say nothing
Increment one semantics
semantics description supposed put page
Semantic web generally web link search meaning word
The semantically correct way something mean right thing
The word adjective simply mean related word level computer science
For instance Semantic data model data model semantic meaningful understood anyone regardless background expertise
le semantic Java Java us meaningful word class method field
semantics refer tag describe
Check wiki page Very good description
It Computer Science terminology ask What behind Computer Science lingo
I afraid get recursive loop like
In HTML world semantic used talk meaning tag rather considering output look
For example common italicize foreign word also common italicize emphasized word
You could simply wrap foreign emphasized word tag describes look describe look way
A better tag use emphasized word conveys semantics emphasis
The browser stylesheet render italic consumer page know word emphasized
For example could properly read emphasized word
From view almost like looking syntax grammatical way
I ca speak semantics broad term When people talk semantics web normally referring idea stripped away cs javascript etc left bare bone html would make sense read
It also take account using correct tag correct markup
This stem old layout table used tabular data using list present content
You would use something le important
That would make sense

Quick Overview Day Experiment HTML HyperText Markup Language
As noted previous chapter HTML language web expressing content
But dive specific HTML let look mean markup language general
A markup language language text computer manipulate purpose
Most markup language readable human designed written plain text editor rather fancy word processor like Microsoft Word
As learn HTML important keep mind job HTML structure document provide content
Making webpage look good job different technology called Cascading Style Sheets CSS
HTML us set tag annotate mark document
The tag look like balanced end content tag
Notice closing tag contains slash beginning differentiate opening tag
An HTML document contains series balanced tag
Note When experimenting HTML simply use web based environment like one right instructive experiment file computer well
For example given simply create text file computer type HTML make sure save file
The extension important allows computer identify type content contained within file
After file saved open using web browser choice Chrome Edge Firefox etc
When creating text file computer sure use plain text editor something like Notepad Word
I recommend using work free require admin right install lab setting
A simple paragraph text
Another paragraph text
The HTML document follows If click render button see HTML example special output window mimic browser
Try changing text one paragraph click run
Try changing tag Don forget change opening closing tag
I indented HTML see opening closing tag clearly
A web browser care indentation one bit get rid indentation put everything one line page still look
Before move talk specific HTML tag useful think page produced structure page
You get sense structure indentation I provided useful look another perspective
Figure illustrates tree view HTML page
This tree upside usually think tree computer science put root tree top
So root tree html tag
The html tag two head body
The head one child head tag
The html tag head tag
The body three child tag two p tag
You may also find helpful think outline although would rotate picture degree counter clockwise get orientation outline form
We see tree structure html page useful later start use CSS Javascript
Like document HTML document may several layer heading
In fact heading level HTML document
Now modify example add next three level heading

You want use search engine find URL image file example
You also change height width image using attribute attribute
Try changing size image example

Try changing one height width try changing time
You stretch image kind crazy way
There several attribute image tag well
You read
The last basic link cover section link tag
In fact last sentence previous section used link send website learn attribute tag
Links made web popular first place
Today call link earlier year usually referred Hyperlinks
You provide link URL web using attribute tag
The text click go opening tag closing tag
Try clicking link example
What happens
How get back

Links also used navigate within page
use one tag create anchor point page using name attribute like You create link jump target anywhere else page using Making text bold italic formatting easy HTML well
The following example illustrates basic text formatting tag

Embedding audio webpage allows link various file containing music speech
The audio tag look like following The attribute provides button listener

In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I question related representing number base floating point
For example I number normalized form
Generally speaking normalizing normalizing hidden bit imply first number mantissa always zero hidden bit mean one taken left point
Generally speaking mean
That mean mantissa never start le base
In binary mean mantissa must
Since mantissa normalized binary floating point number always need store
The first mantissa bit sense always exists actually store bit know value
So normalized result correct correct moved first left binary point
The hidden bit refers concrete representation represent exponent bit field memory storage another bit field
For example IEEE format With sign exponent bias format mantissa

thats network bios unit input layer hidden layer output layer unit
To understand effect hidden layer training testing I set simulation I train network time per number unit hidden layer
The number unit hidden layer range hidden layer unit
I used neural network toolbox MATLAB program
Moreover I utilized patternet command used default setting configuration network training function traincg loss function minimize error loss I use softmax fuction output layer
I configure network well initialize weight training
And finally training network I partition ratio corresponding data block
To gain better insight I plotted misclassification error network number unit hidden layer testing data block find question Given fact I best performance network hidden layer classification problem linear
Are class linearly separable
consider high dimension input b Referring Fig
Why network using one hidden layer unit around produce second optimum performance among
I class
Moreover I two class would network one hidden layer size two get better classification accuracy ca answer
c role hidden layer

In post look three potential location information deleted file slack space swap space hibernation file
At point past File A written sector
The sector completely filled file content
When user decides delete file sector marked unallocated
However file content remains
Sometime File A deleted user request OS save File B
The OS allocates sector notice file content completely fill sector
The unwritten portion sector known still contains content File A
Slack space data read analyzed popular forensics toolkits

In virtual memory model OS move data memory special location disk order free RAM additional operation
When data disk needed moved back RAM
The area disk used purpose called
In Linux environment swap area actual disk partition
On Windows XP machine swap space file called
Since everything RAM subject swapped disk interesting information found swap file
In addition data might encrypted disk file encryption key might also present
This due weakness application allow unencrypted key reside memory
Further information contained stored remote location might still reside swap space

Following
I attempting learn use create neural network research one point somewhat escaping
I realize hidden layer somewhat necessary portion however I stuck two point reference explaining satisfaction From I gather model real world functionality possible I like bit explanation
A hidden layer used increase expressiveness network
It allows network represent complex model possible without hidden layer
Choosing number hidden layer generally choosing network architecture including number hidden unit hidden layer well decision based training data
You train network set amount node start try one hidden layer one unit per input unit test model
See link help I assume discussing simple neural net
perceptrons
Note two hidden layer deep learning land probably need custom algorithm train net
The reason vanilla backpropagation suffers vanishing gradient problem deep net gradient error function dy layer close input layer hardly trained

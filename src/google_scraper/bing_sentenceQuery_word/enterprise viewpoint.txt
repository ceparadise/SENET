A framework defines coherent set used construction
A representation whole system perspective related set concern
Since early number effort prescribe approach describing analyzing system architecture
These recent effort define set view viewpoint
They sometimes referred usually called view model
Usually work product present specific architecture data given system
However term sometimes used refer view including particular viewpoint corresponding guidance defines concrete view
The term related view definition
The purpose view viewpoint enable human comprehend organize element problem solution around domain
In physically intensive system viewpoint often correspond capability responsibility within engineering organization
Most complex system specification extensive single individual fully comprehend aspect specification
Furthermore different interest given system different reason examining
A executive ask different question system would system implementer
The concept viewpoint framework therefore provide separate viewpoint specification given complex system order facilitate communication stakeholder
Each viewpoint satisfies audience interest particular set aspect system
Each viewpoint may use specific optimizes vocabulary presentation audience viewpoint
Viewpoint modeling become effective approach dealing inherent complexity large distributed system
Architecture description practice described utilize multiple view address several area concern one focusing specific aspect system
Examples using multiple view include Kruchten Hamdaqa
In method began appear software engineering modeling multiple view

Schoman introduce construct context viewpoint vantage point organize modeling process system requirement definition
According Ross Schoman viewpoint make clear aspect considered relevant achieving overall purpose model determines As example viewpoint paper offer Technical Operational Economic viewpoint
In others published important paper viewpoint
In work A viewpoint thought combination idea actor knowledge source role agent development process idea view perspective actor maintains
An important idea paper distinguish scheme notation viewpoint express see statement expressed viewpoint style describing particular domain
Subsequent work preserved distinction utilizing two separate term viewpoint view respectively
Since early number effort codify approach describing analyzing system architecture
These often term sometimes
Many funded sprung international national effort
Among IEEE Recommended Practice Architectural Description Systems established useful definition view viewpoint stakeholder concern guideline documenting use multiple view applying viewpoint address
The advantage multiple view hidden requirement stakeholder disagreement discovered readily
However study show practice added complexity reconciling multiple view undermine advantage
prescribes content architecture description describes creation use number scenario including precedented unprecedented design evolutionary design capture design existing system
In scenario overall process identify elicit concern identify set viewpoint used apply viewpoint specification develop set view relevant system interest
Rather define particular set viewpoint standard provides uniform mechanism requirement architect organization define viewpoint
In ISO Reference Model Open Distributed Processing published provide useful framework describing architecture design distributed system
A view system representation system perspective viewpoint
This viewpoint system involves perspective focusing specific concern regarding system suppresses detail provide simplified model element related concern viewpoint
For example security viewpoint focus security concern security viewpoint model contains element related security general model system
A allows user examine portion particular interest area
For example Information View may present function organization technology etc
use particular piece information Organizational View may present function technology information concern particular organization
In view comprise group work product whose development requires particular analytical technical expertise focus either enterprise
For example Functional View work product answer question mission carried They easily developed expert using process activity modeling
They show enterprise point view function
They also may show organizational information component relate function
In system engineering viewpoint partitioning restriction concern system
Adoption viewpoint usable issue aspect addressed separately
A good selection viewpoint also partition design system specific area expertise
Viewpoints provide convention rule language constructing presenting analysing view
In viewpoint specification individual view
A view representation whole system perspective viewpoint
A view may consist one
Each architectural model developed using method established associated architectural system well system whole
set different way represent aspect system
Each different focus conceptualization dedication visualization representing
In traditional way divide modeling perspective distinguish structural functional perspective
This together rule object communication actor role perspective one way classifying modeling approach In given viewpoint possible make model system contains object visible viewpoint also capture object relationship constraint present system relevant viewpoint
Such model said viewpoint model view system viewpoint
A given view specification system particular level abstraction given viewpoint
Different level abstraction contain different level detail
view allow engineer fashion comprehend whole design identify resolve problem large
view allow engineer concentrate part design develop detailed specification
In system however specification appearing various viewpoint model must addressed realized component system
And specification given component may drawn many different viewpoint
On hand specification induced distribution function specific component component interaction typically reflect different partitioning concern reflected original viewpoint
Thus additional viewpoint addressing concern individual component synthesis system may also useful
An representation system architecture time term component part part function rule constraint part function part relate environment
In architecture description shared across several view product
At data layer architecture data element defining attribute relationship
At presentation layer product view support visual mean communicate understand purpose architecture describes various architectural analysis performed
Products provide way visualizing architecture data graphical tabular textual representation
Views provide ability visualize architecture data stem across product logically organizing data specific holistic perspective architecture
The data modeling introduced considered one first view model
It approach building information system system information management promotes key achieving
The Three schema approach defines three schema view At center conceptual schema defines think talk
The physical schema describes internal format stored external schema defines view data presented
The framework attempted permit multiple data model used external schema
Over year skill interest building information system grown tremendously
However part traditional approach building system focused defining two distinct view user view computer view
From user view referred external schema definition data context report screen designed aid individual specific job
The required structure data usage view change business environment individual preference user
From computer view referred internal schema data defined term file structure storage retrieval
The required structure data depends upon specific computer technology employed need efficient processing data
view model designed describing architecture system based use multiple concurrent view
The view used describe system viewpoint different stakeholder developer project manager
The four view model logical development process physical view The four view model concerned In addition selected scenario utilized illustrate architecture
Hence model contains view
defines organize structure view associated
Because discipline Enterprise Architecture Engineering broad enterprise large complex model associated discipline also tend large complex
To manage scale complexity Architecture Framework provides tool method bring task focus allow valuable artifact produced needed
Architecture Frameworks commonly used governance
An organization may wish mandate certain model produced approved
Similarly may wish specify certain view used documentation procured system stipulates specific DoDAF view provided equipment supplier capital project certain value
The originally conceived IBM framework enterprise architecture provides formal highly structured way viewing defining enterprise
The Framework used organizing architectural artifact way take account artifact target example business owner builder particular issue example data functionality addressed
These artifact may include design document specification model
The Zachman Framework often referenced standard approach expressing basic element
The Zachman Framework recognized Federal Government received worldwide acceptance integrated framework managing change enterprise system support
The International Organization Standardization ISO Reference Model Open Distributed Processing specifies set viewpoint partitioning design distributed system
Since integration problem arise design system analogous situation viewpoint may prove useful separating integration concern
The RMODP viewpoint RMODP defines requirement design contain specification consistency viewpoint including The DoDAF defines standard way organize EA complementary consistent view
It especially suited large system complex integration interoperability challenge apparently unique use detailing external customer operating domain developing system operate
The DoDAF defines set product act mechanism visualizing understanding assimilating broad scope complexity architecture description graphic tabular textual mean
These product organized four view Each view depicts certain perspective architecture described
Only subset full DoDAF viewset usually created system development
The figure represents information link system service view technical standard view
The three view interrelationship driven common architecture data element provide basis deriving measure interoperability performance measuring impact value metric operational mission task effectiveness
In US enterprise segment solution architecture provide different business perspective varying level detail addressing related distinct concern
Just enterprise hierarchically organized different view provided type architecture
The Federal Enterprise Architecture Practice Guidance defined three type architecture By definition Enterprise Architecture EA fundamentally concerned identifying common shared asset whether strategy business process investment data system technology
EA driven strategy help agency identify whether resource properly aligned agency mission strategic goal objective
From investment perspective EA used drive decision IT investment portfolio whole
Consequently primary stakeholder EA senior manager executive tasked ensuring agency fulfills mission effectively efficiently possible
By contrast segment architecture defines simple roadmap core mission area business service enterprise service
Segment architecture driven business management delivers product improve delivery service citizen agency staff
From investment perspective segment architecture drive decision business case group business case supporting core mission area common shared service
The primary stakeholder segment architecture business owner manager
Segment architecture related EA three principle structure reuse alignment
First segment architecture inherits framework used EA although may extended specialized meet specific need core mission area common shared service
Second segment architecture reuses important asset defined enterprise level including data common business process investment application technology
Third segment architecture aligns element defined enterprise level business strategy mandate standard performance measure
In search Framework Modeling Space Systems Architectures Peter Shames Joseph Skipper defined nominal set view Derived CCSDS RASDS ISO compliant

I know stupid people I ever seen smart technology leader
What defines stupidity
Not failed project low IQ
Stupid technology leader considered many quite intelligent
They even praised past success
Furthermore leader considerable education experience intellect
If want stupid technology leader practice four trait humility servitude inclusiveness emotional intelligence
Successful technology leader often need show intellectual superiority
Marshall Goldsmith book What Got You There Won Get You There note successful leader often acquire bad habit telling world smart
These prideful leader need show intellectual superiority constantly often loudly demonstrating smartest person room
For example organization stuck Capability Maturity CMMI Level may leader stymie growth thrive heroic putting fire saving day time every single time
It learn know count John Wooden Hall fame basketball coach The best leader believe continuous learning
They learn failure learn success
Leadership author John Maxwell call leadership trait teachability
Teachability reflected attitude towards others
This smart leader technology expert rest comfort much know
He lean forward learn new thing
Who seen selfish leader primarily concerned interest ego
They seek first promote perhaps promote others suit
The worst leader history selfish caring wealth political position personal desire everything else
Even good leader blinded ego often serve interest promoting rather serving customer people follow
The considers need others first
She continuously build follower finding way grow achieve fulfillment role
She give visibility encouragement inspires best
By feeding nurturing follower leader keep ego check
Grace Hopper example model
When Pearl Harbor attacked Hopper left tenured position Vassar join Women Accepted Emergency Volunteer Service WAVES
The WAVES assigned work Harvard Computation Laboratory programming one world first computer
Don think le Think le John C Maxwell Leadership Expert She mother modern computing assembled team specialist nascent computer science field
She created safe environment young programmer nurtured ability innovate create
Her goal empower people collective rather individual
She brought together diverse team early programmer create design together believing idea group would stronger alone
By bringing people together understanding need led subordinating glory need left mark world modern computer technology
Most good leader understand need diversity inclusiveness contribution technology innovation successful organization
They respect consideration ethnicity gender age national origin disability sexual orientation education religion workplace
Additionally focus inclusiveness need individual promote culture support diversity
But good leader may often overlook cognitive diversity difference people think
In many case ingenuity creativity called envision solution great mind necessarily always think alike
Let look cognitive extreme example kid
Kids innovative fearless creative
They certainly achieved brilliance successful leader
Do think smarter grader
It could mind grader openness creativity exactly next technology project need
Consider invention While typical technology leader may intellectually superior dismiss idea virtue superiority
The smart technology leader consider idea others even academic equal
Consider initial controversy occurred Apple released iPad
Many woman cringed name new device
At time technology company executive leadership cadre
A woman may able offer special insight commercial risk using name
Monolithic thinking recipe disaster
Stupid leader low emotional intelligence
Emotional intelligence capacity aware control express one emotion interact others empathically
Dan Goleman book Working Emotional Intelligence say top performer excel emotional skill intellectual skill
Technical intellectual skill limited effect performance
As example successful computer programmer become top performer emotional awareness
They willing collaborate help teammate
As Chief Information Officer federal agency I chose Enterprise Architect technical person
Furthermore little eccentric say least
Yet people skill impeccable
He able bring people together create consensus
His work critical defining technology roadmap met need agency
His success due emotional intelligence ability understand people need
Though knew le technology continues one smartest technology leader I know
If technology leader business leader stupid
Check ego listen others serve follower listen heart
These action smart leader
CEO
Formerly served CIO NASA
Besides NASA served CIOin even federal cabinet level including Bureau Alcohol Tobacco Firearms

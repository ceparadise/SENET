According Project Management Institute PDM technique used constructing schedule activity represented node linked one logical relationship show sequence activity performed
This also known activity node diagram
The input go scheduling include scope deliverable
A project manager gather team schedule planning meeting
During meeting project manager review scope deliverable date importance
The project management team list activity needed complete project
The project manager project management team also list activity milestone
item significance project
A milestone could first prototype rolling assembly line inspection tied funding framing inspection tied loan draw building house
There four common type dependency precedence diagram method
The first common dependency called
This one activity start another finish
The next common dependency known activity start another activity start
The third common dependency named completion activity depends another activity finishing
The final common dependency type called one activity finish another activity start
Each dependency mandatory discretionary external internal
In addition depending type dependency lead lag may needed help schedule activity
A lead example finish start dependency would allow activity start day prior activity completing
A lag example start start hand would starting activity day predecessor start
The include variety activity represented pictorially node
Each node Here example node diagram key includes acronym example node precedence diagram method Get FREE access day create account
Once project manager project management team compiled list activity milestone begin sequence activity add duration activity
The duration realistic achievable
If duration achievable thing may happen
The project manager reporting bogus information project budget customer dissatisfied
So trying fix project gotten control first item need review schedule determining realistic
You want use precedence diagram method help sort schedule schedule correct start look budget execution
As see achievable realistic schedule really critical
So project manager realistic list activity duration begin sequence activity pictorial
This help determine project management team missed item
As project manager build node node linked based type dependency relationship activity fall sequencing seen example The PDM important project manager pictorial representation project schedule
The PDM representation allow project manager communicate activity duration relationship allow work issue management reviewer
The precedence diagram method also allows project manager project management team determine missed activity duration skewed
In lesson learned pictorial representation project activity node linked logical relationship
You also learned precedence diagram method especially important project manager help determine activity missed duration realistic
The project manager also us precedence diagram method communicate schedule project review

Precedence C rule specifies order certain operation need performed expression
For given expression containing two operator determines operation calculated first
While evaluation expression performed human start left work toward right C expression evaluated operator precedence
Precedence help describe expression contains different kind operator without parenthesis expression parenthesis applying predefined rule set C Language Specification CLS
A C expression sequence one operand combined using operator also contain literal value method invocation variable etc
This type expression evaluated single value object method
Precedence play vital role determining order expression evaluated
The precedence C operator similar used algebraic formula
The list category C operator order precedence includes For example expression evaluated first quotient subtracted division higher precedence subtraction
By using parenthesis expression need evaluated first precedence overridden

Network diagram primarily used understand activity project sequenced understand dependency activity finally project
On simple term network diagram show activity related
Meaning project identify activity order activity need perform represent information form network diagram
There primarily two type notation draw network diagram
They The activity arrow AOA le popular compared activity node AON precedence diagramming method PDM
Also another name Activity Arrow AOA diagram activity diagramming method ADM
In notation activity duration activity shown arrow arrow
The node shown represent dependency activity
OR In diagram circle represent node
Activity A shown arrow duration activity A
The activity entering node predecessor activity leaving node
That way node representing dependency activity arrow diagram notation
In diagram activity A predecessor activity B
Also closely observe duration activity B longer duration activity A
Hence arrow representing activity B bit longer compare activity A
Sometimes activity arrow AOA diagram use inserting dummy
These dummy activity duration activity
So arrow activity arrow diagram represents two attribute one sequence duration
Representing sequence single arrow sometimes may feasible especially complex structure predecessor successor
In case represent dependency sequence dummy activity used activity arrow AOA diagram
Hold
I understood concept dummy activity clearly
What
No worry
Nothing panic
We see concept example understand dummy activity AOA diagram detail
Now look popular method creating network diagram
Also called Activity Node diagram Precedence diagramming method
In activity node AON precedence diagramming method PDM Now seen diagramming method create network diagram
Let u traverse example understand two diagram method different practically creating network diagram
Also let u see dummy activity essential Activity arrow AOA diagram
Let u say IT project require following activity perform project
Using table represent project activity duration dependency let u create network diagram
If see tricky part C predecessor A
And activity D predecessor activity A B
This kind representation difficult show Let u see look
If carefully observe wrong network diagram
The reason activity C one predecessor A
But network diagram activity C two predecessor A B
Since activity D two predecessor way activity B represent predecessor activity This issue activity arrow AOA ADM network diagram
To resolve issue dummy activity need insert follows
If see activity arrow AOA diagram dummy activity show dependency activity A activity As mentioned earlier dummy activity always duration name say
And see activity arrow activity diagramming method bit cumbersome compare activity node AON precedence diagramming method PDM creating network diagram
As mentioned earlier activity node precedence diagramming method PDM become popular simplicity le complex type notation
For reason lot tool vendor use primary focus create network diagram
Let u see create network diagram using precedence diagram method activity node AON method
In activity node precedence diagramming method see simplicity network diagram using PDM compare activity arrow diagram
Though precedence diagramming method activity node diagram method popular activity arrow diagram PMP Aspirant project manager professional would need know notation
Hence blog post I tried touch activity arrow diagram also
To conclude network diagram represent Finally project

By A Precedence Diagramming Method PDM sometimes also known Activity Node AON Diagramming Method graphical representation technique show among various project activity
This diagramming method used draw project schedule network diagram example
I hope may heard another le commonly used technique diagramming method Activity Arrow AOA diagramming method special case Precedence Diagramming Method
In AOA dependency Finish Start duration shown arrow
That diagramming method known Activity Arrow AOA diagram

Activity Arrow AOA diagram emphasizes milestone event PDM diagram emphasizes task
The main benefit Precedence Diagramming Method PDM show activity dependency also important communication tool stakeholder
The Precedence Diagramming Method PDM consists rectangle known node project activity shown box
These rectangular box connected arrow show dependency therefore diagram also known Activity Node AON diagram
The Precedence Diagramming Method us four type dependency
Those dependency follows
Finish Start FS
Finish Finish FF
Start To Start SS
Start Finish SF In type dependency second activity started first activity completes
This type dependency commonly used dependency diagramming technique
For example paint wall first need build wall
In case first activity building wall second activity painting
You start painting wall unless wall ready
Here second activity finished first activity finish word activity finish simultaneously
For example let u say coding program client client providing characteristic program
In case finish coding program client give complete requirement
Here activity finish simultaneously
Here second activity started first activity start activity start simultaneously
Suppose apply primary coating wall
To apply coating also need clean wall
Therefore one team start cleaning wall second team paint
Both activity started time
In type dependency second activity finished first activity start
For example let u say move new home old home demolished
In case move new home ready
Hence second activity construction new home must finished first activity start start moving new home
moving new home start vacating old home new house completely ready
Although type dependency commonly used project manager must know type dependency
It important project manager understand type dependency help considerablywhen drawing network diagram creating project schedule
This precedence diagram method type dependency used making diagram
In blog post I tried give simplest example type dependency used project schedule network diagram however feel could simpler example share comment section
This topic also important PMP Exam point view
Please understand task dependency precedence diagramming method also remember exhibit showing dependency
You may see one two question topic PMP Certification exam
image credit top adamr I agree explanation dependency
When say move new home ready
Hence second activity construction new home must finished first activity start start moving new home defining dependency precedent activity CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW HOME subsecuent activity MOVE IN NEW HOME
Think way You vacate home first activity moving new home second activity
Now move new home completed
This example make picture clear
Anyway suggest good example And thanks stopping
I agree Spanish
I struggling example start finish make sense
Your example appears simply poor sequencing activity
I hoping sr pm help
Hello Newb Start finish rare sequence activity used frequently
While writing blog post I tried find good simple example
Although I found example activity typical easy understand
Therefore I thought came simple example sequence
I agree may perfect example consider scenario given example I believe serf purpose
I found good example PMBOK edition First security guard shift successor finish second security guard shift predecessor start
You may think matter activity describes relationship
But case really Finish first shift second shift started
Hence describing relationship
Atleast made sense Thanks Mona sharing understanding
ASSALAM O ALAIKUM SIR I student final year civil engineering dear Sir I WANT TO ASK ONE THING Regarding PDM PREDECCENCE DIAGRAMING METHOD
SIR IN PDM METHOD DOES AN ACTIVITY OR TASK STARTS FROM SAME DAY OR NEXT DAY
SIR EARLIER WE R TOUGHT AS AN ACTIVITY STARTS FROM NEXT DAY AND WE DO IN THE DEPENDENDENCIES IF ZERO ACTIVITY THEN WE DO NOT ADD IN ITS DEPENDENCY IN PDM METHOD IS IT CORRECT ANSWER IF NOT THEN PLZ GIVE ME A SUITABLE CORRECT ANSWER TO CLEAR MY CONCEPT THANKS REGARDS Fahad Hussain If start zero need add case first security guard predecessor see sequence activity first activity finished second activity start
But contradictory SF definition hi student may right wanted quote example start finish automatic power electricity generator soon power go start automatically power electricity wait sec automatically shuts u say waited electricity start finish cant finish working unless electricity started
I need formules fore solving kind network
Hope blog post help Really helped I glad helped
This helpful site Thanks
Can one post lot CPM Time management costing example
I started solving practice test I found I spending lot time thinking complicated CPM costing problem
I need practice
I appreciate one suggest good web site example
Thank
Hello Mahesh Not specifically time cost management question find sample PMP exam question please data provide solve reference
I midst preparing assignment one question I asked conduct forward backward pas using precedence diagram method Activity node AON next question asks display completion time entire project network diagram
My question I refer professor network diagram previous question
forward backward pas essentially calculates project duration
How diagram I asked different
Kristen This free pdf download excerpt Head First PMP book might help
I putting section deciding Earned Value easier lol going able offer much help
Forward pas help identify early start early finish activity backward pas help find late start late finish activity
An example SF could turning ON room heater hotel room Activity ensure comfortable satisfied guest room front office man Activity comfortable satisfying guest room front office man considered COMPLETE room heater turned ON room STARTED warm
I agree SF rare scenario PM context
Well said Kay
Hi Could tell calculate forward backward pas network maybe using example exercise
Just clear step go
I feel give clear picture
Thankyou I mean forward backward pas PDM network
Here everything explained example This helpful
Btw example case study maybe real data involving PDM network
I research topic I found really hard obtain project schedule PDM network
I really appreciate could give suggestion
Thanks
Sorry Atiqah I case study
Please want full diagram two storey building
Thanks Sorry Joseph I diagram two story building
Hi Fahad always get confuse dependency related question
Any tip clear concept read understand question way answer
You refer blog post critical path method
What exact difference precedence diagram network diagram
Precedence diagram network diagram
There question show diagram like blog put following question
The diagram called
Activity arrow network diagram b
Network diagram Precedence diagram Gantt chart If answer Precedence diagram
I chose B wrong answer
Can please help
Let explain example
You shown pineapple asked identified
The option Pineapple b Orange c Fruit Banana Now let say selected answer c Fruit
Is wrong answer
No
It fruit
This correct answer best answer given option
You asked select best correct answer pineapple
So correct answer would pineapple
Likewise question chose best answer
Hope help

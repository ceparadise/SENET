For example general speed limit Irish road
Even though speed excess strictly illegal people seem likely regard anything get concerned speed unlikely result prosecution
A motorist travelling Irish road however likely attract public opprobrium certainly attract police attention caught almost definitely suffer prosecution severe punishment

When someone buy commercial piece software Microsoft Office bound copyright license specifies many machine buyer load software
Thus license agreement single user allows buyer load software onto one machine including laptop person one make copy case something happens original disk compact memory
Companies want employee use particular software must buy site license
Often site license allows buyer network software user log company network access program
Each user network called client software package Microsoft Office cost client

OEM unbundling involves selling component package application
Unauthorized renting involves hiring software violation license
Most buyer purchased PCs software however person buying small component software renting item video even computer game would know something particular software licensing agreement realize whether software pirated
The software piracy rate estimated comparing number personal computer sold number software package sold
Based assumption new PC standard set software would also sold software piracy rate calculated percentage shortfall software sale
The financial loss cost missing software sale
Using method Software Information Industry Association SIIA Business Software Alliance BSA estimate software industry lost billion revenue due pirating business software
This increase figure billion brings estimated loss since survey began total billion
The world highest software piracy rate Eastern Europe rate percent suggesting six every ten software package used pirated
Fourteen country estimated software piracy rate percent percent percent percent percent top list
Because size respective software market however greatest financial loss occur China
These six country accounted billion half worldwide lost sale
Although United States lowest piracy rate world percent United States alone account billion lost sale
The SIIA suggests attack software piracy using legislation effective enforcement public education
This approach based conviction buying selling pirated software essentially counterfeit good
Indeed country provide legal protection software extending copyright patent contract trade secret legislation
They also recognize software like literary creation work art subject intellectual property right IPR protection

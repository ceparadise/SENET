Given data mart generally cover subset data contained data warehouse often easier faster implement
Types data mart include dependent independent hybrid data mart
OLAP characterized relatively low volume transaction
Queries often complex involve aggregation
For OLAP system response time effectiveness measure
OLAP application widely used technique
OLAP database store aggregated historical data schema usually star schema
OLAP system typically data latency hour opposed data mart latency expected closer one day
The OLAP approach used analyze multidimensional data multiple source perspective
The three basic operation OLAP Consolidation Slicing Dicing
OLTP characterized large number short transaction INSERT UPDATE DELETE
OLTP system emphasize fast query processing maintaining environment
For OLTP system effectiveness measured number transaction per second
OLTP database contain detailed current data
The schema used store transactional database entity model usually
Normalization norm data modeling technique system
quantifying hidden pattern data using complex mathematical model used future outcome
Predictive analysis different OLAP OLAP focus historical data analysis reactive nature predictive analysis focus future
These system also used CRM
The concept data warehousing date back late IBM researcher Barry Devlin Paul Murphy developed business data warehouse
In essence data warehousing concept intended provide architectural model flow data operational system
The concept attempted address various problem associated flow mainly high cost associated
In absence data warehousing architecture enormous amount redundancy required support multiple decision support environment
In larger corporation typical multiple decision support environment operate independently
Though environment served different user often required much stored data
The process gathering cleaning integrating data various source usually existing operational system usually referred typically part replicated environment
Moreover operational system frequently reexamined new decision support requirement emerged
Often new requirement necessitated gathering cleaning integrating new data tailored ready access user
Key development early year data warehousing A fact value measurement represents fact managed entity system
Facts reported reporting entity said raw level

mobile telephone system BTS base transceiver station received request traffic channel allocation allocates reject remaining would report measurement management system Facts raw level aggregated higher level various extract service information
These called aggregate summary aggregated fact
For instance BTSs city fact aggregated BTS city level network dimension
For example There three leading approach storing data data warehouse important approach dimensional approach normalized approach
The dimensional approach refers approach stated data warehouse modeled using Dimensional
The normalized approach also called model Third Normal Form refers Bill Inmon approach stated data warehouse modeled using model
In partitioned fact generally numeric transaction data reference information give context fact
For example sale transaction broken fact number product ordered total price paid product dimension order date customer name product number order location salesperson responsible receiving order
A key advantage dimensional approach data warehouse easier user understand use
Also retrieval data data warehouse tends operate quickly
Dimensional structure easy understand business user structure divided
Facts related organization business process operational system whereas dimension surrounding contain context measurement Kimball Ralph
Another advantage offered dimensional model involve relational database every time
Thus type modeling technique useful query data warehouse
The main disadvantage dimensional approach following In normalized approach data data warehouse stored following degree rule
Tables grouped together reflect general data category data customer product finance etc
The normalized structure divide data entity creates several table relational database
When applied large enterprise result dozen table linked together web join
Furthermore created entity converted separate physical table database implemented Kimball Ralph
The main advantage approach straightforward add information database
Some disadvantage approach number table involved difficult user join data different source meaningful information access information without precise understanding source data data warehouse
Both normalized dimensional model represented diagram contain joined relational table
The difference two model degree normalization also known
These approach mutually exclusive approach
Dimensional approach involve normalizing data degree Kimball Ralph
In Robert Hillard proposes approach comparing two approach based information need business problem
The technique show normalized model hold far information dimensional equivalent even field used model extra information come cost usability
The technique measure information quantity term usability term Small Worlds data transformation measure
In approach first created provide reporting analytical capability specific
These data mart integrated create comprehensive data warehouse
The data warehouse bus architecture primarily implementation bus collection dimension shared specific way fact two data mart
The approach designed using normalized enterprise
data greatest level detail stored data warehouse
Dimensional data mart containing data needed specific business process specific department created data warehouse
Data warehouse DW often resemble
feeding warehouse often include generating large amount data
To consolidate various data model facilitate process data warehouse often make use information parsed actual DW
To reduce data redundancy larger system often store data normalized way
Data mart specific report built top data warehouse
A hybrid DW database kept eliminate
A normal relational database however efficient business intelligence report dimensional modelling prevalent
Small data mart shop data consolidated warehouse use filtered specific data fact table dimension required
The DW provides single source information data mart read providing wide range business information
The hybrid architecture allows DW replaced repository operational static information could reside
The component follow hub spoke architecture
This modeling style hybrid design consisting best practice third normal form
The data vault model true third normal form break rule architecture bottom design
The data vault model geared strictly data warehouse
It geared accessible built still requires use data mart star schema based release area business purpose
The different method used data warehouse specified organization numerous
The hardware utilized software created data resource specifically required correct functionality data warehouse main component data warehouse architecture
All data warehouse multiple phase requirement organization modified fine tuned
Operational system optimized preservation speed recording business transaction use
Operational system designer generally follow ensure data integrity
Fully normalized database design satisfying Codd rule often result information business transaction stored dozen hundred table
efficient managing relationship table
The database fast performance small amount data table affected time transaction processed
To improve performance older data usually periodically purged operational system
Data warehouse optimized analytic access pattern
Analytic access pattern generally involve selecting specific field rarely ever common operational database
Because difference access pattern operational database loosely OLTP benefit use DBMS whereas analytics database loosely OLAP benefit use
Unlike operational system maintain snapshot business data warehouse generally maintain infinite history implemented ETL process periodically migrate data operational system data warehouse
These term refer level sophistication data warehouse

Find pick best Computer Science Program Menu Data Warehousing copy data resides later query retrieval subsequent analysis according example definition data warehousing given industry expert Ralph Kimball book
The warehouse designed support analysis data usually transactional nature flexible structure reflects need specific user community
The result data analysis frequently used monitor effectiveness key operational task within business without interfering live operational system
Here recognized benefit using data warehouse system feature common data warehouse issue consider supporting data warehouse development effort
One common feature data warehouse flexible way query conducted subject category
Data analyst support business area like supply chain management sale marketing quickly find data need detect trend risk
For instance data analyst query data warehouse people certain demographic purchased particular product
This group compared demographic group confirm decision made company target market
As result director marketing department could opt focus advertising campaign different group increase sale
Data business intelligence analyst quickly gather data number source analysis project require integrated report using data warehouse
For example business intelligence analyst may require customized report includes input company financial management inventory management system
The result report may show funding requirement sustain inventory particular product certain location specified period time
The data queried using data warehouse often used feed variety statistical model
While data within warehouse static copy transactional data computation used statistical modeling give way different iteration originally queried data
An audit trail function describes original data sourced add greater depth data analysis report
Using data warehouse highly efficient way gaining post transactional data purpose analysis continuous operational improvement
These database designed simple query complex one extend various source system like company enterprise resource planning system
Business intelligence analyst able identify pattern company exploit gain competitive advantage offering special promotion certain product service particular customer group example
Taking data warehouse development project daunting task development team great potential scope requirement creep
This development effort usually follow iterative process heavily involves user community

also called process discovering interesting useful pattern relationship large volume data
The field combine tool learning management analyze large digital collection known data set
Data mining widely used business insurance banking retail science research astronomy medicine government security detection criminal terrorist
The proliferation numerous large sometimes connected government private database led regulation ensure individual record accurate secure unauthorized viewing tampering
Most type data mining targeted toward general knowledge group rather knowledge specific supermarket le concerned selling one item one person selling many item many pattern analysis also may used discern anomalous individual behaviour criminal activity
As computer storage capacity increased many company began store transactional data
The resulting record collection often called data warehouse large analyzed traditional statistical approach
Several computer science conference workshop held consider recent advance field artificial intelligence AI discovery genetic neural adapted knowledge discovery preferred term computer science community
The process led First International Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held Montreal launch journal
This also period many early company formed product introduced
One earliest successful application data mining perhaps second marketing research detection
By studying consumer purchasing behaviour typical pattern usually becomes apparent purchase made outside pattern flagged later investigation deny transaction
However wide variety normal behaviour make challenging single distinction normal fraudulent behaviour work everyone time
Every individual likely make purchase differ type made relying normal single individual likely give many false alarm
One approach improving reliability first group individual similar purchasing pattern since group model le sensitive minor
For example frequent business traveler group likely pattern includes unprecedented purchase location member group might flagged transaction catalog purchase fit group profile
The complete process involves multiple step understanding goal project data available process change based final analysis
The three key computational step process model evaluation use model
This division clearest classification data
Model learning occurs one applied data group class attribute known order produce classifier learned data
The classifier tested independent evaluation set contains data known attribute
The extent model classification agree known class target attribute used determine expected accuracy model
If model sufficiently accurate used classify data target attribute unknown
There many type data mining typically divided kind information attribute known type knowledge sought model
Predictive modeling used goal estimate value particular target attribute exist sample training data value attribute known
An example classification take set data already divided predefined group search pattern data group
These discovered pattern used classify data right group target attribute unknown though attribute may known
For instance manufacturer could develop predictive model distinguishes part fail extreme heat extreme cold condition based manufacturing model may used determine appropriate application part
Another technique employed predictive modeling analysis used target attribute numeric value goal predict value new data
Descriptive modeling clustering also divide data group
With clustering however proper group known advance pattern discovered analyzing data used determine group
For example advertiser could analyze general population order classify potential customer different cluster develop separate advertising campaign targeted group
Fraud detection also make use clustering identify group individual similar purchasing pattern
Pattern mining concentrate identifying rule describe specific pattern within data
analysis identifies item typically occur together purchase transaction one first application data mining
For example supermarket used analysis identify item often purchased instance store featuring fish sale would also stock tartar sauce
Although testing association long often simple see small data set data mining enabled discovery le apparent association immense data set
Of interest discovery unexpected association may open new avenue marketing research
Another important use pattern mining discovery sequential pattern example sequence error warning precede equipment failure may used schedule preventative maintenance may provide insight design flaw
detection viewed flip side finding data instance unusual fit established pattern
Fraud detection example anomaly detection
Although fraud detection may viewed problem predictive modeling relative rarity fraudulent transaction speed criminal develop new type fraud mean predictive model likely low accuracy quickly become date
Thus anomaly detection instead concentrate modeling normal behaviour order identify unusual transaction
Anomaly detection also used various monitoring system intrusion detection
Numerous technique developed including pattern discovery time series data stock price streaming data sensor network relational learning social network
The potential invasion privacy using data mining concern many people
Commercial database may contain detailed record people medical history purchase transaction telephone usage among aspect life
Civil libertarian consider database held business government unwarranted intrusion invitation abuse
For example sued NSA alleging warrantless spying American citizen acquisition call record American telecommunication company
The program began discovered public information began leak
Often risk data mining usually aim produce general knowledge rather learn information specific issue misuse inappropriate disclosure information database
In many federal agency required produce annual report specifically address privacy project
The law requiring privacy report federal agency defines data mining quite restrictively discover locate predictive pattern anomaly indicative terrorist criminal activity part individual As various local national international agency begun share database potential abuse security forced government work industry developing secure computer network
In particular research technique data mining operate distorted transformed decrease risk disclosure individual data
Data mining evolving one driver competition challenge problem
A commercial example million Netflix Prize
American company offer movie rental delivered mail streamed began contest see anyone could improve percent recommendation system algorithm predicting individual movie preference based previous rental data
The prize awarded BellKor team seven mathematician computer scientist engineer United States Canada Austria Israel achieved percent goal June finalized victory improved algorithm day later
The open competition spurred many clever contestant
For example Conferences Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held workshop Netflix Prize research paper presented topic ranging new collaborative filtering technique faster matrix factorization key component many recommendation system
Concerns privacy data also led advance understanding privacy anonymity
Data mining however result must viewed care statistical analysis
One strength data mining ability analyze quantity data would impractical analyze manually pattern found may complex difficult human understand complexity requires care evaluating pattern
Nevertheless statistical evaluation technique result knowledge free human bias large amount data reduce bias smaller sample
Used properly data mining provides valuable insight large data set otherwise would practical possible obtain

Computer Science Project Proposal Implementing Genetic Algorithm Optimize Database Queries Involving Numerous Joins The principal mechanism database maintains optimal level performance known database query optimizer without query optimizer even database PostgreSQL would noticeably sluggish
In broad term database execute query query must first parsed converted expression relational algebra
For given query may many way convert query relational algebra way computationally costly others
Thus point query optimizer select least computationally expensive query evaluation plan
In course considering different query evaluation plan optimizer must analyze data interacts various operator exist relational algebra
Of operator difficult one process optimize operator become focus project
It true normal circumstance database usually process query involve join situation database PostgreSQL excel
There however fairly common application data mining OLAP example would realistically require processing query involving many join
A basic firsthand analysis performance handling query particularly encouraging took approximately second process join involving relation approximately second process join involving relation well minute process join relation
Clearly effectiveness PostgreSQL optimizer begin suffer give query involving numerous join
It reason look provide alternative PostgreSQL query optimization algorithm alternative algorithm actually specialize optimizing large query
Here throughout paper refer large query mean large term number join involved necessarily term size output size relation referenced
Because inherent complexity involved optimizing database query especially involving numerous join propose use genetic algorithm aim produce plan outperform plan created PostgreSQL
In order understand problem optimizing large query must briefly investigate basic query optimization genetic algorithm
Before proceeding let u define exactly constitutes query evaluation plan general tree relational operator intermediate node relation leaf node
Although actual implementation database query optimizer varies system system theory optimizing SQL query involves three basic step
First SQL must rewritten term relational algebra
Specifically query treated collection projection selection Cartesian product remaining operator carried result given expression
Next relational algebra expression formed optimizer must enumerate various alternative plan evaluating expression
A typical optimizer consider every possible evaluation plan given expression since would require excessive overhead thereby rendering possible timesaving optimization moot
Finally optimizer must estimate cost associated enumerated plan choose plan lowest estimated cost least avoid plan highest estimated cost
The exact detail optimizer eliminates inferior plan assigns cost remarkably complex subject need addressed
The thing need concern point optimizing query many join much difficult optimizing query join
The join operator denoted take input two relation combine tuples based give criterion produce new relation output
Complicating matter fact like database PostgreSQL provides variety
Essentially mean one join actually processed number three PostgreSQL case different algorithm may require varying cost
The dominant reason larger query costly however join operator commutative associative mean number way create plan given query grows exponentially number join query
Thus database query search space complicated enough normal circumstance becomes exponentially complex begin consider numerous join
Fortunately u generic algorithm especially suited navigating extremely complex search space exactly meant term
Simply put genetic algorithm GA short search algorithm based mechanic natural selection genetics
A genetic algorithm operates starting group biological term represents valid solution given problem
To introduce concept natural selection algorithm must devise employ function evaluates fitness level chromosome term problem close given solution come optimal solution
Once chromosome assigned fitness value select fittest individual chromosome enter mating population
Each chromosome mating population subsequently paired random resulting pair undergo process different piece paired chromosome interchanged produce two new chromosome
This essentially algorithmic equivalent swapping DNA occurs reproduction nature
Thus since chromosome simply representation various solution problem set parent chromosome crossed represents pair relatively correct solution combined produce two new assuming theory evolution hold true correct solution
Finally child arising mating pool taken new population chromosome process begin
In addition crossover mate selection one genetic operator must mentioned
Many computer scientist even biologist disagree degree importance mutation operator classically play decidedly secondary role algorithmic process
Mutation fact needed even though mate selection crossover effectively search recombine specific member population occasionally may become overzealous lose potentially useful genetic material
Mutation simply occasional alteration small randomly chosen part chromosome
As stated earlier order use GA need develop way encoding pertinent information database query optimization problem chromosome
Devising encoding well implementing necessary genetic operator properly modify improve upon initial population solution fundamental focus project
We frequently stated one crucial step using GA optimize database query devise method encoding information query plan form usable operator genetic algorithm
Any feasible representation must preserve distinguish two main property commutativity operand gene associativity operand gene
Unfortunately complexity preclude use simple string bit canonical representation used genetic algorithm
We must use complex representation specifically adopt encoding scheme variation representation developed Kristin Bennett Michael Ferris Yannis Ionnidis
In particular encoding use involves taking chromosome string breaking number gene represent join must performed
Thus given SQL query involves join chromosome consist gene
In order gene model behavior join must consist three piece information pair relation operand join method relation orientation
Because preceding examination role join operator query optimization first two component straightforward mean
Given pair relation join operates need know one outer left operand one inner right operand exactly orientation indicates
Although orientation could implemented many different way assume orientation one two possible value alphabetical
In order fully grasp encoding work necessary work example
In paper adopt convention using number denote join capital letter denote relation hence alphabetical possibility orientation either r subscript appropriate join denote orientation
Note simplicity join method represented visually
Now consider following simple expression A C B Or B A C This expression involves two join know chromosome must contain two gene
To develop encoding plan start lowest leftmost join happens
Looking operand join see outer one A inner one C mean relation alphabetical orientation first gene
We must consider second final join
Looking operand see outer operand B inner operand without considering orientation yet least write
Unlike previous join immediately clear orientation
Because subjoin alphabetical association
The problem one involving alphabetical promotion clearly would easiest simply promote either A C determining alphabetical orientation one choose
This significant question promote A alphabetical orientation promote C orientation
Establishing rule alphabetical promotion essential order preserve accuracy encoding actual rule particularly important long applied consistently
For representation use following rule If subjoin occurs current join chromosome string obey subjoin orientation suggestion otherwise subjoin occurs current join chromosome string opposite subjoin orientation suggestion
So example represents subjoin occurs encoding disobey orientation suggestion mean take relation giving u promotion So effectively C outer operand B inner operand final encoding Despite seeming complexity encoding many advantage
Because representation based labeling join instead relation avoid complexity frequently arises several intermediate relation exist point encoding process
In representation relation simply attached considered term respective join
Furthermore although may seem awkward initially using concept orientation extremely helpful allows u keep track commutative order outer inner relation join single variable relation simply remain static unordered need access name
Finally representation query plan make implementing genetic algorithm fairly straightforward almost straightforward using string bit
Now introduced encode important database query information manipulated genetic algorithm worthwhile consider implement genetic operator interact chromosome
The mutation operator easiest implement consists performing one three possible alteration
First mutation select two gene transpose switching position string
Second mutation select one gene change associated orientation
Finally mutation select one gene change associated join method
Determining three alteration used done random ensure spontaneous nature indicative mutation
Crossover slightly complicated operation example useful
Recall crossover operates two chromosome attained base level fitness entered mating pool
Suppose two chromosome defined follows X Y The interaction two chromosome implementation crossover described relationship
We first determine chromosome active giver information arbitrarily choose first
Next must define piece information need sent chromosome n gene randomly select size chunk data
In case need choose integer interval let suppose select size
Now need determine gene begin data chunk keeping mind effectively wrap chunk around beginning chromosome get end without satisfying prescribed chunk size
For example assume randomly chose start chunk position gene
So size chunk look like X Now need remove corresponding gene chromosome compress remaining gene leftward Y Y Y Finally remains copy data chunk insert empty space resulting Y Of course actually complete crossover operation would also need go algorithm time active giver passive receiver
It clear method essentially performs scale three operation defined mutation operator
This cement earlier statement crossover play dominant dynamic role algorithmic process mutation
The final genetic operator must consider mating
In point fact implementation operator governed define fitness function every aspect operator simply involves moving chromosome one population another
Recall fitness function must capture measure correctness success want preserve
In term problem database query optimization since chromosome represents query plan function already determined u simply estimated cost plan
Chromosomes encode plan low cost labeled fit since interested avoiding plan exorbitant cost
In order implement genetic algorithm necessary obtain information initial plan structure estimated cost plan various statistic plan information extracted directly PostgreSQL
Although take moderate amount effort configure PostgreSQL output information needed able parse collect categorize information difficult given obtuse syntax PostgreSQL us output plan information
Because parsing file scanning string manipulation necessity PERL seems natural choice far language base code
The actual programmatic structure genetic algorithm however seems cater nature
In particular appears three level organization population level chromosome level gene level
Moreover careful analysis genetic operator reveal often span one level
Mutation example operation transpose two gene operation point change join method orientation
Similarly mate selection operation applies fitness function operation point moving fittest chromosome normal population mating pool
Thus seem require three level abstraction three level PERL easily provide
Therefore appears logical implement genetic hierarchy series container class class containing class containing class
Fortunately since using PERL parsing language base language simply embed separate module PERL code exploit strength language
A final component project involves creating set data schema viable testing
Composing complex properly interconnected testing schema consisting relation complete appropriate useable test data easy task
In fact could probably entire project onto
In addition numerous variation need manipulated test schema test data likely require significant flexibility testing input controlled monitored
This likely suggests use PERL script using interface create populate table schema important avoid getting bogged ancillary aspect project
Once algorithm tested finalized would interesting note performance run real world benchmarking schema one includes least relation available

Lauer Lecturer Newcastle University Computing Laboratory since January candidate Computer Science University Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
A candidate Computing Science Newcastle typically come u knowledge programming clear indication high ability
But specific background computing may range broad appreciation fundamental problem science total ignorance others perhaps may specialized experience area interest
We educate level expertise worthy title Doctor providing environment learn teach research demanding thesis representing original contribution science
The actual character educational program necessarily tailored individual small group individual closely related interest
In one model program student spends first part whole candidacy normally taking three year British small project attending lecture reading broaden knowledge fill gap background exploring science topic interest
During time develops close working relationship one member staff turn agree become supervisor
With help help visitor colleague others candidate eventually narrow sight particular area science potential source research problem
He hone skill point original work area finally defines problem belief solve suitable presentation thesis
It point career ought able present thesis proposal
This article concerned character content proposal concentrate important period research student life
Obviously necessity desirability kind thesis proposal different program different science matter debate discussion beyond scope paper
Instead concentrate expect proposal six vital point address
A thesis proposal represent considerable effort perhaps several month intensive work
It lay ground work thesis research providing convincing argument problem worth solving solved
It allows candidate stake claim potentially crowded area
It provides good yardstick candidate measure progress lack help focus energy feel waffling
It provides extremely useful evidence achievement need seek additional financial support grant expires
Finally help combat common occupational affliction student namely depression
The timing thesis proposal important
For research program presented second year
If done much earlier likely problem defined candidate done enough background work made enough progress area convince others solve
If proposal come much later either little time work money run spurious proposal produced fact thesis nearly done
The form thesis proposal matter individual taste candidate supervisor university
It may written one document presented orally seminar evolved mutual agreement done fashion
It may include research memoranda published article candidate
Some part may eventually included directly thesis
The different section proposal may done order depending upon thesis topic developed
But important least within department everyone know candidate investigation
A thesis proposal computing science address least following six point If candidate unable include defend six point thesis proposal indeed defend corresponding stage career even prepare kind thesis proposal ready commit one two year blood sweat fear turn acceptable thesis
Naturally neither supervisor university examiner going hold detail presented proposal
The nature research science provides biggest surprise strongly convinced fact idea
When lot people working given area lot university anyone easily scooped may feel necessary revise plan problem He may find original idea work must modify expected solution
This perfectly acceptable plan research adapted fit
Nevertheless candidate unable answer six point ready embark work let along follow control adapt force kind conclusion
Let u consider point turn
The first obvious thing thesis proposal contain statement problem considered specific general term
The specific statement must deal specific issue candidate interested example optimization table LAIR parser
The general statement relate problem larger context science show worth solving
The problem statement thesis proposal directed audience intelligent scientist specific interest problem interested knowing candidate
It directed candidate supervisor people similar research interest
To prepare proposal benefit make common mistake
Such proposal filled jargon private local group
It fails state important constraint frequently provide enough background
Sometimes candidate assumes supervisor know much specific area thesis something make difficult department examiner evaluate research merit
The candidate exposed real danger supervisor may working happily microcosm find end three year result justify degree
In order present problem wider audience order justify proceeding work necessary candidate present background problem survey related work others
This second component thesis proposal case may included directly thesis
It may take several example annotated bibliography comprehensive summary explanation analysis existing result
It may necessary desirable candidate include critical comment
For example thesis present new technique solving class numerical problem section proposal review existing technique analyze inadequacy
This without trap
If reference cited work mentioned within candidate department one department chummy serious ground questioning breadth knowledge background pursuing problem
The danger people limit horizon local environment produce inbred research narrow attitude unacceptable thesis
They tend reinvent idea already known elsewhere fail apply technique could simplify problem considerably often attach much importance minor result recognize major one worth reporting write incomprehensible thesis paper make effective contribution knowledge
In inbred environment work organization often dismissed irrelevant unimportant characteristic disease called NIH Not Invented Here
It extremely important thesis proposal indicate candidate know complete work
It hard enough schedule one good idea solving problem
It almost impossible
Thus student working tight emotionally constraining timetable need insight idea preliminary result commits discover
These described third section thesis proposal
If none significance proposal premature
For would indication problem capture attention long take solve write thesis
He would assurance heading right direction capable finding solution
By implication candidate must done successful work area perhaps collaboration others thesis proposal
This may something like discovery interesting algorithm representation relation working one project
He recognized tip iceberg introduction new problem area eventually becomes thesis research
For example student simulating paging algorithm stumble across phenomenon quite different expected generally accepted
This result subsequent explanation form basis thesis proposal thesis research memory management
They form seed method develops specify solve problem
Without result plan investigate area would seemed like hot air effort would lacked direction
But success research assured timely completion thesis much likely
A common situation occurs student proposes seems good problem investigate involving brand new broad general model theory
But pressed idea small special case example
He might even explored idea fully regard example uninteresting context overall problem idea apparent generalization
Some student able discover necessary general idea develop defend
But thesis far author typically awarded Nobel prize high distinction
Ordinary mortal good first class honour degree luck often get stuck unable find example application idea substantially different one know already
At point time go back look problem statement
As often uninteresting example may foundation interesting valuable thesis problem right
If probably better investment energy solve finish thesis devote life work general problem relaxed fashion
The important part thesis proposal statement kind solution problem expected characterization stopping condition project
This anything else help candidate estimate value effort separate chaff wheat allocate time
Without characterization candidate good way knowing stop submit
He measure far towards goal degree progressed
He might even discover satisfactory solution problem perceive
With characterization know stand research able argue convincingly appropriate time done set
Occasionally research student say I know precisely problem I want solve
I idea solution I certainly recognize I got
After research
So I possibly give characterization solution beforehand
That think exception characterize expected solution recognize
More likely specified problem sufficiently precisely yet done enough preliminary work obtained preliminary result area problem
In either case must legwork presenting thesis proposal
Sometimes easy characterize solution particularly light preliminary result
For example candidate developing new analytical model describe message traffic among communicating machine would expect prove theorem model validate empirically existing system construct algorithm based calculating performance similar system different parameter argue example useful design understanding future system
At time much harder specific stopping condition
It may also necessary change research progress
However moving target better target providing moving fast candidate catch
The first two point thesis proposal address almost quite afterthought
After candidate know want background allow done little bit idea take better draw plan action
This section thesis proposal like road map timetable travel remainder research
If carefully realistically prepared expose hazard trying reasonably run steam
Obviously plan like everything else proposal subject change new result obtained new idea gained
But plan better plan
Finally always useful research keep mind reported issue emphasized
Thus thesis proposal contain rough outline thesis preferably term expected solution problem
This least small impact shape research provide set good guideline candidate decides time write
It almost impossible define thesis Computing Sciences ought
Neither characterize difference acceptable one unacceptable one
No one present candidate prescription success embarks study
We predict among entering research student succeed lose interest drift away work hard three year perceive genuine research leave great bitterness discovering nothing present thesis
There formula tell u conduct research science step take thing avoid
The road lead progress result one person disaster another
It follows thesis proposal described guarantee anything may always appropriate
But help particularly problem investigation expected result
By considering research term guideline presented candidate supervisor go long way toward developing sensitivity awareness necessary make research lead successful thesis
It effort undertaken lightly
In note I attempted set personal idea thesis proposal I think ought I feel ought contain
These idea evolved experience thesis observation colleague day supervising student Newcastle analyzing apparently brilliant student never finish dozen conversation student colleague teacher friend
I come expect demand research student use guideline I outlined define thesis topic prepare proposal
When student colleague seek comment advice thesis topic project I ask question apply criterion
I offer thought worth whether student teacher hope supervisor student derive least small benefit
I must acknowledge deepest debt Professors Brian Randell William Lynch Bernard Galler taught enough able recognize good thesis topic I see one able head least bad one student get committed

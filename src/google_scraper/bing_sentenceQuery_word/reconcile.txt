A reconciliation let know financial transaction cleared financial institution
Images Reconciling financial account accounting record help identify error irregularity needed adjustment
In accounting reconcile mean compare two set record make sure agreement
One set record usually bank account type financial account set record usually accounting record
Bank reconciliation common type reconciliation
To ensure accurate accounting record perform reconciliation financial account
Compare transaction financial statement transaction accounting record
As complete reconciliation add entry fee interest income interest expense entry financial statement accounting record
Check transaction verify proof transaction cleared financial institution
Most accounting software way perform reconciliation check cleared transaction
Accounting paper check register also column check reconcile account
A reconciliation tell transaction cleared financial institution
As perform reconciliation may encounter transaction seem match different amount
The best way determine whether financial institution made mistake examine original financial record
You still record time reconciliation according IRS keep financial record backup bill receipt deposit minimum three year
If mistake correct mistake
If financial institution made mistake call work correct account
To protect company worker fraud person input financial transaction perform reconciliation
Reconciliations sometimes reveal entry financial statement accounting record
First investigate determine entry legitimate
If find legitimate source entry call financial institution ask clarity
If transaction fraudulent get financial institution remove possible
Another type fraud easily detected reconciliation check fraud
A reconciliation flush transaction person alters check given writes check account without permission
Reconciliations also let know transaction entered bank yet processed
These called deposit transit outstanding check
If made deposit end statement period statement normal appear next statement
However make deposit beginning statement period appear statement something investigate
Unlike unprocessed deposit unprocessed check rarely sign fraud
It usually mean someone forgotten deposit check account
If check stay unprocessed many month call recipient courtesy remind deposit check

Last month page Jason Rosenhouse reconciling science religion
In concluding paragraph said Many Christians resolved issue satisfaction
The literature defending theistic evolution large erudite
I understand though many people impressed effort
They seem like much armchair philosophy though writer think task reconciliation accomplished logically possible scenario containing God evolution matter implausible produced
He right
If one approach science religion logical system must rationally reconciled reconciliation hard
In particular one approach religion scientifically set logical proposition nothing considers many data point nothing reconciliation probably impossible
Even whatever emerges likely monstrous uninspiring thing
On side many religious people tend think science essentially religious nature
These folk think believing evolution say requires faith like believing Jesus Christ say requires faith
But true unless one stretch word faith mean nothing
Both side seems trapped within native category
Many scientist think religion science done badly many religious people think science basically religion
But science religion different language
They use differently different end
The cultural divide deep
This say science religion nothing say one another live one world
But careful translation required
And even perfect translation
But plenty horrible one
During time chair college physic department I directed search new faculty member
And surprise foreign applicant simply ran CV online translator sending
The result comical
A translation occurred one could discern original intent perhaps three four sentence
The application nearly pure nonsense
Often I read hear scientist religion religious believer science I get sense similar kind flatfooted translation lurking somewhere behind word
Truly bilingual people hard find perhaps two language perspective inspire different
Science category product frontal vision
They relatively
And science progress narrowing focus dividing world part
It put part back together sure never take eye distinction
On hand theology category relatively vision anything frontal
We address God directly always obliquely always indirectly
The language theology reflects object shifting presence life glancing peripheral
That nature thing Once nail dead
Or friend mine put Any box put God becomes casket
A story may help illustrate
As astronomy professor I spent many night sky student pointing star planet cosmic doodad
Often student would strain trying see dim star I could see easily
This blind vision excellent trick
To see dim star ca look straight
But relax look little side pop clearly view
Of course happens reflexively focus disappears
You must relax eye learn trust peripheral vision
You almost stop trying
It frustrating novice skygazers grown believing best way see something always look
It language theology grounded largely peripheral vision
It poetry exactly like poetry anything else
It ca forced ca manipulated anything explicit
Meanwhile science clip along direct straightforward prose
Science accessibility great gift knowledge like
A good translator invite science religion table seek common ground
This requires social savvy well knowledge relevant perspective language merely intellectual problem also identity problem
The translator hardest job may getting stranger look eye see human course mean consider reality outside
Then specific language problem addressed
It impossible task sure easy either
It enough make one hope new language bridge chasm science religion
Just dream
I know today least advice reconcile pair patience sensitivity really good translator

briefly technology us process information mathematical method order automatically correct measurement industrial process
The use DVR allows extracting accurate reliable information state industry process raw measurement data produce single consistent set data representing likely process operation
Industrial process example chemical thermodynamic process chemical plant refinery oil gas production site power plant often represented two fundamental mean Models different level detail example one incorporate simple mass compound conservation balance advanced thermodynamic model including energy conservation law
Mathematically model expressed variable incorporates system constraint example mass heat balance around unit
A variable could temperature pressure certain place plant
Normally distributed measurement without bias
Normally distributed measurement bias
Data originates typically taken different place throughout industrial site example temperature pressure volumetric flow rate measurement etc
To understand basic principle DVR important first recognize plant measurement never correct
raw measurement solution nonlinear system
When using measurement without correction generate plant balance common incoherency
categorized two basic type mean measurement true value typically known
A hand characterized measurement random variable equal true value
For ease deriving implementing optimal estimation solution based argument error sum many factor effect data reconciliation assumes error
Other source error calculating plant balance include process fault leak unmodeled heat loss incorrect physical property physical parameter used equation incorrect structure unmodeled bypass line
Other error include unmodeled plant dynamic holdup change instability plant operation violate steady state algebraic model
Additional dynamic error arise measurement sample taken time especially lab analysis
The normal practice using time average data input partly reduces dynamic problem
However completely resolve timing inconsistency data like lab analysis
This use average value like act high frequency noise mostly eliminated
The result practice data reconciliation mainly making adjustment correct systematic error like bias
international standard integration enterprise control system It asserts Data reconciliation serious issue integration
The data valid useful enterprise system
The data must often determined physical measurement associated error factor
This must usually converted exact value enterprise system
This conversion may require manual intelligent reconciliation converted value
Systems must set ensure accurate data sent production production
Inadvertent operator clerical error may result much production little production wrong production incorrect inventory missing inventory
DVR become important due industrial process becoming complex
DVR started early application aiming closing production process raw measurement available
At time problem identification elimination presented
In late unmeasured variable taken account data reconciliation DVR also became mature considering general nonlinear equation system coming thermodynamic Quasi steady state dynamic filtering simultaneous parameter estimation time introduced Stanley Mah
Dynamic DVR formulated nonlinear optimization problem Liebman et al

Data reconciliation technique target correcting measurement error due measurement noise

From statistical point view main assumption exist set measurement since may bias reconciliation result reduce robustness reconciliation
Given measurement data reconciliation mathematically expressed following form reconciled value measurement measured value measurement unmeasured variable standard deviation measurement process equality constraint bound measured unmeasured variable
The term called measurement
The objective function sum penalty denoted following
In word one want minimize overall correction measured least square term needed order satisfy
Additionally least square term weighted corresponding measurement
Sensor redundancy arising multiple sensor quantity time place
Topological redundancy arising model information using mass conservation constraint example one calculate known
Data reconciliation relies strongly concept redundancy correct measurement little possible order satisfy process constraint
Here redundancy defined differently
Instead redundancy arises combining sensor data model algebraic constraint sometimes specifically called spatial redundancy analytical redundancy topological redundancy
Redundancy due sensor duplicated order one measurement quantity
Redundancy also arises single variable estimated several independent way separate set measurement given time time averaging period using algebraic constraint
Redundancy linked concept
A variable system observable model sensor measurement used uniquely determine value system state
A sensor redundant removal cause loss observability
Rigorous definition observability calculability redundancy along criterion determining established Stanley Mah case set constraint algebraic equation inequality
Next illustrate special case Topological redundancy intimately linked mathematical system
minimum number piece information
measurement required order calculate system variable
For instance example flow conservation requires
One need know value two variable order calculate third one
The degree freedom model case equal
At least measurement needed estimate variable would needed redundancy
When speaking topological redundancy distinguish measured unmeasured variable
In following let u denote unmeasured variable measured variable
Then system process constraint becomes nonlinear system
If system calculable measurement given level topological redundancy defined
number additional measurement hand top measurement required order calculate system
Another way viewing level redundancy use definition difference number variable measured unmeasured number equation
Then one get
redundancy difference number equation number unmeasured variable
The level total redundancy sum sensor redundancy topological redundancy
We speak positive redundancy system calculable total redundancy positive
One see level topological redundancy merely depends number equation equation higher redundancy number unmeasured variable unmeasured variable lower redundancy number measured variable
Simple count variable equation measurement inadequate many system breaking several reason Portions system might redundancy others portion might even possible calculate b Nonlinearities lead different conclusion different operating point
As example consider following system stream unit
Calculable system one compute knowing yield
system knowing give information
We incorporate flow conservation constraint obtain
It possible system calculable even though
If measurement system calculated knowing give information
On hand known system calculated
In observability redundancy criterion proven sort flow network involving mass energy balance constraint
After combining plant input output environment node loss observability corresponds cycle unmeasured stream
That seen second case stream b cycle unmeasured stream
Redundancy classification follows testing path unmeasured stream since would lead unmeasured cycle measurement removed
Measurements c redundant second case even though part system unobservable
Redundancy used source information correct measurement increase accuracy precision one hand reconciled Further data reconciliation problem presented also includes unmeasured variable
Based information redundancy estimate unmeasured variable calculated along accuracy
In industrial process unmeasured variable data reconciliation provides referred virtual sensor hardware sensor installed
Data validation denotes validation verification action reconciliation step
Data filtering denotes process treating measured data value become meaningful lie within range expected value
Data filtering necessary reconciliation process order increase robustness reconciliation step
There several way data filtering example taking several measured value time period
Result validation set validation verification action taken reconciliation process take account measured unmeasured variable well reconciled value
Result validation cover limited penalty analysis determining reliability reconciliation bound check ensure reconciled value lie certain range
temperature within reasonable bound
Result validation may include statistical test validate reliability reconciled value checking whether exist set measured value
These test example If gross error exist set measured value penalty term objective function normally distributed mean equal variance equal
By consequence objective function random variable follows since sum square normally distributed random variable
Comparing value objective function given probability density function distribution
percentile confidence give indication whether gross error exists If gross error exist probability
The chi square test give rough indication existence gross error easy conduct one compare value objective function critical value chi square distribution
The individual test compare penalty term objective function critical value normal distribution
If penalty term outside confidence interval normal distribution reason believe measurement gross error
Advanced data validation reconciliation DVR integrated approach combining data reconciliation data validation technique characterized Simple model include mass balance
When adding thermodynamic constraint model scope level increase
Indeed seen level redundancy defined number equation
Including energy balance mean adding equation system result higher level redundancy provided enough measurement available equivalently many variable unmeasured
Gross error measurement systematic error may reconciliation result
Therefore important identify eliminate gross error reconciliation process
After reconciliation applied indicate whether gross error exist somewhere set measurement
These technique gross error remediation based two concept Gross error elimination determines one measurement biased systematic error discard measurement data set
The determination measurement discarded based different kind penalty term express much measured value deviate reconciled value
Once gross error detected discarded measurement reconciliation done without faulty measurement spoil reconciliation process
If needed elimination repeated gross error exists set measurement
Gross error relaxation target relaxing estimate uncertainty suspicious measurement reconciled value confidence interval
Relaxation typically find application possible determine measurement around one unit responsible gross error equivalence gross error
Then measurement uncertainty measurement involved increased
It important note remediation gross error reduces quality reconciliation either redundancy decrease elimination uncertainty measured data increase relaxation
Therefore applied initial level redundancy high enough ensure data reconciliation still done see Section
Advanced DVR solution offer integration technique mentioned The result advanced DVR procedure coherent set validated reconciled process data
DVR find application mainly industry sector either measurement accurate even like example difficult expensive position see accurate data high importance example security reason see
Another field application see oil refining chemical industry
As DVR enables calculate estimate even unmeasured variable reliable way German Engineering Society VDI Gesellschaft Energie und Umwelt accepted technology DVR mean replace expensive sensor nuclear power industry see VDI norm

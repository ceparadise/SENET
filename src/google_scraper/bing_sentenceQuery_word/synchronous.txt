In refers one two distinct related concept synchronization synchronization
refers idea multiple process join certain point order reach agreement commit certain sequence action
refers idea keeping multiple copy dataset coherence one another maintain
Process synchronization primitive commonly used implement data synchronization
The need synchronization arise merely system kind concurrent process even single processor system
Mentioned main need synchronization When job arrives fork point split N serviced n task
After serviced wait done processing
Then joined leave system
Thus parallel programming require synchronization parallel process wait several process occur
In relationship consumer process dependent producer process till necessary data produced
When multiple process dependent resource need access time operating system need ensure one processor access given point reduces concurrency
Thread synchronization defined mechanism ensures two concurrent simultaneously execute particular program segment known
Processes access critical section controlled using synchronization technique
When one thread start executing serialized segment program thread wait first thread finish
If proper synchronization technique applied may cause value variable may unpredictable vary depending timing process thread
For example suppose three process namely
All three concurrently executing need share common resource critical section shown Figure
Synchronization used avoid conflict accessing shared resource
Hence Process try access resource assigned one process time
If assigned Process process Process need wait Process free resource shown Figure
Another synchronization requirement need considered order particular process thread executed
For example board plane buy ticket
Similarly check without validating credential user name password
In way ATM provide service provide correct PIN
Other mutual exclusion synchronization also deal following One challenge exascale algorithm design minimize reduce synchronization
Synchronization take time computation especially distributed computing
Reducing synchronization drew attention computer scientist decade
Whereas becomes increasingly significant problem recently gap improvement computing latency increase
Experiments shown global communication due synchronization distributed computer take dominated share sparse iterative solver
This problem receiving increasing attention emergence new benchmark metric High Performance Conjugate Gradient HPCG ranking top supercomputer
The following classic problem synchronization These problem used test nearly every newly proposed synchronization scheme primitive
Many system provide hardware support code
A single processor could disable executing currently running code without inefficient system
The key ability require implement synchronization multiprocessor set hardware primitive ability atomically read modify memory location
Without capability cost building basic synchronization primitive high increase processor count increase
There number alternative formulation basic hardware primitive provide ability atomically read modify location together way tell read write performed atomically
These hardware primitive basic building block used build wide variety synchronization operation including thing
In general architect expect user employ basic hardware primitive instead expect primitive used system programmer build synchronization library process often complex tricky
Many modern hardware provides special atomic hardware instruction either memory word content two memory word
In prevent thread interference memory consistency error block code wrapped section
This force thread acquire said lock object execute block
The lock automatically released thread leaf block enter waiting state within block
Any variable update made thread synchronized block become visible thread whenever thread similarly acquires lock
In addition mutual exclusion memory consistency Java block enable signaling sending event thread acquired lock execute code block waiting lock within block
This mean Java synchronized section combine functionality mutexes event
Such primitive known
Any object fine used Java
The declaring object implicitly implied lock object whole method marked
The synchronization primitive
Synchronization designed cooperative demanding every thread process follow synchronization mechanism accessing protected resource critical section consistent result
In locking signaling lightweight synchronization type spinwait interlocked operation mechanism related synchronization
Another effective way implementing synchronization using spinlocks
Before accessing shared resource piece code every processor check flag
If flag reset processor set flag continues executing thread
But flag set locked thread would keep spinning loop keep checking flag set
But spinlocks effective flag reset lower cycle otherwise lead performance issue waste many processor cycle waiting
Barriers simple implement provide good responsiveness
They based concept implementing wait cycle provide synchronization
Consider three thread running simultaneously starting barrier
After time reach barrier still wait thread reach correct data
Once thread reach barrier start
After time thread reach wait thread correct data
Thus barrier synchronization multiple thread always thread end waiting thread example thread keep waiting thread
This result severe degradation process performance
The barrier synchronization wait function thread represented Wbarrier f Tbarrier Rthread Where Wbarrier wait time thread Tbarrier number thread arrived Rthread arrival rate thread
Experiments show total execution time spent waiting slower thread
Semaphores signalling mechanism allow one access section
A Semaphore flag certain fixed value associated time thread wish access section decrement flag
Similarly thread leaf section flag incremented
If flag zero thread access section get blocked chooses wait
Some semaphore would allow one thread process code section
Such Semaphores called binary semaphore similar Mutex
Here value semaphore thread allowed access value access denied
Synchronization originally concept whereby lock could obtained object
Its primary usage database
There two type file
lock may obtained many process thread
lock exclusive may used single time
Although lock derived file database data also shared memory process thread
Sometimes one object file locked time
If locked simultaneously overlap causing deadlock exception
exclusive lock thread based rely processor instruction
An abstract mathematical foundation synchronization primitive given
There also many theoretical device built top history monoid
Following synchronization example respect different platform
provides provides Enabling disabling kernel preemption replaced spinlocks uniprocessor system
Prior kernel version disabled interrupt implement short critical section
Since version later Linux fully preemptive
provides provides A distinctly different related concept
This refers need keep multiple copy set data coherent one another maintain Figure
For example database replication used keep multiple copy data synchronized database server store data different location
Examples include Some challenge user may face data synchronization When start something data usually simple format
It varies time organization grows evolves result building simple interface two application source target also need transform data passing target application
extraction transformation loading tool helpful stage managing data format complexity
This era system
Customers want see current status order current status parcel real time parcel current balance account etc
This show need system updated well enable smooth manufacturing process ordering material enterprise running stock synchronizing customer order manufacturing process etc
From real life exist many example processing give successful competitive advantage
There fixed rule policy enforce data security
It may vary depending system using
Even though security maintained correctly source system capture data security information access privilege must enforced target system well prevent potential misuse information
This serious issue particularly come handling secret confidential personal information
So sensitivity confidentiality data transfer information must encrypted
Data quality another serious constraint
For better management maintain good quality data common practice store data one location share different people different system application different location
It help preventing inconsistency data
There five different phase involved data synchronization process Each step critical
In case large amount data synchronization process need carefully planned executed avoid negative impact performance

The operation may
A synchronous operation process till operation completes
An asynchronous operation operation
The caller could discover completion mechanism discussed later
Does make sense asynchronous RPC send
The notion synchronous operation requires understanding mean operation complete
In case remote assignment send receive complete message delivered receiver
In case remote procedure call send receive reply complete result delivered sender assuming return value
Otherwise send receive complete procedure finish execution
During time procedure executing sender receiver rendezvous mentioned
Note implies blocking vice versa every blocking operation synchronous every non blocking operation asynchronous
For instance send block till receiver machine received message blocking synchronous since receiver process may received
Similarly see later Xinu receive asynchronous
These definition operation similar identical one given text book tend equate synchronous blocking
Asynchronous message passing allows parallelism
Since process block computation message transit
In case receive mean process express interest receving message multiple port simultaneously
The select primitive discussed later provides facility synchronous receives
In synchronous system parallelism achieved forking separate process concurrent operation approach incurs cost extra process management
This cost typically bearable lwps hwps
Asynchronous message passing introduces several problem
What happens message delivered
The sender may never wait delivery message thus never hear error
Similarly mechanism needed notify asynchronous receiver message arrived
The operation invoker could learn polling getting software interrupt waiting explicitly completion later using special sycnhronous wait call
An asynchronous operation need return id application need later notified operation
At notification time id would placed global location passed argument handler wait call
Another problem related asynchronous message passing buffering
If message sent asynchronously buffered space managed OS process may fill space flooding system large number message

What difference asynchronous synchronous execution
When execute something synchronously wait finish moving another task
When execute something asynchronously move another task finish
That said context computer translates executing process task another thread
A thread series command block code exists unit work
The operating system manage multiple thread assign thread piece slice processor time switching another thread give turn work
At core pardon pun processor simply execute command concept two thing one time
The operating system simulates allocating slice time different thread
Now introduce multiple mix thing CAN actually happen time
The operating system allocate time one thread first processor allocate block time another thread different processor
All allowing operating system manage completion task go code thing
Asynchronous programming complicated topic semantics thing tie together time
There numerous article book subject look
Synchronous mean connected dependent way
In word two synchronous task must aware one another one task must execute way dependent wait start task completed
Asynchronous mean totally independent neither one must consider way either initiation execution
Synchronous one thread Synchronous Asynchronous one thread Asynchronous Technically concept really
Although general unusual find asynchronous task running thread possible see example find two task executing synchronously thread No concept whether second subsequent task initiated first task completed whether must wait
That
What thread thread process CPUs indeed hardware task executed relevant
Indeed make point I edited graphic show
ASYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE
In solving many engineering problem software designed split overall problem multiple individual task execute asynchronously
Inverting matrix finite element analysis problem good example
In computing sorting list example
The quick sort routine example split list two list sort calling recursively
In example two task often executed asynchronously
They need separate thread
Even machine one CPU one thread execution coded initiate processing second task first one completed
The criterion
As long start end time task overlap possible output neither needed input executed asynchronously matter many thread use
SYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE
Any process consisting multiple task task must executed sequence one must executed another machine Fetch update data get stock quote financial service etc
If separate machine separate thread whether synchronous asynchronous
In simpler term SYNCHRONOUS You queue get movie ticket
You get one everybody front get one applies people queued behind
ASYNCHRONOUS You restaurant many people
You order food
Other people also order food wait food cooked served order
In kitchen restaurant worker continuously cooking serving taking order
People get food served soon cooked
I try explain simply I hopefully remember My bos busy man
He tell write code
I tell Fine
I get started watching like vulture standing behind shoulder
I like Dude WTF go something I finish
like No I finish
This synchronous
The bos tell rather waiting right work bos go task
When I finish job I simply report bos say I DONE
This Asynchronous Execution
It really simple
Hope help
Take advice NEVER work bos behind
mean execution happens single series

If calling routine run finish start finish start etc
With begin routine let run background start next point say wait finish
It like finish The advantage execute still running background separate thread take better advantage resource fewer hang wait
Synchronous mean caller wait response completion asynchronous caller continues response come later applicable
As example This always ouput But make doSomething asynchronous multiple way output become Because method making asynchronous call would immediately continue next line code
I say could order execution ca guaranteed asynch operation
It could also execute original depending thread timing etc
I think bit explanation still clarifies using real life example
Small Example Let say playing audio involves three step If audio player step sequentially every song synchronous
You wait time hear song till song actually get fetched decompressed
If audio player step independent asynchronous
ie
While playing audio step fetch audio harddisk parallel step decompresses audio parallel
step You end hearing song without waiting much fetch decompress
In nutshell synchronization refers two process point
In example Process A endpoint synchronized Process B start point Asynchronous process hand start endpoint synchronized Where Process A overlap Process B running concurrently dictionary definition hence confusion
It might helpful think term asynchronous synchronous instead asynchronous synchronous
Simply said asynchronous execution stuff background
For example want download file internet might use synchronous function block thread file finished downloading
This make application unresponsive user input
Instead could download file background using asynchronous method
In case download function return immediately program execution continues normally
All download operation done background program notified finished
When executing sequence like b c get failure middle execution like Then beginning synchronous If however sequence execute b c failure middle instead restarting beginning point failure know asynchronous
You confusing Synchronous Parallel v Series
Synchronous mean time
Syncronized mean related othere mean series fixed interval
While program running series
Get dictionary unsweet tea
You tea sweetened tea
Synchronous basically mean execute one thing time
Asynchronous mean execute multiple thing time finish executing current thing order move next one
As really simple example Imagine school student instructed walk queue road
The student got shoelace untied
Now stopped tying
All student behind stopped waiting get tied
The student walked past continuing usual pace
Just Imagine random people walking road
They queue course randomly walking different place road different pace
person shoelace got untied
She stopped get tied
But nobody waiting get tied
Everyone else still walking way pace
A synchronous operation work returning caller
An asynchronous operation work returning caller
When task executed synchronously wait task completed moving another task
One task depends end another When task executed asynchronously directly switch another task previous completed
One task depend
In programming task executed
It necessary understand several thread created task order avoid stacking single queue
That said concept synchronous asynchronous much thread reason I mention rare see task running asynchronously single thread although technically possible
In regard definition synchronous execution sometimes confusing good way understand Thank interest question

In sends message process may relies process supporting infrastructure select invoke actual code run
Message passing differs conventional programming process subroutine function directly invoked name
Message passing key
Message passing used ubiquitously modern computer software
It used way object make program work mean object system running different computer Internet interact
Message passing may implemented various mechanism including
Message passing technique invoking behavior running program computer
In contrast traditional technique calling program name message passing us distinguish general function specific implementation
The invoking program sends message relies object select execute appropriate code
The justification using intermediate layer essentially fall two category encapsulation distribution
idea software object able invoke service object without knowing caring service implemented
Encapsulation reduce amount coding logic make system maintainable
rather statement determine subroutine function call developer send message object object select appropriate code based type
One first example used domain computer graphic
There sort complexity involved manipulating graphic object
For example simply using right formula compute area enclosed shape vary depending shape triangle rectangle elipse circle
In traditional computer programming would result long statement testing sort object shape calling appropriate code
The way handle define class called subclass turn subclass simply send message asking compute area
Each object invoke subclass method formula appropriate kind object
Distributed message passing provides developer layer architecture provides common service build system made run disparate computer different location different time
When distributed object sending message messaging layer take care issue One important distinction among message passing system whether use synchronous asynchronous message passing
Synchronous message passing occurs object running time
With asynchronous message passing possible receiving object busy running requesting object sends message
Synchronous message passing typical programming language Java Smalltalk use
Asynchronous message passing requires additional capability storing retransmitting data system may run concurrently
The advantage synchronous message passing conceptually le complex
Synchronous message passing analogous function call message sender function caller message receiver called function
Function calling easy familiar
Just function caller stop called function completes sending process stop receiving process completes
This alone make synchronous message unworkable application
For example synchronous message passing would used exclusively large distributed system generally would perform well enough usable
Such large distributed system may need continue operate subsystem subsystem may need go offline kind maintenance time subsystem open receiving input system
Imagine busy business office desktop computer send email using synchronous message passing exclusively
Because office system use asynchronous message passing one worker turning computer cause computer freeze worker turn computer back process single email
Asynchronous message passing generally implemented complexity naturally occur trying synchronize system data handled intermediary level software
Commercial vendor develop software product support intermediate level usually call software
One common type middleware support asynchronous messaging called MOM
With asynchronous message passing sending system wait response
Continuing function call analogy asynchronous message passing would function call return immediately without waiting called function execute
Such asynchronous function call would merely deliver argument called function tell called function execute return continue execution
Asynchronous message passing simply sends message message bus
The bus store message receiving process request message sent
When receiving process arrives result sends result message bus message bus hold message original process designated next process pick message message bus
Synchronous communication built top asynchronous communication using
For example work ensuring sender always wait acknowledgement message receiver
The sender sends next message acknowledgement received
On hand asynchronous communication also built top synchronous communication
For example modern generally provide primitive asynchronous messaging implemented top using
The buffer required asynchronous communication cause problem full
A decision made whether block sender whether discard future message
If sender blocked may lead unexpected
If message dropped communication longer reliable
These example kind problem middleware vendor try address
In addition distinction synchronous asynchronous message passing primary distinguishing feature message passing system whether use distributed local object
With distributed object sender receiver may exist different computer running different operating system using different programming language etc
In case bus layer take care detail converting data one system another sending receiving data across network etc
The RPC protocol early example
Note type message passing requirement either sender receiver implemented using programming
It possible wrap system developed using procedural language treat large grained object capable sending receiving message
Examples system support distributed object
Distributed object system called shared nothing system message passing abstraction hide underlying state change may used implementation sending message
Distributed asynchronous message passing overhead associated compared simpler way simply calling procedure
In traditional argument passed receiver typically one containing address argument
This form communication differs message passing least three crucial area In message passing transferring argument involved operation involves copying existing argument portion new message upon creation
This applies regardless size argument case argument large document megabyte worth data
The argument copied entirety transmitted receiving object
By contrast standard procedure call address bit need passed argument may even passed requiring zero additional storage zero transfer time
This course possible distributed system since absolute address caller address space normally meaningless remote program however might fact usable receiver copy least sender memory advance
Web example process communicate message passing
A example way referencing resource depend exposing internals process
A call invocation exit invoked computation terminated
Asynchronous message passing contrast result response arriving significant time request message sent
A message handler general process message one sender
This mean state change reason unrelated behavior single sender client process
This contrast typical behavior object upon method invoked latter expected remain state method invocation
In word message handler behaves analogously
The prominent mathematical model message passing
In mathematical term message single mean pas control object
If object responds message message
argued message passing important object OOP object often
The programming model build upon observation us concept characterize behavior complex distributed system term message pattern using specification

Quoted interrupt signal indicating need attention event software indicating need change execution
I wondering asynchronous synchronous mean
When mention asynchronous interrupt using classical clocked definition synchronous applies digital circuit
A digital circuit said synchronous every part logic connected common clock like CPU
At rise fall every clock cycle state circuit updated
An asynchronous digital circuit hand clocked rather next state dependent current one switch soon
Reading logic circuit share common clock also defined asynchronous
If asynchronous interrupt triggered mean processor likely next clock cycle save current executing environment service interrupt request
This example hardware interrupt one triggered external connection processor
All software interrupt mentioned article technically synchronous since initiated CPU synchronous circuit
Since external device share common clock CPU external interrupt said asynchronous
Even though device triggered interrupt synchronous circuit interrupt triggered asynchronously since sharing common clock signal device
The actual external interrupt asynchronous CPU interrupt handler synchronous detect interrupt since point synchronous system allow system state change together
If curious processor handle interrupt see specifically Volume Part
From Etymology Dictionary
synchronus Gk
synchronos together time
Meaning recurring successive instant time attested mean synchronous
Now read context
The asynchronous interrupt would directly related activity hand think like reading suddenly hear noise behind turn around asynchronously interrupted Now reading wikipedia page interrupt see word look synchronous interrupt flow thought cause interrupt read result stopped reading looked word eventually came back reading
Basically way get attention kernel program
An example Lets say program download file
I want program still responsive file downloading I need tell program I done
In meantime however program continue whatever want completion downloaded file
It whatever need
It asynchronous happen predefined time predefined order
Sync mean expected happen next
Async mean know would happen

What difference encoding modulation
I seen term used sometimes sometimes differently ratio
Can somebody clearly explain technical example
I searched lot net end I end scratching head
Modulation Way send signal information one place another
exanmple carrier wave like sine wave Information signal analog signal want transmit
You simply change property carrier wave respect signal
Like AM FM ASK PSK QAM Encoding Somthing else modulation
It representation data
Example could according logic example Unipolar encoding Bipolar Encoding
Encoding assigning different binary code according particular algorithm
Modulation changing property one signal value according certain property Amplitude Phase Frequency another signal

Do computer actually speak English
Do store information sentence could understand
No
Computers transmit store information encoding combination digit two choice per spot
Most people think choice zero one like movie The Matrix
In reality information encoded many way
Hard Disk Drives image use combination magnetic positive magnetic negative
CDs DVDs Image use laser light either reflects reflect back
Other storage device may use option method still binary Computers today use binary system represent information
It called binary two different digit used
It also known base two human normally use base
Each zero one called bit binary digit
A bit usually represented computer main memory transistor switched capacitor charged discharged
Image When data must transmitted telephone line radio link high tone used one zero
On gnetic disk floppy disk hard disk tape bit represented direction magnetic field coated surface either
Image Audio CDs DVDs store bit part surface corresponding bit either reflect light
Image One bit represent much usually grouped together group eight represent number
A group eight bit called byte
The speed computer depends number bit process
For example computer process number one operation computer must break number smaller piece making slower
Ultimately bit byte computer us store transmit number text information
Now need binary clear time practice encoding simple data like letter

This noob question I wan na know different encoding type difference ie
ASCII etc
Reasons many I believe main point How many character need display encode
If live US example could go pretty far ASCII
But many county need character like etc
If SO ASCII try read text ASCII encoded text see weird character place
Think also China Japan Thailand exotic countires
Those weird figure photo may seen around world might letter pretty picture
As difference different encoding type need see specification
Here something
I familiar
Here information difference
used need encode binary data need stored transferred medium designed deal textual data
If ever made somesort email system PHP probably encountered
Is short To support computer program user interface localization many different language
Programming language still mainly consist character found ASCII encoding althought possible example Java use encoding variable name source code file usually stored something else ASCII encoded text example encoding
In short Always different people trying solve problem specific point view even without point view even possible result may quite different
Quote Joel unicode article link Because byte room eight bit lot people got thinking gosh use code purpose
The trouble lot people idea time idea go space
Thanks Joachim tchrist info discussion
Here two article I read
Both link page I linked earlier
I forgotten stuff Joel article since I last read year back
Good introduction subject I hope
Mark Davis go little deeper
The real reason many variant came along late
In The Beginning memory storage expensive using sometimes bit memory store single character considered excessive
Thus pretty much text stored using bit per character
Clearly bit enough memory represent character human language
It barely enough represent character used language even possible
Therefore many different character encoding designed allow different language English German Greek Russian encode text bit per character
After single text file usually even single computer system ever used single language right
This led situation single mapping character number kind
Many different incompatible solution produced real central control existed
Some computer system used others used precisely one many variation EBCDIC one many derivative big list encoding hardly heard
Finally Unicode Consortium stepped task produce single mapping together auxiliary data useful outside bound answer
When Unicode consortium finally produced comprehensive list character computer might represent together number encoding scheme encode binary data depending concrete need character encoding scheme already widely used
This slowed adoption Unicode encoding considerably
These day want represent text best bet use one encoding represent Unicode character
together suffice use case cover almost others
And clear encoding encode valid Unicode character
But due fact encoding might ideal use case
Unless need able interact legacy system handle encoding rarely reason choose anything else day
The main reason able show character
When internet infancy noone really planned ahead thinking one day would people using country language around world
So small character set good enough
Gradually revealed limited thus demand bigger character set

In computing used represent repertoire kind system
Depending context corresponding resulting code space may regarded natural electrical etc
A character encoding used transmission textual
Character set character map codeset related identical term
Early character code associated optical electrical could represent subset character used written language sometimes restricted upper case letter numeral punctuation
The low cost digital representation data modern computer system allows elaborate character code represent character used many written language
Character encoding using internationally accepted standard permit worldwide interchange text electronic form
Early binary repertoire include encoding Chinese character
Common example character encoding system include American Standard Code Information Interchange
introduced used encode letter character via series long short press
Representations character encoded using Morse code varied length
The encoding created patented modified Donald Murray standardized CCITT International Telegraph Alphabet No
code introduced Army Signal Corps late
encoding scheme used IBM early computer example computer well associated peripheral
BCD extended existing simple numeric encoding include alphabetic special character mapping easily encoding already widespread use
It precursor EBCDIC
introduced encoding scheme used encode letter numeral symbol device code using
usually abbreviated EBCDIC encoding scheme developed
The limitation set soon became apparent number method developed extend
The need support different language including family East Asian script required support far larger number character demanded systematic approach character encoding rather previous ad hoc approach
In trying develop universally interchangeable character encoding researcher faced dilemma one hand seemed necessary add bit accommodate additional character hand user relatively small character set Latin alphabet still constituted majority computer user additional bit colossal waste expensive computing resource would always zeroed user
The compromise solution eventually found developed Unicode break assumption dating back telegraph code character always directly correspond particular sequence bit
Instead character would first mapped universal intermediate representation form abstract number called
Code point would represented variety way various default number bit per character code unit depending context
To encode code point higher length code unit unit solution implement escape sequence would signal subsequent bit parsed higher code point
Terminology related code unit The Latin character set used English European language though Greek character set used Greek language
The character repertoire abstract set one million character found wide variety script including
Other symbol musical notation also included character repertoire
Both Unicode standard character repertoire
As new character added one standard standard also add character maintain parity
The code unit size equivalent bit measurement particular encoding Consider letter abc followed represented
That string contains To express character Unicode hexadecimal value prefixed string
The range valid code point Unicode standard inclusive divided identified number
Characters range plane called BMP
This plane contains character
Characters range plane called
The following table show example code point value A code point represented sequence code unit
The mapping defined encoding
Thus number code unit required represent code point depends encoding parallel standard together constitute modern unified character encoding
Rather mapping character directly octet separately define character available corresponding natural number number encoded series natural number code unit finally unit encoded stream octet
The purpose decomposition establish universal set character encoded variety way
To describe model correctly requires precise term character set character encoding
The term used modern model follow A full set abstract character system support
The repertoire may closed
addition allowed without creating new standard case ASCII series may open allowing addition case Unicode limited extent
The character given repertoire reflect decision made divide writing system basic information unit
The basic variant alphabet broken letter digit punctuation space arranged simple linear sequence displayed order read
But even alphabet pose complication regarded either part single character containing letter diacritic known precomposed character separate character
The former allows far simpler text handling system latter allows combination used text
pose similar problem
Other writing system Arabic Hebrew represented complex character repertoire due need accommodate thing like bidirectional text joined together different way different situation
A CCS map character code point represents one character
For example given repertoire capital letter A Latin alphabet might represented code point character B
Multiple coded character set may share repertoire example IBM code page cover repertoire map different code point
A CEF mapping code point facilitate storage system represents number bit sequence fixed length
practically computer system
For example system store numeric information unit directly represent code point unit larger code point say million could represented using multiple unit
This correspondence defined CEF
Next CES mapping code unit sequence octet facilitate storage file system transmission network
Simple character encoding scheme include compound character encoding scheme switch several simple scheme using compressing scheme try minimise number byte used per code unit
Although simpler CES system working Unicode use either ASCII map Unicode code point sequence octet map Unicode code point sequence word
See detailed discussion
Finally may supply additional information select particular variant character particularly regional variant Unicode character
An example attribute xml lang
The Unicode model us term historical system directly assign sequence character sequence byte covering CCS CEF CES layer
Historically term character encoding character map character set synonymous standard would specify repertoire character encoded stream code unit usually single character per code unit
But term related distinct meaning due effort standard body use precise terminology writing unifying many different encoding system
Regardless term still used interchangeably nearly ubiquitous
A usually mean encoding regard suite encoding covering different script many character share code page
code page suite Windows based IBM DOS based see detail
Most encoding referred code page encoding see byte size
IBM Character Data Representation Architecture CDRA designates coded character set identifier variously called charset character set code page CHARMAP
The term code page occur Unix Linux charmap preferred usually larger context locale
Contrasted character encoding map abstract character
A character set parlance character encoding CCS
encoding term sometimes used characterize old character encoding ambiguity sense
Most use context refers encoding fail cover Unicode code point generally using somewhat different character repertoire several code point representing one Unicode character versa see

Some source refer encoding preceded Unicode
All Windows code page usually referred legacy antedate Unicode unable represent possible Unicode code point
As result many character encoding method use need backward compatibility archived data many computer program developed translate data encoding scheme form data

Data compression reduces amount space needed store file
If halve size file store twice many file cost download file twice fast half cost paying download
Even though disk getting bigger high bandwidth becoming common nice get even value working smaller compressed file
For large data warehouse like kept Google Facebook halving amount space taken represent massive reduction space computing required consequently big saving power consumption cooling huge reduction impact environment
Common form compression currently use include JPEG used photo used audio MPEG used video including DVDs ZIP many kind data
For example JPEG method reduces photo tenth smaller original size mean camera store time many photo image web downloaded time faster
So catch
Well issue quality data example highly compressed JPEG image look sharp image compressed
Also take processing time compress decompress data
In case tradeoff worth always
Kb JPEG Kb JPEG Use interactive online In chapter look compression might done benefit cost associated using compressed data need considered deciding whether compress data
We start simple example Run Length Encoding give insight benefit issue around compression
Watch video online Run length encoding RLE technique widely used day great way get feel issue around using compression
Imagine following simple black white image
One simple way computer store image binary using format mean white mean black bit map mapped pixel onto value bit
Using method image would represented following way There image format us simple representation described
The format called portable bitmap format PBM
PBM file saved file extension contain simple header followed image data
The data file viewed opening text editor much like opening file image viewed opening drawing image viewing program support PBM file format well supported number image viewing editing program display
A pbm file diamond image used earlier would follows The first two line header
The first line specifies format file mean file contains ASCII zero one
The second line specifies width height image pixel
This allows computer know size dimension image even newline character separating row file missing
The rest data image like
If wanted could copy paste representation including header text file save file extension
If program computer able open PBM file could view image
You could even write program output file display image
Because digit represented using ASCII format efficient useful want read inside file
There variation format pack pixel bit instead character variation used grey scale colour image
More
The key question compression whether represent image using fewer bit still able reconstruct original image
It turn
There many way going section focussing method called
Imagine read bit someone copying might say thing like five zero instead zero zero zero zero zero
Is basic idea behind run length encoding RLE used save space storing digital image
In run length encoding replace row number say many consecutive pixel colour
For example first row image contains one white two black four white one black four white two black one white pixel
This could represented follows
For second row need say number white pixel say number black need explicitly say zero start row
You might ask need say number white pixel first case zero
The reason clear rule start computer would way knowing colour display image represented form
The third row contains five white five black five white
This coded That mean get following representation first three row
You work row would following system
The remaining row In video Computer Science Unplugged show Run length encoded image decoded using large pixel printer spray
Watch video online Just ensure reverse compression process go finding original representation zero one compressed image
What image
How many pixel original image
How many number used represent pixel
This image solution available activity cup saucer
The following interactive allows experiment Run Length Encoding
Use interactive online How much space saved using alternate representation measure
One simple way consider imagine typing representation could think original bit stored one character RLE code using character digit comma bit crude starting point
In original representation digit one zero required represent image
Count number comma digit space newlines ignore new representation
This number character required represent image new representation ensure right track first row given contain character
Assuming got new image representation correct counted correctly found character new image double check number differs
This mean new representation requires around many character represent calculated using
This significant reduction amount space required store image half size
The new representation form old one
In practice method extra trick used compress image original size
In real system original image us one bit every pixel store black white value one character used calculation
However run length number also stored much efficiently using bit pattern take little space represent number
The bit pattern used usually based technique called Huffman coding beyond want get
The main place black white scanned image used fax machine use approach compression
One reason work well scanned page number consecutive white pixel huge
In fact entire scanned line nothing white pixel
A typical fax page pixel across replacing bit one number big saving
The number take bit represent place scanned page consecutive pixel replaced number overall saving significant
In fact fax machine would take time longer send page use compression
Now know run length encoding work come compress black white image well uncompress image somebody else given
Start making picture one zero
Make sure rectangular row length
You either draw paper prepare computer using fixed width font otherwise become really frustrating confusing
In order make easier could start working want image grid paper math exercise book shading square represent black one leaving blank represent white one
Once done could write zero one image
Work compressed representation image using run length coding
run length separated comma form explained
Now give copy run length code original uncompressed representation friend classmate along explanation compressed
Ask try draw image grid paper
Once done check conversion original
Imagining friend computer shown image using system representation compressed one computer decompressed another long standard agreed
every line begin white pixel
It important compression algorithm follow standard file compressed one computer decompressed another example song often follow standard downloaded played variety device
As compressed representation image converted back original representation original representation compressed representation would give image read computer compression algorithm called
none data lost compressing image result compression could undone exactly
Not compression algorithm lossless though
In type file particular photo sound video willing sacrifice little bit quality
lose little data representing image allows u make file size lot smaller
For downloading large file movie essential ensure file size big infeasible download
These compression method called
If data lost impossible convert file back exactly original form lossy compression used person viewing movie listening music may mind lower quality file smaller
Later chapter investigate effect lossy compression algorithm image sound
Interestingly turn compression algorithm case compressed version file larger uncompressed version
Computer scientist even proven case meaning impossible anybody ever come lossless compression algorithm make possible file smaller
In case issue though good lossless compression algorithm tend give best compression common pattern data worst compression one highly unlikely occur
What image best compression
image size small percentage original come
This best case performance compression algorithm
What worst compression
Can find image actually compressed representation
Don forget comma version used
This worst case performance compression algorithm
The best case image entirely white one number used per line
The worst case every pixel alternating black white one number every pixel
In fact case size compressed file likely little larger original one number likely take one bit store
Real system represent data exactly discussed issue
In worst case alternating black white pixel run length encoding method result file larger original
As noted lossless compression method make least one file smaller must also file make larger mathematically possible method always make file smaller unless method lossy
As trivial example suppose someone claim compression method convert file file
How many different file
There
How many different file
There
Can see problem
We got possible file might want compress way represent
So identical representation ca decoded exactly
Over year several fraud based claim lossless compression method compress every file given
This true method lossy loses information lossless method must expand file
It would nice file could compressed without loss could compress huge file apply compression compressed file make smaller repeating one byte one bit
Unfortunately possible
Images take lot space time picture stored computer compressed avoid wasting much space
With lot image especially photograph need store image exactly originally contains way detail anyone see
This lead considerable saving space especially detail missing kind people trouble perceiving
This kind compression called lossy compression
There situation image need stored exactly original medical scan high quality photograph processing case lossless method used image compressed
using RAW format camera
In data representation section looked size image file reduced using fewer bit describe colour pixel
However image compression method JPEG take advantage pattern image reduce space needed represent without impacting image unnecessarily
The following three image show difference reducing bit depth using specialised image compression system
The left hand image original bit per pixel
The middle image compressed one third original size using JPEG lossy version original difference unlikely perceptible
The right hand one number colour reduced bit per pixel instead mean also stored third original size
Even though lost many bit information removed much impact look
This advantage JPEG remove information image much impact perceived quality
Furthermore JPEG choose tradeoff quality file size
Reducing number bit colour depth sufficiently crude really regard compression method low quality representation
Image compression method like JPEG GIF PNG designed take advantage pattern image get good reduction file size without losing quality necessary
For example following image show zoomed view pixel part detail around eye high quality image
Notice colour adjacent pixel often similar even part picture lot detail
For example pixel shown red box change gradually dark light
encoding would work situation
You could use variation specifies pixel colour say many following pixel colour although adjacent pixel nearly chance identical low would almost run identical colour
But way take advantage gradually changing colour
For pixel red box could generate approximate version colour specifying first last one getting computer calculate one assuming colour change gradually
Instead storing pixel value needed yet someone viewing probably might notice difference
This would ca reproduce original exactly would good enough lot purpose save lot space
The process guessing colour pixel two known example
A interpolation assumes value increase constant rate two given value example five pixel suppose first pixel blue colour value last one blue value linear interpolation would guess blue value one would save storing
In practice complex approach used guess pixel linear interpolation give idea going
The JPEG system widely used photo us sophisticated version idea
Instead taking run pixel work block pixel
And instead estimating value linear function us combination cosine wave
A cosine wave form trig function often used calculating side triangle
If plot cosine value degree get smooth curve going
Variations plot used approximate value pixel going one colour another
If add higher frequency cosine wave produce interesting shape
In theory pattern pixel created adding together different cosine wave
The following graph show value ranging degree
JPEGs based idea add together lot sine cosine wave create waveform want
Converting waveform block pixel sample music sum simple wave done using technique called widely used idea signal processing
You experiment adding sine wave together generate shape using
In spreadsheet yellow region first sheet allows choose sine wave add
Try setting sine wave frequency time fundamental frequency respectively fundamental lowest frequency
Now set amplitude equivalent volume level four respectively half previous one
This produce following four sine wave When four wave added together interfere produce shape sharper transition In fact continue pattern four sine wave shape would become square wave one suddenly go maximum value suddenly minimum
The one shown bumpy used sine wave describe
This exactly going JPEG compress black white image
The colour pixel go across image either black full intensity white JPEG approximate small number cosine wave basically property sine wave
This give overshoot see image JPEG image come bright dark patch surrounding sudden change colour like You experiment different combination sine wave get different shape
You may need four get good approximation shape want exactly tradeoff JPEG making
There suggestion parameter second sheet spreadsheet
Each block pixel JPEG image created adding together different amount pattern based cosine wave
The wave represented visually pattern white black pixel shown image
These particular wave known basis function block pixel created combining
The basis function top left average colour block
By adding increasing coefficient multiplied resultant block become darker
The basis function become complex towards bottom right therefore used le commonly
How often would image every pixel different color bottom right basis function
To investigate basis function combined form pattern block pixel try puzzle
Use interactive online So pixel block represented coefficient tell u much basis function use
But help u save space compress image
At moment still storing exactly amount data different way
The name JPEG short Joint Photographic Experts Group committee formed create standard digital photograph could captured displayed different brand device
Because file extension limited three character often seen extension
The cosine wave used JPEG image based Discrete Cosine Transform
The Discrete mean waveform digital opposite continuous value occur
In JPEG wave x value block coded value limited range number binary integer rather value
The advantage using DCT representation allows u separate low frequency change top left one high frequency change bottom right JPEG compression us advantage
The human eye usually notice high frequency change image often discarded without affecting visual quality image
The low frequency le varied basis function far important image
JPEG compression us process called quantisation set insignificant basis function coefficient zero
But decide insignificant
Quantisation requires quantisation table number
Each coefficient value divided corresponding value quantisation table rounded nearest integer
This mean many coefficient become zero multiplied back quantisation table remain zero
There optimal quantisation table every image many camera image processing company worked develop good quantisation table
As result many kept secret
Some company also developed software analyse image select appropriate quantisation table particular image
For example image text high frequency detail important quantisation table lower value bottom right detail kept
Of course also result image size remaining relatively large
Lossy compression compromise
The figure show image quantisation applied
Before Quantisation After Quantisation Notice image look similar even though second one many zero coefficient
The difference see barely visible image viewed original size
Try Use interactive online We still number even many zero save space storing zero
You notice zero bunched towards bottom right
This mean list coefficient starting top left corner end many zero row
Instead writing zero store fact zero using method encoding similar one discussed earlier chapter
And finally number left converted bit using Huffman coding common value take le space vice versa
All thing happen every time take photo save JPEG file happens every block pixel
When display image software need reverse process adding basis function together block hundereds thousand block image
An important issue arises JPEG represents image smoothly varying colour happens colour change suddenly
In case lot value need stored lot cosine wave added together make sudden change colour else edge image become fuzzy
You think cosine wave overshooting sudden change producing artifact like one following image edge messy
The original sharp edge zoomed view JPEG version show edge gradual darker pixel occur white space looking bit like shadow echo
For reason JPEG used photo natural image technique GIF PNG look another section work better artificial image like one
General purpose compression method need lossless ca assume user wo mind data changed
The widely used general purpose compression algorithm ZIP gzip rar based method called coding invented Jacob Ziv Abraham Lempel
We look text file example
The main idea coding sequence character often repeated file example sequence character image appears often chapter instead storing repeated occurrence replace reference last occurred
As long reference smaller phrase replaced save space
Typically system based approach used reduce text file little quarter original size almost good method known compressing text
The following interactive allows explore idea
The empty box replaced reference text occurring earlier
You click box see reference type referenced character decode text
What happens reference pointing another reference
As long decode first last information available need
View link online You also enter text clicking Text tab
You could paste text see many character replaced reference
The reference actually two number first say many character count back previous phrase start second say long referenced phrase
Each reference typically take space one two character system make saving long two character replaced
The option interactive allow require replaced length least two avoid replacing single character reference
Of course character count letter alphabet system also refer back white space word
In fact common sequence thing like full stop followed space
This approach also work well black white image since sequence like white pixel likely occurred
Here bit example earlier chapter paste interactive see many pointer needed represent
In fact essentially happens GIF PNG image pixel value compressed using algorithm work well lot consecutive pixel colour
But work poorly photograph pixel pattern unlikely repeated
The method described named compression Jacob Ziv Abraham Lempel two computer scientist invented
Unfortunately someone mixed order name wrote article called LZ compression instead ZL compression
So many people copied mistake Ziv Lempel method usually called LZ compression
One widely used method compressing music actually video compression standard called MPEG Moving Picture Experts Group
The name self explanatory mp stand moving picture version file used music
The full name standard come MPEG missing EG stand expert group consortium company researcher got together agree standard people could easily play video different brand equipment example could play DVD brand DVD player
The first version standard called three method storing sound track layer
One method layer became popular compressing music abbreviated
The standard used much video example DVDs TV mainly use remains important audio coding
The next MPEG version redundant became standard
offer higher quality video commonly used digital video file streaming medium disc broadcast TV
The AAC audio compression method used Apple among others also standard
On computer Part commonly used video often abbreviated
So stand layer stand part
Most audio compression method use similar approach method although offer better quality amount storage le storage quality
We wo go exactly work general idea break sound band different frequency represent band adding together value simple formula sum cosine wave precise
There also
Other audio compression system might come across include AAC ALAC Ogg Vorbis WMA
Each various advantage others compatible open others
The main question compressed audio small file made good quality human ear
There also question long take encode file might affect useful system
The tradeoff quality size audio file depend situation jogging listening music quality may matter much good reduce space available store
On hand someone listening recording home good sound system might mind large device store music long quality high
To evaluate audio compression choose variety recording high quality original typically CD using uncompressed WAV AIFF file
Choose different style music kind audio speech perhaps even create recording totally silent
Now convert recording different audio format
One system free download Apple iTunes used rip CDs variety format give choice setting quality size
A lot audio system able convert file plugins conversion
Compress recording using variety method making sure compressed file created high quality original
Make table showing long took process recording size compressed file evaluation quality sound compared original
Discuss tradeoff involved need much bigger file store good quality sound
Is limit small make file still sounding ok
Do method work better speech others
Does minute recording silence take space minute recording silence
Does minute recording music use space minute silence
The detail compression system work glossed chapter concerned file size speed method work
Most compression system variation idea covered although one fundamental method mentioned Huffman coding turn useful final stage method often one first topic mentioned textbook discussing compression brief
A closely related system Arithmetic coding
Also video compression omitted even though compressing video save space kind compression
Most video compression based MPEG standard Moving Pictures Experts Group
There information work
The method shown variation method
Many popular lossless compression method based although many variation one called LZW also used lot
Another compression method bzip based clever method called Transform
Questions like compression achieved addressed field
There
Based theory seems English text ca compressed le original size best
Images sound video get much better compression use lossy compression reproduce original data exactly

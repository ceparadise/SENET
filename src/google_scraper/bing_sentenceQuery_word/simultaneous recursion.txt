method solution problem depends solution smaller instance problem opposed
The approach applied many type problem one central idea computer science
The power recursion evidently lie possibility defining infinite set object finite statement
In manner infinite number computation described finite recursive program even program contains explicit repetition
Most computer programming language support recursion allowing call within program text
Some define looping construct rely solely recursion repeatedly call code
prof language computationally powerful Turing complete imperative language meaning solve kind problem imperative language even without iterative control structure
A common tactic divide problem type original solve combine result
This often referred combined store result solving avoid solving repeatedly incurring extra computation time referred
A recursive function definition one meaning input function produce result without recurring one meaning input program recurs call
For example function defined recursively equation
Neither equation constitutes complete definition first base case second recursive case
Because base case break chain recursion sometimes also called terminating case
The job recursive case seen breaking complex input simpler one
In properly designed recursive function recursive call input problem must simplified way eventually base case must reached
Functions intended terminate normal example exception
Neglecting write base case testing incorrectly cause
For function one computes obvious base case implied input data one may add number term added series example provide criterion establishes base case
Such example naturally treated successive term output partial sum converted recursion using indexing parameter say compute th term th partial sum
Many must process generate arbitrarily large quantity
Recursion one technique representing data whose exact size know programmer specify data definition
There two type definition inductive definition
An inductively defined recursive data definition one specifies construct instance data
For example defined inductively using syntax The code specifies list string either empty structure contains string list string
The definition permit construction list finite number string
Another example inductive positive Similarly recursive often used model structure programming language
Language designer often express grammar syntax grammar simple language arithmetic expression multiplication addition This say expression either number product two expression sum two expression
By recursively referring expression second third line grammar permit arbitrarily complex arithmetic expression one product sum operation single expression
A coinductive data definition one specifies operation may performed piece data typically coinductive definition used data structure infinite size
A coinductive definition infinite string given informally might look like This similar inductive definition list string difference definition specifies access content data via function content may whereas inductive definition specifies create structure may created
related coinduction used compute particular instance possibly infinite object
As programming technique used often context programming language preferable recursion desired size precision program output unknown
In case program requires definition infinitely large infinitely precise result mechanism taking finite portion result
The problem computing first n one solved corecursive program

Recursion contains single known recursion contains multiple known
Standard example single recursion include list traversal linear search computing factorial function standard example multiple recursion include search
Single recursion often much efficient multiple recursion generally replaced iterative computation running linear time requiring constant space
Multiple recursion contrast may require exponential time space fundamentally recursive able replaced iteration without explicit stack
Multiple recursion sometimes converted single recursion desired thence iteration
For example computing Fibonacci sequence naively multiple iteration value requires two previous value computed single recursion passing two successive value parameter
This naturally framed corecursion building initial value tracking step two successive value see
A sophisticated example using allows iterative tree traversal rather multiple recursion
Most basic example recursion example presented demonstrate function call
recursion occurs function called another function called either directly indirectly
For example call direct recursion call call indirect recursion Chains three function possible example function call function function call function function call function
Indirect recursion also called symmetric term though simply difference emphasis different notion
That call call turn call point view alone indirectly recursing point view alone indirectly recursing point view mutually recursing
Similarly set three function call called set mutually recursive function
Recursion usually done explicitly calling function name
However recursion also done via implicitly calling function based current context particularly useful known
Some author classify recursion either structural generative
The distinction related recursive procedure get data work process data Functions consume structured data typically decompose argument immediate structural component process component
If one immediate component belongs class data input function recursive
For reason refer function STRUCTURALLY RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
Thus defining characteristic structurally recursive function argument recursive call content field original input
Structural recursion includes nearly tree traversal including XML processing binary tree creation search etc
By considering algebraic structure natural number natural number either zero successor natural number function factorial may also regarded structural recursion
alternative Many recursive algorithm generate entirely new piece data given data recur
refers kind generative recursion
Examples generative recursion include
This distinction important function
A classic example recursive procedure function used calculate The function also written This evaluation recurrence relation demonstrates computation would performed evaluating pseudocode This factorial function also described without using recursion making use typical looping construct found imperative programming language The imperative code equivalent mathematical definition using accumulator variable The definition translates straightforwardly example iteration implemented recursively
The computes two integer written recursively
Function definition greatest common divisor express The recursive program equivalent iterative algorithm computation shown show step evaluation would performed language eliminates tail call
Below version algorithm using explicit iteration suitable language eliminate tail call
By maintaining state entirely variable using looping construct program avoids making recursive call growing call stack
The iterative algorithm requires temporary variable even given knowledge Euclidean algorithm difficult understand process simple inspection although two algorithm similar step
The Towers Hanoi mathematical puzzle whose solution illustrates recursion
There three peg hold stack disk different diameter
A larger disk may never stacked top smaller
Starting disk one peg must moved another peg one time
What smallest number step move stack
Example implementation Although recursive function explicit solution Tower Hanoi sequence reduced explicit formula
The algorithm method searching single element cutting array half recursive pas
The trick pick midpoint near center array compare data point data searched responding one three possible condition data found midpoint data midpoint greater data searched data midpoint le data searched
Recursion used algorithm pas new array created cutting old one half
The binary search procedure called recursively time new smaller array
Typically array size adjusted manipulating beginning ending index
The algorithm exhibit logarithmic order growth essentially divide problem domain half pas
Example implementation binary search C An important application recursion computer science defining dynamic data structure
Recursive data structure dynamically grow theoretically infinite size response runtime requirement contrast size static array must set compile time
Recursive algorithm particularly appropriate underlying problem data treated defined recursive term
The example section illustrate known structural recursion
This term refers fact recursive procedure acting data defined recursively
As long programmer derives template data definition function employ structural recursion
That recursion function body consume immediate piece given compound value
Below C definition linked list node structure
Notice especially node defined term
The next element pointer another effectively creating list type
Because data structure defined recursively procedure operate implemented naturally recursive procedure
The procedure defined walk list list empty list pointer value NULL
For node print data element integer
In C implementation list remains unchanged procedure
Below simple definition binary tree node
Like node linked list defined term recursively
There two pointer left pointing left right pointing right
Operations tree implemented using recursion
Note two pointer left right tree operation may require two recursive call At two recursive call made given call defined
The example illustrates binary tree
A special case binary tree data element node order
Since number file may vary practical way traverse thus enumerate content
Traversing filesystem similar therefore concept behind tree traversal applicable traversing filesystem
More specifically code would example filesystem
This code blend line least somewhat recursion
It essentially recursive implementation best way traverse
It also example direct indirect recursion
The method rtraverse purely direct example method traverse indirect call rtraverse
This example need base case scenario due fact always fixed number file directory given filesystem
In actual implementation rather pure recursive function single check base case otherwise recursive step number modification may made purpose clarity efficiency
These include On basis elegance wrapper function generally approved base case frowned upon particularly academia
Hybrid algorithm often used efficiency reduce overhead recursion small case recursion special case
A function directly called recurse instead calling separate auxiliary function actually recursion
Wrapper function used validate parameter recursive function skip perform initialization allocate memory initialize variable particularly auxiliary variable level recursion partial computation handle exception error
In language support auxiliary function nested inside wrapper function use shared scope
In absence nested function auxiliary function instead separate function possible private called directly information shared wrapper function using
base case also known consists checking base case making recursive call checking next call base case instead calling checking base case
particularly done efficiency reason avoid overhead function call immediately return
Note since base case already checked immediately recursive step need checked separately one need use wrapper function case overall recursion start base case
For example factorial function properly base case
immediately returning
may miss mitigated wrapper function
primarily concern many base case encountered Null pointer tree linear number function call hence significant saving algorithm illustrated search
tree corresponds considering leaf node child base case rather considering empty node base case
If single base case computing factorial provides saving
Conceptually considered either base case recursive step checking base case recursion considered different base case one step removed standard base case complex recursive step namely check valid recurse considering leaf node rather Null node base case tree
Because complicated flow compared clear separation base case recursive step standard recursion often considered poor style particularly academia
A basic example given DFS binary tree see section standard recursive discussion
The standard recursive algorithm DFS In instead In term standard step move base case check recursive step
Alternatively considered different form base case recursive step respectively
Note requires wrapper function handle case tree empty root node Null
In case height node Null pointer child leaf cut number function call half worst case
In C standard recursive algorithm may implemented The algorithm may implemented Note use Boolean AND operator recursive call made node valid
Note first term AND pointer node second term bool overall expression evaluates bool
This common idiom recursive
This addition evaluation Boolean OR operator check right child left child fails
In fact entire function replaced single Boolean expression return statement legibility suffers benefit efficiency
Recursive algorithm often inefficient small data due overhead repeated function call return
For reason efficient implementation recursive algorithm often start recursive algorithm switch different algorithm input becomes small
An important example often implemented switching data sufficiently small
Hybrid recursive algorithm often refined derived hybrid merge sort
Recursion iteration equally expressive recursion replaced iteration explicit stack iteration replaced tail recursion
Which approach preferable depends problem consideration language used
In iteration preferred particularly simple recursion avoids overhead function call call stack management recursion generally used multiple recursion
By contrast recursion preferred tail recursion optimization leading little overhead sometimes explicit iteration available
Compare template compute x defined x f n x x For imperative language overhead define function functional language overhead define accumulator variable x
For example factorial function may implemented iteratively C assigning loop index variable accumulator variable rather passing argument returning value recursion Most use today allow direct specification recursive function procedure
When function called program keep track various instance function often using although method may used
Every recursive function transformed iterative function replacing recursive call simulating call stack explicitly managed program
Conversely iterative function procedure evaluated computer see expressed term recursive function iterative control construct routinely rewritten recursive form
However practice rewriting depends feature language
notable mainstream language function call including may cause stack allocation would occur use looping construct language working iterative program rewritten recursive form may although tail call elimination may feature covered language specification different implementation language may differ tail call elimination capability
In language favor iterative looping construct usually significant time space cost associated recursive program due overhead required manage stack relative slowness function call function call particularly typically fast operation difference usually le noticeable
As concrete example difference performance recursive iterative implementation factorial example depends highly compiler used
In language looping construct preferred iterative version may much several order magnitude faster recursive one
In functional language overall time difference two implementation may negligible fact cost multiplying larger number first rather smaller number iterative version given happens may overwhelm time saved choosing iteration
In programming language maximum size much le space available recursive algorithm tend require stack space iterative algorithm
Consequently language sometimes place limit depth recursion avoid stack overflow one language
Note caveat regarding special case
Multiply recursive problem inherently recursive prior state need track
One example contrast list traversal linear search list singly recursive thus naturally iterative
Other example include function
All algorithm implemented iteratively help explicit programmer effort involved managing stack complexity resulting program arguably outweigh advantage iterative solution
function function recursive call hence build deferred operation
For example gcd function shown
In contrast factorial function also recursive call tail position build deferred multiplication operation must performed final recursive call completes
With treat call rather function call function gcd execute using constant space
Thus program essentially iterative equivalent using imperative language control structure like loop
The significance tail recursion making call tail call caller return position need saved recursive call return branch directly previously saved return position
Therefore language recognize property tail call tail recursion save space time
In simple case function calling instruction placed recursive call executed per recursion instruction placed recursive call
The latter executed repeatedly maximum recursion reached
Consider example The recursive algorithm expressed
They usually simplified single term
If function form Then thus represents number recursive call level recursion represents factor smaller input next level recursion
number piece divide problem represents work function independent recursion
partitioning recombining level recursion

I idea even start proving following theorem If N N N N primitive recursive also N N defined x x x n n x n x x Any much appreciated
Define function p n x n x n x recursion n using primitive recursive pairing function
At use x x successor combine two recursion one equation new function
One get access n x n x projecting pair
The point define single new function p n x n x n x recursion combination two function combined using common pairing function r
The new combined function defined recursion since know next value pair p x x x consulting n x previous value p n x n x n x
So new combined function p primitive recursive
It follows decoding pair function primitive recursive separately

There number good explanation thread answer use language
In majority major imperative language implementation
every major implementation C Basic Python Ruby Java C vastly preferable recursion
To see walk step language use call function Doing step take time usually little bit take iterate loop
However real problem step
When many program start allocate single chunk memory stack run memory often always due recursion program crash due
So language recursion slower make vulnerable crashing
There still argument using though
In general code written recursively shorter bit elegant know read
There technique language implementers use called eliminate class stack overflow
Put succinctly function return expression simply result function call need add new level onto stack reuse current one function called
Regrettably imperative optimization built

Simple english example recursion
In basic computer science sense recursion function call
Say linked list structure And want find long linked list recursion This could course done loop well useful illustration concept Whenever function call creating loop recursion
As anything good us bad us recursion
The simple example tail recursion last line function call However lame almost pointless example easily replaced efficient iteration
After recursion suffers function call overhead example could substantial compared operation inside function
So whole reason recursion rather iteration take advantage clever stuff
For example call function multiple time different parameter inside loop way accomplish
A classic example
You draw one simply recursion call stack branch direction If attempt thing iteration I think find take lot code accomplish
Other common use case might include traversing hierarchy
website crawler directory comparison etc
In practical term recursion make sense whenever need iterative branching
Recursion method solving problem based divide conquer mentality
The basic idea take original problem divide smaller easily solved instance solve smaller instance usually using algorithm reassemble final solution
The canonical example routine generate Factorial The Factorial n calculated multiplying number An iterative solution C look like There nothing surprising iterative solution make sense anyone familiar C
The recursive solution found recognising nth Factorial n Fact
Or put another way know particular Factorial number calculate next one
Here recursive solution C The first part function known sometimes Guard Clause prevents algorithm running forever
It return value whenever function called value le
The second part interesting known
Here call method slightly modified parameter decrement multiply result copy When first encountered kind confusing instructive examine work run
Imagine call FactRec
We enter routine picked base case end like If method parameter stopped guard clause end If substitute return value return value get This give clue final solution arrived fast track show step way That final substitution happens base case triggered
At point simple algrebraic formula solve equates directly definition Factorials first place
It instructive note every call method result either base case triggered call method parameter closer base case often called recursive call
If case method run forever
Recursion solving problem function call
A good example factorial function
Factorial math problem factorial example
This function solves C positive integer tested may bug
The canonical example factorial look like In general recursion necessarily fast function call overhead tends high recursive function tend small see suffer problem stack overflow anyone
Some say tend hard get case I really buy
In situation recursion make sense elegant clear way write particular function
It noted language favor recursive solution optimize much LISP come mind
Recursion refers method solves problem solving smaller version problem using result plus computation formulate answer original problem
Often time process solving smaller version method solve yet smaller version problem reach base case trivial solve
For instance calculate factorial number one represent
Thus method recurses find factorial multiplies whatever got give final answer
Of course find factorial first calculate factorial
The base case would case know return since
Consider In mathematics gcd two integer largest positive integer divide number without remainder

A recursive function one call
The common reason I found use traversing tree structure

If ever traverse search something like tree nested identical structure got problem might good candidate recursion
People avoid recursion number reason Most people included cut programming teeth procedural programming opposed functional programming
To people iterative approach typically using loop feel natural
Those u cut programming teeth procedural programming often told avoid recursion error prone
We often told recursion slow
Calling returning routine repeatedly involves lot stack pushing popping slower looping
I think language handle better others language likely dominant paradigm procedural
For least couple programming language I used I remember hearing recommendation use recursion get beyond certain depth stack deep
Recursion expression directly indirectly referencing
Consider recursive acronym simple example Here simple example many element set

For example take factorial But easy see factorial also So generally Of course tricky thing recursion want define thing term already done need place start
In example make special case defining factorial
Now see bottom Since defined factorial reach bottom
Generally speaking recursive procedure two part The recursive part defines procedure term new input combined already done via procedure

A base part make sure process repeat forever giving place start
It bit confusing get head around first look bunch example come together
If want much deeper understanding concept study mathematical induction
Also aware language optimize recursive call others
It pretty easy make insanely slow recursive function careful also technique make performant case

EDIT This dig Dav answer I seen reply I posted
A method recursive call either directly indirectly
When use recursion
People use recursion complex write iterative code
For example tree traversal technique like preorder postorder made iterative recursive
But usually use recursive simplicity
To recurse solved problem nothing done
To recurse open problem next step recurse rest

occurs thing defined term type
Recursion used variety discipline ranging
The common application recursion defined applied within definition
While apparently defines infinite number instance function value often done way loop infinite chain reference occur
In class object method exhibit recursive behavior defined two property For example following recursive definition person ancestor The classic example recursion Many mathematical axiom based upon recursive rule
For example formal definition described By base case recursive rule one generate set natural number
Recursively defined mathematical object include especially
There various definition recursion see
Recursion process procedure go one step procedure involves invoking procedure
A procedure go recursion said
To understand recursion one must recognize distinction procedure running procedure
A procedure set step based set rule
The running procedure involves actually following rule performing step
An analogy procedure like written recipe running procedure like actually preparing meal
Recursion related reference within specification procedure execution procedure
For instance recipe might refer cooking vegetable another procedure turn requires heating water forth
However recursive procedure least one step call new instance procedure like recipe calling dough left last time recipe made
This course immediately creates possibility endless loop recursion properly used definition step question skipped certain case procedure complete like sourdough recipe also tell get starter dough case never made
Even properly defined recursive procedure easy human perform requires distinguishing new old partially executed invocation procedure requires administration far various simultaneous instance procedure progressed
For reason recursive definition rare everyday situation
An example could following procedure find way
Proceed forward reaching either exit branching point dead end considered branching point branch
If point reached exit terminate
Otherwise try branch turn using procedure recursively every trial fails reaching dead end return path led branching point report failure
Whether actually defines terminating procedure depends nature maze must allow loop
In case executing procedure requires carefully recording currently explored branching point branch already exhaustively tried
Linguist among many others argued lack upper bound number grammatical sentence language lack upper bound grammatical sentence length beyond practical constraint time available utter one explained consequence recursion natural language
This understood term recursive definition syntactic category sentence
A sentence structure follows verb another sentence sentence occurs larger one
So sentence defined recursively roughly something structure includes noun phrase verb optionally another sentence
This really special case mathematical definition recursion
This provides way understanding creativity unbounded number grammatical immediately predicts sentence arbitrary length
Of course many structure apart sentence defined recursively therefore many way sentence embed instance one category inside another
Over year language general proved amenable kind analysis
Recently however generally accepted idea recursion essential property human language challenged basis claim

Recursion play crucial role syntax also natural language semantics

It also apply intransitive verb transitive verb ditransitive verb
In order provide single denotation suitably flexible typically defined take different type meaning argument

The idea recursion common real world
So seems bit confusing novice programmer
Though I guess become used concept gradually
So nice explanation grasp idea easily
To explain I use combination different explanation usually try For starter defines simple term An expression term generated repeating particular mathematical operation
If student person explain I say student least mathematical background obviously already encountered recursion studying series notion
A good way start demonstrate series tell quite simply recursion Usually either get huh huh whatev best still use likely deep snore
For rest actually detailed version I presented bad pun
At stage student usually know print something screen
Assuming using C know print single char using
They also know control loop
I usually resort repetitive simple programming problem get Factorial simple math concept understand implementation close mathematical representation
However might get first
The alphabet version interesting teach think ordering recursive statement
Like pointer throw line randomly
The point bring realization loop inverted either modifying condition inverting order statement function
That printing alphabet help something visual
Simply write function print one character call call recursively write next previous one
The exponentiation problem slightly difficult learning
Obviously concept exactly factorial added complexity except multiple parameter
And usually enough confuse people throw beginning
Its simple form expressed like recurrence Once simple problem shown AND tutorial give slightly difficult classic exercise Some reading never hurt
Well first feel even lost
It sort thing grows sits back head one day realize finally get
And think back stuff read
The page Wikipedia would
Assuming student much coding experience provide code stub
After first attempt give printing function display recursion level
Printing numerical value level help
Indenting printed result level output help well give another visual representation program opening closing stack context like drawer folder file system explorer
If student already bit versed computer culture might already use name using
It tradition going around time especially GNU project
Some example include Recursive Mutually Recursive Have try come
Similarly many occurrence recursive humor like correction

Some issue people usually struggle need know answer
Why would
A good reason often simpler express problem way
A obvious reason often take le typing make feel soooo using recursion though
Some problem definitely easier solve using recursive approach
Typically problem solve using paradigm fit recursion algorithm
Why whatever variable name different every time
Beginners usually problem understanding variable parameter thing named program different value
So value control loop recursion even worse
Be nice use variable name everywhere make clear
How I determine end condition
That easy say step loud
For instance factorial start
Do talk early abut thing like
I know I know TCO nice care first

From Steven Pinker The Language Instinct either girl eats ice cream girl eats candy boy eats hot dog That whole sentence contains whole sentence girl eats ice cream girl eats candy boy eats hot dog The act understanding full sentence involves understanding smaller sentence use set mental trickery understood full sentence
To understand recursion programming perspective easiest look problem solved recursion understand mean need
For example I use greatest common divisor function gcd short
You two number
To find gcd assuming neither need check evenly divisible
If gcd otherwise need check gcd remainder
You already able see recursive function gcd function calling gcd function
Just hammer home c assuming never get passed parameter In programme important stopping condition otherwise function recur forever eventually cause stack overflow
The reason use recursion rather loop iterative construct read code tell happen next easier figure working correctly
Here real world example recursion
Let imagine comic collection going mix big pile
Careful really collection may instantly kill mention idea
Now let sort big unsorted pile comic help manual The nice thing When single issue full stack frame local pile visible ground
Give multiple printout manual put one aside pile level mark currently level ie
state local variable continue Done
That recursion basically Performing process finer detail level go
Recursion concise way express something repeated something reached
Not plain english really real life example two way learning recursion playing A nice explanaition recursion literally action reoccurs within
Consider painter painting wall recursive action paint strip ceiling floor scoot little right paint strip ceiling floor scoot little right paint strip ceiling floor scoot little right etc
His paint function call make bigger function
Hopefully poor painter kind stop condition Thank interest question

occurs thing defined term type
Recursion used variety discipline ranging linguistics logic
The common application recursion mathematics computer science function defined applied within definition
While apparently defines infinite number instance function value often done way loop infinite chain reference occur
In mathematics computer science class object method exhibit recursive behavior defined two property A simple case terminating scenario use recursion produce answer A set rule reduce case toward base case For example following recursive definition person ancestor parent one ancestor
ancestor one ancestor also one ancestor
The Fibonacci sequence classic example recursion Many mathematical axiom based upon recursive rule
For example formal definition natural number Peano axiom described By base case recursive rule one generate set natural number
Recursively defined mathematical object include function set especially fractal
There various definition recursion see recursive humor
Recursion process procedure go one step procedure involves invoking procedure
A procedure go recursion said
To understand recursion one must recognize distinction procedure running procedure
A procedure set step based set rule
The running procedure involves actually following rule performing step
An analogy procedure like written recipe running procedure like actually preparing meal
Recursion related reference within specification procedure execution procedure
For instance recipe might refer cooking vegetable another procedure turn requires heating water forth
However recursive procedure least one step call new instance procedure like sourdough recipe calling dough left last time recipe made
This course immediately creates possibility endless loop recursion properly used definition step question skipped certain case procedure complete like sourdough recipe also tell get starter dough case never made
Even properly defined recursive procedure easy human perform requires distinguishing new old partially executed invocation procedure requires administration far various simultaneous instance procedure progressed
For reason recursive definition rare everyday situation
An example could following procedure find way maze
Proceed forward reaching either exit branching point dead end considered branching point branch
If point reached exit terminate
Otherwise try branch turn using procedure recursively every trial fails reaching dead end return path led branching point report failure
Whether actually defines terminating procedure depends nature maze must allow loop
In case executing procedure requires carefully recording currently explored branching point branch already exhaustively tried
Linguist Noam Chomsky among many others argued lack upper bound number grammatical sentence language lack upper bound grammatical sentence length beyond practical constraint time available utter one explained consequence recursion natural language
This understood term recursive definition syntactic category sentence
A sentence structure follows verb another sentence sentence occurs larger one
So sentence defined recursively roughly something structure includes noun phrase verb optionally another sentence
This really special case mathematical definition recursion
This provides way understanding creativity unbounded number grammatical immediately predicts sentence arbitrary length
Of course many structure apart sentence defined recursively therefore many way sentence embed instance one category inside another
Over year language general proved amenable kind analysis
Recently however generally accepted idea recursion essential property human language challenged Daniel Everett basis claim Pirahã language
Andrew Nevins David Pesetsky Cilene Rodrigues among many argued
Literary case argued different kind mathematical logical recursion
Recursion play crucial role syntax also natural language semantics
The word example construed function apply sentence meaning create new sentence likewise noun phrase meaning verb phrase meaning others
It also apply intransitive verb transitive verb ditransitive verb
In order provide single denotation suitably flexible typically defined take different type meaning argument
This done defining simple case combine sentence defining case recursively term simple one
Recursion sometimes used humorously computer science programming philosophy mathematics textbook generally giving circular definition putative recursive step get closer base case instead lead infinite regress
It unusual book include joke entry glossary along line Recursion
A variation found page index edition Brian Kernighan Dennis Ritchie book index entry recursively reference recursion
The earliest version joke Software Tools Kernighan Plauger also appears The UNIX Programming Environment Kernighan Pike
It appear first edition
Another joke To understand recursion must understand recursion
Recursion used painting since Giotto made
Its central panel contains kneeling figure Cardinal Stefaneschi holding triptych offering
Escher print depicts distorted city contains gallery recursively contains picture
recursion In set theory theorem guaranteeing recursively defined function exist
Given set element function theorem state unique function denotes set natural number including zero natural number
Take two function element
It proved mathematical induction natural number equality hold
Suppose
Then F k G k implies F G
By induction

What recursion
Sometimes problem difficult complex solve big
If problem broken smaller version may able find way solve one smaller version able build solution entire problem
This idea behind recursion recursive algorithm break problem smaller piece either already know answer solve applying algorithm piece combining result
Stated concisely recursive definition defined term
Recursion computer programming technique involving use procedure subroutine function algorithm call step termination condition successive repetition processed critical step condition met time rest repetition processed last one called first
Do worry detail definition

A recursive function function call execution
This enables function repeat several time outputting result end iteration
Below example recursive function
The function Count us count number number
For example Count would return
Count would return
The result could used roundabout way subtract number
Recursive function common computer science allow programmer write efficient program using minimal amount code
The downside cause infinite loop unexpected result written properly
For example example function terminated number le greater
If proper case included function stop execution recursion repeat forever causing program crash worse yet hang entire computer system

Hai want replay discussion board Discuss five risk encountered everyday life
How ass risk
How treat risk
Risks encountered everyday
While part lliving healthy lifestyle come inherent risk

Different type weather obviously different risk associated
If hurricane wind blowing MPH going go outside
If going protect
Just might blizzard well freezing outside cant see foot front face
How going manage risk going
around Conducting even routine maintenance around home come associated risk
There number hazard involved depending task preformed

Probably one biggest risk encountered everyday taking risk
We know life pretty much risk matter unless want sit house day nothing
Pretty boring huh
So manage risk
First correctly identify risk reduce risk
Next try determine taking risk would worth would better taking different direction
The last thing manage risk plan
While risk necessary evil life risk control minimize acceptable level risk beyond control done protect best ability avoid together

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I reading Google DeepMind Atari I trying understand concept Experience replay come lot reinforcement learning paper particularly AlphaGo paper I want understand work
Below excerpt
First used biologically inspired mechanism termed experience replay randomizes data thereby removing correlation observation sequence smoothing change data distribution
The paper elaborates follows I taken screenshot since lot mathematical symbol difficult reproduce What experience replay benefit layman term
The key part quoted text To perform experience replay store agent experience This mean instead running pair occur simulation actual experience system store data discovered state action reward typically large table
Note store associated value raw data feed calculation later
The learning phase logically separate gaining experience based taking random sample table
You still want interleave two process acting learning improving policy lead different behaviour explore action closer optimal one want learn
However split like
take one step learn three random prior step etc
The target using experience replay use target online version new formula
The loss formula given also one would use DQN without experience replay
The difference r feed
In DQN DeepMind team also maintained two network switched one learning one feeding current estimate bootstrap
This helped stability algorithm using function approximator
That bar stand denotes alternate version weight
Advantages experience replay More efficient use previous experience learning multiple time
This key gaining experience costly get full use
The update incremental converge quickly multiple pass data beneficial especially low variance immediate outcome reward next state given state action pair
Better convergence behaviour training function approximator
Partly data like data assumed supervised learning convergence proof
Disadvantage experience replay The approach used DQN briefly around worth seeing section
I recommend watching whole series graduate level course reinforcement learning time

This activity begin short review Graph Paper Programming quickly move race clock student break team work together create program one instruction time
Debugging Students This great time review last lesson went class
You one large group student discus elbow partner
Here question ask review What last time
What wish chance
Did think question lesson want ask
What favorite part last lesson
Finishing review asking student favorite thing help leave positive impression previous exercise increasing excitement activity introduce
This lesson one new important word Say Finding fixing problem algorithm program Recall Graph Paper Programming guided teammate Automatic Realization Machine ARM using arrow
Take moment refresher Graph Paper Programming image either one already covered entirely new one
We going kind thing today instead controlling going work together create program one symbol time
The practice lesson easy enough let add action
We going type thing create program describing image going relay team one symbol time
The rule game simple Play several time image increasing difficulty
Here clarification need shared time time You choose class student discus elbow partner share
Which one definition learn word today
To rub scrape letter character Doing something repeatedly similar way Finding fixing problem algorithm program word learned
Which thing could debug
wrong answer math problem tunafish sandwich basket pine cone Explain chose answer
Use activity enhance student learning
They used outside class activity enrichment

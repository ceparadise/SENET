Another option senior project undertake individual research faculty member auspex
writing intensive version involves several writing assignment fulfills WIM requirement
Doing research based senior project provide additional valuable experience student interested research career
Taking requires finding faculty member oversee project
See information
Students taking must also fill senior project proposal form get approvoal advisor Patrick Young
Another option fulfill senior project requirement senior honor thesis
Writing honor thesis includes research project supervised CS faculty member
Applications honor program due May
For information see
A final option senior project directed research class
If like take part active research specific project mind would like guidance might
The class typically focused single large project professor interest
People choose assigned part larger project work quarter
For example past student contributed DARPA Grand Challenge robot
The topic change year though frequently led AI professor
Professors may expect student comfortable technique used field
For example AI might expect taken
Like student opt version fulfills WIM requirement
Almost everyone fulfills WIM requirement senior project
If took TIS requirement need fulfill WIM senior project
WIM requirement fulfilled class also fulfills another requirement

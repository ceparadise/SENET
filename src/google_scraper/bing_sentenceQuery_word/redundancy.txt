In duplication critical function system intention increasing reliability usually form backup improve actual system performance case receiver computer processing
In many system part control system may triplicated formally termed TMR
An error one component may two
In triply redundant system system three sub component three must fail system fails
Since one rarely fails sub component expected fail independently probability three failing calculated extraordinarily small often outweighed risk factor human error
Redundancy may also known term majority voting system voting logic
Redundancy sometimes produce le instead greater reliability creates complex system prone various issue may lead human neglect duty may lead higher production demand overstressing system may make le safe
In computer science four major form redundancy A modified form software redundancy applied hardware may usually designed redundant part well ensuring one part fails entire structure collapse
A structure without redundancy called meaning single broken component cause collapse entire structure
Bridges failed due lack redundancy include
Parallel combined system demonstrate different level redundancy
The model subject study reliability safety engineering
The two function redundancy passive redundancy
Both function prevent performance decline exceeding specification limit without human intervention using extra capacity
Passive redundancy us excess capacity reduce impact component failure
One common form passive redundancy extra strength cabling strut used bridge
This extra strength allows structural component fail without bridge collapse
The extra strength used design called margin safety
Eyes ear provide working example passive redundancy
Vision loss one eye cause blindness depth perception impaired
Hearing loss one ear cause deafness directionality impaired
Performance decline commonly associated passive redundancy limited number failure occur
Active redundancy eliminates performance decline monitoring performance individual device monitoring used voting logic
The voting logic linked switching automatically reconfigures component
Error detection correction Global Positioning System GPS two example active redundancy
Electrical power distribution provides example active redundancy
Several power line connect generation facility customer
Each power line includes monitor detect overload
Each power line also includes circuit breaker
The combination power line provides excess capacity
Circuit breaker disconnect power line monitor detect overload
Power redistributed across remaining line
author said sometimes redundancy backfire produce le reliability
This may happen three way First redundant safety device result complex system prone error accident
Second redundancy may lead shirking responsibility among worker
Third redundancy may lead increased production pressure resulting system operates higher speed le safely
Voting logic us performance monitoring determine reconfigure individual component operation continues without violating specification limitation overall system
Voting logic often involves computer system composed item computer may reconfigured using voting logic
Circuit breaker example form voting logic
Electrical power system use reconfigure active redundancy
Computing system adjust production output generating facility generating facility suddenly lost
This prevents blackout condition major event earthquake
The simplest voting logic computing system involves two component primary alternate
They run similar software output alternate remains inactive normal operation
The primary monitor periodically sends activity message alternate long everything All output primary stop including activity message primary detects fault
The alternate activates output take primary brief delay activity message cease
Errors voting logic cause output active inactive time cause output flutter
A reliable form voting logic involves odd number three device
All perform identical function output compared voting logic
The voting logic establishes majority disagreement majority act deactivate output device disagree
A single fault interrupt normal operation
This technique used system responsible operation
Each duplicate component added system decrease probability system failure according formula This formula assumes independence failure event
That mean probability component B failing given component A already failed B failing A failed
There situation unreasonable using two power supply connected socket way one power supply failed would
It also assumes one component needed keep system running

Data Redundancy Definition A problem occuring business computerising operation
Data duplicated different place data became redundant company developed database system efficient
Search Data Redundancy UK US Search Data Redundancy rest Computing Students

The general definition redundancy exceeding normal
However computing term used specifically refers duplicate device used purpose
The goal redundancy prevent recover failure specific system
There many type redundant device
The common personal computing backup
While computer component easily replaced fails may possible recover personal data
Therefore important regularly back data secondary hard drive
In enterprise situation configuration used mirror data across two drive
Another type redundant device secondary
High traffic critical system may multiple power supply take case primary one fails
While uninterruptible power supply technically redundant device battery within surge protector provides power redundancy minute electricity lost
Computer network often implement redundancy well
From Internet connection common redundant data path
This mean one system go connection system broken
For example network duplicate data ring used automatically primary data path interrupted
Network redundancy accomplished either adding extra physical connection using networking software automatically reroutes data needed

The cyclic redundancy check CRC technique used detect error digital data
CRC hash function detects accidental change raw computer data commonly used digital telecommunication network storage device hard disk drive
This technique invented Wesley Peterson developed CCITT Comit√© Consultatif International Telegraphique et Telephonique
Cyclic redundancy check quite simple implement hardware easily analyzed mathematically
It one better technique detecting common transmission error
It based binary division also called polynomial code checksum
In cyclic redundancy check fixed number check bit often called checksum appended message need transmitted
The data receiver receive data inspect check bit error
Mathematically data receiver check check value attached finding remainder polynomial division content transmitted
If seems error occurred negative acknowledgement transmitted asking data retransmission
A cyclic redundancy check also applied storage device like hard disk
In case check bit allocated block hard disk
When corrupt incomplete file read computer cyclic redundancy error reported
This could another storage device
The common reason error include system crash incomplete corrupt file file lot bug
CRC polynomial design depend length block protected error protection feature resource CRC implementation performance

My Computing teacher talk data duplication data redundancy term database different thing I struggling differentiate
The context database normalisation particular third normal form important eliminates data duplication redundancy
But far I see term relate data appearing database
Yes I asked teacher I understand explanation group revision session I want hold
When create table database may want create duplication Here would duplicate name user table
That way display list friend access user table read name
This simple example show call data duplication
Duplication mean YOU responsible also updating name parameter friend table change name user table
If consistently data becomes inconsistent user start seeing strange thing happening
In case redundancy two copy piece data
The database though
This useful safety
For example place database two separate computer
If one computer go data available computer
Redundancy definitively copy access either version data exactly
The RDBM may choose one based different parameter fast whether computer network connection
The RDBM manages copy consistent way problem I mentioned user name
If RDBM asked update user name update version copy
The good thing time INSERT UPDATE delay update copy computer
So implementers database exactly opposite told make duplicate data
probably main source confusion realm
You may want read fun thing respect
Cassandra type database used Google update data ring computer possibly heavy redundancy
Since asked I also let know RDBMs make use call Indexes And Indexes duplicate data
To continue user example name user could used index
The Index would look like example When UPDATE user table RDBM need also update index move name new position maintaining consistency SQL warrant data always consistent So renaming Alexis Tristan would give new index And see duplication actually necessary
And see handle properly without ever losing existing data understand duplication difficult deal
By posting answer agree

Computer system need reliable
Backing testing redundancy disaster recovery plan help improve system reliability
Redundancy mean available support main system
It reserve system step primary system fails
The reserve resource redundant time used everything working properly
Redundancy important critical system like aeroplane
If hardware software fails flight plane redundant system step
The three main type redundancy Computer system make use extra hardware used something go wrong
For example instead one power supply one network card system two
Some organisation use two identical hardware allowing switch two system reducing disruption normal operation
This called
Redundant array independent disk RAID automatically make extra copy new changed data using several hard disk
If one disk go wrong data still safely exist least one disk
If program regulating cabin temperature aircraft fails backup program take run successfully A system use redundant software case main program fails
If one program go wrong system carry operating normally using program
data called

In book Exercise show piece code compute value polynomial The exercise assumes clock cycle needed addition multiplication respectively
The reader asked explain According exercise answer iteration need update variable operation need addition multiplication latter dominates latency causing ultimate CPE
But I think data flow something like So longest path previous value new value going execution unit
Therefore longest time cycle
I want ask Any explanation CPU architecture execution unit pipeline unit appreciated
I know I bit late party book absolutely right
As verify timing code CPE indeed second answer wrong
But first one also wrong
It say MULs must performed time possible Nehalem architecture I suspect modern processor
Remember one FP MUL unit different FP ADD unit shown book ed
later What happens instead LOADs assumed always present cycle cache First feed MUL
Immediately feed remember pipeline
cycle get new value cycle result
At point new computation stage MUL
So cycle rest ops want restricted
Of course easy need cycle FP ADD get new
So becomes obvious limiting factor computation
Which mean looking critical path whatever look specifically path old value new
In case path consists one FP ADD
threw first The critical path indeed cycle question asks CPE like time output one cycle loop
Other first last cycle processor addition previous iteration loop current multiplication time operand dependent
The first iteration loop take full cycle iteration loop take cycle run making actual CPE cycle

I agree book way presenting critical path confusing
Their definition critical path simply path take longest path path also operation operand depends previous operation order
This definition make finding critical path rather intuitive
The critical path longest path graph case eight clock
This say critical path Prioritized Topological Orders Without resource constraint shortest schedule given critical path longest path graph
A metric useful priority function height node length longest path graph originating node
I think found error book
You consider contacting author correct future printing
The critical path longest one data flow graph according book must straight line effect single register rather add whose result intermediate operand next operation
About question get done continuing read rest
Especially comparing data flow graph one helpful
If understood clear answer book reasonable

Follow update I also took lot physic math doubt help degree philosophy I feel study various logical abstraction helped widen perspective
Not mention trained diagram set also quite useful
My diagram consistent grammer I sure I trained create legend map directly real concept
arrow mean something used truly identical relationship
Of course arrow might mean different thing different diagram within given diagram consistency
I sure Philosophy program rigerous logic one thing thing philosopher agreement
Except undergraduate philosophy little problem solving
From I seen analyzing argument finding solution
Logical dissection useful skill especially testing debugging
The problem wit From Philosophy lot logical people would assume first glance
You presupposing teleological explanation preview button
I look existential perspective preview button simply u find meaning
I could read post massive wall text hurt eye I guessing mention English class taking
Holy shit
You went entire little diatribe without using single p
That kind record Longest post somebody stupid break post paragraph
For fuck sake man
If want people read write learn use paragraph
I currently undergraduate Muhlenberg College notably unhappy program
What appeared friendly small liberal art college I applied year half ago far rather disappointing
As matter background I note w But lot interesting hang
I think basic study philosophy would probably widen people perspective life generally worthwhile experience
Also study different type logic numerical system useful professionally could considered branch philosophy though probably commonly found mathematics curriculum experience anyway
However interesting may right I never found Hegelian dialectic basic epistemology really helped build distributed data model network traffic prediction algorithm
On hand I working say AI research I see working knowledge epistemology might useful YMMV
I sure I agree say right economics useful thing study
I majored CS got minor econ math I use econ stuff much CS stuff
I know minoring entirely worthwhile going intermediate microeconomics intermediate macroeconomics possibly smartest thing I college
Some philosophy teacher surely turn course
I imagine GT EVERYTHING subjugated engineering need could one first already
You could make one required elective
Of course real philosophy person rain parade telling u already class offering different name change name pandering
Now hell people
Abandon hope ye enter Please God make stop
We also one zero know make perform calculation u
Calculating seems start true intelligence making connection thinking Aha
I figured
Look intelligent I
It necessarily follow complex calculator going Take look kind discourse design pattern pattern language
Pure philosophy
Also I say computer science people totally different take Descarte problem
As problem
And I think bunch thing CS change outlook
After class might encounter considerably interesting philosophy interesting controversial
The big one philosophy Freedom advocated folk RMS The tragedy nearly half century computer science much involving relational system RDBMS one real Considering average student get nearly half question wrong impressive feat
Let know get right I admit equal
grin You leave politics alone wo leave alone
That necessary
Because Turing machine hard program
Or fast big memory hard build
I ca really understand answer want
And I agree may person I sure kook
The problem post like take long sort kook making invalid point people reasonable person making detailed valid point something I time care moment people
I guess upshot This century ago physic commonly called natural philosophy
In English If say say clearly
If ca say shut
APL natural extension assembler language programming best educational purpose

cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet
This layer called
used reasoning

December December December December Thomas Jones PhD Candidate Our office hour Monday Friday excluding official UNM holiday
Main Office Room University New Mexico Department Computer Science University New Mexico Albuquerque NM Give UNM Computer Science The University New Mexico Albuquerque NM New Mexico Flagship University

This focus important community issue innovative solution societal challenge people group making impact technology
The chart tell quite story
That blue line one look like hockey stick show interest computer science freshman University Washington Seattle skyrocketed since compared engineering field
The UW alone
Countless university Harvard Stanford University Michigan seeing similar demand computer science degree
On surface encouraging trend tech industry get enough new engineer
But beneath surface problem College student want become computer scientist many case enough room faculty meet demand
Young adult today realizing computer science knowledge help succeed software developer nearly job
Heck even journalist like u take Javascript HTML course
Kids waking said Bill Melinda Gates Chair Computer Science Engineering UW
Every field becoming information field program level beyond intro course huge value It also becoming popular thing learn
Yep geek cool today world
Students feel computing socially relevant even hip said computer science department chair Harvey Mudd College
But may encouraging see many young mind yearning build technology change world solution insane demand
In search potential fix growing problem GeekWire spoke computer science professor nation top university expert like Hadi Partovi Washington STEM Chief Policy Officer leading new coding trade school
What found short university appear prepared demand much planned future
There hope
The nascent online education industry could provide help program like proving beneficial want crash course coding outside typical university system
But much need done satisfy unprecedented demand computer science education
This first time explosion computer science interest
Back mid surge advent personal computer
Some argue university tried apply fix keep demand strategy ultimately led substantial fall year later
Then big boom late
Students saw entrepreneur creating website made millionaire wanted
There small number case actually happening alumnus helped fuel frenzy said Harvey Mudd computer science chair
It something like every college basketball player thinking going play But bubble burst leading another steep reduction computer science degree
Now seeing third surge though one differs greatly previous spike
What happened financially driven interest today appears coming new technology particularly seeing power smartphones
This time around I see student choosing major computer science genuinely excited said
Good job almost certainly factor decision many case I see fewer dollar sign student eye enthusiasm contribute something meaningful society cool former Stanford computer science department associate chair also cited employer graduate computer science background
He said latest surge It idea uncertain time people looking best stable education ensure least job Roberts explained
It le Wow I could become billionaire like saw Lazowska Roberts gave last month nuance particular wave computer science major
They found huge spike demand major introductory course enrollment computer science course realize need computer science skill particular field
This vastly outstrips previous enrollment peak late Lazowska said
The graph show Lazowska talking
Here increasing demand introductory course pas popular intro class Harvard example And increasing demand major Finally increasing demand So begs question What university crazy level interest
There simple answer question Increase classroom size hire faculty
However easier said done
At private institution adding space faculty doable stronger funding
At Stanford percent student take computer science course school place cap program
If say people want study certain subject Stanford historically expected figure way accommodate
university difficult time
The UW example expand computer science program two year ago constrained funding state government
We turning away many student love Lazowska said
That Lazowska offered bevy potential crappy solution increasing demand That last idea online education something many agree continue grow used every level education including university
Partovi technology veteran help expose computer science million kid big believer learning code online
The good news absolute best university course computer science also available study online via platform EdX Coursera Partovi said
Although online course completion rate course motivated student access university program due rising tuition cost shortage spot program still available But online class may provide cheaper accessible solution Lazowska warned computer science education without interaction simply good enough
He said lesson UW student learn working small team class invaluable another reason increasing class size could detrimental implication quality learning
We send student Amazon Facebook Microsoft Google team design experience said
You may get knowledge data structure Coursera much le obvious learn work collaborate small trade school also pointed inefficiency online education
Learning code frustrating lonely said
Graduation rate full online course single digit Having company like Code Fellows another potential alternative solution computer science degree
The program one growing number organization teach intensive coding bootcamps take traditional route learning computer science university level
It growing rapidly ever since launching two year ago attractive guarantee job graduation
Smith explained group like Code Fellows also flexibility university respond customer demand hearing feedback hiring partner perspective student understand technology relevant workplace
I think trade school like Code Fellows going huge part solution bridging gap demand supply software engineer ability learn quickly efficiently higher quality team expert guiding said
But advisor previously worked Microsoft startup said something like Code Fellows place tech ecosystem really replacement quality education someone receive university level
No matter smart way get breadth depth education university would something like bootcamp said Verespej earned Masters Computer Science UC San Diego
It If case perhaps university get creative way teach computer science
Chief Policy Officer said one solution could collaboration business higher education
She pointed University Maryland Lockheed Martin one example
These partnership leverage industry faculty teach course design curriculum provide internship research project benefit enabling student get experience industry exposure earning degree key factor looking full time work King said
Or colleague John Cook suggested year ago maybe time Seattle bankrolled technology investor
Lazowska however said raising money program would extremely difficult
He also expressed serious doubt would succeed
People always talk creating MIT creating Stanford creating Georgia Tech Lazowska said
Those university
There never instance one created becoming truly excellent le Roberts former Stanford computer science department head still teach class Palo Alto said like idea special institution teaching essential part field describes Hogwarts School Software He noted industry may persuaded fund something like much like Lockheed Martin partnering University Maryland
But hopeful optimistic solution university level
In fact expects academic institution able produce enough worker may lead downturn economy
Roberts compared dilemma global warming
We know problem something requires individual sacrifice even though downstream benefit shared said
It classic tragedy common problem
The entire economics structure go finding good way keep teacher employed reasonable Roberts cautioned problem fixed obvious solution
He said simply existing faculty teach student dilutes quality education student end receiving eventually diminish quality computer science graduate going workforce dire need
Roberts noted something similar happened surge
Every fix try impose end making environment le interesting positive people need said
If remember happened I quite sure repeat When asked workplace demand computer programmer coming college Partovi shared image
The number bit staggering Bureau Labor Statistics predicts million job student six year
This critical issue university many company
veteran recruiter Director Talent Madrona Venture Group said certainly computer science graduate five year ago enough
It still meet demand today employer said
Partovi note Washington state time open job graduate
King executive Washington STEM stressed importance computer science education meeting demand future job
Computer science job growing pay well
Students know code access best paying fastest growing job nation Washington said
It imperative every young person option particularly girl student color student rural area tend left computer science education hence wonder tech company trouble recruiting retaining diverse But unfortunately one really clear answer university adapt fill job particularly looking year road
With program like Washington STEM pushing forward computer science education expect even high school senior likely support parent wating study programming college
Harvey Mudd said ultimately people power control much money funneled school
My advice would folk control university budget Invest resource allow computer science department meet demand qualified student said
This investment pay dividend satisfaction student ultimately There may hope horizon
Perhaps government allocate fund allow school hire faculty
Maybe high individual like donate money help educate tomorrow leader
It hard know solution I see resource said Roberts former Stanford computer science associate chair
But keep talking
I hope wake people
There hope always This part GeekWire underwritten Singh Family Foundation business leader Steve Singh focusing important community issue innovative solution societal challenge people group making impact technology

MIT NSE Nuclear Information Hub The word criticality used extensively medium coverage
Criticality nuclear term refers balance neutron system
Subcritical refers system loss rate neutron greater production rate neutron therefore neutron population number The word criticality used extensively medium coverage
Criticality nuclear term refers balance neutron system
Subcritical refers system loss rate neutron greater production rate neutron therefore neutron population number neutron decrease time go
Supercritical refers system production rate neutron greater loss rate neutron therefore neutron population increase
When neutron population remains constant mean perfect balance production rate loss rate nuclear system said The criticality system calculated comparing rate neutron produced fission source rate lost absorption leakage reactor core
A nuclear reactor system control criticality balance neutron
The power reactor directly proportional neutron population
If neutron system fission take place producing energy
When reactor starting neutron population increased slowly controlled manner neutron produced lost nuclear reactor becomes supercritical
This allows neutron population increase power produced
When desired power level achieved nuclear reactor placed critical configuration keep neutron population power constant
Finally shutdown reactor placed subcritical configuration neutron population power decrease
Therefore reactor said gone critical actually mean stable configuration producing constant power
A reactor maintained critical normal power operation
In system spent fuel pool mechanism place prevent criticality
If system still achieves criticality called
Boron material absorb neutron place make sure occur
The added neutron absorber substantially increase rate loss neutron ensure subcritical system
Most type light water reactor like BWRs Japan use water cool reactor also slow neutron
In system slower neutron cause majority fission reaction
Therefore water boil neutron slow much probability fission reaction power decrease thus putting nuclear system subcritical state
If water heat vaporizes BWR reactor spent fuel pool without cooling temperature increase water eventual vaporization water tend place system subcritical condition
There also large amount boron system control rod reactor various kind boron spent fuel pool
Additionally steel structure supporting spent fuel pool sometimes made borated steel also contains large amount boron
Even fuel melt new geometric configuration likely favorable slowing neutron unlikely even water reintroduced system
Like Required field marked

In property
Their macroscopic behaviour thus display spatial temporal characteristic without need tune control parameter precise value system effectively tune evolves towards criticality
The concept put forward BTW paper published considered one mechanism arises nature
Its concept enthusiastically applied across field diverse others
SOC typically observed slowly driven system extended high level
Many individual example identified since BTW original paper date known set general characteristic system display SOC
criticality one number important discovery made related field latter half century discovery relate particularly study nature
For example study early discovery extensive work made clear complexity could generated feature extended system simple local interaction
Over similar period time large body work showed much complexity nature could described certain ubiquitous mathematical law extensive study carried showed phenomenon emerged phase
However term Criticality firstly introduced paper clearly linked together factor simple shown produce several characteristic feature observed natural complexity geometry way could linked
Crucially however paper emphasized complexity observed emerged robust manner depend finely tuned detail system variable parameter model could changed widely without affecting emergence critical behaviour hence criticality
Thus key result BTW paper discovery mechanism emergence complexity simple local interaction could therefore plausible source natural something possible lab lab computer possible tune control parameter precise value
The publication research sparked considerable interest theoretician experimentalists important paper subject among cited paper scientific literature
Due BTW metaphorical visualization model new sand grain slowly sprinkled cause avalanche much initial experimental work tended focus examining real avalanche famous extensive study probably Oslo ricepile experiment
Other experiment include carried pattern vortex
Early theoretical work included development variety alternative dynamic distinct BTW model attempt prove model property analytically including calculating examination necessary condition SOC emerge
One important issue latter investigation whether required local dynamical exchange model answer general minor reservation exchange dynamic BTW require local conservation least average
In long term key theoretical issue yet resolved include calculation possible SOC behaviour question whether possible derive general rule determining arbitrary display SOC
Alongside largely approach many investigation centered around natural social system known suspected display behavior
Although approach always welcomed least initially specialist subject examined SOC nevertheless become established strong candidate explaining number natural phenomenon including long SOC discovered known source behavior describing statistical distribution earthquake size describing frequency aftershock model displayed SOC proposed analyzed prior BTW paper fluctuation economic system reference SOC common neuronal avalanche cortex noise amplitude envelope electrophysiological signal SOC invoked example dynamical mechanism behind theory put forward
These applied investigation SOC included attempt modelling either developing new model adapting existing one specific given natural system extensive data analysis determine existence characteristic natural scaling law
The recent excitement generated raised interesting new question research number different SOC model shown generate network emergent phenomenon opposed simpler model proposed network researcher network tends assumed exist independently physical space dynamic
While many single phenomenon shown exhibit scale free property narrow range far extensive data concern surface area globular protein plotted modular segment centered specific amino acid length L L
Because fractal linearity hold amino acid range exists independently model
It regarded basic mechanism life
These study quantify differential geometry protein resolve many evolutionary puzzle regarding biological emergence complexity
Despite considerable interest research output generated SOC hypothesis remains general agreement regard mathematical mechanism
Bak Tang Wiesenfeld based hypothesis behavior sandpile model
However model subsequently shown actually generate noise rather noise
Other simulation model proposed later could produce true noise experimental sandpile model observed yield noise
In addition nonconservative theoretical model mentioned theoretical model SOC based upon

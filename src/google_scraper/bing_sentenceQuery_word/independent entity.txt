In general entity pronounced existing real thing
The word root Latin make distinction thing existence quality
An entity exists need entity
The fact something exists also seems connote separateness existence entity
In programming engineering probably many context word used identify unit whether concrete thing abstract idea ready name label
In blackboard discussion one draw something yet unnamed refer drawing representation entity
If entity discussed later get ascribed quality name reference entity may longer useful
In usage entity close meaning used
Here usage know In Standard Generalized Markup Language entity specific character string effect causing formatting program print formatter Web browser format display screen select present particular character notation
In usage entity certain string character together specify unique font selected displayed printed
A word needed character string entity came handy
In HTML usage SGML special entity character string given name entity therefore called named entity
In relation entity single person place thing data stored
In first step creation database entity unit data classified stated relationship entity
In Open Systems Interconnection model network communication entity active element within subsystem communicates entity using defined protocol
In IBM security product entity user group resource defined RACF

These problem procedure data space program representing procedure particular programming language computer
Problems procedure often confused
A problem defined criterion determines whether proposed solution accepted
One understand problem completely without method solution
Procedures usually built elementary procedure
What elementary procedure may complex procedure constructed one first topic computer science
This subject hard understand since precise notion computable function guide u computability relative given collection initial function easy define
Procedures operate member certain data space produce member data space using general still data space intermediate
A number operation known constructing new data space simpler one yet general theory representable data space comparable theory computable function
Some result given
Programs symbolic expression representing procedure
The procedure may represented different program different programming language
We shall discus problem defining programming language semantically stating procedure program represent
As syntax programming language rule allow u determine whether expression belongs language formalized part syntax relate closely semantics well studied
The problem translating procedure one programming language another much studied shall try give definition correctness translation
Computers finite automaton
From point view computer defined effect executing program given input state memory output
Computer science must study various way element data space represented memory computer procedure represented computer program
From point view current work automaton theory beside point

Relational database allow data separated connected across several table
Tables connected primary foreign key increase efficiency
The main characteristic When working relational database user need try keep
Each entity primary key provide unique reference entity mean entity referenced another table without call detail entity

One hundred fifteen year ago archeologist sifting object found wreck vessel Greek island Antikythera
Among wreck treasure beautiful vas pot jewelry bronze statue ancient philosopher peculiar thing series brass gear dial mounted case size mantel clock
Archeologists dubbed instrument Antikythera mechanism
The genius mystery piece ancient Greek technology arguably world first computer Google highlighting today At first glance piece brass found near wreck look like something might find junkyard hanging wall dive bar
What remains mechanism set rusted brass gear sandwiched rotting wooden box
But look machine see evidence least two dozen gear laid neatly top one another calibrated precision Swiss watch
This level technology well first
But mystery remained What contraption used
To archeologist immediately apparent mechanism sort clock calendar calculating device
But idea
For decade debated Was Antikythera toy model planet
Or perhaps early astrolabe device calculate latitude
In Princeton science historian Derek de Solla Price provided thorough scientific analysis contraption date
After careful study gear deduced mechanism used predict position planet star sky depending calendar month
A main gear would move represent calendar year would turn move many separate smaller gear represent motion planet sun moon
So could set main gear calendar date get approximation celestial object would sky date
And Price declared page Scientific American computer The mechanism like great astronomical clock like modern analogue computer us mechanical part save tedious It computer sense user could input simple variable would yield flurry complicated mathematical calculation
Today programming computer written digital code series one zero
This ancient clock code written mathematical ratio gear
All user enter main date one gear series subsequent gear turn mechanism could calculate thing like angle sun crossing sky
For reference used gear ratio add subtract arrive Europe
Since Price assessment modern mapping technology allowed scientist peer deeper remains mechanism learn even secret
In researcher revealed text kind instruction manual inscribed never seen
The text written tiny typeface legible ancient Greek helped complete puzzle machine operated
In astounding
The mechanism several dial clock face served different function measuring movement sun moon star planet operated one main crank Again mechanic absurdly complicated
A paper plotted schematic mechanic connect gear
It look
Not simple
Researchers still sure exactly used
Did scientist build aid calculation
Or type teaching tool show student math held cosmos together
Was unique
Or similar device yet discovered
Its assembly remains another mystery
How ancient Greeks accomplished feat unknown day
Whatever used however built know Its discovery changed understanding human history reminds u flash genius possible every human age
Nothing like instrument preserved elsewhere
Nothing comparable known ancient scientific text literary allusion Price wrote
It bit frightening know fall great civilization ancient Greeks come close age thought also scientific Check modern reconstruction mechanism video

Everything You Need Know About Mechanisms The ability write organic reaction mechanism properly key success organic chemistry class
Organic chemist use technique called depict flow movement electron chemical reaction
Arrow pushing help chemist keep track way electron associated atom redistribute bond made broken
The first essential rule keep mind following The great majority reaction discussed book involve movement pair electron represented arrowhead
Keep mind case resonance atom move contributing structure electron actually moving
The true chemical structure thought hybrid contributing Lewis line structure
It worth pointing used contributing structure arrow generally indicate interconversion p bond lone pair acetate ion p bond benzene formation breaking bond
In chemical reaction electron atom change position p bond formed broken
Arrow pushing used keep track movement electron involved step overall transformation
Because electron located orbitals surrounding atom bond formed broken movement electron orbitals necessarily accompanied movement associated atom lead second rule arrow pushing depicting chemical reaction mechanism We already used arrow pushing show proton transfer several time Chapter
The example show transfer proton relatively acidic acetic acid molecule relatively basic hydroxide anion
We show process one arrow labeled diagram start lone pair electron basic oxygen atom hydroxide anion point acidic H atom acetic acid indicate formation new bond made
A second arrow originates line representing breaking bond point O atom denote creation lone pair arrow b
In reaction proton transferred molecule arrow indicate movement electron involved
A common mistake beginning student make erroneously write arrow pointing H acetic acid O atom hydroxide anion
This wrong arrow would indicating H movement directly movement
Other common mistake arrow pushing given end
Combined arrow shown contributing structure shown previously seen three situation illustrated arrow arrowhead namely redistribution p bond lone pair formation new bond generally lone pair sometimes new p bond breaking bond generally form new lone pair sometimes new p bond
Often case ion reaction one arrow used given mechanism step
Now seen important type arrow point important common feature An bond lone pair electron
It either p bond lone pair atom relatively high electron density molecule ion bond must break reaction
An atom molecule ion accept new bond lone pair electron
Learning identify characteristic source sink different functional group key learning organic chemistry reaction mechanism
For example arrow depict formation new bond electron source often readily identified lone pair electron rich atom molecule ion electron sink readily identified electron poor atom molecule ion Thus prediction many important electron source sink come lesson concerning difference electronegativity atom presented Section allow identify partial formal negative positive charge molecule
As aid analysis red blue color various electrostatic surface map given throughout book indicate negative positive region molecule
We say reactivity pattern little bit later
This lead u another commonly encountered type process deserves mention
As see many later chapter making new bond electron sink often requires simultaneous breaking one bond present sink atom avoid overfilling valence orbitals situation referred hypervalence
In case electron source arrow bond broken sink atom able accommodate electron lone pair generally electronegative atom O atom halogen
If ion created ion often stabilized resonance delocalization stabilizing interaction
Returning proton transfer reaction acetic acid hydroxide summarize analysis simple mechanism
Viewed context third rule considering arrow used make new bond arrow hydroxide O atom electron source negatively charged atom acetic acid H atom electron sink atom highest partial positive charge
This illustrated using electrostatic molecular surface shown reaction equation
The O atom hydroxide ion greatest localized negative charge indicated intense red color acetic acid proton transferred intense positive charge character indicated intense blue color
In order avoid overfilling valence H atom reaction fourth rule bond acetic acid must broken arrow b
In acetate ion formed
Note acetate ion stabilized resonance delocalization
Based analysis reaction acetic acid hydroxide anion appreciate transfer proton Brønsted reaction really special case common pattern reactivity electron source base proton electron sink combined breaking bond satisfy valence create relatively stable ion
The addition removal proton chemical reaction common proton transfer step referred name directly use phrase add proton take proton away referring
However proton transfer reaction case use special name describe particular type common reaction involves arrow electron source electron sink
As briefly mentioned Section broader terminology applied common case reaction new bond form electron rich electron poor region molecule
meaning nucleus seeking molecule relatively electron rich p bond lone pair act electron source arrow making new bond
meaning electron seeking molecule relatively electron poor atom serve sink arrow
Analogously molecule region molecule source arrow called nucleophilic molecule region molecule sink arrow referred electrophilic
Based description clear nucleophiles analogous Lewis base electrophiles analogous Lewis acid
Chemists use term interchangeably although nucleophile electrophile commonly used kinetics discussion Lewis acid Lewis base commonly used discussion reaction thermodynamics
We use term throughout rest book
It helpful summarize appropriate use key term associated arrow pushing reaction mechanism
The term source sink used identify start end reaction mechanism arrow indicating change location electron pair
The term nucleophile electrophile well Lewis base Lewis acid used describe molecule based chemical reactivity propensity either donate receive electron interact
Protons thought specific type electrophile reaction proton transferred nucleophile called base
The following two set reaction A B show possibility arrow pushing individual reaction step
Identify wrong explain
Next using arrow pushing correctly label molecule nucleophile electrophile
In case first arrow pushing scenario wrong
The arrow shown star start source electron rather start position relative positive charge incorrect
In correct arrow pushing arrow labeled depicts interaction region relative high negative charge lone pair atom relatively high partial positive charge reactant
Therefore molecule acting source arrow arrow nucleophile molecule containing sink atom electrophile
The arrow labeled b needed satisfy valence considered defining nucleophile electrophile
In section chapter follow many different reaction mechanism described stepwise fashion
Each arrow classified according one three overall situation already encountered redistribution p bond lone pair formation new bond lone pair p bond breaking bond give new lone pair p bond
When learning new mechanism first focus overall transformation take place
It might reaction atom group added addition reaction reaction atom group removed elimination reaction reaction atom group replace atom group substitution reaction process encounter
Often overall process composed multiple step
Once overall process mind time think individual step convert starting material product
Predicting complete mechanism come learning predict individual step
Understanding opposed memorizing mechanism critical mastering organic chemistry
Although mechanism encounter throughout course may seem entirely different actually related fundamental way
In fact almost organic reaction mechanism learn composed different individual element step put together various combination
Your job learn individual mechanism element understand assemble step correct mechanism overall reaction
Fortunately surprisingly small number different type characteristic mechanism element pattern arrow considered trying predict individual step even complex chemical reaction
For reason view prediction step organic mechanism essentially situation common choice following Use element nucleophile present solution well electrophile suitable reaction occur
The situation even simpler might expect functional reverse many case
Many time one four choice occurs simultaneously mechanism step special situation unique different process electrophilic addition shift occur
These different process described detail encountered
In following section chapter book learn important property different functional group allow deduce appropriate choice individual step reaction mechanism
To help accomplish new mechanism introduced throughout rest book label mechanistic step one four mentioned appropriate emphasizing common feature even complex mechanism
When able predict choice appropriate given step mechanism able push electron correctly without relying memorization
At point taken major step toward mastering organic chemistry
Throughout book arrow pushing used indicate flow electron various organic reaction mechanism discussed
A simple rule properly performing arrow pushing introduced Section
In Appendix examine common mistake student make first learning method tell avoid
The mistake given one seen often author cumulative dozen year experience teaching Introductory Organic Chemistry
A second common mistake writing scheme use enough arrow
This usually result keeping track lone pair bond made bond broken mechanism step
In word analyze exactly new position electron resulting arrow missing arrow become evident
In following example compare two scenario one missing arrow
In incorrect scheme arrow indicates breaking bond reactant formation alkene product
Note arrow missing result commonly many bond lone pair one atom see next section hypervalency enough bond lone pair another
Another frequent mistake writing scheme expand valency atom electron atom accommodate situation referred hypervalency
An overarching principle organic chemistry carbon eight electron valence shell present stable organic molecule Octet Rule Section
Analogously many common element organic molecule nitrogen oxygen chlorine also obey Octet Rule
There three common way student incorrectly draw hypervalent atom Too many bond atom Forgetting presence hydrogen Forgetting presence lone pair
In following case arrow used depict potential resonance structure nitromethane
However result nitrogen atom electron valence shell many bond Such mistake avoided remembering draw bond lone pair atom total number electron atom valence shell apparent
Another common way make hypervalency mistake forgetting count lone pair electron
The following example show negatively charged nucleophile incorrectly adding formal positive charge alkylated ketone
This may look correct atom positive negative charge directly combined counting bond lone pair electron found oxygen end electron overall
Hence mistake
Acids base catalyst reactant product intermediate many organic chemistry transformation
When writing mechanism reaction involving acid base three general rule help guide depicting correct mechanism
The reason rule significant extent strong acid base simultaneously medium would rapidly undergo proton transfer reaction anything else would happen solution
An example mixed medium error given
The first example show strong base created although reaction performed acidic condition see condition first equilibrium arrow
Not shown three step lead intermediate drawn
A mistake made arrow pushing strong base methoxide generated leaving group even though reaction run strong acid
In correct mechanism next step would protonation ether oxygen atom followed loss methanol last step shown give carboxylic acid product
Overall charge must conserved mechanism step
Failure conserve overall charge could caused preceding error hypervalency failure draw arrow mixed medium error mention always helpful check arrow pushing consistent confirming overall charge conservation obeyed
In example shown arrow missing leading neutral intermediate even thought overall charge left side equation minus one
Notice five bond carbon intermediate hypervalency providing another obvious indication something incorrect mechanism step drawn

In object whose value refers another value stored elsewhere using
A pointer location memory obtaining value stored location known pointer
As analogy page number book index could considered pointer corresponding page dereferencing pointer would done flipping page given page number reading text found indexed page
Pointers data significantly improve performance repetitive operation traversing structure
In particular often much cheaper time space copy dereference pointer copy access data pointer point
Pointers also used hold address entry point subroutine
In used often using called
A pointer simple concrete implementation abstract
Several language support type pointer although restriction use others
While pointer used refer reference general properly applies whose explicitly allows pointer manipulated arithmetically via memory address opposed possible
Because pointer allow protected unprotected access memory address risk associated using particularly latter case
Primitive pointer often stored format similar however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To alleviate potential problem matter pointer considered separate type parameterized type data point even underlying representation integer
Other measure may also taken validation bound checking verify content pointer variable contain value valid memory address within numerical range processor capable addressing
credited invention pointer
In Lawson presented Computer Pioneer Award f inventing pointer variable introducing concept thus providing first time capability flexibly treat linked list high level language
According first appeared print technical memorandum
In pointer kind
A datum read written using one memory access instance primitive
A group primitive contiguous memory viewed collectively one datum instance aggregate could logically contiguous byte value represent coordinate point space
When aggregate entirely composed type primitive aggregate may called sense primitive array byte program use word way
In context definition smallest primitive specifies different byte
The memory address initial byte datum considered memory address entire datum
A primitive value intended used memory address said
It also said pointer value datum memory address
More generally pointer kind said obtain datum
The feature separate pointer kind reference pointer value meant interpreted memory address rather concept
References serve level indirection A pointer value determines memory address datum used calculation
Because indirection fundamental aspect algorithm pointer often expressed fundamental typed programming language pointer determines type datum pointer point
When setting like tree necessary pointer help manage structure implemented controlled
Typical example pointer start pointer end pointer pointer
These pointer either actual absolute start address base typically us fewer bit full address usually require one additional arithmetic operation resolve
Relative address form manual share many advantage disadvantage
A offset containing unsigned integer used provide relative addressing kilobyte data structure
This easily extended address pointed forced word boundary requiring additional shift left order adjust offset factor addition base address
Generally though scheme lot trouble convenience programmer absolute address underlying preferred
A one byte offset hexadecimal value character
used point alternative integer value index array

In way character efficiently translated usable sequential absolute address without
used control usually make extensive use pointer
The pointer usually embedded table entry may instance used hold entry point executed based certain condition defined table entry
The pointer however simply index separate associated table comprising array actual address address depending upon programming language construct available
They also used point earlier table entry loop processing forward skip table entry early exit loop
For latter purpose pointer may simply table entry number transformed actual address simple arithmetic
Pointers thin top addressing capability provided modern
In simplest scheme numeric assigned unit memory system unit typically either depending whether architecture effectively transforming memory large
The system would also provide operation retrieve value stored memory unit given address usually utilizing machine
In usual case pointer large enough hold address unit memory system
This introduces possibility program may attempt access address corresponds unit memory either enough memory installed
beyond range available memory architecture support address
The first case may certain platform architecture called segfault
The second case possible current implementation pointer bit long address extend bit
Pointers must conform certain rule canonical address pointer dereferenced processor raise
On hand system unit memory address
In case complex scheme employed use different part memory different time
The last incarnation architecture support bit physical memory address mapped linear address space paging mechanism
Thus possible total memory may accessed time
Another example computer family processor though supporting MB physical memory could access GB virtual memory combination address segment register made accessing KB one data structure cumbersome
In order provide consistent interface architecture provide allows address refer unit memory others refer device computer
There analogous concept file offset array index remote object reference serve purpose address type object
Pointers directly supported without restriction language implicitly
They primarily used constructing turn fundamental constructing nearly well passing data different part program
In functional programming language rely heavily list pointer reference managed abstractly language using internal construct like
When dealing array critical operation typically involves stage called involves constructing pointer desired data element array
In data structure pointer used reference explicitly tie one piece structure another
Pointers used pas parameter reference
This useful programmer want function modification parameter visible function caller
This also useful returning multiple value function
Pointers also used deallocate dynamic variable array memory
Since variable often become redundant served purpose waste memory keep therefore good practice deallocate using original pointer reference longer needed
Failure may result available free memory gradually severe case rapidly diminishes accumulation numerous redundant memory block
The basic define pointer This declares identifier object following type This usually stated succinctly pointer
Because C language specify implicit initialization object automatic storage duration care often taken ensure address point valid sometimes suggested pointer explicitly initialized value traditionally specified C standardized macro Dereferencing null pointer C produce could catastrophic
However implementation simply halt execution program question usually
However initializing pointer unnecessarily could hinder program analysis thereby hiding bug
In case pointer declared next logical step point something This assigns value address
For example stored memory location value assignment
To dereference pointer asterisk used This mean take content locate address memory set value
If later accessed new value
This example may clearer memory examined directly
Assume located address memory also assume machine int wide
The following would memory following code snippet executed The NULL pointer shown
By assigning address yield following memory value Then dereferencing coding computer take content address assign location yielding following memory Clearly accessing yield value previous instruction modified content way pointer
In C array indexing formally defined term pointer arithmetic language specification requires equivalent
Thus C array thought pointer consecutive area memory gap syntax accessing array identical used dereference pointer
For example array declared used following manner This allocates block five integer name block act pointer block
Another common use pointer point dynamically allocated memory return consecutive block memory le requested size used array
While operator array pointer equivalent result operator differs
In example evaluate size array evaluate size pointer
Default value array declared like If located memory starting address machine memory contain following value like address Represented five integer
These five integer occupy bit byte byte stored first stored consecutively starting address
The syntax C pointer The last example access content
Breaking Below example definition This definition essentially definition empty list cell type another link also type
The definition reference however use potentially confusing signal value
For reason data structure C usually dealt via carefully checked correctness
Pointers used pas variable address allowing value changed
For example consider following code In program required memory depends may enter
In case programmer need allocate memory dynamically
This done allocating memory rather variable usually stored
Variables also stored CPU register another matter Dynamic memory allocation made pointer name like common variable ca given
Pointers used store manage address block memory
Such block used store data object array object
Most structured language provide area memory called object dynamically allocated
The example C code illustrates structure object dynamically allocated referenced
The provides function allocating memory block heap
It take size object allocate parameter return pointer newly allocated block memory suitable storing object return null pointer allocation failed
The code illustrates memory object dynamically deallocated returned heap free store
The standard C library provides function deallocating previously allocated memory block returning back heap
On computing architecture pointer used directly manipulate memory device
Assigning address pointer invaluable tool programming
Below simple example declaring pointer type int initialising address example constant In mid using access video capability PCs slow
Applications typically used access video memory directly casting constant pointer array unsigned int value
Each value consisted code low byte colour high byte
Thus put letter row column bright white blue one would write code like following In many language pointer additional restriction object point specific
For example pointer may declared point language attempt prevent programmer pointing object integer eliminating error
For example C would integer pointer would char pointer
The following would yield compiler warning assignment incompatible pointer type declared different type
To suppress compiler warning must made explicit indeed wish make assignment say cast integer pointer char pointer assign
A draft C standard requires casting pointer derived one type one another type maintain alignment correctness type Pointers par
In language allow pointer arithmetic arithmetic pointer take account size type
For example adding integer number pointer produce another pointer point address higher number time size type
This allows u easily compute address element array given type shown C array example
When pointer one type cast another type different size programmer expect pointer arithmetic calculated differently
In C example array start byte whereas byte point would point
Other risk casting include loss data wide data written narrow location
unexpected result value comparison problem especially signed v unsigned value
Although impossible general determine cast safe language store used confirm dangerous cast valid runtime
Other language merely accept conservative approximation safe cast none
As pointer allows program attempt access object may defined pointer origin variety
However usefulness pointer great difficult perform programming task without
Consequently many language created construct designed provide useful feature pointer without also sometimes referred
In context pointer directly address memory used article referred contrast smart pointer variant
One major problem pointer long directly manipulated number made point unused address data used purpose
Many language including recent like replace pointer opaque type reference typically referred simply used refer object manipulated number preventing type error
Array indexing handled special case
A pointer address assigned called
Any attempt use uninitialized pointer cause unexpected behavior either initial value valid address using may damage part program
The result often used function pointer branch address
In system explicit memory allocation possible create deallocating memory region point
This type pointer dangerous subtle deallocated memory region may contain data deallocated may reallocated overwritten unrelated code unknown earlier code
Languages prevent type error deallocation performed automatically reference scope
Some language like support use simple form help track allocation dynamic memory addition acting reference
In absence reference cycle object refers indirectly sequence smart pointer eliminate possibility dangling pointer memory leak
string support reference counting natively
The introduces optimisation based around eliminate pointer bug without resorting
A value reserved indicating pointer refer valid object
Null pointer routinely used represent condition end unknown length failure perform action use null pointer compared value
An pointer whose value interpreted offset address pointer thus data structure autorelative pointer member point portion data structure data structure may relocated memory without update value auto relative pointer
The cited patent also us term mean thing
However meaning term used way A pointer whose value offset value another pointer
This used store load block data assigning address beginning block base pointer
In language pointer reference another pointer requiring multiple dereference operation get original value
While level indirection may add performance cost sometimes necessary order provide correct behavior complex
For example C typical define term element contains pointer next element list This implementation us pointer first element list surrogate entire list
If new value added beginning list changed point new element
Since C argument always passed value using double indirection allows insertion implemented correctly desirable eliminating special case code deal insertion front list In case value le caller properly updated address new item
A basic example argument given prototype variable pointer array string array array pointer string convention name program character string
In language pointer reference executable code point function method procedure
A store address function invoked
While facility used call function dynamically often favorite technique virus malicious software writer
A pointer point valid object consequently may make program crash behave oddly
In pointer specifically initialized may point unpredictable address memory
The following example code show dangling pointer Here may point anywhere memory performing assignment corrupt unknown area memory trigger
In doubly back pointer held element back item referring current element
These useful navigation manipulation expense greater memory use
These pointer declaration cover variant pointer declaration
Of course possible triple pointer main principle behind triple pointer already exist double pointer
The higher priority
Where pointer used address entry point program start also either uninitialized corrupted call nevertheless made address said occurred
The consequence usually unpredictable error may present several different way depending upon whether pointer valid address whether coincidentally valid instruction opcode address
The detection wild branch present one difficult frustrating debugging exercise since much evidence may already destroyed beforehand execution one inappropriate instruction branch location
If available usually detect wild branch take effect also provide complete partial trace history
It possible simulate pointer behavior using index normally array
Primarily language support pointer explicitly support array thought processed entire memory range within scope particular array index thought equivalent assembly language point individual byte whose actual value relative start array absolute address memory
Assuming array say contiguous character individual byte contiguous byte within array directly addressed manipulated using name array bit unsigned simulated pointer quite similar example shown
Pointer arithmetic simulated adding subtracting index minimal additional overhead compared genuine pointer arithmetic
It even theoretically possible using technique together suitable simulate intermediate another language support pointer example
To achieve code initially loaded contiguous byte array simulator read interpret action entirely within memory contained array
If necessary completely avoid problem usually actioned compiler hand coded simulator
strongly typed language pointer typed safe type conversion permitted
All pointer default initialized attempt access data pointer cause raised
Pointers Ada called
Ada permit arithmetic access type although many compiler vendor provided feature Ada support safe arithmetic access type via package
Several old version Windows platform support STRPTR return address string VARPTR return address variable
Visual Basic also support OBJPTR return address object interface ADDRESSOF operator return address function
The type integer value equivalent held pointer type
Newer dialect exhaustive pointer implementation however
In FreeBASIC arithmetic pointer equivalent C treated though pointer byte width
pointer dereferenced Also casting type pointer generate warning
In pointer variable store address
Each pointer type point one freely cast pointer type function pointer object pointer
A special pointer type called void pointer allows pointing object limited fact dereferenced directly shall cast
The address often directly manipulated casting pointer integral type sufficient size though result may indeed cause undefined behavior earlier C standard integral type guaranteed large enough specifies defined implementation need provide
fully support C pointer C typecasting
It also support new group typecasting operator help catch unintended dangerous cast
Since also provides used situation safer alternative primitive C pointer
also support another form reference quite different pointer called simply
ability modify pointer target address arithmetic operation well magnitude comparison restricted language standard remain within bound single array object otherwise invoke
Adding subtracting pointer move multiple size
For example adding pointer integer value increment pointer
This effect incrementing pointer point next element contiguous array often intended result
Pointer arithmetic performed pointer size thus pointed address added although compiler perform byte arithmetic extension treating
Pointer arithmetic provides programmer single way dealing different type adding subtracting number element required instead actual offset byte
Pointer arithmetic pointer us byte offset definition
In particular C definition explicitly declares syntax element array equivalent content element pointed
This implies equivalent one write equally well access fourth element array
While powerful pointer arithmetic source
It tends confuse novice forcing different context expression ordinary arithmetic one pointer arithmetic one sometimes easy mistake one
In response many modern computer language example permit direct access memory using address
Also safe C dialect address many issue pointer
See discussion
The supported ANSI C generic pointer type
A pointer store address object function C implicitly converted object pointer type assignment must explicitly cast dereferenced
C used pointer purpose ANSI C
allow implicit conversion pointer type even assignment
This design decision avoid careless even unintended cast though compiler output warning error encountering cast
In reference void complement pointer void reference behave like alias variable point never variable whose type
In pointer supported certain condition block code including pointer must marked keyword
Such block usually require higher security permission allowed run
The syntax essentially address pointed either memory
However pointer managed memory pointer managed object must declared using keyword prevents moving pointed object part memory management pointer scope thus keeping pointer address valid
An exception using structure safe managed equivalent require unsafe code
This type often returned using method example The framework includes many class method namespaces class convert type example many type pointer example allow communication
Most method security permission requirement unmanaged code since affect arbitrary place memory
The programming language support pointer variable
Primitive group record data object declared within program inherently memory allocated within program space address data item typically single memory word
In program source code data item used like variable content implicitly accessed indirectly pointer
Memory space data object typically using external statement via embedded extended language construct statement
Extended version COBOL also provide pointer variable declared clause
The value pointer variable established modified using statement
Some extended version COBOL also provide variable capable storing
The language provides full support pointer data type including pointer structure string handling extensive
quite leap forward compared programming language time
The derivative C fully support C pointer C typecasting
The employ value reference semantics without pointer arithmetic
Nevertheless pointer class provided
They offer pointer arithmetic typecasting explicit memory management interfacing software feature
introduced strongly typed pointer capability
Fortran pointer contain simple memory address
They also encapsulate lower upper bound array dimension stride example support arbitrary array section metadata
An used associate variable attribute
The statement may also used associate pointer block memory
For example following code might used define create linked list structure add support procedure pointer
Also part feature support intrinsic function converting pointer Fortran pointer back
pointer
Its declaration syntax equivalent C written way around ending type
Unlike C Go garbage collection disallows pointer arithmetic
Reference type like exist
Some type like map channel boxed
internally pointer mutable structure initialized using function
In approach unified syntax pointer arrow operator dropped dot operator pointer refers field method dereferenced object
This however work level indirection
Unlike explicit representation pointer
Instead complex data structure like implemented using
The language provide explicit pointer manipulation operator
It still possible code attempt dereference null reference null pointer however result thrown
The space occupied unreferenced memory object recovered automatically
Pointers implemented much Pascal parameter procedure call
even strongly typed Pascal fewer way escape type system
Some variant include garbage collection
Much pointer available
There still fewer way evade type system variant still safer respect pointer variant
As garbage collection part language specification
Unlike many language feature pointer standard allows pointer reference dynamically created variable anonymous allow reference standard static local variable
It pointer arithmetic
Pointers also must associated type pointer one type compatible pointer another type
pointer char compatible pointer integer
This help eliminate type security issue inherent pointer implementation particularly used
It also remove risk caused ability dynamically let go referenced space using standard procedure effect library function found mean risk dangling pointer entirely eliminated
However commercial open source Pascal derivative compiler implementation pointer allowed reference standard static local variable cast one pointer type another
Moreover pointer arithmetic unrestricted adding subtracting pointer move number byte either direction using standard procedure move pointer size point
An untyped pointer also provided name compatible pointer type
The support pointer although rarely used form pack unpack function
These intended simple interaction compiled OS library
In case Perl us typed allow form pointer arithmetic
They used construct complex data structure

How I type simple chemical equation Microsoft Word
I subscript long arrow difficult
I ca get align text
Also I ca figure put delta arrow heat
I tried Chemistry Microsoft seem help equation
If using MS Word newer use equation feature
It designed math work okay chemistry
Go insert tab
Click equation button far right
Type equation
Use button ribbon superscript subscript
The default letter italicized variable want fix
There also shortcut command render common thing want
For example underscore creates subscript caret creates superscript
You access wide range arrow menu give simple right arrow although long
This feature Word also accept command formatting equation
To get long arrow click operator choose arrow word yield written common operator structure
Click word yield replace many space need create arrow whatever length want
Finally finish equation
For older version MS Word go insert menu click equation launch Equation Editor Program also find program computer searching give ability create equation
Even though question already answered alternative answer open switching Word LaTeX package PDF benefit greatly long run
Frequently best solution draw equation chemical drawing software several freeware option paste graphic Word
The answer mentioned correct also shortcut built math autocorrect
It much like LaTeX
By default inactive activate really helpful want write big equation
For example want type H type
Many option available
For example want superscript character caret sign converted superscript
Many shortcut covered simply search How insert mathematical equation like LaTeX Tips trick YouTube
These method especially helpful fast typing
Moreover save time lost switching keyboard mouse searching proper option Word
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

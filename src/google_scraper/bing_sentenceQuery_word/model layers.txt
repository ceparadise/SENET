The Data Link Layer protocol layer transfer data adjacent network node wide area network node local area network segment
The Data Link Layer provides functional procedural mean transfer data network entity might provide mean detect possibly correct error may occur Physical Layer
Examples data link protocol Ethernet local area network Protocol PPP HDLC ADCCP connection
OSI short Open System Interconnection ISO standard worldwide communication defines networking framework implementing protocol seven layer
OSI layer control passed one layer next starting application layer one station proceeding bottom layer channel next station back hierarchy
The network layer This layer provides switching routing technology creating logical path known virtual circuit transmitting data node
Routing forwarding function layer well addressing internet working error handling congestion control packet sequencing
The network layer concerned controlling operation sub net
A key design issue determining packet routed source destination
Routes could based static table wired network rarely changed
They could also determined start conversation example terminal session
Finally could highly dynamic determined anew packet reflect current network load

In way hiding implementation detail particular set functionality allowing facilitate
Software model use layer abstraction include
In abstraction layer generalization away specific implementation
These generalization arise broad similarity best encapsulated model express similarity present various specific implementation
The simplification provided good abstraction layer allows easy reuse distilling useful concept situation may accurately applied quickly recognized
A good abstraction generalize made abstract allowing specificity abstraction break successful application requires customization unique requirement problem
A layer top another depends
Every layer exist without layer requires layer function
Frequently abstraction layer composed hierarchy abstraction level
The OSI model comprises seven abstraction layer
Each layer model encapsulates address different part need digital communication thereby reducing complexity associated engineering solution
A All problem computer science solved another level indirection
This often deliberately misquoted abstraction substituted indirection
It also sometimes misattributed
corollary except problem many layer indirection
In computer system usually represented consisting several abstraction level Programmable logic often considered part hardware logical definition also sometimes seen part device software firmware
Firmware may include software also include software including operating system application
The software layer divided
hardware abstraction layer physical logical device driver repository filesystems operating system kernel middleware application others
A distinction also made programming language like
In Unix operating system type input output operation considered stream byte read device written device
This stream byte model used file socket terminal order provide device independence
In order read write device application level program call function open device may real device terminal virtual device network port file file system
The device physical characteristic mediated operating system turn present abstract interface allows programmer read write byte device
The operating system performs actual transformation needed read write stream byte device
Most graphic library OpenGL provide abstract graphical device model interface
The library responsible translating command provided programmer specific device command needed draw graphical element object
The specific device command different device command graphic library hide implementation device dependent detail providing abstract interface provides set generally useful drawing graphical object

Layers OSI Model Computer Network Network Administration Windows User Properties Network Administration How Create New User How Enable SUDO Command Your Linux Network Useful Linux Commands Related Book By The OSI Open System Interconnection Model break various aspect computer network seven distinct layer
Each successive layer envelops layer beneath hiding detail level
The OSI Model networking standard sense Ethernet
Rather OSI Model framework various networking standard fit
The OSI Model specifies aspect network operation addressed various network standard
So sense OSI Model sort standard standard
The first three layer sometimes called They deal mechanic information sent one computer another network
Layers sometimes called They deal application relate network application programming interface
The bottom layer OSI Model Physical Layer
It address physical characteristic network type cable used connect device type connector used long cable
For example Ethernet standard cable specifies electrical characteristic cable size shape connector maximum length cable
Another aspect Physical Layer specifies electrical characteristic signal used transmit data cable one network node another
The Physical Layer define particular meaning signal basic binary value
The higher level OSI model must assign meaning bit transmitted Physical Layer
One type Physical Layer device commonly used network A repeater used regenerate signal need exceed cable length allowed Physical Layer standard need redistribute signal one cable onto two cable
An hub also Physical Layer device
Technically hub purpose regenerate every signal received port hub port
Repeaters hub examine content signal regenerate
If working Data Link Layer Physical Layer
The lowest layer meaning assigned bit transmitted network
protocol address thing size packet data sent mean addressing packet delivered intended recipient way ensure two node try transmit data network time
The Data Link Layer also provides basic error detection correction ensure data sent data received
If uncorrectable error occurs standard must specify node informed error retransmit data
At Data Link Layer device network address known This actual hardware address assigned device factory
You see MAC address computer network adapter opening command window running command
The handle task routing network message one computer another
The two popular protocol IP usually paired TCP IPX normally paired SPX use Novell Windows network
One important function Network Layer Every network device physical address called assigned device factory
When buy network interface card install computer MAC address card changed
But want use addressing scheme refer computer device network
This concept logical addressing come logical address give network device place accessed network using address assign
Logical address created used Network Layer protocol IP IPX
The Network Layer protocol translates logical address MAC address
For example use IP Network Layer protocol device network assigned IP address
Because IP protocol must use Data Link Layer protocol actually send packet device IP must know translate IP address device correct MAC address device
You use command see IP address computer
Another important function Network layer finding appropriate path network
Routing come play computer one network need send packet computer another network
In case Network Layer device called forward packet destination network
An important feature router used connect network use different protocol
For example router used connect network us Ethernet network run different set protocol
The Transport Layer basic layer one network computer communicates another network computer
The Transport Layer find one popular networking protocol TCP
The main purpose Transport Layer ensure packet move network reliably without error
The Transport Layer establishing connection network device acknowledging receipt packet resending packet received corrupted arrive
In many case Transport Layer protocol divide large message smaller packet sent network efficiently
The Transport Layer protocol reassembles message receiving end making sure packet contained single transmission received data lost
The Session Layer establishes instance communication data exchange network node
A session must established data transmitted network
The Session Layer make sure session properly established maintained
The Presentation Layer responsible converting data sent network one type representation another
For example Presentation Layer apply sophisticated compression technique fewer byte data required represent information sent network
At end transmission Transport Layer uncompresses data
The Presentation Layer also scramble data transmitted unscramble end using sophisticated encryption technique
The highest layer OSI model Application Layer deal technique application program use communicate network
The name layer little confusing application program Excel Word actually part layer
Rather Application Layer represents level application program using programming interface request network service
One commonly used application layer protocol HTTP stand HyperText Transfer Protocol
HTTP basis World Wide Web

The Open System Interconnection OSI model defines networking framework implement protocol seven layer
Use handy guide compare different layer OSI model understand interact
The model defines
There really nothing OSI model
In fact even tangible
The OSI model perform function networking process
It better understand complex interaction happening
The developed Open Systems Interconnection OSI model
It divide network communication seven layer
Layers considered lower layer mostly concern moving data around
Layers upper layer contain data
Networks operate one basic principle pas
Each layer take care specific job pass data onto next layer
In OSI model control passed one layer next starting application layer Layer one station proceeding bottom layer channel next station back hierarchy
The OSI model take task divide referred consists following layer
Click link list read detailed information example layer OSI Model Layer support process
Communication partner identified quality service identified user authentication privacy considered constraint data identified
Everything layer
This layer provides application service file transfer service
application exist entirely application level
Tiered application architecture part layer
This layer provides independence difference data representation translating application network format vice versa
The presentation layer work transform data form application layer accept
This layer format encrypts data sent across providing freedom compatibility problem
It sometimes called syntax layer
This layer establishes manages terminates connection
The session layer set coordinate terminates conversation exchange dialogue application end
It deal session connection coordination
OSI Model Layer provides transparent transfer data end system responsible error recovery
It ensures complete data transfer
Layer provides technology creating logical path known transmitting data node
Routing forwarding function layer well error handling control packet sequencing
At OSI Model Layer data packet decoded bit
It furnishes knowledge management handle error physical layer flow control frame synchronization
The data link layer divided two sub layer The Media Access Control layer LLC layer
The MAC sub layer control computer network gain access data permission transmit
The LLC layer control frame flow control error checking

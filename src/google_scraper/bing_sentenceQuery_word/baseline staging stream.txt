What difference branch stream ClearCase
A branch classic versioning way parallelize history version given file See A metadata able memorize baseline view referencing Stream see
When create Stream nothing happen branch created
But Stream used file checked view set config spec order create branch named Stream order isolate
See This important adequately name Stream If I create Stream named eventually see version tree modified file branch named If I create Stream named see branch named infer view referencing Stream produce fix release much useful name
This I like So writable component Stream could considered template branch And many UCM user mix equate Stream branch But component project Stream list baseline label component want see view create said Stream
That becomes visualization mechanism useful testing environment need access precise version set component order test system
In case branch ever created since checkout ever made file component declared UCM project
The major difference Stream branch
That hierarchy simply exist branch branch With Stream would The hierarchy Streams Keep mind two UCM operation core simple merges two branch
However name know merge two branch parent Stream parent Stream

One client using AccuRev Source Code Management Version Control
We trying Jenkins CI environment
Currently done Jenkins simply polling stream
However looking better way integrate Jenkins CI AccuRev workflow
I read something Gated Streams trigger external build determine whether change downstream may promoted
This sound promising however due inexperience AccuRev I sure would implemented
Can anyone point example tutorial using Jenkins CI AccuRev particularly Gated Streams
Or perhaps explain detail specific subject
I use Jenkins AccuRev
In environment CI build started based accomplished using cover promote purge new cover demote
I played around gated stream abit implemneted feature environment I hit defect maybe fixed latest release
The basic concept gated stream promote change stream change actually sent staging stream child stream
You change based acceptance criterion determine change promoted gated stream
Example I promote change fails build change stay staging stream
You need fix problem successful build change promoted gated stream
This way tainting stream gated stream
Currently today promote change stream break build stream stream contain bad code
Look online accurev help Chapter
Using Streams Enforce Process

The USGS Water Science School previous page Floods drought glacier Q A home River stage important concept analyzing much water moving stream given moment
Stage water level arbitrary point usually zero height near river bed river commonly measured foot
For example normal day rain fallen river might stage foot baseflow condition
If big storm hit river stage could rise foot
This important past record might know stage hit foot water start flowing bank basement house along river time tell people move dog bed upstairs
In picture see common Geological Survey USGS staff tall ruler marked inch
This allows someone quickly look water level get pretty accurate reading current gage height stream
How high fast river rise storm depends many thing
Most important course much rain falling
But also look thing stage river storm begin soil like drainage basin raining soil already saturated water previous storm
hard part rain falling
The USGS studied thing many place across country many year thus often able make prediction flood occur bad flood
With advent modern computer satellite technology USGS monitor stage many stream almost instantly
Since stream especially normally arid Western rise dramatically matter minute major storm important able remotely monitor fast water rising real time order warn people might affected dangerous flood
Recreational user stream kayakers also use data tell certain stream right height kayaking
The USGS gather data river stage even produce graph showing stage rain URL http Page Contact Information Page Last Modified Friday EST

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I thought I worked reading excellent book I little confused
They talk server I always thought staging providing UAT function seem staging separate level
So scheme function would staging server provide
Staging would putting full product system place actually using yet
When go use would production
You put everything place used test flip switch
The UAT commonly us testing environment significantly different used production
For example I work customer test everything VM environment running server
When system go live running hardware facility probably integrating existing system absolutely nothing server test environment except code configuration copied I work release management team large internet company
We use essentially process outlined chosen process purpose
In methodology staging serf branching mechanism final level testing production
Obviously want testing go production large complex environment lot user difficult goal reach
In particular virtually impossible adequately load test software QA
Functional testing lot easier automate load testing
When many thousand user hitting server thing fail weird hard predict way
So That point branch staging production
We use train model release new train starting every week
Even numbered train go staging server production
Odd numbered train
In even train developer ability push individual change staging server change tested QA course
This allows validate software performs expected real production environment
This generally reserved component deemed higher risk push every little piece staging
Then everyone understands next even train start wipe staging server set back train baseline
Developers either ensure change got train decide ready general use yet case change get erased staging server
To sum short answer least u impossible completely test complex system QA
Staging provides safe way limited production testing
On related note I gave release process work
The simplest explanation staging testing deployment process test using real data source
Some system combine staging testing environment large scale system deployment process could complex may extra testing step required connect data source
In case staging environment let test deployment process check last minute bug using live data thing verified working quickly switch stage environment production environment
An example would Windows Azure requires minute deploy new version deploy staging environment perform test
I came across article say Staging validate system
The article well worth read full

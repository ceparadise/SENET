Kim Education taught math course four college addition teaching math student variety setting
The mathematical rule allows find number way combination event occur
For example first event occur way second event occur way third event occur way find number unique combination multiplying unique combination
Imagine necktie sewing business
You make unique tie changing following factor color option shape option
How many unique tie make
One way think making diagram
There color
Each color made shape blue shape choice red shape choice etc
By multiplying get total number path take diagram
You make different kind tie
Now suppose also add pattern choice tie option striped solid
How many tie make
Simply imagine one possibility originally maybe green tie short fat
That green short tie made three way striped solid
The true original tie
So different type tie
This multiplication method work time several factor color shape design factor combined way possible
You use fundamental counting rule multiplication time set category one several choice category selected
You might think several empty fill
Each get one item
Suppose slot represent course meal going order
If course might appetizer choice soup choice salad choice along main course choice beverage choice dessert choice
To find many unique meal make fill blank number choice multiply possible unique meal Another situation might creation license plate
Again slot fill
This time first two slot must letter choice remaining slot must number choice
If fill number choice multiply get number license plate make Get FREE access day create account
license plate If repeat number choice several slot little concise use exponent
The license plate multiplication rewritten This simplification particularly helpful every slot number option
For example suppose creating phone number use ten digit slot
You get power possibility
Another simplification happens slot get one le choice preceding slot
For example suppose book want arrange bookcase
You randomly pick book put first
The first book choice
But chosen book left choose second slot
For third slot forth book left
The number way arrange book This represented
The exclamation point math symbol called
It mean take number front multiply next lowest number next number forth get
The simply way counting number combination create making several choice row
In case repeated value easier use exponent
also come handy multiplying set number start increase

This preview shown page This preview shown page This preview shown page This preview shown page Two different subset ninety number shown sum
For example maybe sum number first column equal sum number second column
Can find two subset
This difficult computational problem
But prove subset must exist
This sort weird conclusion one reach tricky use counting topic chapter
Counting seems easy enough etc
This explicit approach work well counting simple thing like toe extremely complicated thing identifiable structure
However subtler method help count many thing vast middle ground The number different way select dozen doughnut five eties available
The number number exactly one
Counting useful computer science several reason Determining time storage required solve computational central objective computer often come solving counting problem
Counting I Counting basis probability theory turn perhaps portant topic term
Two remarkable proof technique pigeonhole principle combinatorial proof rely counting
These lead variety interesting useful insight
We going present lot rule counting
These rule actually theorem generally going prove
Our objective teach counting practical skill like integration
And rule seem obvious anyway
How count number people crowded room
We could count head since person exactly one head
Alternatively could count ear divide two
Of course might adjust calculation someone lost ear pirate raid someone born three ear
The point often count one thing counting another though fudge factor may required
This central theme counting easiest problem hardest
In formal term every counting problem come determining size set
The set S number element S denoted
In term claiming often find size one set S finding size related set T
We already mathematical tool relating one set another relation
Not surprisingly particular kind relation heart counting
Functions like f x g x x surely quite familiar calculus
We going use function counting well way might familiar
Instead using function map one real number another use function relate element finite set
In order count accurately need carefully define notion function
mally f X Y relation two set X Y relates element X exactly one element Y
The set X called function f Y called
Here illustration function Counting I X f Y domain codomainb PPPPPPq q In example domain set X b c e range set Y
Related element joined arrow
This relation function every element left related exactly one element right
In term function every element left degree exactly
If x element domain related element codomain denoted f x
We often say f x f x
In case f map b c e
Equivalently f f b f c f f e
The relation shown function X Y X Y PPPPPPqc PPPPPPqd b c PPPPPPq e e The relation left function mapped two element codomain
The relation right function b mapped zero element codomain

The definition function rather asymmetric restriction element domain element codomain
A function f X Y map exactly one element domain element codomain
In graph term domain codomain element required degree exactly bijective function
Here example bijection Counting I X f Y domain codomainb PPPPPPc q In contrast relation bijections X Y X Y X Y b PPPPPPqc PPPPPPqd e b PPPPPPqc Q Q Q Q QQs b c e PPPPPPq The first function bijective related two element domain
The second function bijective related zero element domain
The last relation even function b associated zero element domain
Bijective function also found world function
For example f x bijective function domain codomain For every real number codomain f x exactly one real number x domain
On hand f x bijective function
The number codomain related domain
If pair girl dance boy must equal number
This simple observation generalizes powerful counting rule If exists bijection f A B B In example A set boy B set girl function f defines paired
The Bijection Rule act magnifier counting ability figure size one set immediately determine size many set via bijections
Counting I For example let return two set mentioned earlier A way select dozen doughnut five variety available B sequence exactly one Let consider particular element set A chocolate sugar glazed plain We depicted doughnut left gap different variety
Thus selection contains two chocolate doughnut six sugar two glazed two plain
Now let put four gap chocolate sugar glazed plain We formed number exactly element B
This example suggests bijection set A set B map dozen doughnut ing c chocolate l sugar g glazed p plain sequence














c l g p The resulting sequence always bit exactly one thus element B
Moreover mapping bijection every bit sequence mapped exactly one order dozen doughnut
Therefore B Bijection Rule
This demonstrates magnifying power bijection rule
We managed prove two different set actually even though know exactly big either one
But soon figure size one set immediately know size
This particular bijection might seem frighteningly ingenious seen fore
But use essentially argument soon consider boringly routine
The Bijection Rule let u count one thing counting another
This suggests general strategy get really good counting thing use bijections count everything else Counting I This precisely strategy follow
In particular get really good ing sequence
When want determine size set T find jection T set sequence Then use skill determine immediately give u T
We need hone idea somewhat go along pretty much plan
In order pull need clarify issue concerning sequence set
Recall unordered collection distinct element
A set often represented listing element inside
For example b c set c b another way writing set
On hand b set element appears twice
On hand ordered collection element called necessarily distinct
A sequence often written listing term inside parenthesis
For example b c sequence c b different sequence
Furthermore b perfectly valid sequence
The distinction set sequence crucial everything follows
If keep distinction clear mind doomed
We harvest first crop counting problem two basic rule
Linus allocates big sister Lucy quota crabby day irritable day generally surly day
On many day Lucy one way another
Let set C crabby day I irritable day S generally surly
In term answer question C I S
Now assuming permitted one bad quality day size union set given Sum Rule Counting I If


An disjoint set


An

Thus according Linus budget Lucy C I SC I day Notice Sum Rule hold union disjoint set
Finding size union intersecting set complicated problem take later
The product rule give size product set
Recall


Pn set

Pn set sequence whose first term drawn second term drawn forth
If


Pn set

Pn Unlike sum rule product rule require set


Pn disjoint
For example suppose daily diet consists breakfast selected set B lunch set L dinner set D B pancake bacon egg bagel Doritos L burger fry garden salad Doritos D macaroni pizza frozen burrito pasta Doritos Then B set possible daily diet
Here sample element pancake burger fry pizza bacon egg garden salad pasta Doritos Doritos frozen burrito The Product Rule tell u many different daily diet possible LB Counting I Few counting problem solved single rule
More often solution flury sum product bijections method
Let look example bring one rule play
The sum product rule together useful solving problem involving password telephone number license plate
For example certain computer system valid password sequence six eight symbol
The first symbol must letter lowercase uppercase remaining symbol must either letter digit
How many different password possible
Let define two set corresponding valid symbol first subsequent tions password
F b


z A B


Z S b


z A B


Z


In term set possible password F F F Thus password set password password F
Since set disjoint apply Sum Rule count total number possible password follows F Sum Rule F F F F F S S Product Rule different password n How many different subset n element set X
For example set X eight different subset There natural bijection subset X sequence
Let


xn element X
Then particular subset X map sequence


bn Counting I bi xi subset
For example n subset map sequence follows subset sequence We used bijection transform original problem question exactly according plan
Now answer sequence question solved original problem well
But many different sequence
For example different sequence Well write set sequence product set n

n term Then Product Rule give answer n n This mean number subset set X also
We put answer use shortly
Bijective function incredibly powerful counting tool
A kind function useful well look two one next time
A function f X every element Y mapped least every element Y mapped every element Y mapped exactly We repeated definition bijective function comparison
Notice definition immediately imply function bijective injective surjective
Now name surjective injective hopelessly unmemorable nondescriptive
Some people prefer term respectively perhaps ground hopelessly unmemorable shorter
Anyway couple example Counting I X Y X Y b PPPPPP b PPPPPP c q c Q q Q PPPPPP q QQe The function left surjective every element right mapped least injective element mapped twice
The function right tive every element mapped surjective element mapped zero time
Earlier observed two set size bijection
Similarly surjections injection imply certain size relationship set

If f X Y surjective Y
If f X Y injective Y
If f X Y bijective Y Here old puzzle A drawer dark room contains red sock green sock blue sock
How many sock must withdraw sure matching pair
For example picking three sock enough might end one red one green one blue
The solution relies Pigeonhole Principle friendly name contrapositive part Mapping Rule
Let write If Y function f X Y injective
Now let rewrite second time eliminate word injective since ghost chance remember mean If every function f X Y exist two different element X mapped element Y
Counting I Perhaps relevance abstract mathematical statement selecting footwear poor lighting condition obvious
However let A set sock pick let B set color available let f map sock color
The Pigeonhole Principle say B least two element A least two sock must mapped element B color
For example one possible mapping four sock three color shown
A f B sock red sock sock blue sock Therefore four sock enough ensure matched pair
Not surprisingly pigeonhole principle often described term pigeon n pigeon fly n pigeonhole least two pigeon must fly hole
In case pigeon form set A pigeonhole set B f describes assignment pigeon pigeonhole
Mathematicians come many ingenious application pigeonhole principle
If cookbook procedure generating argument give
Unfortunately one
One helpful tip though try solve problem pigeonhole principle key clearly identify three thing
The set A pigeon

The set B pigeonhole

The function f rule assigning pigeon pigeonhole
There number generalization pigeonhole principle
For example If k Y every function f X map least k different element X element Y
For example pick two people random surely extremely unlikely exactly number hair head
However remarkable city Boston Massachusetts actually three people exactly number hair
Of course many bald people Boston zero hair
But I talking people
Counting I Boston peole number hair person head
Let A set people Boston let B


let f map person number hair head
Since B Generalized Pigeonhole Principle implies least three people exactly number hair
I know I know exist
We asserted two different subset ninety number listed first page sum
This actually follows Pigeonhole Principle
Let A collection subset number list
Now sum subset number since number every number le
So let B set integer


let f map subset number A sum B
We proved set different subset
Therefore On hand Both quantity enormous bit greater B
This mean f least two element A element B
In word Pigeonhole Principle two different subset must sum
Notice proof give indication two set number sum
This frustrating variety argument called
Counting I How construct set n positive integer subset distinct sum
One way use power two This approach natural one suspect set must involve larger number
For example could safely replace
Remarkably example involving smaller number
Here one One top mathematicans century Paul Erd conjectured set involving significantly smaller number
More precisely conjectured largest number must Ω
He offered anyone could prove disprove conjecture problem remains unsolved

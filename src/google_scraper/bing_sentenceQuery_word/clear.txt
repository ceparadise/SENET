In hardware software component store data future request data served faster data stored cache might result earlier computation duplicate data stored elsewhere
A occurs requested data found cache occurs
Cache hit served reading data cache faster recomputing result reading slower data store thus request served cache faster system performs
To enable efficient use data cache must relatively small
Nevertheless cache proven many area computing access pattern typical exhibit
Moreover access pattern exhibit data requested recently requested already refers request data physically stored close data already requested
There inherent size speed given larger resource implies greater physical distance also tradeoff expensive premium technology v cheaper easily commodity
The provided cache benefit A larger resource incurs significant access
take hundred clock cycle modern GHz processor reach
This mitigated reading large chunk hope subsequent read nearby location
Prediction explicit might also guess future read come make request ahead time done correctly latency bypassed altogether
The use cache also allows higher underlying resource assembling multiple fine grain transfer larger efficient request
In case DRAM might served wider bus
Imagine program scanning byte address space served chip data bus individual uncached byte access would allow total used data movement would address
Reading larger chunk reduces fraction bandwidth required transmitting address information
Hardware implement cache memory temporary storage data likely used
CPUs HDDs frequently use cache web browser web server
A cache made pool entry
Each entry associated data copy data
Each entry also tag specifies identity data backing store entry copy
When cache client CPU web browser need access data presumed exist backing store first check cache
If entry found tag matching desired data data entry used instead
This situation known
So example web browser program might check local cache disk see local copy content web page particular URL
In example URL tag content web page data
The percentage access result cache hit known cache
The alternative situation cache consulted found contain data desired tag become known
The previously uncached data fetched backing store miss handling usually copied cache ready next access
During cache miss CPU usually ejects entry order make room previously uncached data
The used select entry eject known
One popular replacement policy least recently used LRU replaces least recently used entry see
More efficient cache compute use frequency size stored content well throughput cache backing store
This work well larger amount data longer latency slower throughput experienced hard drive Internet efficient use CPU cache
When system writes data cache must point write data backing store well
The timing write controlled known
There two basic writing approach A cache complex implement since need track location written mark later writing backing store
The data location written back backing store evicted cache effect referred
For reason read miss cache requires block replaced another often require two memory access service one write replaced data cache back store one retrieve needed data
Other policy may also trigger data
The client may make many change data cache explicitly notify cache write back data
No data returned write operation thus two approach situation Both policy use either policy usually paired way Entities cache may change data backing store case copy cache may become
Alternatively client update data cache copy data cache become stale
Communication protocol cache manager keep data consistent known
Small memory close operate faster much larger
Most CPUs since used one cache sometimes modern server may many six type cache level function
Examples cache specific function
Earlier GPUs often limited introduced improve
would drastically affect performance
used
Caching important leverage wider transfer texture data often little bit per pixel indexed complex pattern arbitrary
As GPUs advanced especially developed progressively larger increasingly general cache including exhibiting increasingly common functionality CPU cache
For example architecture GPUs feature cache GPU KB cache GPU KB cache GPU KB cache
These cache grown handle thread interface
similarly generalised year
Earlier design used fed modern DSPs often include similar set cache CPU
shared split
A MMU fetch page table entry main memory specialized cache used recording result translation
This specialized cache called TLB
While CPU cache generally managed entirely hardware variety software manages cache
The main memory example disk cache managed operating system
While integrated part hard disk drive sometimes misleadingly referred disk cache main function write sequencing read prefetching
Repeated cache hit relatively rare due small size buffer comparison drive capacity
However often cache hard disk drive
Finally fast local hard disk drive also cache information held even slower data storage device remote server local scheme main concept
Also fast SSDs used cache slower hard disk drive working together SSHDs
employ web cache store previous response
Web cache reduce amount information need transmitted across network information previously stored cache often
This reduces bandwidth processing requirement web server help improve user web
Web browser employ web cache ISPs organization also use caching proxy server web cache shared among user network
Another form cache file sought application stored cache accelerate transfer
Similarly decentralised equivalent exist allow community perform task traffic example Corelli
A cache store data computed demand rather retrieved backing store
technique store result within lookup table allowing subsequent call reuse stored result avoid repeated computation
The BIND daemon cache mapping domain name resolver library
operation common operating unreliable network like Ethernet LAN enormous complexity required multiple cache communication unreliable
For instance web page cache cache like typically specifically keep network protocol simple reliable
also frequently make indexed available cache
For example provides Cached link next search result
This prove useful web page temporarily permanently inaccessible
Another type caching storing computed result likely needed
For example program cache output compilation order speed later compilation run
substantially improve throughput application example processing frequently used subset data
A us networked host provide scalability reliability performance application
The host spread different geographical region
The semantics buffer cache totally different even fundamental difference intent process caching process buffering
Fundamentally caching realizes performance increase transfer data repeatedly transferred
While caching system may realize performance increase upon initial typically write transfer data item performance increase due buffering occurring within caching system
With read cache data item must fetched residing location least order subsequent read data item realize performance increase virtue able fetched cache faster intermediate storage rather data residing location
With write cache performance increase writing data item may realized upon first write data item virtue data item immediately stored cache intermediate storage deferring transfer data item residing storage later stage else occurring background process
Contrary strict buffering caching process must adhere potentially distributed cache coherency protocol order maintain consistency cache intermediate storage location data resides
Buffering hand With typical caching implementation data item read written first time effectively buffered case write mostly realizing performance increase application write originated
Additionally portion caching protocol individual writes deferred batch writes form buffering
The portion caching protocol individual read deferred batch read also form buffering although form may negatively impact performance least initial read even though may positively impact performance sum individual read
In practice caching almost always involves form buffering strict buffering involve caching
A temporary memory location traditionally used CPU directly address data stored peripheral device
Thus addressable memory used intermediate stage
Additionally buffer may feasible large block data assembled disassembled required storage device data may delivered different order produced
Also whole buffer data usually transferred sequentially example hard disk buffering sometimes increase transfer performance reduces variation jitter transfer latency opposed caching intent reduce latency
These benefit present even buffered data written read buffer
A cache also increase transfer performance
A part increase similarly come possibility multiple small transfer combine one large block
But main occurs good chance data read cache multiple time written data soon read
A cache sole purpose reduce access underlying slower storage
Cache also usually designed invisible perspective neighboring layer

The stereotype computer scientist geek memorize Star Trek line never leave lab may driving woman away field new study suggests
And woman turned physical environment say classroom office strewn object considered masculine geeky video game stuff
When people think computer science image immediately pop many mind surrounded thing computer game memorabilia junk food said lead researcher Sapna Cheryan assistant professor psychology University Washington
That stereotype appeal many woman like portrait masculinity evokes
The upshot Women feel would fit steer clear major job researcher say
Such avoidance could help explain percent graduate woman percentage steadily decreasing according data National Science Foundation
Not best career opportunity computer science missing female perspective Cheryan colleague wrote recent issue Journal Personality Social Psychology
The result come four study student studying computer science
In first experiment male female student entered small classroom either contained object stereotypically associated computer science Star Trek poster video game box Coke can item nature poster art dictionary coffee mug
The student told ignore object room shared another class
Then student filled questionnaire attitude toward computer science
In geeky environment woman significantly le interested men computer science gender difference classroom
Female student stereotypical environment said felt le similar major classroom geeked
In three experiment two involved student participant told imagine stereotypical object various environment
Here result There subset woman study view stereotypical object masculine geeky turned associated office classroom
That tell cultural phenomenon Cheryan told LiveScience
These object inherently masculine geeky constructed way
That mean reconstruct object importantly whole field
Cheryan added one way change lopsided field would broadening image computer science make people feel connection field

Fixed price contract bit
You propose single price accomplish work sought
Once project complete government customer pay agreed price
Your cost complete work factor much paid
Firm Fixed Price FFP contract detailed requirement price work
The price negotiated contract finalized vary even contractor need expend le resource planned
Firm fixed price contract require contractor manage cost work order make profit
If work planned required contractor may lose money contract
Fixed Price Contract Incentive Firm Target FPIF contract firm fixed price type contract compared
The fee vary depending whether contract come planned cost
These contract contain ceiling price limit government exposure cost overrun
Fixed price economic price adjustment contract fixed price contract contain provision account contingency changing cost
An example contract may contain adjustment annual salary increase
Fixed price contract lucrative cause big loss company
Computing proposed fixed price follows similar cost plus contract pricing
Study request proposal carefully determining scope work completed labor category personnel needed material procured
A conservative approach scoping work resulting higher proposed cost preferred offset risk level work taking effort money planned
However propose high price could lose contract competitive
Start computing fixed price propose creating general work breakdown structure WBS project
Using work breakdown structure estimate number needed complete phase project
Add material travel direct cost labor priced labor rate get proposed contract cost
Add fringe overhead general administrative rate appropriate cost get proposed project cost
Fee added planned cost obtain final fixed price propose
When deciding fee take careful account amount risk project going least well planned
Any risk cost overrun factored fee
If feel confident complete work proposed cost reduce fee competitive
For example contract provide mowing service base estimate amount labor required fairly accurately since amount mowing well defined
If contract develop new renewable fuel type tank risk incurring cost planned much greater
Fee rate range couple percent depending risk level
Note government competitor also computing project risk level related fee reasonable realistic computation
Here couple fixed price contract come play
When propose know fee type required request proposal
If economic adjustment allowed need propose percentage year contract
This also called escalation
Modify computed fixed price match request proposal submit winning proposal

What You Should Know Fixed Price Contracts Motivation Theories You Should Know PMP Certification Exam Basic Quality Planning Tools You Should Know WBS Outputs PMP Certification Exam What You Should Know Stakeholder Registers Related Book By For PMP Certification Exam know fixed price contract favored scope project clearly defined subject change
With type contract seller required finish work regardless final price
Therefore majority cost risk seller
There several type fixed price contract
A type contract set fixed total price defined product service provided
Fixed price contract may also incorporate financial incentive achieving exceeding selected project objective schedule delivery date cost technical performance anything quantified subsequently measured
A type fixed price contract buyer pay seller set amount defined contract regardless seller cost
A type contract buyer pay seller set amount defined contract seller earn additional amount seller meet defined performance criterion
A type contract used seller performance period span considerable period year
It fixed price contract provision allowing predefined final adjustment contract price due changing condition cost increase
The EPA clause must relate reliable financial index used adjust final price
In procurement jargon word synonymous The fee seller receives cost paid
A fixed fee remains regardless level performance contract
Fixed fee usually used contract
Incentive fee used stimulate performance schedule technical quality cost type performance
They used motivate seller deliver early reach performance quality standard
Award fee based broad set subjective criterion
They used contract
Most buyer prefer firm fixed price contract know price upfront
The buyer seller agree price work
The price remains unless scope change
All risk cost growth seller
However always best choice particularly project scope still evolving subject change
Fixed price incentive fee FPIF contract establish price ceiling build incentive fee profit cost schedule technical achievement
The term fixed price misleading
When buyer incentivizing cost performance buyer seller establish cost target target fee share ratio something similar
Cost performance target cost earns incentive fee
Cost performance target cost mean seller relinquishes target fee
When contract share ratio incentive fee first number buyer keep second number seller keep
Both number must total
A share ratio mean actual cost come buyer keep seller get remaining
Here example
Say contract target cost price ceiling target fee share ratio
In case price ceiling fixed price part
Regardless total cost buyer pay However seller delivers scope le target price seller get target fee plus amount le
However cost greater fee reduced amount
See play actual cost incentive fee would calculated follows Target cost actual cost x share ratio target fee x x Therefore total price contract would In case price came right ceiling
If actual price ceiling would stayed seller would started lose fee
The point seller hit dollar amount give back fee This concept point total assumption something started showing PMP exam year ago
It Likely one two question mention
It found FPIF contract

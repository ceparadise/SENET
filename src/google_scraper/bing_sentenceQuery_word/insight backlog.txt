My company ISV occasionally prospective customer especially life science insist sending auditor check software development process
We starting implement CEO concerned auditor would react
His concern I share extent auditor would expect see specification document software developed tested would happy incremental approach really deliver full specification
Does anyone experience respect
Is usually necessary fudge issue slightly signing user story producing retrospective specification document etc
My defense CEO far agile almost universal software development bound accept valid I know whether true
I seen discussion ISO general consensus seems agile incompatible I think really question sole motivation sure satisfy auditor
FWIW We ISO certified intention auditor problem past
Agile development method specify document method
That called chaos
When approaching agile development project start capturing requirement set user story added backlog
That backlog along documented acceptance criterion form specification
If need physical signature print sign stamp master copy
That may top many auditor though happy story help system requires password access document management system marked approved etc
During sprint story taken backlog potentially decomposed task worked
Again need record paper system action eg formally record somewhere task done even closing task eg Jira
That way build audit trail change specification work done
Finally document set procedure ensure staff aware procedure
One word warning always document never document like road lead endless audit problem
One final thought easiest path ensuring auditor happy discus plan next visit
Have process documented shown auditor explain work
If happy guide else need
The solution question change management
What important auditor decide start long project valid end project change linked decision taken right people documented
So document global plan always Agile necessary run company anyhow document decision meeting Scrum meeting good include customer representative doer
You also document acceptance criterion test suite document product released according acceptance criterion
If keep documentation date really include product owner scrum meeting representing customer part quality system fine auditor
I successfully managed stringent audit type though different vertical
We handled sensitive financial data prove auditor necessary safeguard place
As Marv Mills said auditor focused making sure following stated process
However Agile
Here good article In summary Many organization believe must use waterfall approach regulated environment say
We show case
So I would say first thing find whehter prospective customer regulated environment
If answer yes find regulation prescriptive descriptive
In prescriptive approach regulation define must done many case done
In descriptive approach regulation define must achieved largely leave question achieve regulated organization
If descriptive regulated environment take following step Map regulated activity agile development process
Insert hardening sprint certain point development synchronization point ensure software meet regulatory requirement
From I read previously auditor likely going following thing Inquire engineer Ask established actually Ask see project documentation match Agile plenty documentation easy
Although documentation Waterfall environment
You process documented wiki project documentation available grunt easily digestable
That enough auditor
I experience external auditor gained plenty experience dealing internal Business Owners fund project little experience Agile methodology practice alright u new point uncomfortable adopting new practice make tough dev team intend Agile
First thing I would I know audience case
I would try gain insight history possible
Given Agile practice software development around quite time chance customer already used
If I got know used I would show practice already follow
In case I gain insight I got know never practiced agile I directly use learning one old project
There two thing
We prepare roadmap Backlog adding timeline line item feel comfortable looking see used
And highlighted confidence level meeting date example confidence meet

Added granular requirement story even though knew likely change make feel comfortable However execution continued Agile
Presentation modified little bit though wrongly modified audience understood traditional language
I commented David Arno answer worth one
The Product Owner control backlog priority
As part story creation create acceptance criterion usually form question This reviewed product owner business sign proxy spec agreed story worked
You may want document sign change workflow tracking tool record
Agile mean abandon everything enough criterion spec
As IT auditor would expect guidance policy procedure process following describe process following prove following process
Step audit make sure documented process policy procedure sufficient mitigate risk
If step pass audit ask proof process followed
What seen Agile seems false perception documentation waste time hinders creative flow agile process
Yes true functional requirement user story acceptance criterion Definition Done provide sufficient auditing cover purpose
But requirement situation different especially compliance related
requirement like meet level security us component wo show user story Acceptance Criteria would need every story practical
Usually appear Definition Done compliance environment get fairly large
The audit question whether team process demonstrate every story Accepted Definition Done item validated
In trust environment training occasional inspection may sufficient confirm
In tighter le trustful environment checklist might necessary could attached every story

By In The product innovation process traditionally undertaken using gated model consisting series defined stage gate decision point
Such process developed deal random disorganized often chaotic approach development prevalent many major firm still challenge many small company
A typical gated model shown Figure
A structured gating process product innovation clear benefit Such system allows management select best idea project insight knowledge also reduces risk cost project failure increase chance new product success
An exciting new development field innovation management combine principle method Agile project management whose origin lie software development world method development
Recent evidence show new hybrid approach speed innovation process make flexible iterative ensures measurable output early process
A solid proven model Agile innovation manufactured product exist yet traditional model
experience however reveal practice hybrid model new physical product development also Such early experience also identify key challenge inconsistency one must aware implementation
model product development innovation An estimated percent major company adopted Europe major manufacturer use version The benefit summarized thus remains highly relevant model managing product service innovation
In last decade many company made system analyzing simplifying process streamlining deliverable removing activity
In case efficient leaner innovation process result
Lean solved challenge however Issues remain example dealing uncertainty ambiguity coping rapidly changing customer need want accommodating reality world plan often change
Experience demanded become adaptive agile accelerated
A new approach namely integrating principle method Agile project management promise deal challenge appears yield dramatic performance result
As noted recent article Indeed integrating method yield new hybrid model may exciting significant change process since introduction gating system year Why
First novel hybrid approach provides framework dealing uncertainty ambiguity accelerates process use iteration focus result via development tangible product increment measure progress
new hybrid method used Discovery ideation Launch
Second new method also major potential increasing success rate new product model requires project team interact user customer starting early stage thus getting valuable feedback early market validation
Finally rocket science
Rather fairly straightforward employ working method part stage
Moreover although usually initially deployed two technical stage namely Testing Development Figure new hybrid method used Discovery ideation Launch shown Figure Agile project management based principle see Figure Agile developed reaction major failure using dominant waterfall way managing large IT project
Waterfall focused big goal final product major feature
But requirement tend change rapidly IT project feature criterion defined project initially planned often longer valid end development cycle
Committing early feature schedule mean compromise needed late game early commitment large feature long schedule long feedback loop replanning inherent traditional product development process create inefficiency slow development In Agile development project based principle team close dialogue user customer many short iteration functional visible result interdisciplinary collaboration business development adoption change project progress
The result IT world positive particular reducing development Agile project management therefore gained ground new dominant development methodology many IT project company last five year
Figure show result achieved Agile HP survey IT product developer across multiple Nearly percent IT professional survey reported increased customer satisfaction percent witnessed reduced development cost shorter time market
Experience show certain IT project suited Agile others
For example largest bank Denmark Danske Bank report complex project gain Agile simpler project Danske Bank experience successful Agile project need clear project owner also project team member experienced Agile development
Developers trained initially helped Agile coach two month implementation
Performance result significant Danske Bank development time cut half using Agile
Currently bank development team using Agile project management parallel classic waterfall model model used different purpose different context
Scrum one popular version Agile indeed version often used conjunction
Scrum first identified flexible holistic product development strategy development team work unit reach common goal opposed traditional sequential approach The basic framework Scrum consists The element Scrum process illustrated Figure
There three major role framework together called The Scrum Team Most notably absence traditional project manager role
Traditionally project manager role manage project term scope cost time using project plan defined deliverable detailed budget milestone plan facilitate project meeting ensuring progress communication sometimes involved project staffing
The project management role divided somewhat differently team A handful leading begun experiment combining traditional process newer Agile method
The resulting still new initial experience lead user positive
This hybrid version Agile Scrum seems promising new innovation The benefit combining Agile based number case Denmark Sweden Germany summarized five area listed Table The provocative result flow two factor Table How much increase success rate accelerate development time still yet fully documented may vary across industry type organization
But one Danish study five manufacturing firm result extremely positive number performance metric adaptive faster response changing product requirement better team communication higher team morale important faster provides simple methodology speed innovation process make flexible iterative well ensuring measurable output process
By working sprint format speed emphasized task may vary length sprint last longer agreed team
This applies stage innovation process
The greater flexibility content inherent innovation process much uncertainty ambiguity may initially exist
The greater flexibility content inherent innovation process much uncertainty ambiguity may initially exist
That development project matter much work technical assessment done early stage product definition still totally certain development begin
In however rather definition determined part development process team move forward
Note iterative process build user focus throughout process project team build product increment test learn customer user along way every stage
Developing physical product service obviously quite different developing software notion product increment created sprint system must modified somewhat Agile
But manufacturing firm made adjustment typically define product increment deliverable tangible result work done project team
These tangible deliverable example result market research work computer generated drawing product concept detailed design drawing protocepts product version concept prototype rapid prototype early working model anything demonstrated stakeholder including customer feedback
used often technical stage Development Testing also applies early fuzzy front end stage innovation process namely Ideation discovery Concept Development Building Business Case
Figure illustrates Agile principle Scrum built earlier stage leading Development framework
The iterative spiral sprint early stage include Idea Sprint Concept Sprint followed number Development sprint
Each early stage typically made several sprint entering gate Figure
The sprint review follow sprint effect evaluate increment done individual sprint contrast gate Figure evaluation increment completed project thus far well investment decision point
Each multiple sprint Idea Concept stage last week consists number repeated action within Scrum framework
sprint detailed action illustrated Figure may executed different way important caveat best practice exist highlighted The Danish company Danfoss undertook major treatment innovation project whereby Danfoss designer developer new solution created scenario jointly user
Both group worked together user plant Here followed user treatment process imagined new digital monitoring solution might help user get job done better
This case documented Buur Matthews label method Participatory Innovation emphasize participation user early
Developing approach ideally part second idea sprint test early idea thus guide subsequent concept sprint
The Sprint Planning Meeting important plan sprint define Done referred DoD
In world physical product Done may obvious later sprint development underway le evident Done earlier stage product undefined nothing physical yet available
Here specific guide early stage An important step following sprint revisit backlog
For example Idea Backlog refined idea sprint
This Idea Backlog ultimately becomes Concept Backlog pass first gate Figure
Similarly Concept Backlog updated successive concept sprint
The ongoing refinement product backlog must transparent visible project team team member
The Product Owner manager Idea Concept Backlog decides prioritized included backlog example product feature based understanding creates value customer business
Best practice visual collaborative method utilized within include Combining Agile project method Scrum potential yield productive faster product service innovation
get product right via multiple early deal uncertainty ambiguity regarding product solution might focus project team one project thus accelerating project foster much stronger team morale
Examples early adopter new system appearing around world company successfully bring two model together hybrid approach delivers best model innovation digital solution physical product service product
These early day however
And evidence result required result evaluated term objective measure development
Moreover remain number inconsistency paradox early adopter still working especially world manufactured product outside expert help might Nonetheless early result promising sufficiently investigate Are interested learning

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I read interest answer Jeff Sutherland Scrum Q What view Business Analyst relates Scrum
Is place role skill set position spread team
A The Business Analyst responsible clarifying requirement team effort belongs partly Product Owner partly team
I usually assign Business Analysis work Product Owner backlog ready work team make sure implemented well
And list role BA Gathering requirement managing relationship stakeholder facilitating conversation Providing guidance build release much value possible early possible Helping Scrum team plan improve way working retrospective Ensuring work done team aligns wider business strategy
Does mean Business Analyst Scrum attending standup meeting
There three question asked every participant
They Notice requirement clarification part three question
The entire meeting take longer minute
In time frame question may raise issue requirement specification resolution problem would take place standup meeting BA present
The BA responsible clarifying requirement team It responsibility scrum master seek clarification BA outside daily standup meeting
It make sense include BA planning meeting individual sprint daily standup meeting
I understand analogy chicken pig applies BA scrum
As BA IS embedded scrum team attends daily standups I thought I try offer little insight personal experience
Generally speaking BAs perfect fit agile scrum project
They still useful particularly large project many team Product Owner everywhere
BAs function subordinate stand POs
In many case helpful someone close team answer question requirement good grasp intended use app customer business process
This really mean BA embedded scrum team ideal
It help far facilitating communication team requirement BA serve useful conduit help facilitate communication customer devs reluctant reach customer directly may know exactly need asked order clarify something
Generally though enough good reason morning stand meeting
The BA usually useful update team needed answering question format especially since available devs anytime course day
In case BAs asked write user story team verify user story linked agreed upon scope FLIs functional line item check functionality completed story sort sign go formal testing process
I see lot benefit BAs embedded scrum team reality reason project primarily due fact government customer simultaneously want u agile hinders ability really practice agile software development
I consider position result scrummerfall type compromise unfortunately
The chicken pig fable along entire chicken pig terminology removed
The purpose Daily Scrum Development Team review coordinate activity
That look towards completing work Sprint Backlog toward achieving Sprint Goals
One rule Daily Scrum Development Team member participate Scrum Master ensures attendee outside Development Team disrupt event
So Development Team member
The three Scrum role Product Owner Scrum Master Development Team
The Development Team consists professional work delivering potentially releasable Increment product end Sprint
Who depends organization
If Business Analysts work required meet team Definition Done part development team
However work go meeting Definition Done member Development Team
In question four role Business Analyst listed This part ongoing activity refining Product Backlog
This tied Sprint changing need various stakeholder
This really place Daily Scrum
Items added removed reordered Product Backlog continuously people empowered make decision
That likely includes Business Analysts
This part Daily Scrum Retrospectives
The Retrospective open entire Scrum Team includes Product Owner
If Business Analysts working closely Product Owner support team make sense would also likely present
This could potentially useful Daily Scrum
As observer Business Analysts bring possible delay meeting Sprint Goals completing Sprint Backlog planning future work
In event Sprint Goals risk available immediately following Daily Scrum coordinate team prioritize remaining work add value stakeholder
Although Daily Scrum timeboxed minute uncommon immediately move detailed discussion right people present following Daily Scrum
Per Scrum BAs participant Daily Scrum unless also work toward achieving Definition Done
However participation attendance different
You need evaluate BAs attend available discussion needed Daily Scrum worth time
I argue BA part scrum process
They member scrum team
Instead resource Product Owner member scrum team
The Product Owner ultimately one responsible determining go backlog order well acceptance criterion PBIs
The BA help Product Owner make decision mean part scrum team

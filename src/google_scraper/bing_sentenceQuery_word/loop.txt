So far learned basic programming command
assigning value printing way control statement executed using statement
In lesson introduce sometimes called way make computer thing similar thing
For example word document would done loop
We describe two kind Python loop lesson loop loop
A statement repeat section code long condition true
Here example Here general structure So example keep repeating loop body greater
There another kind loop Python called loop
In many situation either kind loop used one simpler another useful know use
A loop built order easily loop range number see later lesson list data
Here example loop
The general structure numerical loop Here example loop inside another loop
The statement like emergency escape loop cause immediate jump command end loop body
Here example using read line input find one say
The statement make rest loop repeat body next round usually called next iteration
Here visualized example combine

We use loop write program repeat action many time
The three kind loop Java loop loop loop
They equivalent expressive power
rewrite loop us one loop construct loop us one
The loop following form
The execution loop start evaluating Boolean expression
If condition evaluates body loop executed body executed execution go back loop condition
If loop condition evaluates skip loop body continue executing program following loop
The following loop compute sum number
It start initializing variable variable
We use variable accumulate sum number covered far variable used count number
The loop body execute value counter variable time execute body increase current value increase counter variable one
The loop following form
The difference loop loop loop condition executed execute body loop
That loop execution start executing loop body loop condition evaluated first time
If loop condition evaluates execution jump back beginning loop execute body
If hand loop body evaluates exit loop continue program following loop
The loop therefore executes body loop convenient situation
The loop must terminated semicolon
The following loop computes sum number
The loop following form
It convenient remember loop term corresponding loop achieves effect
The following program us loop compute sum number
Notice example separate initial statement loop condition statement using semicolon statement inside initial statement separated using comma
As see loop useful writing provides u mean initialize counter variable n loop condition control number time execute loop used increase counter
In example used counting loop knew advance many time would like execute loop body
This example show use loop performs computation result achieved
Diving number amount counting many time subtract
We therefore compute division subtracting long possible time perform subtraction count
When subtraction longer possible count result division value left remainder division
In previous class wrote game user get guess number time
We copying necessary code time
Using loop compact way
We use loop count number guess far
In addition use use indicate user guessed number correctly exit loop
In following program read sequence positive number input find maximal among
We use number indicate end input
In case use loop since want execute loop body least user enter least one number
The body loop contain statement include loop
The following program print multiplication table number
The main loop outer loop iterating loop responsible iterating row multiplication table
The inner loop iterating value print row corresponding multiplied number
Note use special character represents tabulator tab
When print character console automatically tabulates output producing nicer table
A number divisible
We check number prime checking divisible number
If divisible number number prime
The following program us loop iterate number check dive number
If divide use indicator variable mark prime
We use indicator variable loop condition exit loop soon find number
Since know check number prime write program print prime number
We using two nested loop
The outer loop iterate number inner loop one check whether current number prime
The program output prime number

One three basic logic structure computer
The two logic structure
In structure program asks question answer requires action performed original question asked answer action longer required
For example program written compute weekly payroll individual employee begin computing wage one employee continue performing action loop employee wage computed program move next action
Each pas loop called
Loops constitute one basic powerful programming concept
All logic problem programming solved forming using three logic structure combined infinite number way

In simply specifying allows code repeatedly
The syntax based heritage language prior programming language borrowed programming language descendant offshoot language originally provided iterator often use keyword name iterator descendant use descendant use
There possibility example us PERFORM VARYING
Unlike many kind often distinguished explicit loop variable
This allows body code repeatedly executed know sequencing iteration
also typically used number iteration known entering loop
shorthand way make loop number iteration known every could written
The name come English word used programming language introduce
The term English date popularized influential later direct translation earlier German used also involved defining ALGOL ALGOL
The loop body executed given value loop variable though explicit version statement list possible value increment specified
In though keyword used called otherwise identical described confused
A statement available language
Even ignoring minor difference many difference statement work level expressiveness support
Generally fall one following category The language like requires look something like Depending language explicit sign may used place language require word even numerical case
An optional increment decrement may also included although exact syntax used differs bit language
Some language require separate declaration control variable
Another form popularized
It requires part three part optional
The initialization declares perhaps assigns variable required
The type variable using multiple variable initialization part
The condition check condition quits loop false
The afterthought performed exactly every time loop end repeat
Here example traditional
This type generalisation numeric range type allows enumeration set item number sequence
It usually characterized use implicit explicit loop variable take value sequence data collection
A representative example Where either data collection support implicit iteration like list employee name may fact iterator
Some language addition another syntax notably PHP type loop name well see name
Some language offer act processing iteration keyword interpretation expression evaluated assignment made distinct explicit iteration form
For example statement following pseudocode fragment calculating new value except first reference obtain new value placed previous step
In version however calculation refers original unaltered
The difference may significant
Some language FORTRAN also offer array assignment statement enable many omitted
Thus pseudocode would set element array A zero matter size dimensionality
The example loop could rendered But whether would rendered style something else may clearly described compiler manual
Introduced followed allows iteration loop compounded test That value assigned loop variable loop body executed
If result execution stop short
Granted loop variable value defined termination loop statement find first element array value suitable variation first character string
In control iteration loop computer construct
It named us construct result variable taking range integer value orderly sequence starting end increment Loop counter change loop providing unique value individual iteration
The loop counter used decide loop terminate program flow continue next loop
A common loop counter use variable name needed would outer loop next inner loop etc
The reverse order also used programmer
This style generally agreed originated early programming variable name beginning letter implicitly declared integer type obvious choice loop counter temporarily required
The practice date back often etc
A variant convention use reduplicated letter index allows easier searching using single letter
An example code involving nested loop loop counter variable This commonly source since fundamental step iteration completely control programmer
In fact infinite loop intended type used empty expression This style used instead infinite loop avoid type conversion warning compiler
Some programmer prefer succinct form semantically equivalent verbose form
Some language may also provide supporting statement present alter iteration proceeds
Common among statement found C derivative
The break statement cause loop terminated immediately executed
The continue statement move next iteration without progress loop body current iteration
A statement also terminates break goto return statement within statement body executed
Wells Other language may similar statement otherwise provide mean alter progress example FORTRAN Some language offer facility naming various loop statement multiple nested loop doubt loop involved
Fortran example Thus trouble detected inner loop CYCLE mean skip next iteration I J
The compiler also checking END DO appropriate label position documentation aid
The programmer must still code problem correctly possible blunder blocked
Different language specify different rule value loop variable hold termination loop indeed hold becomes undefined
This permit generate code leaf value loop variable perhaps even leaf unchanged loop value held register never stored memory
Actual behaviour may even vary according compiler optimization setting Honywell compiler
In language loop variable within scope loop body attempt modify value regarded semantic error
Such modification sometimes consequence programmer error difficult identify made
However overt change likely detected compiler
Situations address loop variable passed argument make difficult check routine behavior general unknowable compiler
Some example style Fortran A common approach calculate iteration count start loop careful attention overflow integer arithmetic iteration decrement count also adjusting value double counting result
However adjustment value within loop change number iteration executed
Still another possibility code generated may employ auxiliary variable loop variable possibly held machine register whose value may may copied iteration
Again modification would affect control loop disjunction possible within loop reference value might possibly altered current value auxiliary variable held safe improper modification confusing result guaranteed
For instance within loop reference element array would likely employ auxiliary variable especially held machine register parameter routine instance reveal value would likely reference proper variable instead
It best avoid possibility
Just index variable might modified within also may bound direction
But uncertain effect
A compiler may prevent attempt may effect might even work properly though many would declare would wrong
Consider statement If approach compiling loop evaluation calculation iteration count via something like start item simple variable value somehow adjusted iteration would effect iteration count even element selected division changed
Algol allows loop loop variable iterated list range value instead single range
The following example execute loop six value A converted equivalent incrementing counter variable directly
The following illustrates technique easily translated following This translation slightly complicated language allow statement jump next iteration loop continue statement C
These statement typically implicitly increment counter equivalent since latter case counter integral part loop construct
Any translation place statement within block increment explicit counter running statement
The formal equivalence applies far computer arithmetic also follows axia mathematics particular x x
Actual computer arithmetic suffers overflow limited representation example unsigned arithmetic come zero represented unsigned
Similar problem arise size signed unsigned
Compiler writer handle like possibly producing code inspects state overflow indicator unless provision equivalent checking calculating equivalence fail counter never exceed loop never end unless mishap occurs
Given action must repeated instance five time different language written differently
The syntax nearly identical language accounting different style block termination
Fortran equivalent loop loop using keyword instead The syntax Fortran loop The following two example behave equivalently three argument language initializing counter variable incrementing iteration loop stopping five inclusive
In Fortran later may also written The step part may omitted step one
Example Spaces irrelevant Fortran statement thus
In modern Fortran style blank significant
In Fortran may avoided using statement
first formalised report
COBOL formalized late many elaboration
It us PERFORM verb many option later addition structured statement
Ignoring need declaring initialising variable equivalent would If PERFORM verb optional clause TEST AFTER resulting loop slightly different loop body executed least test
Loops sometimes called loop
Notice marker specifies name index variable must correspond name index variable start
Some language FORTRAN later allow statement label start matched compiler text corresponding statement
Fortran also allows EXIT CYCLE statement name text nest loop make clear loop intended
However language label must unique successive loop involving index variable use text label name variable index variable loop
The statement may used exit loop
Loops labeled may leave specific labeled loop group nested loop
Some dialect include statement terminate current loop iteration begin next
considered universal loop full syntax Further single iteration range could replaced list range
There several unusual aspect construct Subsequent standard allowed syntactic element replaced achieve small optimization
The compiler also incorporated Decrementing counting backwards using keyword instead The varies somewhat
The often block statement example would The publication commonly known also allows initial declaration loop
All three section loop optional
Contrary language defined class Number method two parameter end value using self start value
The statement may used exit loop
Loops labeled may leave specifically labeled loop group nested loop Maple two form one iterating range value iterating content container
The value range form follows All part except optional
The part present must come first
The remaining part appear order
Iterating container done using form loop The clause specifies container may list set sum product unevaluated function array object implementing iterator
A may terminated
In one use also non integer value The written initialises internal variable executes body long internal variable limit le increment negative end iteration increment internal variable
Before iteration value internal variable pushed onto stack
There also simple
The written repeat body exactly X time
As used use loop variable discouraged
Note Perl programming motto
The construct corresponding language called Do Mathematica Mathematica also For construct mimic language Note empty loop one command syntax error
If loop contained comment execution would result message
The imperative map expression list get iteration result list But want save space list authentic construction defined used Note original Oberon language omitted favor general Oberon loop construct
The reintroduced
You also iterate list item similar array language You may also use exit loop time
Unlike language AppleScript currently command continue next iteration loop
So code print also loop table using iterate numerically array iterate randomly dictionary
Generic making use Simple index loop Using array Using list string value The example available dialect CFML used
Simple index loop Using array Using list string value For extended see JavaScript support loop
The statement supported inside loop
Alternatively possible iterate key array
This print triangle several possible syntax including sample
See expression syntax
In implemented many way
Oftentimes directly translated compare instruction instruction
However always
In interpreted programming language simply translated
For instance take following code

This make nonprocedural language somewhat easier learn beginning get coding programming
Nonprocedural language allows programmer focus rather
This language focus much individual process needed get conclusion rather way get conclusion
This nonprocedural language often referred declarative language
The opposite nonprocedural language procedural language focus much individual process needed writing programming code
Many common type programming language considered procedural language including FORTRAN JavaScript COBOL Java
Procedural language often referred imperative language due necessity take certain step get conclusion
Most time nonprocedural language considered language
Also represented language differs language since procedural
Both regularly used programming
An example nonprocedural language structured query language SQL

program small routine
also called nonprocedural high level programming language ideally program specifies done rather
In language le difference specification program Logic
These termed nonprocedural declarative language sense programmer specifies goal accomplished specific method applied attain goal
Prolog based concept resolution akin logical deduction unification

Programming language language programmer writes instruction computer ultimately execute
The earliest programming language far removed instruction directly executed hardware
Users soon beginning invented convenient language
The early language FORTRAN Formula Translator originally much like assembly language however allowed programmer write algebraic expression instead coded instruction operation
As learning program computer became increasingly important stripped basic version FORTRAN called Beginner Symbolic Instruction Code written John Kemeny Thomas Kurtz Hanover teach novice simple programming skill
BASIC quickly spread academic institution beginning version BASIC personal computer allowed even student elementary school learn fundamental programming
At roughly time FORTRAN created COBOL Common Language developed handle record file operation necessary simple business application
The trend since toward developing increasingly abstract language allowing programmer think communicate machine level ever remote
COBOL FORTRAN descendant Pascal C known imperative language since specify sequence explicit command machine go solving problem hand different take place machine level
Other language sense programming done calling invoking function procedure section executed within program
The language type List Processing computation expressed application one Since LISP object may function well individual data item variable mathematical terminology data structure see section programmer create function appropriate level abstraction solve problem hand
This feature made LISP popular language application although somewhat superseded Programming Logic
These termed declarative language sense programmer specifies goal accomplished specific method applied attain goal
Prolog based concept resolution akin logical deduction unification similar pattern matching
Programs language written sequence goal
A recent extension logic programming constraint logic programming pattern matching replaced general operation constraint satisfaction
Again program sequence goal attained case satisfaction specified constraint
An important trend programming language support data encapsulation code
Data encapsulation best illustrated language programming done term object
An object Smalltalk similar language consists data together procedure program segment operate data
Encapsulation refers fact object data accessed method procedure provided
Programming done creating object send message one another task accomplished cooperatively others method
This influential
For example language C popular application system development largely supplanted extension
An version BASIC named available personal computer allows even novice programmer create interactive application elegant GUIs
In introduced yet another language
Applications written Java translated particular machine language intermediate language called Java Bytecode may executed computer using UNIX Macintosh Windows operating system Java interpretation program known Java virtual machine
See
Thus Java ideal creating distributed application application
The application reside server Bytecode form readily downloaded executed Java virtual machine
In many case desirable download entire application interface client may communicate interactively application
Java applet small chunk application code solve problem
Residing server may downloaded run standard provide example client interface game residing server
Concurrency refers execution one procedure time perhaps access shared data either truly simultaneously multiprocessor unpredictably interleaved manner
Languages standard application language include encapsulation feature allow programmer specify rule interaction procedure task
At still higher level abstraction lie visual programming language programmer graphically express want done mean icon represent data object process arrow represent data flow sequencing operation
As yet none visual programming language found wide commercial acceptance
On hand language much successful example language like sophisticated may easily expressed fourth generation language allow user express request data simple command
For example query Select salary payroll employee Jones written database language SQL easily understood reader
The language HyperText Markup Language allows nonprogrammers design Web page specifying structure content leaf detailed presentation extraction information client Web browser
Computer program written language machine language must either interpreted compiled
An software examines one instruction time call code execute operation required instruction
This rather slow process
A software translates computer program whole machine code saved subsequent execution whenever desired
Much work done making process compiled code efficient possible
When new language developed usually first interpreted
If language becomes popular becomes important write compiler although may task considerable difficulty
There intermediate approach compile code machine language intermediate language close enough machine language efficient close tied machine language particular computer
It use approach provides Java language independence

It focus process rather data
A program written procedural language list instruction statement tell computer task
An algorithm needed perform derived computation
When written program becomes larger divided function procedure function clearly defined purpose
A potential task may involve several step printing function accomplishes one particular section task move onto next stage
Procedural programming language include C Go Fortran Pascal BASIC
Unlike object oriented programming language break task object focus data structure programming language break task function emphasize process rather data
Every function complete access global variable tampering code corrupt data creating new function
The ability create new data type called extensibility procedural programming language extensible

Why Oversight Board place leadership ownership Modernization program business unit
Why place responsibility ITS organization

Why Oversight Board place responsibility controlling scope change business unit
Why responsibility given BSM
To ITS
To Computer Science Corporation

The second recommendation difficult assignment especially considering size IRS complexity project
How one go creating environment trust confidence teamwork Now assume given responsibility creating environment trust confidence teamwork among faculty staff user computer support department vendor
How would proceed

The problem number involves hundred people site
The IRS problem involves people site
How would answer question project large IRS

If existing system work apparently BSM needed
Why fix system work
ownership Modernization program business unit
Why place responsibility ITS organization
The IRS business unit must take control modernization program project
In particular must include defining scope project preparing realistic attainable business case controlling scope change throughout project life cycle
THE OVERSIGHT BOARD NEVER PLACED RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ITS ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THE BMS PROGRAM WAS WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE AND WAY OVER ITS BUDGET
THE BOARD FELT THAT THE ITS ORGANIZATION LACKED THE capability TRUST AND cooperation TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM
controlling scope change business unit
Why responsibility given BSM

To Computer Science Corporation
The new IRS Commissioner placed responsibility following two cause failure Mark Everson explained
The BSM developed new system work acceptance understanding support new system either existing IRS business unit form existing ITS staff

The team really understand need accomplish system

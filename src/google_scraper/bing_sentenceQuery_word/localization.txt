I read word quite lot publication I would like nice definition term make clear difference object detection v semantic segmentation v localization
It would nice could give source definition
I read lot paper Object Detection Object Recognition Object Segmentation Image Segmentation Semantic Image Segmentation conclusion could true Object Recognition In given image detect object restricted class object depend dataset Localized bounding box label bounding box label
In image see simple output state art object recognition
Object Detection like Object recognition task two class object classification mean object bounding box bounding box
For example Car detection Detect car given image bounding box
Object Segmentation Like object recognition recognize object image output show object classifying pixel image
Image Segmentation In image segmentation segment region image
output label segment region image consistent segment
Extracting super pixel image example task segmentation
Semantic Segmentation In semantic segmentation label pixel class object Car Person Dog Water Sky Road
I word Semantic Segmentation label region image
The term localization unclear
I therefore discus term object detection semantic segmentation
In object detection image pixel classified whether belongs particular class
face
In practice simplified grouping pixel together form bounding box therefore reducing problem deciding bounding box tight fit around object
As pixel belong multiple object
face eye hold multiple label time
On hand semantic segmentation involves assigning class label image pixel
While allow better localizing accuracy incorporate bounding box simplification strictly enforce single label per pixel
I believe localization mean single object classification localization using bounding box
Object detection localizing classifying instance known object class question
Semantic Segmentation basically classification
Also wrt involved metric source Precision ratio accurately identified object total number predicted object ratio true positive true positive plus false positive
Recall ratio accurately identified object total number actual object image ratio true positive true positive plus true negative
mAP simplified mean Average Precision score based product precision recall DetectNet
good combined measure sensitive network object interest well avoids false alarm
Semantic segmentation It task clustering part image together belong object class
eg detecting road sign By posting answer agree

In mean adapting different language regional difference technical requirement target locale
Internationalization process designing software application adapted various language region without engineering change
Localization process adapting internationalized software specific region language adding component translating text
Localization potentially performed multiple time different locale us infrastructure flexibility provided internationalization ideally performed integral part ongoing development
The term frequently abbreviated stand number letter first last word usage coined due length word
Some company like use term globalization combination internationalization localization
Also known globalization localization
defines Internationalization combination localization
developer task enables product used multiple script culture globalization separating user interface resource localizable format localizability abbreviated
created system called National Language Support Native Language Support NLS produce localizable software
According design aspect consider internationalizing product data encoding data documentation software construction hardware device support user interaction key design area consider making fully internationalized product scratch user interaction algorithm design data format software service documentation
typically component
This may involve encounter difference beyond straightforward translation word phrase computer program generate content dynamically
These difference may need taken account internationalization process preparation translation
Many difference regular conversion language easily automated
The provides collection difference
Its data used major including major internet company project
Examples difference include Different country different economic convention including variation In particular United States Europe differ case
Other area often follow one
Specific service might available worldwide carrier
vary across world must taken account product originally interacted people single time zone
For internationalization often used internally converted local time zone display purpose
Different country different legal requirement meaning example Localization also may take account difference In order product important look variety market product foreseeably enter
Details field length street address unique format address ability make field optional address country postal code state field country state plus introduction new registration flow adhere local law example make internationalization complex project
A broader approach take account cultural factor regarding example adaptation business process logic inclusion individual cultural behavioral aspect
Already company used large scale translation activity human translator handled making input
Both existing software designing new internationalized software first step internationalization split potentially part whether code text data separate module
Each module either rely standard independently replaced needed locale
The current prevailing practice application place text resource string loaded program execution needed
These string stored resource file relatively easy translate
Programs often built reference resource library depending selected locale data
The storage translatable translated string sometimes called message catalog string called message
The catalog generally comprises set file specific localization format standard library handle said format
One format aid
Thus get application support multiple language one would design application select relevant language resource file runtime
The code required manage data entry verification many data type also must support differing locale requirement
Modern development system operating system include sophisticated library international support type see also
Many localization issue
writing direction text sorting require profound change software text translation
For example achieves compilation switch
A globalization method includes planning three implementation step internationalization localization quality assurance
To degree
development team need include someone handle stage process enable others
Such person typically understand foreign language culture technical background
Specialized technical writer required construct culturally appropriate syntax potentially complicated concept coupled engineering resource deploy test localization element
Once properly internationalized software rely decentralized model localization usually rely volunteer sometimes organized team
The project example translated language language mostly complete
While translating existing text language may seem easy difficult maintain parallel version text throughout life product
For instance message displayed user modified translated version must changed
In commercial setting benefit localization access market
In early took year separate program code text lost market lead
However considerable cost involved go far beyond engineering
Further business operation must adapt manage production storage distribution multiple discrete localized product often sold completely different currency regulatory environment tax regime
Finally sale marketing technical support must also facilitate operation new language order support customer localized product
Particularly relatively small language population may thus never economically viable offer localized product
Even large language population could justify localization given product product internal structure already permit localization given software may lack size sophistication manage ancillary function associated operating multiple locale

Localization adaptation product service meet need particular language culture desired population

It probably make sense clarify terminology I often take granted industry confounds others around including wife rare instance I get listen
The language service industry love word end
Not sure originated quick definition term thrown around rather liberally blog post
Translation This applies fairly literal word word
This often necessity
If want make sure person Japan understands use product medical device important source text match precisely

This involved process whereby content adapted effectively convey similar meaning connotation target culture
Idiomatic expression pun marketing material generally fall category localization apply type content based business objective
The key point version often literal translation
As example want convey phrase Like father like son Chinese would read something like Tigers breed dog
Although match source content connotation target culture

This relates work required allow website software application display operate different target language
If website translated Spanish need make sure style sheet accommodate text expansion application going deployed Japan need make sure product able handle character want web user Middle East able toggle English Arabic need ensure web architecture handle Arabic font AND navigational element site functionality flip reading language
And
Outside political context process making product website accessible comprehensible people around world
It includes term described
We also love take word use strange abbreviation folk industry understand
So risk communication police come spilling bean secret code word See pattern

Fascinating right
If ever want find life party find guy work language service industry
Trust one
So mean someone wading realm multilingual communication first time
Here type content affected process
Translation impact literal content documentation legal manual etc
So functional area might technical publication compliance HR support typically billed per word

Localization affect content driving customer action
Web site marketing campaign branded content would fall category majority would fall advertising marketing business development
It billed per word hourly flat fee per project

Internationalization concern tech side house impact development software application website mobile site almost always billed hourly

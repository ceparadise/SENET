Senior project sponsorship sound investment corporation small business national laboratory R D organization
As project sponsor organization opportunity And project team member one exposed company
During classroom presentation throughout year senior capstone student introduced organization opportunity provide feedback idea project
Students Software Engineering Project course sequence work team student complete sponsored project across two semester well study software project management fall
Projects expected provide design experience reinforces student learned academic work allows creative latitude arriving final design implementation
The project begin initial project scoping phase involve initial requirement gathering sufficient allow team identify best software process model apply problem
Students make use technical design skill developed throughout undergraduate Computer Science curriculum satisfy sponsor objective
Project team design develop test document deploy system meet sponsor requirement
Proposed sponsored project embody objective course All project expected require student In return sponsor investment CS facility student staff faculty become resource sponsored team
The sponsor opportunity directly observe mentor team action solving problem learning software engineering time
Sponsoring project may seen activity interview potential future employee
Additionally CS capstone design student become familiar sponsoring organization assigned team learns company need goal successfully complete project share information entire class
Class presentation made beginning middle end semester give student opportunity practice oral presentation skill gain feedback member class may idea approach problem
This great exposure company future hiring student interaction faculty
Corporations small business national laboratory R D organization organization faculty staff member University Colorado may become project sponsor
When defining project sponsor understand purpose CS senior project curriculum provide undergraduate student software development experience carried largely team employing fundamental software engineering principle make design choice apply state art programming language technology understand software development process follow
All project concept clear purpose recognized value industry society specific functional objective yet provide significant design challenge allow student explore various design solution make design choice based sound engineering reasoning
At time project must level complexity compatible team CS senior working average hour week fall hour week spring
Within framework course project conducted basis student guided staff close collaboration sponsor
The sponsor understand primary purpose educational exploratory project quite successful
Projects customer critical path accepted senior design project unless customer take full responsibility outcome
result study likely suitable
Although goal make every project success University Colorado take responsibility result deemed customer Over course two semester team student required spend approximately working senior project
Teams required team organization chart detail responsibility individual student
Each student must assume least one type leadership position
Since team small individual student must assume multiple technical function
Each team assigned one instructional staff spends approximately advising particular project
In addition course faculty staff member spend additional hour review evaluation project
Computer Science Department faculty support senior design team question providing expertise experience student sponsor draw upon
A list faculty expertise area available upon request
Students also encouraged seek source expertise information advice industry computer science literature support project development
Teams work sponsor identify documentation material needed satisfy project goal
The form degree detail various document including requirement statement architectural detailed design test plan vary depending project process model used
Unless project agreement created based contract managed University Office Contracts Grants Intellectual Property IP right resulting supported senior design project remains inventor
student
All material software package etc
purchased support project remain property CS Department possible future use another project class
Projects must conceived scoped minimum success depend receipt software material may may available
Project description result posted openly project website
All sponsor expected active participant sponsored project
Sponsors name Technical Lead project able dedicate least one hour per week project
Close contact team early project definition phase critical project success
Frequency interaction vary according software process model used jointly scheduled sponsor team
The course instructor CC team contact
In addition participation course requires following financial commitment sponsor
Available support model follows Members group may apply Director Senior Projects donation reduction exemption
Project sponsor deadline important date include Prospective sponsor must submit Notice Intent NOI propose project June project starting fall year
Before sponsor also provide one two page written project definition well optional video project overview CS Senior Projects Director posting internal website student review
More detailed requirement developed student team assignment finalized
During first week fall semester beginning late August student familiarize proposed sponsor project idea
A Project Fair held usually first Tuesday evening September
Students come Project Fair resume ready meet project sponsor ask question find detail project interest
After Project Fair student submit list five project preference sponsor opportunity submit list student interested
The Senior Project instructional staff use student sponsor input create team assign project
Once team formed student team meet corresponding project sponsor order gain deeper understanding project sponsor goal confirm project sponsor team good match
By November signed Project Sponsor Acknowledgement signed Student Participation Agreement sponsor fee due
The first task team refine understanding project goal sponsor perform initial risk evaluation identify best software process model use frame developing software
With place team proceed identify tool technology appropriate project work sponsor identify material constitute complete project appropriate specific project according process model used
By end fall semester sponsor team shall produce written agreement scope project
The sponsor team shall also produce written agreement form document work product finished order satisfactorily complete project
Teams present project public form presentation Computer Science Expo end April
Sponsors attend Expo
Teams give six presentation class various point throughout year subject three review Project Review Board
Sponsors welcome attend meeting
In addition interaction sponsor required complete team evaluation end fall spring semester asked provide feedback fall
The feedback team informational purpose
The end semester evaluation form used basis student course grade adjusted instructor according peer evaluation instructor observation produce individual project grade

A transforms computer code written one source language another programming language target language
Compilers type support digital device primarily computer
The name primarily used program translate create program
However many different type compiler
If compiled program run computer whose different one compiler run compiler
A written language compiled
A program translates higher level one
A program translates language usually called transpiler
A language usually program translates form expression without change language
The term refers tool used create parser perform syntax analysis
A compiler likely perform many following operation conversion input program
Compilers implement operation phase promote efficient design correct transformation source input target output
Program fault caused incorrect compiler behavior difficult track work around therefore compiler implementers invest significant effort ensure
Compilers translator used transform source program
An computer software transforms executes indicated operation
The translation process influence design computer language lead preference compilation interpretation
In practice interpreter implemented compiled language compiler implemented interpreted language
Theoretical computing concept developed scientist mathematician engineer formed basis digital computing development World War II
Primitive binary language evolved digital device understand one zero circuit pattern underlying machine architecture
In late forty assembly language created offer workable abstraction computer architecture
Limited capacity early computer led substantial technical challenge first compiler designed
Therefore compilation process needed divided several small program
The front end program produce analysis product used back end program generate target code
As computer technology provided resource compiler design could align better compilation process
The human mind design better solution language move machine higher level
So development language follows naturally capability offered digital computer
language strictly defined syntax semantics form language architecture
Elements formal language include The sentence language may defined set rule called grammar
BNF describes syntax sentence language used syntax Algol
The idea derive concept linguist
BNF extension become standard tool describing syntax programming notation many case part compiler generated automatically BNF description
In designed algorithmic programming language called Plan Calculus
While actual implementation occurred presented concept later seen designed Ken Iverson late
APL language mathematical computation
language design formative year digital computing provided useful programming tool variety application Compiler technology evolved need strictly defined transformation source program target target program digital computer
The compiler could viewed front end deal analysis source code back end synthesize analysis target code
Optimization front end back end could produce efficient target code
Some early milestone development compiler technology Early operating system system software written assembly language
In early language system programming still controversial due resource limitation
Still several research industry effort began shift toward system programming language example
Basic Combined Programming Language designed University Cambridge originally developed compiler writing tool
Several compiler implemented Richards book provides insight language compiler
BCPL influential system programming language still used research also provided basis design B C language
Basic Language Implementation System Software developed Digital Equipment Corporation DEC computer
Wulf Carnegie Mellon University CMU research team
The CMU team went develop compiler one year later
Multiplexed Information Computing Service operating system project involved later led MIT
Multics written language developed IBM IBM User Group
IBM goal satisfy business scientific system programming requirement
There language could considered offered complete solution even though implemented
For first year Mulitics project subset language could compiled assembly language Early EPL compiler Doug McIlory Bob Morris Bell Labs
EPL supported project compiler full could developed
Bell Labs left Multics project Over time hope replaced frustration group effort initially failed produce economically useful system
Continued participation would drive project support cost
So researcher turned development effort
A system programming language based BCPL concept written
Ritchie created compiler B wrote Uniplexed Information Computing Service operating system Unics eventually became spelled Unix
Bell Labs started development expansion based B BCPL
The BCPL compiler transported Multics Bell Labs BCPL preferred language Bell Labs
Initially program Bell Labs B compiler used C compiler developed
In new provided resource define extension B rewrite compiler
By design C language essentially complete Unix kernel rewritten Steve Johnson started development Portable C Compiler PCC support retargeting C compiler new machine
OOP offered interesting possibility application development maintenance
OOP concept go back part language science
At Bell Labs development became interested OOP
first used system programming
The initial design leveraged C language system programming capability Simula concept
facility added
The Cfront program implemented language compiler
In subsequent year several compiler developed popularity grew
In many application domain idea using language quickly caught
Because expanding functionality supported newer increasing complexity computer architecture compiler became complex

language continued drive compiler research development
Focus area included optimization automatic code generation
Trends programming language development environment influenced compiler technology
More compiler became included language distribution PERL Java Development Kit component IDE VADS Eclipse Ada Pro
The interrelationship interdependence technology grew
The advent web service promoted growth web language scripting language
Scripts trace back early day Command Line Interfaces CLI user could enter command executed system
User Shell concept developed language write shell program
Early Windows design offered simple batch programming capability
The conventional transformation language used interpreter
While widely used Bash Batch compiler written
More recently sophisticated interpreted language became part developer tool kit
Modern scripting language include PHP Python Ruby Lua
Lua widely used game development
All interpreter compiler support
When field compiling began late focus limited translation language program machine code
The compiler field increasingly intertwined discipline including computer architecture programming language formal method software engineering computer security
The Compiler Research The Next Years article noted importance language Java
Security parallel computing cited among future research target
A compiler implement formal transformation source program target program
Compiler design define end end solution tackle defined subset interface compilation tool
preprocessors assembler linkers
Design requirement include rigorously defined interface internally compiler component externally supporting toolsets
In early day approach taken compiler design directly affected complexity computer language processed experience person designing resource available
Resource limitation led need pas source code
A compiler relatively simple language written one person might single monolithic piece software
However source language grows complexity design may split number interdependent phase
Separate phase provide design improvement focus development function compilation process
Classifying compiler number pass background hardware resource limitation computer
Compiling involves performing lot work early computer enough memory contain one program work
So compiler split smaller program made pas source representation performing required analysis translation
The ability compile classically seen benefit simplifies job writing compiler compiler generally perform compilation faster
Thus partly driven resource limitation early system many early language specifically designed could compiled single pas
In case design language feature may require compiler perform one pas source
For instance consider declaration appearing line source affect translation statement appearing line
In case first pas need gather information declaration appearing statement affect actual translation happening subsequent pas
The disadvantage compiling single pas possible perform many sophisticated needed generate high quality code
It difficult count exactly many pass optimizing compiler make
For instance different phase optimization may analyse one expression many time analyse another expression
Splitting compiler small program technique used researcher interested producing provably correct compiler
Proving correctness set small program often requires le effort proving correctness larger single equivalent program
Regardless exact number phase compiler design phase assigned one three stage
The stage include front end middle end back end
This approach make possible combine front end different language back end different sharing optimization middle end
Practical example approach multiple shared optimization multiple
The front end analyzes source code build internal representation program called IR
It also manages data structure mapping symbol source code associated information location type scope
While frontend single monolithic function program commonly implemented analyzed several phase may execute sequentially concurrently
This method favored due modularity
Most commonly today frontend broken three phase also known lexing also known scanning parsing
Lexing parsing comprise syntactic analysis word syntax phrase syntax respectively simple case module lexer parser automatically generated grammar language though complex case require manual modification
The lexical grammar phrase grammar usually simplifies analysis significantly handled semantic analysis phase
The semantic analysis phase generally complex written hand partially fully automated using
These phase broken lexing scanning evaluating parsing building CST parse tree transforming AST syntax tree
In case additional phase used notably rare
The main phase front end include following The middle end performs optimization intermediate representation order improve performance quality produced machine code
The middle end contains optimization independent CPU architecture targeted
The main phase middle end include following Compiler analysis prerequisite compiler optimization tightly work together
For example crucial
The scope compiler analysis optimization vary greatly small level even whole program
Obviously compiler potentially better job using broader view
But broad view free large scope analysis optimization costly term compilation time memory space especially true interprocedural analysis optimization
Interprocedural analysis optimization common modern commercial compiler
The open source criticized long time lacking powerful interprocedural optimization changing respect
Another open source compiler full analysis optimization infrastructure used many organization research commercial purpose
Due extra time space needed compiler analysis optimization compiler skip default
Users use compilation option explicitly tell compiler optimization enabled
The back end responsible CPU architecture specific optimization The main phase back end include following branch software engineering deal trying show compiler behaves according
Techniques include developing compiler using using rigorous testing often called compiler validation existing compiler
programming language usually appear type mind either designed
However practice rarely anything language exclusively compiled exclusively interpreted although possible design language rely run time
The categorization usually reflects popular widespread implementation language instance sometimes called interpreted language C compiled one despite existence BASIC compiler C interpreter
Interpretation replace compilation completely
It hide user make gradual
Even though interpreter interpreted directly executed program needed somewhere bottom stack see
Further compiler contain interpreter optimization reason
For example expression executed compilation result inserted output program prevents recalculated time program run greatly speed final program
Modern trend toward time blur traditional categorization compiler interpreter even
Some language specification spell implementation include compilation facility example
However nothing inherent definition Common Lisp stop interpreted
Other language feature easy implement interpreter make writing compiler much harder example many scripting language allow program construct arbitrary source code runtime regular string operation execute code passing special
To implement feature compiled language program must usually shipped includes version compiler
One classification compiler generated code executes
This known A compiler one output intended directly run type computer operating system compiler run
The output designed run different platform
Cross compiler often used developing software intended support software development environment
The output compiler produce code VM may may executed platform compiler produced
For reason compiler usually classified native cross compiler
The lower level language target compiler may
C often viewed sort portable assembler also target language compiler

original compiler used C target language
The C created compiler usually intended read maintained human
So pretty C intermediate code irrelevant
Some feature C turn good target language

C code directive generated support original source
While common compiler type output machine code many type Compiler construction taught university school part curriculum
Such course usually supplemented implementation compiler
A example compiler Wirth used teach compiler construction

There many programming language

In directly
instruction written without requiring previously program
An interpreter generally us one following strategy program execution Early version would example first type
example second example third type
Source program compiled ahead time stored machine independent code executed interpreter compiler system
Some system contemporary version may also combine two three
Interpreters various type also constructed many language traditionally associated compilation Algol Fortran Cobol
While interpretation compilation two main mean programming language implemented mutually exclusive interpreting system also perform translation work like compiler
The term signify canonical implementation language interpreter compiler respectively
A ideally independent particular implementation
The first interpreted language
Lisp first implemented computer
Russell read paper realized McCarthy surprise Lisp function could implemented machine code
The result working Lisp interpreter could used run Lisp program properly evaluate Lisp expression
Programs written either directly executed kind interpreter converted compiler execute
While compiler assembler generally produce machine code directly executable computer hardware often optionally produce intermediate form called
This basically machine specific code augmented symbol table name tag make executable block module identifiable relocatable
Compiled program typically use building block function kept library object code module
A used combine library file object file application form single executable file
The object file used generate executable file thus often produced different time sometimes even different language capable generating object format
A simple interpreter written low level language
may similar machine code block implementing function high level language stored executed function entry look table point code
However interpreter written high level language typically us another approach generating walking generating executing intermediate instruction
Thus compiler interpreter generally turn source code text file token may may generate parse tree may generate immediate instruction mean
The basic difference compiler system including built separate linker generates program interpreter system instead action described high level program
A compiler thus make almost conversion source code semantics machine level
program changed interpreter conversion work every time statement function executed
However efficient interpreter much translation work including analysis type similar factored done first time program module function even statement run thus quite akin compiler work
However compiled program still run much faster circumstance part compiler designed optimize code may given ample time
This especially true simpler high level language without many dynamic data structure check
In traditional compilation executable output linkers file file library see picture typically relocatable run general operating system much like object code module difference relocation done dynamically run time
program loaded execution
On hand compiled linked program small typically statically allocated often hard coded memory often secondary storage operating system sense
Historically editor built
This becoming common also compiler often called although programmer prefer use editor choice run compiler linker tool manually
Historically compiler predate interpreter hardware time could support interpreter interpreted code typical batch environment time limited advantage interpretation
During programmer make frequent change source code
When using compiler time change made source code must wait compiler translate altered source file binary code file together program executed
The larger program longer wait
By contrast programmer using interpreter lot le waiting interpreter usually need translate code worked intermediate representation translate thus requiring much le time change tested
Effects evident upon saving source code reloading program
Compiled code generally le readily debugged editing compiling linking sequential process conducted proper sequence proper set command
For reason many compiler also executive aid known file program
The Make file list compiler linker command line program source code file might take simple command line menu input
Make selects third group set instruction issue command compiler linker feeding specified source code file
A convert source code binary instruction specific processor architecture thus making le portable
This conversion made developer environment binary distributed user machine executed without translation
A generate binary code user machine even different processor machine code compiled
An interpreted program distributed source code
It need translated final machine take time make program distribution independent machine architecture
However portability interpreted source code dependent target machine actually suitable interpreter
If interpreter need supplied along source overall installation process complex delivery monolithic executable since interpreter part need installed
The fact interpreted code easily read copied human concern point view
However various system exist
Delivery intermediate code bytecode similar effect obfuscation bytecode could decoded
The main disadvantage interpreter interpreted program typically run slower
The difference speed could tiny great often order magnitude sometimes
It generally take longer run program interpreter run compiled code take le time interpret total time required compile run
This especially important prototyping testing code cycle often much shorter cycle
Interpreting code slower running compiled code interpreter must analyze program time executed perform desired action whereas compiled code performs action within fixed context determined compilation
This analysis known interpretive overhead
Access variable also slower interpreter mapping identifier storage location must done repeatedly rather
There various compromise using interpreter execution speed using compiler
Some system allow interpreted compiled code call share variable
This mean routine tested debugged interpreter compiled thus benefit faster execution routine developed
Many interpreter execute source code stand convert compact internal form
Many interpreter replace single used find instruction
A interpreter interpreter achieve even higher level program compaction using rather program memory structure command token occupy perhaps bit nominally constant stored requiring bit address operand include bit offset
Many BASIC interpreter store read back tokenized internal representation
An interpreter might well use compiler interpret resulting
Example data type definition latter toy interpreter syntax tree obtained C expression shown box
Interpretation used sole method execution even though interpreter interpreted directly executed program needed somewhere bottom stack code interpreted definition machine code CPU execute
There spectrum possibility interpreting compiling depending amount analysis performed program executed
For example compiled highly compressed optimized representation Lisp source machine code therefore tied particular hardware
This compiled code interpreted bytecode interpreter written
The compiled code case machine code implemented hardware bytecode interpreter
Such compiling interpreter sometimes also called
In bytecode interpreter instruction start byte therefore bytecode interpreter instruction although may used
Some bytecodes may take multiple byte may arbitrarily complicated
necessarily ever need pas compiling phase dictate appropriate algorithmic via customized interpreter similar fashion bytecode interpreter
Threaded code interpreter similar bytecode interpreter instead byte use pointer
Each instruction word point function instruction sequence possibly followed parameter
The threaded code interpreter either loop fetching instruction calling function point fetch first instruction jump every instruction sequence end fetch jump next instruction
Unlike bytecode effective limit number different instruction available memory address space
The classic example threaded code code used system source language compiled F code bytecode interpreted
In spectrum interpreting compiling another approach transform source code optimized abstract syntax tree AST execute program following tree structure use generate native code
In approach sentence need parsed
As advantage bytecode AST keep global program structure relation statement lost bytecode representation compressed provides compact representation
Thus using AST proposed better intermediate format compiler bytecode
Also allows system perform better analysis runtime
However interpreter AST cause overhead bytecode interpreter node related syntax performing useful work le sequential representation requiring traversal pointer overhead visiting tree
Further blurring distinction interpreter bytecode interpreter compilation compilation JIT technique intermediate representation compiled native runtime
This confers efficiency running native code cost startup time increased memory use bytecode AST first compiled
complementary technique interpreter profile running program compiles frequently executed part native code
Both technique decade old appearing language
compilation gained mainstream attention amongst language implementers recent year modern implementation including JITs

By first interpreter system new version interpreter developed language
It way developed TANGLE interpreter language industrial standard
Defining computer language usually done relation abstract machine mathematical function
A language may also defined interpreter semantics host language given
The definition language define language tell reader expressiveness elegance language
It also enables interpreter interpret source code first step towards reflective interpreting
An important design dimension implementation whether feature interpreted language implemented feature interpreter host language
An example whether language implemented using closure interpreter language implemented manually data structure explicitly storing environment
The feature implemented feature host language le control programmer interpreter different behavior dealing number overflow realized arithmetic operation delegated corresponding operation host language

Much research particularly reflective interpreter conducted dialect Lisp
In general however language allows writing interpreter

Other example language
Microcode commonly used technique imposes interpreter hardware architectural level computer
As microcode layer instruction implement instruction internal sequencing many element
Microcode used well specialized processor hardware
Microcode typically resides special memory translates machine instruction data input sequence detailed operation
It separate machine instruction underlying instruction designed altered freely
It also facilitates building complex instruction reducing complexity computer circuit
Writing microcode often called microcode particular processor implementation sometimes called
More extensive microcoding allows small simple powerful architecture wider relatively simple way achieve software compatibility different product processor family

A compiler software program convert computer programming code written human programmer binary code machine code understood executed specific CPU
The act transforming machine code called compilation
When code transformed one time reach platform run process called AOT compilation
Many programming language require compiler including Before Java C computer program either compiled
Interpreted code executes instruction program without compiling machine language
The interpreted code par source code directly paired virtual machine translates code machine time execution take advantage precompiled code
usually Compiled code run faster interpreted code need work time action take place
The work already done
C use compiler
compiler combination AOT compiler interpreter
After Java program written JIT compiler turn code bytecode rather code contains instruction specific hardware platform processor
The bytecode platform independent sent run platform support Java
In sense program compiled process
Similarly C us JIT compiler part Common Language Runtime manages execution application
Each target platform JIT compiler
As long intermediate bytecode language conversion understood platform program run
AOT compilation delivers faster startup time particularly much code executes startup
However requires memory disk space
JOT compilation must target least capable possible execution platform
JIT compilation profile target platform run fly deliver improved performance
JIT generates improved code target current platform although usually take time run AOT compiled code

Computer science often difficult define
This probably due unfortunate use word computer name
As perhaps aware computer science simply study computer
Although computer play important supporting role tool discipline
Computer science study problem solution come process
Given problem computer scientist goal develop list instruction solving instance problem might arise
Algorithms finite process followed solve problem
Algorithms solution
Computer science thought study algorithm
However must careful include fact problem may solution
Although proving statement beyond scope text fact problem solved important study computer science
We fully define computer science including type problem stating computer science study solution problem well study problem solution
It also common include word describing problem solution
We say problem computable algorithm exists solving
An alternative definition computer science say computer science study problem computable study existence nonexistence algorithm
In case note word computer come
Solutions considered independent machine
Computer science pertains process also study
Abstraction allows u view problem solution way separate logical physical perspective
The basic idea familiar u common example
Consider automobile may driven school work today
As driver user car certain interaction take place order utilize car intended purpose
You get insert key start car shift brake accelerate steer order drive
From abstraction point view say seeing logical perspective automobile
You using function provided car designer purpose transporting one location another
These function sometimes also referred
On hand mechanic must repair automobile take different point view
She know drive must know detail necessary carry function take granted
She need understand engine work transmission shift gear temperature controlled
This known physical perspective detail take place The thing happens use computer
Most people use computer write document send receive email surf web play music store image play game without knowledge detail take place allow type application work
They view computer logical user perspective
Computer scientist programmer technology support staff system administrator take different view computer
They must know detail operating system work network protocol configured code various script control function
They must able control detail user simply assumes
The common point example user abstraction sometimes also called client need know detail long user aware way interface work
This interface way user communicate underlying complexity implementation
As another example abstraction consider Python module
Once import module perform computation This example
We necessarily know square root calculated know function called use
If perform import correctly assume function provide u correct result
We know someone implemented solution square root problem need know use
This sometimes referred black box view process
We simply describe interface name function needed parameter returned

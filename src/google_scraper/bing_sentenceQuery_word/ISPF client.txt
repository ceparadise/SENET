TSO ISPF two separate service run Marist mainframe
TSO allows user access mainframe submit job
ISPF provides hierarchical user interface allows access various mainframe component
If need review
You may use either terminal emulator access Marist mainframe
It matter personal preference software wish use
Remember run Windows Vista
After connecting Marist mainframe ZOS welcome screen displayed
On screen type l tso press enter
ZOS welcome screen Terminal Emulator
ZOS welcome screen Terminal Emulator
On either terminal Emulator type l tso press enter initiate log process

To type ispfinit prompt press enter
This create number configuration file run whenever start ISPF
This need done may skip step future
Simply type command ispf press enter key
This start Interactive System Productivity Facility interface TSO command
Now fully logged onto Marist system
The ISPF main menu screen consists several part

Many created product use ISPF interface
An early version called merely introduced system
Originally stood since introduced time concept later name changed
In IBM ported operating system able use either PDF editor
ISPF also run batch job
When user sign TSO start
Through menuing system provides access many useful tool application development administering operating system
Such tool include Underlying extensive set tool allow application developer create application set guideline promote consistent use ISPF function
A panel window encompass part session screen real estate

Most mainframe software vendor used ISPF function create application tool similar appearance operation ISPF
Similarly many installation write informal tool use ISPF service
ISPF service generally available programmer shop used write panel either personal use writing either compiled language interpreted language
ISPF application used perform file tailoring function customisation specially crafted member called skeleton

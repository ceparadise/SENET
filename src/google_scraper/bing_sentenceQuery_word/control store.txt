In order individual imperative evaluated
The emphasis explicit control flow distinguishes language language
Within imperative statement execution result choice made two path follow
For functional language function language construct exist achieve result usually termed control flow statement
A set statement turn generally structured addition grouping also defines
mechanism alter flow control way similar subroutine usually occur response external stimulus event occur rather execution control flow statement
At level control flow instruction usually work altering
For CPUs control flow instruction available conditional unconditional instruction also termed jump
The kind control flow statement supported different language vary categorized effect A explicit name number assigned fixed position within may referenced control flow statement appearing elsewhere source code
A label mark position within source code effect
alternative named label used language placed start line text source code
Languages use often impose constraint line number must increase value following line may require consecutive
For example BASIC In language label usually appearing start line immediately followed colon
For example C The language allowed whole number identifier label linked colon following statement variant allowed whole number
The statement combination English word pronounced accordingly basic form unconditional transfer control
Although may either upper lower case depending language usually written The effect goto statement cause next statement executed statement appearing immediately indicated label
Goto statement many computer scientist notably
The terminology varies may alternatively known routine procedure function especially return result method especially belong
In computer memory small current standard subroutine used mainly reduce program size
A piece code written used many time various place program
Today subroutine often used help make program structured isolating algorithm hiding data access method
If many programmer working one program subroutine one kind help divide work
In structured programming ordered sequencing successive command considered one basic control structure used building block program alongside iteration recursion choice
In May Böhm Jacopini published article showed program could transformed form involving choice IF THEN ELSE loop WHILE condition DO xxx possibly duplicated code addition Boolean variable flag
Later author showed choice replaced loop yet Boolean variable
That minimalism possible mean necessarily desirable computer theoretically need subtract one number another branch result negative practical computer dozen even hundred machine instruction
What Böhm Jacopini article showed program could
Other research showed control structure one entry one exit much easier understand form mainly could used anywhere statement without disrupting control flow
In word
Later development recently composable continued strategy making component program even freely composable
Some academic took purist approach result argued even instruction like middle loop bad practice needed proof thus advocated loop single exit point
This purist approach embodied language designed preferred tool teaching introductory programming academia
The direct application theorem may result additional local variable introduced structured chart may also result
The latter issue called context
Pascal affected problem according empirical study cited student programmer difficulty formulating correct solution Pascal several simple problem including writing function searching element array
A study Henry Shapiro cited Roberts found using control structure correct solution given subject subject wrote incorrect code problem allowed write return middle loop
Most programming language control structure initial keyword indicates type control structure involved
Languages divide whether control structure final keyword
Conditional expression conditional construct feature perform different computation action depending whether evaluates true false
Less common variation include compare given value specified constant take action according first constant match
There usually provision default action else otherwise taken match succeeds
Switch statement allow compiler optimization
In case may limited constant expression might extend example right implement default case matching string
Case logic also implemented functional form statement
A loop sequence statement specified may carried several time succession
The code inside loop loop shown obeyed specified number time collection item condition met
In language loop expressed using rather explicit looping construct
special case recursion easily transformed iteration
Most programming language construction repeating loop certain number time
In case counting go downwards instead upwards step size used
In example N body loop may execute I value depending programming language
In many programming language integer reliably used loop
number represented imprecisely due hardware constraint loop might repeated time depending rounding error hardware compiler version
Furthermore increment X occurs repeated addition accumulated rounding error may mean value X iteration differ quite significantly expected sequence
Most programming language construction repeating loop condition change
Some variation test condition start loop others test end
If test start body may skipped completely end body always executed least
A value change detection method used within ordinary loop trigger processing group value
Values monitored within loop change diverts program flow handling group event associated
Several programming language later special construct allow implicit looping element array member set collection
generalise loop also support us
comprehension together provide similar function Scala
General iteration construct C statement form used express sort loop others looping number collection parallel
Where specific looping construct used usually preferred general iteration construct since often make purpose expression clearer
used assure program segment loop forever exceptional condition arises error
For instance program loop forever handling event occur stopping process terminated operator
Infinite loop implemented using control flow construct
Most commonly unstructured programming jump back goto structured programming indefinite loop loop set never end either omitting condition explicitly setting true
Some language special construct infinite loop typically omitting condition indefinite loop
Examples include Ada Fortran Go Ruby
Often infinite loop unintentionally created programming error loop wherein loop condition us variable never change within loop
Sometimes within body loop desire skip remainder loop body continue next iteration loop
Some language provide statement language Perl Ruby
The effect prematurely terminate innermost loop body resume normal next iteration
If iteration last one loop effect terminate entire loop early
Some language like Perl Ruby statement restarts current iteration start
Ruby statement restarts entire loop initial iteration
When using loop search table might desirable stop searching soon required item found
Some programming language provide statement language Perl effect terminate current loop immediately transfer control statement immediately loop
The following example done support
Both feature similar comparing code snippet show difference must combined statement construct
support conditional execution code depending whether loop exited early statement using loop
For example The clause example linked statement inner statement
Both Python loop support else clause executed early exit loop occurred
Some language support breaking nested loop theory circle called break
One common use example searching table
This done either via multilevel break break level bash PHP via labeled break break continue given label Java Perl
Alternatives multilevel break include single break together state variable tested break another level exception caught level broken placing nested loop function using return effect termination entire nested loop using label goto statement
C include multilevel break usual alternative use goto implement labeled break
Python multilevel break continue proposed rejected basis added complexity worth rare legitimate use
The notion break interest give rise today called
In refined proving possible avoid adding additional variable structured programming long break loop allowed
Furthermore Kosaraju proved strict hierarchy program exists every integer exists program containing break depth rewritten program break depth le without introducing added variable
One also subroutine executing looped statement breaking nested loop subroutine
There multiple break generally implemented exception instead
In textbook us Tennent notion explain similarity break return statement
Watt note class sequencer known defined sequencer terminates execution textually enclosing command procedure encompasses break loop including break return statement
As commonly implemented however return sequencer may also carry return value whereas break sequencer implemented contemporary language usually
used express correctness loop
In practical term loop variant integer expression initial value
The variant value must decrease loop iteration must never become negative correct execution loop
Loop variant used guarantee loop terminate
A loop invariant assertion must true first loop iteration remain true iteration
This implies loop terminates correctly exit condition loop invariant satisfied
Loop invariant used monitor specific property loop successive iteration
Some programming language contain native support loop variant invariant
In case support specification
Some dialect provide extensive sublanguage describing Loops
An early example found Conversional Lisp
provides Loop macro implement sublanguage
Many programming language especially favoring dynamic style programming offer construct
These cause flow execution jump given context resume predeclared point
three common sort control construct exotic one also exist keyword
standard condition ZERODIVIDE SUBSCRIPTRANGE ENDFILE raised intercepted ON action Programmers also define use named condition
Like one statement specified many case GOTO needed decide flow control resume
Unfortunately implementation substantial overhead space time especially SUBSCRIPTRANGE many programmer tried avoid using condition
Common Syntax example Modern language specialized structured construct exception handling rely use break return
For example one write Any number variety clause used
If matching particular control percolate back subroutine call nested block matching found end main program reached point program forcibly stopped suitable error message
Via influence keyword reserved declaring exception handler language popular today like Java C
Some language like Ada use keyword introduce exception handler may even employ different keyword Ada pattern matching
A language like incorporate placeholder exception handler syntax automatically extract several piece information exception occurs
This approach exemplified construct AppleScript David Watt textbook also analyzes exception handling framework sequencer introduced article section early exit loop
Watt note abnormal situation generally exemplified arithmetic overflow failure like file found kind error detected program unit handler naturally located program unit
For example program might contain several call read file action perform file found depends meaning purpose file question program thus handling routine abnormal situation located system code
Watts note introducing status flag testing caller structured programming even return sequencer would entail result situation application code tends get cluttered test status flag programmer might forgetfully lazily omit test status flag
In fact abnormal situation represented status flag default ignored
Watt note contrast status flag testing exception opposite causing program terminate unless programmer explicitly deal exception way possibly adding explicit code ignore
Based argument Watt concludes jump sequencer escape sequencer suitable dedicated exception sequencer semantics discussed
In Object Pascal D Java C Python clause added construct
No matter control leaf code inside clause guaranteed execute
This useful writing code must relinquish expensive resource opened file database connection finished processing Since pattern fairly common C special syntax Upon leaving compiler guarantee object released effectively variable file stream abstracting side effect initializing releasing file
Python statement Ruby block argument used similar effect
All language mentioned define standard exception circumstance thrown
Users throw exception fact allows user throw catch almost type including basic type like whereas language like Java permissive
C introduced async keyword supporting direct style
also known semicoroutines allow control yielded consumer method temporarily typically using keyword
Like async keyword support programming direct style
function yield control form without thread
Coroutines implemented library programming language provides either continuation generator distinction coroutines generator practice technical detail
In spoof article Lawrence Clark suggested GOTO statement could replaced statement provides entertaining example
COMEFROM implemented one named
article Structured Programming go Statements identifies two situation covered control structure listed gave example control structure could handle situation
Despite utility construct yet found way mainstream programming language
The following proposed If omitted get loop test top
If omitted get loop test bottom
If omitted get infinite loop
Hence single construction replace several construction programming language
A possible variant allow one test within loop use see next section appears cover case better
Languages lacking construct generally emulate using equivalent idiom In loop construct represented using standard infinite loop clause middle confused statement following section
Naming loop like example optional permit leaving outer loop several nested loop
This proposed
A modified version presented
used specify event may occur within occurrence indicated using name event statement
When event occur relevant action carried control pass
This construction provides clear separation determining situation applies action taken situation
conceptually similar exception similar construct used purpose many language
The following simple example involves searching table particular item
One way attack piece software redirect flow execution program

In storage location identified paired associated contains known unknown quantity information referred
The variable name usual way stored value addition referring variable depending context
This separation name content allows name used independently exact information represents
The identifier computer value variable may thus change course
Variables programming may directly correspond concept
The latter reference physical object storage location
The value computing variable necessarily part mathematics
Variables computer programming frequently given long name make relatively descriptive use whereas variable mathematics often terse name brevity transcription manipulation
A variable storage location may referred several different identifier situation known
Assigning value variable using one identifier change value accessed identifier
replace variable symbolic name actual location data
While variable name type location often remain fixed data stored location may changed program execution
In value generally time
In variable expression keep single value entire due requirement
In imperative language behavior exhibited named symbolic constant typically contrasted normal variable
Depending programming language variable may able store specified

Alternatively datatype may associated current value allowing single variable store anything supported programming language
An identifier referencing variable used access variable order read value alter value edit variable access permission etc
For instance variable might referenced identifier variable contain number
If variable referenced identifier well using identifier value variable altered reading value using identifier yield result
If variable referenced single identifier simply called
Otherwise speak
For instance previous example name variable question another name variable
The variable describes program text variable may used describes program execution variable meaningful value
The scope variable actually property name variable extent property variable
These confused also called property program varies point source code execution see
Further may coincide variable lifetime many case tied variable lifetime
A variable name affect
important part variable
Most language define specific variable well named entity may differ within given program
The scope variable portion program code variable name meaning variable said visible
Entrance scope typically begin variable lifetime come context exit scope typically end lifetime go context
For instance variable meaningful within certain finely within block accordingly static resolution performable
Alternatively variable resolved based global binding stack depends specific control flow
Variables accessible within certain function termed
A one indefinite scope may referred anywhere program
hand runtime aspect variable
Each variable value runtime
The extent binding portion program execution time variable continues refer value memory location
A running program may enter leave given extent many time case
Unless programming language feature variable whose extent permanently outlasts scope result whereby memory allocated variable never freed since variable would used reference deallocation purpose longer accessible
However permissible variable binding extend beyond scope occurs Lisp C execution pass back variable scope variable may used
A variable whose scope begin extent said often undefined arbitrary value accessed see since yet explicitly given particular value
A variable whose extent end scope may become deemed uninitialized since value destroyed
Variables described previous two case may said
In many language error try use value variable extent
In language may yield
Such variable may however assigned new value give new extent
For space efficiency memory space needed variable may allocated variable first used freed longer needed
A variable needed scope thus beginning variable lifetime enters scope may give space unused variable
To avoid wasting space compiler often warn programmer variable declared used
It considered good programming practice make scope variable narrow feasible different part program accidentally interact modifying variable
Doing also prevents
Common technique different section program use different make individual variable private either
Many programming language employ reserved value often named indicate invalid uninitialized variable
In language variable also meaning certain kind value stored
For example variable type prohibited storing text value
In language value variable carry type
In situation exist simultaneously A variable given type undeclared assumed universal exists compile time
Values also type checked queried runtime
Typing variable also allows resolved compile time
However different polymorphism used function call referred resolve call based value type opposed supertypes variable allowed
Variables often store simple data like integer literal string programming language allow variable store value well
Such language may also enable function
These function operate like variable represent data multiple type
For example function named may determine length list
Such function may parametric polymorphic including type variable since amount element list independent element type
The function also referred variable
For instance code segment variable named given value function called
The integer give value
In language function parameter local scope
This specific variable named referred within function though course function also variable called
The specific variable allocation representation value vary widely among programming language among implementation given language
Many language implementation allocate space whose extent last single function call whose memory automatically reclaimed function return
More generally name variable bound address particular block contiguous sequence byte memory operation variable manipulate block
common variable whose value large unknown size code compiled
Such variable reference location value instead storing value allocated pool memory called
Bound variable value
A value however abstraction idea implementation value represented stored somewhere computer memory
The program must set aside memory data object since memory finite ensure memory yielded reuse object longer needed represent variable value
Objects allocated heap must object longer needed
In language runtime environment automatically reclaims object extant variable longer refer
In language program programmer must explicitly memory later free reclaim memory
Failure lead heap depleted program run risk eventual failure exhausting available memory
When variable refers created dynamically component may indirectly accessed variable
In circumstance garbage collector analogous program feature language lack garbage collector must deal case portion memory reachable variable need reclaimed
Unlike mathematical counterpart programming variable constant commonly take name

name commonly used auxiliary variable instance variable
Some naming convention enforced language level part language syntax involve format valid identifier
In almost language variable name start digit contain whitespace character
Whether punctuation mark permitted variable name varies language language many language permit variable name forbid punctuation
In programming language specific often punctuation character known prefixed appended variable identifier indicate variable type
variable name also varies language language require use certain case naming certain entity Most modern language older language
Some language reserve certain form variable name internal use many language name beginning two underscore often fall category
However beyond basic restriction imposed language naming variable largely matter style
At level variable name used exact name chosen matter computer
Thus name variable identify rest tool programmer make program easier write understand
Using poorly chosen variable name make code difficult review name name clear often encouraged
Programmers often create adhere code style guideline offer guidance naming variable impose precise naming scheme
Shorter name faster type le descriptive longer name often make program easier read purpose variable easier understand
However extreme verbosity variable name also lead le comprehensible code

Another major characteristic von Neumann architecture unit process information separate unit store information
This characteristic lead following component von Neumann architecture
Memory collection cell unique physical address
We use generic word cell rather byte number bit addressable location called memory varies one machine another
Today computer byte addressable
To fully illustrate concept memory take computer RAM example
The memory consists byte mean byte computer uniquely addressable machine bit
The cell memory numbered consecutively beginning
For example cell memory cell would addressed follows What content address
The bit pattern stored location
However content actually represents instruction value sign etc
discussed later
What important however understand bit pattern information interpreted
When referring bit byte word bit numbered right left beginning zero
The bit address numbered follows The capable performing basic arithmetic operation adding subtracting multiplying dividing two number
This unit also capable performing logical operation
The operates word natural unit data associated particular computer design
Historically word length computer number bit processed
However current Intel line processor blurred definition defining word length bit

Each bus carry three kind information address data control
An address used select memory location device data go taken
Data flow bus CPU memory Devices
The control information used manage flow address data
For example control signal typically used determine direction data flowing either CPU
The number bit transfer simultaneously
The wider bus address data bit move
Explain use cache memory
Because memory access time consuming relative speed processor many architecture provide
Cache memory small amount memory copy frequently used data stored
Before main memory access made CPU check whether data stored cache memory
another technique used speed
This technique split instruction smaller step overlapped
In personal computer component von Neumann machine reside physically printed circuit board called
The motherboard also connection attaching device bus mouse keyboard additional storage device
So mean say machine processor
The variable usually refers number bit CPU general register Two number added single instruction
It also refer width bus size addressable always
In addition refer width data always
Explain machine instruction cycle
Before looking computer let u look
The definition computer outline capability computer electronic device store retrieve process data
Therefore instruction give computer relate storing retrieving processing data
The underlying principle von Neumann machine data instruction stored memory treated alike
This mean instruction data addressable
Instructions stored contiguous memory location data manipulated stored together different part memory
To start Cycle first data loaded main memory operating system address first instruction placed onto
The process cycle includes four step The increment one one point next instruction executed control unit go address memory address register hold address next instruction specified take main memory address bus return memory buffer register via data bus
The MBR two way register temporarily hold data fetched Memory cache RAM make copy content place copy
At point contains instruction executed
Before going next step cycle must updated hold address next instruction executed current instruction completed
There instruction register responsible instruction solved CU
CU check status instruction allows execution
Because instruction stored contiguously memory adding number byte current instruction put address next instruction
Thus control unit increment
It possible may changed later instruction executed
In case instruction must get additional data memory sends address memory bus memory responds returning value location
In computer data retrieved memory may immediately participate arithmetic logical operation
Other computer simply save data returned memory register processing subsequent instruction
At end execution result instruction may saved either register memory
To execute instruction instruction register control unit determine instruction
It might instruction access data input device send data output device perform operation data value
At phase instruction decoded control signal
That logic circuitry determines operation executed
This step show computer execute instruction expressed machine language
The instruction literally built circuit
The instruction executed may potentially require additional memory access complete task
For example instruction say add content memory location register control unit must get content memory location
Once instruction decoded operand data fetched control unit ready execute instruction
Execution involves sending signal unit carry processing
In case adding number register operand sent added content register
When execution complete cycle begin
If last instruction add value content register next instruction probably say store result place memory
However next instruction might control instruction asks question result last instruction perhaps change content program counter
Hardware changed dramatically last yet von Neumann model remains basis computer today
As Alan Perlis computer scientist said Describe primary memory
RAM stand Memory
RAM memory cell usually byte directly accessed
Inherent idea able access location ability content location
That storing something else place change bit pattern cell
In addition RAM computer contain second kind memory called ROM
ROM stand Memory
The content location ROM changed
Their content permanent altered second operation
Placing bit pattern ROM called
The bit pattern burnt either time ROM manufactured time computer part assembled
RAM ROM differentiated basic property RAM ROM
This mean RAM retain bit configuration power turned ROM
Because ROM stable changed used store instruction computer need start
Frequently used software also stored ROM system read software time machine turned
Main memory usually contains ROM along RAM
Identify need persistent storage
An input device mean data program entered computer stored memory
An output device mean result sent back user
Because main memory volatile limited essential type storage device program data stored longer processed machine turned
These type storage device main memory called storage device
Because data must read written storage device also input output device

Recall executing program resides main memory instruction processed one another cycle
technique keeping multiple program main memory time program compete access CPU work
All modern operating system employ multiprogramming one degree another
An operating system must therefore perform keep track program memory memory reside
Another key operating system concept idea defined program execution
A program static set instruction
A process dynamic entity represents program executed
Through multiprogramming computer system might many active process
The operating system must manage process carefully
At point time specific instruction may next executed

The following section Single Contiguous Memory Management Partition Memory Management Paged Memory Management interest purpose
The Computer Science Guide clearly note technical detail needed
For example memory management described handled multitasking environment expected
Therefore section serve purpose illustrating memory management technique summarised rather utilised exam
Has operating system one program memory one time
This basic type memory management
The memory broken different part
Has operating system number program running time different partition
The partition base bound register
Base register Bounds register Partition selection First fit Best fit Worst fit A technique process divided page stored memory frame loaded
Frame Page The number system specifies number digit used system
The digit always begin continue one le base
For example digit base
There digit base
There digit base
The base also determines position digit mean
When one add last digit number system one carry digit position left
Numbers written using
The rightmost digit represents value multiplied base zeroth power
The digit left one represents value multiplied base first power
The next digit represents value multiplied base second power
The next digit represents value multiplied base third power
One usually familiar positional notation even aware
One instinctively inclined utilise method calculate number one A formal way defining positional notation say value represented polynomial base number system
But polynomial
A polynomial sum two algebriac term consists constant multiplied one variable raised integral power
When defining positional notation variable base number system
Thus represented polynomial follows acting base To express idea formally number number system digit represented follows represents digit th position number Look complicated
Take concrete example base
Here number exactly digit base
The formula state fifth digit last digit left multiplied base fourth power fourth digit multiplied base third power In previous calculation one assumed number base
This logical assumption generic number system base
However reason number could represent value base
In order distinguish value general notation utilised order represent number base
Therefore number found base system
In order turn turn one simply us previous calculation Therefore base equal base
One must keep mind two number equivalent value
That represent number thing
If one bag contains bean second bag contains bean bag contain exact number bean
The number system allow one represent value various way
Note base rightmost digit one position
In base rightmost digit also one position
In fact true base anything raised power zero one
Why would anyone want represent value base
It done often granted sometimes helpful understand work
For example computing technique called hashing take number scramble one way scramble number interpret different base
Other base base binary particularly important computer processing
The binary number system particularly important computing
It also helpful familiar number system power ase base octal base hexadecimal
Recall base digit base two digit base eight digit
Therefore number could represent value base le digit exist base
It however valid number base base higher
Likewise number valid number base higher simply exist us digit base lower
What digit base higher
One need assign symbol represent digit correspond decimal value beyond
In base higher one generally look towards letter digit
The letter A consequently represent number B represent C represent forth
Therefore digit base Focusing value binary octal hexadecimal represent number base one calculate example decimal equivalent octal base simply put finding
As case expanding number polynomial form adding number And converting hexadecimal number decimal Define Boolean operator AND OR NOT NAND NOR XOR
Construct truth table using operator
The gate computer sometimes referred logic gate perform one logical function
That gate accepts one input value produce single output value
Because one dealing binary information input output either corresponding signal corresponding signal
The type gate input value determine output value
A NOT gate accepts one input value produce one output value
The table right illustrates NOT gate three way Boolean expression logical diagram symbol using truth table
In representation variable represents input signal either
The variable represents output signal whose value determined value
By definition input value NOT gate output input value output
A NOT gate sometimes referred inverts input value
In Boolean expression NOT operation represented mark value begin negated
Sometimes operation shown horizontal bar value begin negated
In Boolean expression table assigned value determined applying NOT operation input value
In variable left equal sign take value expression side
The logical diagram symbol NOT gate triangle small circle called end
The input output shown line flowing gate
Sometimes line labeled though always
The truth table show possible input value NOT gate well corresponding output value
Because one input signal NOT gate signal two possibility column labelled A truth table
The column labelled show output gate inverse input
Note three representation truth table actually defines behaviour gate situation
These three notation different way representing thing example result Boolean expression always result Boolean expression always
This behaviour consistent value shown truth table
Unlike NOT gate accepts one input signal AND gate accepts two input signal
The value input signal determine output signal
If two input value AND gate output otherwise output
The AND operation Boolean algebra expressed using single dot case asterisk
Often operator assumed example often written
Because two input two possible value input four possible combination provided input AND gate
Therefore four situation occur AND operator used Boolean expression
Likewise truth table showing behaviour AND gate four row showing four possible input combination
Like AND gate two input OR gate
If two input value output value otherwise input
The Boolean algebra OR operation expressed using plus sign
The OR gate two input one two value AND gate four input combination therefore four row truth table
The XOR OR gate illustrated right
An XOR gate produce two input otherwise
Note difference XOR gate OR gate differ one input situation
When input signal OR gate produce XOR produce
Sometimes regular OR gate referred OR produce either input
The XOR produce input mixed one one
Think XOR gate saying When I say I mean one
The Boolean algebra symbol sometimes used express XOR operation
However XOR operation also expressed using operator leave exercise
Note logic diagram symbol XOR gate like symbol OR gate except extra curved line connecting input signal
The NAND NOR gate accept two input value
The NAND NOR gate essentially opposite AND OR gate respectively
That output NAND gate one took output AND gate put inverter NOT gate
There typically specific symbol used express NAND NOR gate operation Boolean algebra
Instead one rely definition express concept
That Boolean algebra expression NAND negation AND operation
Likewise Boolean algebra expression NOR negation OR operation
The logic diagram symbol NAND NOR AND OR except NAND NOR symbol inversion bubble indicate negation
Compare output column truth table AND NAND
They opposite row row
The true OR NOR gate
Six specific type gate observed
It may seem difficult task keep straight remember work
Well probably depends one think
One encouraged try memorise truth table
The processing gate described briefly general term
If one think way one produce appropriate truth table time needed
Some description term input value cause gate produce n output case produce Construct logic diagram using AND OR NOT NAND NOR XOR
A combinational circuit consists logic gate whose output determined time present combination input irrespective previous consists input variable logic gate output variable
The logic gate accept signal input generate signal example combinational circuit binary adder decimal adder decoder multiplexer half adder half subtractor etc
A logic circuit addition two number called half adder
addition process reproduced truth table

Storage instruction computer enable perform variety task sequence intermittently
The idea introduced late proposed program electronically stored format memory device instruction could modified computer determined intermediate computational result
Other engineer notably contributed idea enabled become much flexible powerful
Nevertheless engineer England built first computer shortly Americans built operational
kept single store instruction encoded modifiable instruction
This extremely critical decision meant one program could treated data another program
Zuse considered rejected possibility In computer program data memory indistinguishable
Both bit may interpreted either data program instruction fetched memory CPU
The CPU program counter hold concept computer usually credited mathematician John von Neumann
This instruction well data stored computer memory fast access critical development modern computer
Previous thinking limited symbol
This Turing concept implicit possibility machine operating modifying improving program
Turing conception known simply universal Turing machine
All modern computer essence universal Turing machine
within EDVAC memory
This computer advance upon previous machine Electronic Numerical Integrator Computer ENIAC program instruction determined wiring machine

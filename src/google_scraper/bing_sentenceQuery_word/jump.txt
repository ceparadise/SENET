A instruction cause computer begin executing different instruction sequence thus deviate default behavior executing instruction order
may also refer act switching execution different instruction sequence result executing branch instruction
A branch instruction either always result branching may may cause branching depending condition
Branch instruction used implement program loop conditionals executing particular sequence instruction certain condition satisfied
Mechanically branch instruction change PC
The program counter memory address next instruction
Therefore branch cause CPU begin fetching instruction different sequence memory cell
When branch CPU program counter set jump instruction
So next instruction becomes instruction address
Therefore flow control change
When branch CPU program counter unchanged
Therefore next instruction executed instruction branch instruction
Therefore flow control unchanged
The term used referring program high level language well program written
In branch usually take form various form encapsulate instruction sequence executed condition satisfied
Unconditional branch instruction used unconditionally jump begin execution different instruction sequence
Machine level branch instruction sometimes called instruction
Machine level jump instruction typically form latter may depending condition
Usually distinct form jump often called subroutine invokations known automatically save originating address return address stack allowing single subroutine invoked multiple location code
In CPUs earlier instruction set condition flag register
The earlier instruction may instruction
It often close branch though necessarily instruction branch
The stored condition used branch
This temporary information often stored flag register may also located elsewhere
A flag register design simple slower simple computer
In fast computer flag register place bottleneck speed instruction could otherwise operate parallel several need set flag bit particular sequence
There also machine particular instruction condition may checked jump instruction
In simple computer design comparison branch execute arithmetic use power flag register branch
In fast computer design comparison branch run faster flag register branch comparison branch access register parallelism using CPU mechanism calculation
Some early simple CPU architecture still found microcontrollers may implement conditional jump rather conditional skip next instruction operation
A conditional jump call thus implemented conditional skip unconditional jump call instruction
Depending jump instruction typically shortened form word word often along informative letter extra parameter representing condition
Sometimes detail included well range jump offset size special addressing mode used locate actual effective offset
This table list machine level branch jump instruction found several architecture VAX others set signal clear signal
ARM PIC others opposite subtractive operation
This inverted function carry flag certain instruction marked part table otherwise noted
However carry additive operation handled way architecture
To achieve high performance modern processor
They consist multiple part partially process instruction feed result next stage pipeline start working next instruction program
This design expects instruction execute particular unchanging sequence
Conditional branch instruction make impossible know sequence
So conditional branch cause stall pipeline restarted different part program
Several technique improve speed reducing stall conditional branch
Historically branch prediction took statistic used result optimize code
A programmer would compile test version program run test data
The test code counted branch actually taken
The statistic test code used compiler optimize branch released code
The optimization would arrange fastest branch direction taken would always frequently taken control flow path
To permit CPUs must designed least predictable branch timing
Some CPUs even instruction set designed branch hint compiler tell CPU branch taken
The problem software branch prediction requires complex software development process
To run software hardware moved statistic electronics
Branch predictor part processor guess outcome conditional branch
Then processor logic gamble guess beginning execute expected instruction flow
An example simple hardware branch prediction scheme assume backward branch
smaller program counter taken part loop forward branch larger program counter taken leave loop
Better branch predictor developed validated statistically running simulation variety test program
Good predictor usually count outcome previous execution branch
Faster expensive computer run faster investing better branch prediction electronics
In CPU hardware branch prediction branch hint let compiler presumably superior branch prediction override hardware simplistic branch prediction
Some logic written without branch fewer branch
It often possible use instead branch
Another technique
In approach one instruction branch always executed
Therefore computer use instruction useful work whether pipeline stall
This approach historically popular computer
In family compatible CPUs complicates multicycle CPUs pipeline faster CPUs pipeline superscalar CPUs execute instruction order

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Studying parallel algorithm CLRS old edition Chapter
Can one explain simple example pointer jumping exactly work
I really ca explain better Suppose want traverse tree
You traverse serial manner walking tree either recursively otherwise traverse parallel starting N leaf node following shortest path root
In serial case running time O n
n need visit n node n extra time spend going tree reach sibling node via parent
In parallel case best running time O n accurate O n n number thread used
You assigning leaf node thread finding shortest path root
If leaf node thread assign one leaf node thread
Because height tree n running time per thread obviously O n
This efficient closer get root node get visited
You solve issue first thread arrive parent leave breadcrumb subsequent thread drop
If elect let duplicate thread drop traverse also solve problem thread synchronization issue altering data tree

Many computer science program require two three calculus class
I wondering calculus used computer science
The CS content degree computer science tends focus algorithm operating system data structure artificial intelligence software engineering etc
Are time Calculus useful area Computer Science
We looking long answer provide explanation context
Do give answer explain answer right ideally citation
Answers include explanation may removed
I think course would need Calculus
I used bold face usually obligatory discipline Computer Science degree italic usually optional one
There may others top head
And besides one benefit Calculus course learning reason explain argument technical rigor
This valuable student usually think
This somewhat obscure calculus turn algebraic data type
For given type type context derivative type
See overview whole subject
This technical terminology let explain
You may come across tuples referred cartesian two type
We going take literally use notation b To represent tuple b type
Next may come across type either one type another known type kinda Haskell
We also going take one literally use notation b These named type value type b value type b value
These type look like normal algebraic expression fact manipulate point
In functional language common definition list given Haskell This say list either empty tuple value another list
Transforming algebraic notation get L L Where represents type one value aka unit type
By repeatedly inserting evaluate get definition L L L L L L L L L L Where meant sense repeated multiplication
This definition say list either unit tuple one item tuple two item three etc definition list
Now context context get value product type
Let give example For simple homogeneous take value get
But two different context type namely first second value tuple
So since either could write course
This differentiation come play
Let confirm another example Taking value give three different variant Depending put hole
This give u indeed derivative
There proof general
For final example let use list If take original expression list L L We rearrange get L On surface may seem like nonsense take taylor series result get definition derived earlier
Now differentiate get interesting result L L Thus one list become pair list
This fact make sense two list produced correspond element hole original list
Numerical Methods
There exist cumbersome calculus problem unique specific application need solution faster human practically solve without program
Someone design algorithm compute solution
Is thing separate programmer scientist
Similar robotics automation require quantifying lot human behavior
Finding solution proof often requires calculus
Utilizing advanced algorithm requires calculus co sine pi Especially calculating vector collision field meshing
Determining whether task possible risk involved possible rate success
Most security performed without calculus however many people want explanation prefer mathematical expression
The basic AI utilized without calculus however calculating advanced behavior swarm mind complex value based decision making
Visualizing health data requires calculus EKG reading
When working nearly scientific discipline requires calculus Aerospace Astrology Biology Chemistry Engineering
Many people programming go entire career without using calculus however prove invaluable willing work
For effective automation logistics visualization
By identifying specific pattern simply ignore pattern imitate pattern develop superior method together
The fact little chance ever use calculus
However virtually every scientific discipline DOES use calculus working science degree
There certain expectation university science degree supposed mean one thing know calculus
Even never use
It okay poorly calculus make sure put effort discrete mathematics
There lot programming problem discrete math come play ignorance principle embarrass front coder
Many people already provided application CS
But sometimes find Calculus least expect If know automaton pdf might worth reading
Some specific example To excellent answer I add point
In creating test case application I make use calculus predict expected running time memory size choose optimal parameter tuning data structure
This includes understanding expected rounding error etc
While statistic mentioned answer I would like specifically mention optimization algorithm based Mathematical principle include calculus
Specific industry I worked calculus required include Finance creating trading platform Insurance numerical integration insurance policy scenario compute expected policy loss Logistics optimizing consolidation transportation route Signal processing Calculus integral portion used directly CS foundation thinking summation
If work portion Knuth Concrete Mathematics section summation quickly recognize convention common calculus understanding continuous case give tool consider discrete
Many us CS study involve programming system monitor change case attempt predict future
The mathematics around system rooted differential equation linear algebra differential equation calculus
There teacher like Gibert Strang advocate moving quickly differential equation part still subset calculus
When change depends change system start unstable stable way well understood
To understand sensible linear system behaving nonlinear way either need tool calculus need problem space
And finally CS often requires reading understanding work others calculus first exposure lot shared vocabulary convention history

A speculative method traveling FTL
Related concept
The key characteristic jump drive term usually used allows instantaneously two point
A jump drive supposed make spaceship matter go one point space another point may several away single instant
Like jump drive often taken granted science fiction science fiction work talk mechanic behind jump drive
There vague indication involvement work
Jump drive used many universe space vehicle movement initially suggested novel
In character use Horst Transition travel instantaneously space flat warping associated gravity
Heinlein novel published us form jump drive kind starship
Jump drive next appears novel trilogy name Frank Herbert
The series Jerry Pournelle begun publication feature
However popularity exploded decade later series
The role playing game Game Designers Workshop first edition us something called jump drive actually kind ship using traveling jump space game term week regardless distance travelled normal space
In novel starship use make vehicle omnipresent instant repositioning ship location
Several jump needed farther triangulation require time calculate therefore journey across galaxy may take century calculate
In novel various specie described Owlein Plicans fold space allowing form jump drive
This Folding exceed certain unspecified distance without damaging structure
In fictional universe total distance per jump limited multiple jump may needed reach final destination
Jump drive often require significant power many universe require time jump drive jump thereby limiting frequency jump executed
These factor allow writer build showing character struggling reach jump point recharge drive foe reach
novel published used name ZTT Zero Temporal Transit Drive
It worth noting ZTT momentum conserved ship might spend day synchronizing relative velocity destination jumping concept first used series albeit connection FTL drive rather jump drive referred matching intrinsics
The novel Tim Parise featured kind jump drive operated altering coordinate ship object within framework causing move instantly two point
This form jump drive unusual science fiction change effected pilot interfacing directly structure universe rather machine computer
Jump drive also used Battletech series game literature
In literature drive called Drive drive
Named physicist developed equation needed drive work
The jump take second limited max distance lys
There variable amount time required jump recharge energy jumping
Recharging done solar sail developed system may recharge station
In rare case Warships ship may battery store extra power additional jump without normal recharge time
When solar sail used recharging type star determines long recharge take
Jump drive used one method FTL travel universe Lost Fleet book series Jack Campbell
The us jump drive limited key point solar system limited range
Once portal jump space opened flagship left open rest fleet follow
The technical detail jump drive never discussed except allows travel another continuum explored allows transmit simple data ship fleet
Jump drive also dangerous overload jump core catastrophic destroying ship within blast radius
If used long ship may become lost jump space due constant change physical characteristic
John Geary main character series mention cheesy zombie motion picture time entire crew become zombie remaining jump space long
Jump space may also cause side effect human including itchy skin nausea headache
There two main variant jump drive commonly portrayed computer game
The first requires ship travel specific jump point
Once point jump drive used move another jump point
In example Capsule Drive computer game ship travel jump point
Others series allow transit one jump point corresponding exit point may may allow travel opposite direction
The second variant allows ship execute jump anywhere normal space move directly location
This variant frequently subject limitation distance strong
us style jump drive
With appearance computer game many used jump drive including The film television series utilizes two different type jump drive
Many space craft featured franchise type hyperspace technology stargates employ wormhole technology used almost instantaneous travel one point another across many light year including intergalactic travel
Similar wormhole technology also explored season finale alternative Atlantis hyperdrive allowing entire city move outer edge Earth matter second
In series ancient spaceship us previously unknown type simply referred FTL character television series
The television series describes jump drive way jump hyperspace
While interstellar travel instantaneous much faster speed light
The television series utilizes jump drive known FTL Drive
The technology allows ship instantaneously jump one point space another though mechanic behind drive never explained beyond describing preparing drive spooling
The film feature eponymous ship using jump drive
Harnessing power artificial drive designed project focused beam graviton folding space allowing ship pas arrive immediately new location
The drive malfunctioned opened rift sending ship dimensional gateway hell place pure chaos
The television series us FTL drive method travel moon By opening going wormhole instantaneously arrive side No limit mentioned
It first introduced method delivery large amount data deep space
The television series employ FTL drive evade enemy missile first episode well mean travel universe

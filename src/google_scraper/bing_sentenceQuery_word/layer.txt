What abstraction layer computer science
I already read tried read wikipedia article I could understand anything
abstraction concept idea associated specific instance So computer science I think abstraction deal something
So saying Cars drive without considering specific detail Car abstraction
I know helpful wikipedia article though
Perhaps others add discussion
How would relate abstraction layer hardware
The kernel talk hardware application consider every possible hardware configuration
It would really suck require different build Microsoft Word bought new monitor ne
So kernel run different computer regardless hardware
I mean window XP kernel run almost every computer right
There magic
The kernel simply written recognize interface supported hardware
The broader range hardware supported portable kernel

I read quote book There problem computer science ca solved using another level indirection
Can someone explain
What level indirection mean
From I understood indirection fancy name using pointer value instead value
Please clarify
Indirection using something us something else broadest sense
So example using pointer value instead value fit definition one level
The pointer something value something else
Typically something larger scope This last example perhaps explains
As work something master learn abstract higher level abstraction thus new level indirection needed solve bigger problem faster offloading work new API
One potential big advantage indirection reduced coupling
It another way saying thing compartmentalized appropriately
This often help significantly testing maintainability flexibility long term
As example application need read persisted data instead specific knowledge read scattered throughout application isolate put reading data method let part application call method get data instead part app deal detail

In technique arranging complexity computer system
It work establishing level complexity person interacts system suppressing complex detail current level
The programmer work idealized interface usually well defined add additional level functionality would otherwise complex handle
For example programmer writing code involves numerical operation may interested way number represented underlying hardware
whether detail suppressed said leaving simply programmer work
In addition task sending email message across continent would extremely complex programmer start piece fiber optic cable basic hardware component
By using layer complexity created abstract away physical cable network layout presenting programmer virtual data channel task manageable
Abstraction apply control data abstraction action
The notion programming viewed way combine abstraction data code
The abstract definition used common family object different implementation behavior share meaning
The mechanism programming used define common interface
The recommendation programmer use abstraction whenever suitable order avoid duplication usually known
The requirement programming language provide suitable abstraction also called abstraction principle
Computing mostly operates independently concrete world The hardware implement interchangeable others
The software structured enable human create enormous system concentrating issue time
These architecture made specific choice abstraction
architecture inevitable complex
A central form abstraction computing language abstraction new artificial language developed express specific aspect system
help planning
processed computer
An example abstraction process generational development
Each stage used stepping stone next stage
The language abstraction continues example
Within programming language feature let programmer create new abstraction
These include
Some abstraction remain invisible operate design system
Some abstraction try limit range concept programmer need aware completely hiding abstraction turn built
The software engineer writer criticised effort claiming abstraction never completely hide detail however negate usefulness abstraction
Some abstraction designed interoperate abstraction example programming language may contain making call language
Different programming language provide different type abstraction depending intended application language
For example Analysts developed various method formally specify software system
Some known method include Specification language generally rely abstraction one kind another since specification typically defined earlier project abstract level eventual implementation
The specification language example allows definition class waterfall project remain abstract architecture specification phase project
Programming language offer control abstraction one main purpose use
Computer machine understand operation low level moving bit one location memory another location producing sum two sequence bit
Programming language allow done higher level
For example consider statement written fashion To human seems fairly simple obvious calculation
However step necessary carry evaluation return value assign value variable actually quite subtle complex
The value need converted binary representation often much complicated task one would think calculation decomposed compiler interpreter assembly instruction much le intuitive programmer operation shifting binary register left adding binary complement content one register another simply human think abstract arithmetical operation addition multiplication
Finally assigning resulting value variable labeled used later involves additional step looking variable label resultant location physical virtual memory storing binary representation memory location etc
Without control abstraction programmer would need specify step time simply wanted add multiply couple number assign result variable
Such duplication effort two serious negative consequence Structured programming involves splitting complex program task smaller piece clear interface component reduction complexity potential
In simple program may aim ensure loop single obvious exit point possible single exit point function procedure
In larger system may involve breaking complex task many different module
Consider system handle payroll ship shore office These layer produce effect isolating implementation detail one component assorted internal method others
programming embrace extends concept
Data abstraction enforces clear separation property detail implementation
The abstract property visible client code make use data data concrete implementation kept entirely private indeed change example incorporate efficiency improvement time
The idea change supposed impact client code since involve difference abstract behaviour
For example one could define called uniquely associate value may retrieved specifying corresponding key
Such lookup table may implemented various way even simple linear key value pair
As far client code concerned abstract property type case
Of course relies getting detail interface right first place since change major impact client code
As one way look interface form agreed behaviour data type client code anything spelled contract subject change without notice
In theory involves facility define object represent abstract actor perform work report change state communicate object system
The term refers hiding detail extending concept earlier programming language associate strongly data standardizing way different data type interact beginning
When abstraction proceeds operation defined enabling object different type substituted called
When proceeds opposite direction inside type class structuring simplify complex set relationship called
Various programming language offer similar facility abstraction support general strategy programming includes substitution one another similar role
Although generally supported image package may predetermine great many
This would leave minimum binding change
example feature le distinction use delegation
Individual object function abstracted flexibly better fit shared functional heritage
exemplifies another extreme relies heavily static binding turn certain flexibility problem
Although example offer alternate strategy achieving abstraction fundamentally alter need support abstract noun code programming relies ability abstract verb function noun data structure either process
Consider example sample fragment represent common farm animal level abstraction suitable model simple aspect hunger feeding
It defines class represent state animal function With definition one could create object type call method like In example class abstraction used place actual animal abstraction case generalisation
If one requires differentiated hierarchy animal differentiate say provide milk provide nothing except meat end life intermediary level abstraction probably DairyAnimal cow goat would eat food suitable giving good milk MeatAnimal pig steer would eat food give best
Such abstraction could remove need application coder specify type food could concentrate instead feeding schedule
The two class could related using stand alone programmer could define varying degree two type
These facility tend vary drastically language general achieve anything possible others
A great many operation overload data type data type effect degree inheritance mean achieve polymorphism
The class notation simply coder convenience
Decisions regarding abstract keep control coder become major concern design determining relevant relationship real world concern
In general determine appropriate abstraction one must make many small decision scope domain analysis determine system one must cooperate legacy analysis perform detailed analysis expressed within project time budget constraint design
In simple example domain barnyard live pig cow eating habit legacy constraint detailed analysis coder must flexibility feed animal available thus reason code type food class design single simple Animal class pig cow instance function
A decision differentiate DairyAnimal would change detailed analysis domain legacy analysis would entirely control programmer refer abstraction programming distinct abstraction domain legacy analysis
When discussing refers act considering le detailed safe definition observed program behavior
For instance one may observe final result program execution instead considering intermediate step execution
Abstraction defined precise model execution
Abstraction may respect property one answer question property equally well concrete abstract model
For instance wish know result evaluation mathematical expression involving integer worth need perform operation modulo familiar form abstraction
Abstractions however though necessarily
That possible get sound answer though abstraction may simply yield result
For instance may abstract student class minimal maximal age one asks whether certain person belongs class one may simply compare person age minimal maximal age age lie outside range one may safely answer person belong class one may answer I know
The level abstraction included programming language influence overall
The framework includes concept formalism
This framework allows designer programming language study abstraction characteristic design change abstraction influence language usability
Abstractions prove useful dealing computer program property computer program essentially see
As consequence automatic method deriving information behavior computer program either drop termination occasion may fail crash never yield result soundness may provide false information precision may answer I know question
Abstraction core concept
generally take place abstract version studied system
Computer science commonly present le commonly abstraction wherein level represents different model information process varying amount detail
Each level us system expression involving unique set object composition apply particular domain
Each relatively abstract higher level build relatively concrete lower level tends provide increasingly granular representation
For example gate build electronic circuit binary gate machine language binary programming language machine language application operating system programming language
Each level embodied determined level beneath making language description somewhat
Since many user database system lack familiarity computer database developer often hide complexity following level The lowest level abstraction describes system actually store data
The physical level describes complex data structure detail
The next higher level abstraction describes data database store relationship exist among data
The logical level thus describes entire database term small number relatively simple structure
Although implementation simple structure logical level may involve complex physical level structure user logical level need aware complexity
This referred
must decide information keep database use logical level abstraction
The highest level abstraction describes part entire database
Even though logical level us simpler structure complexity remains variety information stored large database
Many user database system need information instead need access part database
The view level abstraction exists simplify interaction system
The system may provide many database
The ability provide different level abstraction use
Some specifically generate design contain various level abstraction
Layered architecture partition concern application stacked group layer
It technique used designing computer software hardware communication system network component isolated layer change made one layer without affecting others

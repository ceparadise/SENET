I studying computer architecture
I would like know difference term computer architecture microarchitecture
The term popularized paper April Gene M Amdahl Gerrit A Blaauw Frederick P Brooks Jr
They say The term used describe attribute system seen programmer conceptual structure functional behavior distinct organization data flow control logical design physical implementation
According terminology probably introduced inside IBM
Today would use term describe syntax semantics interface computer including type size operand programmer visible register state memory model interrupt exception handled available instruction meaning instruction
The instruction set architecture boundary software hardware contract programmer hardware designer
The term used refer organization highest level implementation particular processor
The study microarchitecture would include topic like pipelining parallelism execution speculative execution branch prediction caching
I sure etymology
I find used early title EUROMICRO Workshop Microarchitecture Computer Systems could certainly older
Currently term typically encompasses instruction set architecture microarchitecture well broader issue like network connectivity multiprocessor

This question already answer What Architecture microarchitecture ISA processor
How relate difference
Elucidate difference example clarified
Also clarify word computer architecture processor architecture mean thing
This question marked exact duplicate existing question
There three architecture computer science relate computer hardware CPU ISA ISA instruction set architecture set instruction given cpu accordingly able understand
Let assume cpu five instruction ADD MULT WRITE LOAD OUT
Then processor five thing addition multiplication two number writing RAM Loading reading getting data instruction stored hdd RAM register outputting result onto monitor
It ISA implemented microarchitecture given cpu
If le instruction ISA need le component transistor capacitor etc
designing microarchitecture
Note You easily counteract following Snapdragon follows RISC ISA billion transistor
Then elaborate snapdragon employ core four core kryo probably based core big core need die area transistor moreover snapdragon meant processor processor designed keeping view technology VR virtual reality extra higher transistor extra performance Moreover today processor completely RISC CISC incorporate element ARM ISA true RISC ISA intel CISC true CISC ISA
All instruction ISA binary form supported accompanying associated hardware
For example intel instruction ISA binary form implement one several instruction ISA assembly language used
assembly language produce object code instruction assembler linker translates machine language executed intel cpu directly
And programming language like designed according ISA Microarchitecture particular processor
Your cpu manufacturer intel AMD designer ARM provides information instruction supported particular processor
You need worry much ISA casual programmer compiler third generation fourth gen programming language compiler act translator translate source code code written user assembly language translated machine language assembler
Note Not compiler interpreter translate language assembly
Java compiler translates java code java bytecode code JVM understands converted machine language JVM java virtual machine executed processor Moreover compiler interpreter translate language directly machine language
You need learn programming language However serious programmer professional need take consideration addition new instruction new generation processor give performance power reduction
Moreover addition new instruction given ISA particular processor support instruction new compiler made must contain instruction Binary assembly instruction depending type compiler interperter database equivalent instruction given programming language c etc
use
You make use new instruction compiler given third programming language support instruction able compile particular instruction understand
Role Any program create programming language c java follow ISA given processor
For example instruction ISA given processor output able display anything monitor Likewise instruction supposed load write something RAM able operation loading writing instruction data RAM
If program designed according particular ISA run two different processor ISA program designed cpu run intel AMD CPU incorporate ISA Note A bit program run bit processor bit processor even ISA bit processor vice versa bit program run processor cpu designer provide compatibility
Examples ISA intel CISC complex instruction set architecture ARM RISC reduced instruction set architecture Microarchitecture Microarchitecture refers set technique given ISA implemented
It includes decision choice many core choice cache type size design pipelinine stage width microcode ILP instruction level parallellism bus type PCI PCIE etc
whether execution execution cpu designer chooses execution depth execution engine whether execution external memory controller add component like GPU Northbridge chip onto silicon die chip whether northbridge memory controller As case AMD cpu compatible motherboards Northbridge chipset Amd cpu interface data transfer southbridge chip memory controller interface data transfer south bridge chipset case intel require northbridge chip built onto motherboard
It ISA implemented microarchitecture given cpu
If le instruction ISA need le component transistor capacitor etc
designing microarchitecture
Several study shown microarchitecture greater importance ISA matter much ISA cisc risc type matter well microarchitecture designed optimised
mean microarchitecture bring performance power efficiency choice type ISA
Examples microarchitecture kabylake ARM Computer Architecture It collective term includes ISA microarchitecture system design system design includes hardware component system including data processor aside CPU graphic processing unit direct memory access
It also includes memory controller data path miscellaneous thing like multiprocessing virtualization
In short computer architecture refers computer system designed technology compatible
Examples computer architecture neumann architecture Harvard Architecture Computer architecture processor architecture mean thing
When someone strictly say architecture referring last one answer someone say architecture architecture whether ignorance laziness could mean
When someone say short form could mean three judge context
For example someone talking instruction say risc cisc architecture easily see talking use word like RISC CISC instruction surely talking
And someone talking architecture saying word like ISA saying CISC RISC microarchitecture system design mixing thing becoming difficult understand sure referring computer architecture

Some definition architecture define describing capability programming model computer particular implementation
In definition computer architecture involves design design
The first documented computer architecture correspondence describing
When building computer described two patent application future project machine instruction could stored storage used data
concept
Two early important example The term architecture computer literature traced work Lyle Johnson Mohammad Usman Khan member Machine Organization department IBM main research center
Johnson opportunity write proprietary research communication time known Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
To describe level detail discussing luxuriously embellished computer noted description format instruction type hardware parameter speed enhancement level system architecture term seemed useful machine Subsequently Brooks Stretch designer started Chapter book Planning Computer System Project Stretch ed
Buchholz writing Computer architecture like architecture art determining need user structure designing meet need effectively possible within economic technological constraint
Brooks went help develop called line computer architecture became noun defining user need know
Later computer user came use term many way
The earliest computer architecture designed paper directly built final hardware form
Later computer architecture prototype physically built form TTL prototype tweaked committing final hardware form
As new computer architecture typically built tested computer architecture inside FPGA committing final hardware form
The discipline computer architecture three main subcategories There type computer architecture
The following type used bigger company like Intel count computer architecture The purpose design computer maximizes performance keeping power consumption check cost low relative amount expected performance also reliable
For many aspect considered includes instruction set design functional organization logic design implementation
The implementation involves integrated circuit design packaging power cooling
Optimization design requires familiarity compiler operating system logic design packaging
An instruction set architecture ISA interface computer software hardware also viewed programmer view machine
Computers understand Java programming language used
A processor understands instruction encoded numerical fashion usually
Software tool translate high level language instruction processor understand
Besides instruction ISA defines item computer available
memory
Instructions locate available item register index name memory addressing mode
The ISA computer usually described small instruction manual describes instruction encoded
Also may define short vaguely mnemonic name instruction
The name recognized software development tool called
An assembler computer program translates form ISA form
also widely available usually software program isolate correct malfunction binary computer program
ISAs vary quality completeness
A good ISA compromise programmer convenience easy code understand size code much code required specific action cost computer interpret instruction complexity mean space needed disassemble instruction speed computer larger disassemblers come longer disassemble time
For example ISAs like ISA subtracts one value value zero value return higher value inexpensive fast however ISAs like convenient helpful looking size ISA
Memory organization defines instruction interact memory memory interacts
During design software emulator run program written proposed instruction set
Modern emulator measure size cost speed determine particular ISA meeting goal
Computer organization help optimize product
For example software engineer need know processing power processor
They may need optimize software order gain performance lowest price
This require quite detailed analysis computer organization
For example SD card designer might need arrange card data processed fastest possible way
Computer organization also help plan selection processor particular project
Multimedia project may need rapid data access virtual machine may need fast interrupt
Sometimes certain task need additional component well
For example computer capable running virtual machine need hardware memory different virtual computer kept separated
Computer organization feature also affect power consumption processor cost
Once instruction set designed practical machine must developed
This design process called
Implementation usually considered architectural design rather hardware
Implementation broken several step For entire implementation process organized differently often referred
The exact form computer system depends constraint goal
Computer architecture usually trade standard power versus performance cost memory capacity latency amount time take information one node travel source throughput
Sometimes consideration feature size weight reliability expandability also factor
The common scheme depth power analysis figure keep power consumption low maintaining adequate performance
Modern computer performance often described IPC instruction per
This measure efficiency architecture clock frequency
Since faster rate make faster computer useful measurement
Older computer IPC count low
Simple modern processor easily reach near processor may reach three five IPC executing several instruction per clock cycle
Counting machine language instruction would misleading varying amount work different ISAs
The instruction standard measurement count ISA actual machine language instruction unit measurement usually based speed computer architecture
Many people used measure computer speed clock rate usually MHz GHz
This refers cycle per second main clock CPU
However metric somewhat misleading machine higher clock rate may necessarily greater performance
As result manufacturer moved away clock speed measure performance
Other factor influence speed mix speed available memory type order instruction program
There two main type speed latency throughput
Latency time start process completion
Throughput amount work done per unit time
guaranteed maximum response time system electronic event like disk drive finish moving data
Performance affected wide range design choice example processor usually make latency worse make throughput better
Computers control machinery usually need low interrupt latency
These computer operate environment fail operation completed specified amount time
For example brake must begin braking within predictable short time brake pedal sensed else failure brake occur
take factor account measuring time computer take run series test program
Although benchmarking show strength choose computer
Often measured machine split different measure
For example one system might handle scientific application quickly another might render video game smoothly
Furthermore designer may target add special feature product hardware software permit specific benchmark execute quickly offer similar advantage general task
Power efficiency another important measurement modern computer
A higher power efficiency often traded lower speed higher cost
The typical measurement referring power consumption computer architecture million instruction per second per watt
Modern circuit le power required per transistor number transistor per chip grows
This transistor put new chip requires power supply requires new pathway built power
However number transistor per chip starting increase slower rate
Therefore power efficiency starting become important important fitting transistor single chip
Recent processor design shown emphasis put focus power efficiency rather cramming many transistor single chip possible
In world embedded computer power efficiency long important goal next throughput latency
Increases publicly released refresh rate grown slowly past year respect vast leap power consumption reduction miniaturization demand
This led new demand longer battery life reduction size due mobile technology produced greater rate
This change focus greater refresh rate power consumption miniaturization shown significant reduction power consumption much reported Intel release dropped power consumption benchmark watt watt
Comparing processing speed increase GHz GHz seen focus research development shifting away refresh rate moving towards consuming le power taking le space

In also called sometimes abbreviated way given ISA way PCB pathed Processing unit implemented particular
A given ISA may implemented different microarchitectures implementation may vary due different goal given design due shift technology
Computer architecture combination microarchitecture instruction set

Each microarchitectural element turn represented describing interconnection used implement
Each logic gate turn represented describing connection transistor used implement particular
Machines different microarchitectures may instruction set architecture thus capable executing program
New microarchitectures circuitry solution along advance semiconductor manufacturing allows newer generation processor achieve higher performance using ISA
In principle single microarchitecture could execute several different ISAs minor change
The commonly used datapath design microarchitecture today
This technique used modern microprocessor
The pipelined architecture allows multiple instruction overlap execution much like assembly line
The pipeline includes several different stage fundamental microarchitecture design
Some stage include instruction fetch instruction decode execute write back
Some architecture include stage memory access
The design pipeline one central microarchitectural task
Execution unit also essential microarchitecture
Execution unit include ALU FPU unit branch prediction
These unit perform operation calculation processor
The choice number execution unit latency throughput central microarchitectural design task
The size latency throughput connectivity memory within system also microarchitectural decision

A considerable amount research put design avoid delay much possible
Over year central goal execute instruction parallel thus increasing effective execution speed program
These effort introduced complicated logic circuit structure
Initially technique could implemented expensive mainframe supercomputer due amount circuitry needed technique
As semiconductor manufacturing progressed technique could implemented single semiconductor chip
See
Instruction set shifted year originally simple sometimes complex various respect
In recent year type fashion
Architectures dealing include
Some label used denote class CPU architecture particularly descriptive especially CISC label many early design retroactively denoted fact significantly simpler modern RISC processor several respect
However choice may greatly affect complexity implementing high performance device
The prominent strategy used develop first RISC processor simplify instruction minimum individual semantic complexity combined high encoding regularity simplicity
Such uniform instruction easily fetched decoded executed pipelined fashion simple strategy reduce number logic level order reach high operating frequency instruction compensated higher operating frequency inherently low large register set used factor much slow memory access possible
One first powerful technique improve performance use
Early processor design would carry step one instruction moving onto next
Large portion circuitry left idle one step instance instruction decoding circuitry would idle execution
Pipelines improve performance allowing number instruction work way processor time
In basic example processor would start decode step new instruction last one waiting result
This would allow four instruction flight one time making processor look four time fast
Although one instruction take long complete still four step CPU whole retires instruction much faster
RISC make pipeline smaller much easier construct cleanly separating stage instruction process making take amount time one cycle
The processor whole operates fashion instruction coming one side result
Due reduced complexity pipelined core instruction cache could placed size die would otherwise fit core alone CISC design
This real reason RISC faster
Early design like often ran time fast CISC solution clock speed price
Pipelines mean limited RISC design
By VAX implementation heavily pipelined design slightly predating first commercial MIPS SPARC design
Most modern CPUs even embedded CPUs pipelined microcoded CPUs pipelining seen embedded processor
Large CISC machine VAX modern Pentium Athlon implemented microcode pipeline
Improvements pipelining caching two major microarchitectural advance enabled processor performance keep pace circuit technology based
It long improvement chip manufacturing allowed even circuitry placed die designer started looking way use
One common add amount
Cache simply fast memory memory accessed cycle opposed many needed talk main memory
The CPU includes cache controller automates reading writing cache data already cache simply appears whereas processor stalled cache controller read
RISC design started adding cache often KB total
This number grew time typical CPUs least KB powerful CPUs come even MB organized multiple level
Generally speaking cache mean performance due reduced stalling
Caches pipeline perfect match
Previously make much sense build pipeline could run faster access latency memory
Using cache memory instead meant pipeline could run speed cache access latency much smaller length time
This allowed operating frequency processor increase much faster rate memory
One barrier achieving higher performance parallelism stem pipeline stall flush due branch
Normally whether conditional branch taken known late pipeline conditional branch depend result coming register
From time processor instruction decoder figured encountered conditional branch instruction time deciding register value read pipeline need stalled several cycle branch taken pipeline need flushed
As clock speed increase depth pipeline increase modern processor may stage
On average every fifth instruction executed branch without intervention high amount stalling
Techniques used lessen branch penalty
Branch prediction hardware make educated guess whether particular branch taken
In reality one side branch called much often
Modern design rather complex statistical prediction system watch result past branch predict future greater accuracy
The guess allows hardware prefetch instruction without waiting register read
Speculative execution enhancement code along predicted path prefetched also executed known whether branch taken
This yield better performance guess good risk huge penalty guess bad instruction need undone
Even added complexity gate needed support concept outlined improvement semiconductor manufacturing soon allowed even logic gate used
In outline processor process part single instruction time
Computer program could executed faster multiple instruction processed simultaneously
This processor achieve replicating functional unit ALUs
The replication functional unit made possible die area processor longer stretched limit could reliably manufactured
By late superscalar design started enter market place
In modern design common find two load unit one store many instruction result store two integer math unit two floating point unit often unit sort
The instruction issue logic grows complexity reading huge list instruction memory handing different execution unit idle point
The result collected end
The addition cache reduces frequency duration stall due waiting data fetched memory hierarchy get rid stall entirely
In early design would force cache controller stall processor wait
Of course may instruction program whose data available cache point
allows ready instruction processed older instruction wait cache result make appear everything happened programmed order
This technique also used avoid operand dependency stall instruction awaiting result long latency operation operation
Register renaming refers technique used avoid unnecessary serialized execution program instruction reuse register instruction
Suppose two group instruction use
One set instruction executed first leave register set set assigned different similar register set instruction executed parallel series
Computer architect become stymied growing mismatch CPU operating frequency access time
None technique exploited parallelism ILP within one program could make long stall occurred data fetched main memory
Additionally large transistor count high operating frequency needed advanced ILP technique required power dissipation level could longer cheaply cooled
For reason newer generation computer started exploit higher level parallelism exist outside single program
This trend sometimes known
This idea originated mainframe market emphasized execution speed one transaction capacity deal massive number transaction
With application network routing serving greatly increasing last decade computer industry capacity throughput issue
One technique parallelism achieved system computer system multiple CPUs
Once reserved multiprocessor server become commonplace small business market
For large corporation large scale multiprocessor common
Even multiple CPUs appeared since
With transistor size reduction made available semiconductor technology advance appeared multiple CPUs implemented silicon chip
Initially used chip targeting embedded market simpler smaller CPUs would allow multiple instantiation fit one piece silicon
By semiconductor technology allowed dual desktop CPUs chip manufactured volume
Some design reverted simpler scalar design order fit processor one piece silicon
Another technique become popular recently
In multithreading processor fetch data slow system memory instead stalling data arrive processor switch another program program thread ready execute
Though speed particular increase overall system throughput reducing time CPU idle
Conceptually multithreading equivalent operating system level
The difference multithreaded CPU thread switch one CPU cycle instead hundred thousand CPU cycle context switch normally requires
This achieved replicating state hardware active thread
A enhancement
This technique allows superscalar CPUs execute instruction different simultaneously cycle

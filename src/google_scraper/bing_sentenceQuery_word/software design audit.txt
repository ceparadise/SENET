A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field

You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
The word design implementation used widely
But I sure I understand
Think design system process input requirement user system output user interface
Think implementation system process input design system output system
What common design computer system OS programming language DBMS
What common implementation computer system OS programming language DBMS
Thanks
I would get hung terminology
Google good definition Design search design noun plan drawing produced show look function working building garment object built made
verb decide upon look functioning building garment object typically making detailed drawing
Actual drawing sometimes exist think flowchart design I familiar typically written description
Implementation process putting decision plan effect execution
As specific question In context making question process followed beginning project requirement defined technology used resource needed organization component constructed
The next stage info step used begin constructing component
However especially Web application difference design implementation slightly change
The refers functionality application function executed backstage
The refers aesthetic decision Web app styling font image etc
The difference design implementation stem foolish idea people perpetuate approach building software like building bridge design bridge bunch construction worker implement
In reality software development design
Generally yeah understood people belong group
Some people consider requirement gathering part design others
The user interface necessarily exclusive output design phase even subscribing foolish concept
Many software platform UIs
library
The common element computer system use math move information around
That really thing common
Not project use database operating system
embedded software programmed assembly I would lump programming language considering OPs understanding subject run platform C compiler available
Some computer system even run analog system obscure specialized purpose
Not use microprocessor system older elevator controller built relay much simple computer system

In computer software processed data
Computer software includes related
Computer hardware software require neither realistically used
At lowest level consists specific individual CPU
A machine language consists group signifying processor instruction change state computer preceding state
For example instruction may change value stored particular storage location effect directly observable user
An instruction may also indirectly cause something appear display computer state change visible user
The processor carry instruction order provided unless instructed interrupted dominant core run instruction order however application software run one core default software made run many
The majority software written easier efficient programmer use closer machine language

An outline would first piece software written century planned
However neither Analytical Engine software ever created
The first theory creation computer know proposed Alan Turing essay decision problem
This eventually led creation twin academic field computer science software engineering study software creation
Computer science theoretical Turing essay example computer science software engineering focus practical concern
However prior software understand stored memory digital yet exist
The first electronic computing device instead rewired order reprogram
On virtually computer platform software grouped broad category
Based goal computer software divided Programming tool also software form program application also known use create
improve fix otherwise software
Software written one programming language many programming language existence least one implementation consists set programming tool
These tool may relatively program combined together accomplish task may form IDE combine much functionality tool
IDEs may either invoking relevant individual tool functionality new way
An IDE make easier specific task searching file particular project
Many programming language implementation provide option using individual tool IDE
Users often see thing differently programmer
People use modern general purpose computer opposed usually see three layer software performing variety task platform application user software
Computer software loaded
Once software loaded computer able software
This involves passing system software hardware ultimately receives instruction
Each instruction cause computer carry carrying altering instruction
Data movement typically one place memory another
Sometimes involves moving data memory register enable data access CPU
Moving data especially large amount costly
So sometimes avoided using pointer data instead
Computations include simple operation incrementing value variable data element
More complex computation may involve many operation data element together
Software quality important especially system software like
If software faulty buggy delete person work crash computer unexpected thing
Faults error called often discovered alpha beta testing
Software often also victim known progressive performance degradation resulting combination unseen bug
Many bug discovered eliminated debugged
However software testing every bug programmer say every program least one bug Lubarsky Law
In method software development separate testing team typically employed newer approach collectively termed developer often testing demonstrate software regularly obtain feedback
Software tested method done manually commonly automatically since amount code tested quite large
For instance extremely rigorous software testing procedure many operating system communication function
Many operation interact identify command program
This enables many people work NASA check evaluate functional system overall
Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering system operation function much easier together
The software license give user right use software licensed environment case also grant right right make copy
divided two type hand come granting recipient right modify redistribute software
Software patent like type patent theoretically supposed give inventor exclusive license piece software component piece software
Ideas useful thing software could user supposed patentable concrete implementation
actual software package implementing patent supposed patentable latter already covered copyright generally automatically
So software patent supposed cover middle area requirement concrete implementation
In country requirement claimed invention effect physical world may also part requirement software patent held since useful software effect physical world requirement may open debate
Meanwhile American copyright law applied various aspect writing software code
Software patent controversial software industry many people holding different view
One source controversy aforementioned split initial idea patent seem honored practice patent example patent AOP purported claim right programming tool implementing idea AOP howsoever implemented
Another source controversy effect innovation many distinguished expert company arguing software field software patent merely create vast additional litigation cost risk actually retard innovation
In case debate software patent outside United States argument made large American corporation patent lawyer likely primary beneficiary allowing continue allow software patent
Design implementation software varies depending complexity software
For instance design creation took much time designing developing latter much basic functionality
Software usually designed created aka IDE like simplify process software applicable
As noted different section software usually created top existing software API underlying software provides like JavaBeans
Libraries APIs categorized purpose
For instance used implementing library used designing graphical user interface GUI application like used designing
When program designed relies upon API
For instance user designing Microsoft Windows desktop application might use Windows Forms library design desktop application call APIs like close open application write additional operation need
Without APIs programmer need write APIs
Companies like provide APIs many application written using usually numerous APIs
useful creating software
Computer software special economic characteristic make design creation distribution different economic good
A person creates software called term similar meaning
More informal term programmer also exist coder although use latter word may cause confusion often used mean
A great variety software company programmer world comprise software industry
Software quite profitable industry richest person world largely due ownership significant number share Microsoft company responsible software product
software organization include
Software standard organization like develop recommended software standard software interoperate standard
Other large software company include small company often provide innovation

An overview software development process helpful determining whether process experimentation defined Code Treasury Regulations present
Software development generally involves cycle requirement specification design coding testing performance tuning product release maintenance bug fixing
Based upon result step software development activity may need repeat iterate one step
For example assume product development cycle testing phase new requirement came competitive reason incorporated product could released
Then new requirement would designed product turn could affect existing design coding software already written tested
All software development project follow development methodology whether structured informal
Some common methodology include ii Waterfall Iterative RAD Rapid Application Development SEI Software Engineering Institute ISO Extreme Programming
There general many different way given piece software designed implemented
For example one ask ten different software engineer write payroll program one would likely end ten completely different program
Software unlike tangible business component wear traditional sense tends last year longer product
For example manufacturer may build tangible product short period time replace entirely new model car TVs cell phone
However core software often tends used year decade
Software requirement often change development process
The requirement business rule specified piece software rarely ever complete beginning process often conflict
Moreover requirement often change throughout software development activity
New changing requirement may necessitate major minor redesign effort order incorporate new changed requirement
It commonplace software development work incomplete imprecise requirement changing requirement throughout life cycle software development project
As software design inherently iterative follows order incorporate new modified deleted requirement design must also change
Technology especially software technology constantly changing
Technologies new one year may become commonplace subsequent year
It important aware timeframe software development activity question technology utilized
Software developer utilize newer technology currently Internet JAVA XML Web Services grid etc
like individual learning new language may need spend time learning technology
This learning process commonplace software development
Software project fail many reason
Interestingly common reason software project fail relate business project management issue failure eliminate uncertainty concerning development improvement software question
These reason iii Incomplete changing requirement Lack user involvement Lack resource budget staff Unrealistic expectation Lack executive support Lack planning Didn need longer Lack IT management Technological illiteracy
This section provides list example software development activity common development improvement software business component The preamble final regulation state The final regulation provide detailed guidance regulatory provision applied given factual situation
Rather Treasury Department IRS concluded application provision depend specific activity claimed taxpayer qualified research nature taxpayer business industry uncertainty addressed taxpayer research
January Accordingly preliminary discussion nature uncertainty software development order
Uncertainty context software development uncertainty identified concerning functional aspect software business component
In software development development tangible business component distinction software development uncertainty resolved process experimentation software development uncertainty resolved mean
For example taxpayer may configure software application may uncertain configuration choice make
This uncertainty indicate taxpayer subsequently engaged process experimentation eliminate configuration uncertainty
The activity undertaken eliminate configuration uncertainty determinative
In addition software development uncertainty type uncertainty namely business project uncertainty
Business uncertainty could example whether potential customer react favorably new product whether product competitive
Project uncertainty could whether existing staff adequately trained use technology whether project completed within given schedule budget
Such uncertainty meet requirement

There many different category software development limited initial development software product new product application area feature extension enhancement existing product combining existing product create new product product suite creating new version existing product removing feature provide product
The fact circumstance case must taken account making determination whether taxpayer activity constitute element process experimentation Code Treasury Regulations
The following list intended provide assistance identifying category software development low risk moderate risk high risk qualified research

mean activity usually fail constitute qualified research

Modifying purchased software product access different database example mean review product program code find database reference change reference new database
These activity require reading documentation product perhaps reverse engineering purchased product extract information data item making appropriate software modification
Just work activity directed finding location software need modified generally directed resolving software development uncertainty
If vendor decides migrate existing customer purchased product onto vendor current product vendor must develop software convert customer current data vendor data structure
This involves understanding purchased product data requirement well understanding data requirement
Once requirement known may require reverse engineering activity straightforward process write software read old data convert data new data format write data new data structure file database
There generally software development uncertainty associated reading writing data converting data item one format another resolved identifying conducting process designed evaluate alternative fundamentally relies principle computer science
A software business component might also interface user via Internet browser
For example taxpayer could application run PC decide add Internet browser interface essentially application one could PC application calculate tax print tax form Internet browser interface similar application tax
Interface software development activity involve defining data transaction requirement must supported end interface may also involve reverse engineering interface
These activity generally directed defining requirement interface writing software accordingly resolving software development uncertainty identifying conducting process designed evaluate alternative fundamentally relies principle computer science
Some major release may contain feature function require software development activity generally directed resolving software development uncertainty identifying conducting process designed evaluate alternative fundamentally relies principle computer science
For example new version income tax product may contain updated income tax table modified tax form product may contain modified screen permit user choose automatically run scan
Alternatively major release may contain feature function involve software development activity directed resolving software development uncertainty process experimentation identifying conducting process designed evaluate alternative fundamentally relies principle computer science
For example new version income tax product may involve development modification data encryption algorithm protect privacy integrity electronic submission tax return new version product may involve development modification heuristic algorithm detect new incoming computer virus
For example particular software development uncertainty small screen size software must failsafe requirement develop new communication protocol may need resolved identifying conducting process designed evaluate alternative fundamentally relies principle computer science
Alternatively embedded software display information user screen caller ID name phone number displayed cell phone screen produce report time speed car going accident occurred generally involve activity directed resolving software development uncertainty identifying conducting process designed evaluate alternative fundamentally relies principle computer science
Alternatively example software utility program designed recover data hard disk even though file previously deleted disk space reused application may involve design uncertainty resolved identifying conducting process designed evaluate alternative fundamentally relies principle computer science
Alternatively changing technology upon existing product originally based may involve changing underlying architecture software order accommodate new technology
For example changing application run mainframe application run grid computing environment may involve software development uncertainty need resolved identifying conducting process designed evaluate alternative fundamentally relies principle computer science
The activity involved developing product generally include evaluating design tradeoff among hardware software component running example performance benchmark combined product measure operation per minute graphical display time data throughput
The hardware software design generally modified together order develop final business component
This process concomitantly modifying hardware software order develop product frequently entail identification conducting process designed evaluate alternative fundamentally relies principle computer science
The intent document provide guideline examining software development activity identifying category software development low risk moderate risk high risk constituting qualified research

Thus guideline aid risk analysis help focus limited audit resource ranking software development activity lowest highest risk constituting qualified research

This Code consisting imperative formulated statement personal responsibility identifies element commitment
It contains many issue professional likely face
outline fundamental ethical consideration address additional specific consideration professional conduct
Statements pertain specifically individual leadership role whether workplace volunteer capacity organization like ACM
Principles involving compliance Code given
The Code shall supplemented set Guidelines provide explanation assist member dealing various issue contained Code
It expected Guidelines changed frequently Code
The Code supplemented Guidelines intended serve basis ethical decision making conduct professional work
Secondarily may serve basis judging merit formal complaint pertaining violation professional ethical standard
It noted although computing mentioned imperative Code concerned fundamental imperative apply one conduct computing professional
These imperative expressed general form emphasize ethical principle apply computer ethic derived general ethical principle
It understood word phrase code ethic subject varying interpretation ethical principle may conflict ethical principle specific situation
Questions related ethical conflict best answered thoughtful consideration fundamental principle rather reliance detailed regulation
This principle concerning quality life people affirms obligation protect fundamental human right respect diversity culture
An essential aim computing professional minimize negative consequence computing system including threat health safety
When designing implementing system computing professional must attempt ensure product effort used socially responsible way meet social need avoid harmful effect health welfare
In addition safe social environment human includes safe natural environment
Therefore computing professional design develop system must alert make others aware potential damage local global environment
Harm mean injury negative consequence undesirable loss information loss property property damage unwanted environmental impact
This principle prohibits use computing technology way result harm following user general public employee employer
Harmful action include intentional destruction modification file program leading serious loss resource unnecessary expenditure human resource time effort required purge system computer virus
action including accomplish assigned duty may lead harm unexpectedly
In event responsible person person obligated undo mitigate negative consequence much possible
One way avoid unintentional harm carefully consider potential impact affected decision made design implementation
To minimize possibility indirectly harming others computing professional must minimize malfunction following generally accepted standard system design testing
Furthermore often necessary ass social consequence system project likelihood serious harm others
If system feature misrepresented user coworkers supervisor individual computing professional responsible resulting injury
In work environment computing professional additional obligation report sign system danger might result serious personal social damage
If one superior act curtail mitigate danger may necessary blow whistle help correct problem reduce risk
However capricious misguided reporting violation harmful
Before reporting violation relevant aspect incident must thoroughly assessed
In particular assessment risk responsibility must credible
It suggested advice sought computing professional
See regarding thorough evaluation
Honesty essential component trust
Without trust organization function effectively
The honest computing professional make deliberately false deceptive claim system system design instead provide full disclosure pertinent system limitation problem
A computer professional duty honest qualification circumstance might lead conflict interest
Membership volunteer organization ACM may time place individual situation statement action could interpreted carrying weight larger group professional
An ACM member exercise care misrepresent ACM position policy ACM ACM unit
The value equality tolerance respect others principle equal justice govern imperative
Discrimination basis race sex religion age disability national origin factor explicit violation ACM policy tolerated
Inequities different group people may result use misuse information technology
In fair society individual would equal opportunity participate benefit use computer resource regardless race sex religion age disability national origin similar factor
However ideal justify unauthorized use computer resource provide adequate basis violation ethical imperative code
Violation copyright patent trade secret term license agreement prohibited law circumstance
Even software protected violation contrary professional behavior
Copies software made proper authorization
Unauthorized duplication material must condoned
Computing professional obligated protect integrity intellectual property
Specifically one must take credit idea work even case work explicitly protected copyright patent etc
Computing communication technology enables collection exchange personal information scale unprecedented history civilization
Thus increased potential violating privacy individual group
It responsibility professional maintain privacy integrity data describing individual
This includes taking precaution ensure accuracy data well protecting unauthorized access accidental disclosure inappropriate individual
Furthermore procedure must established allow individual review record correct inaccuracy
This imperative implies necessary amount personal information collected system retention disposal period information clearly defined enforced personal information gathered specific purpose used purpose without consent individual
These principle apply electronic communication including electronic mail prohibit procedure capture monitor electronic user data including message without permission user bona fide authorization related system operation maintenance
User data observed normal duty system operation maintenance must treated strictest confidentiality except case evidence violation law organizational regulation Code
In case nature content information must disclosed proper authority
The principle honesty extends issue confidentiality information whenever one made explicit promise honor confidentiality implicitly private information directly related performance one duty becomes available
The ethical concern respect obligation confidentiality employer client user unless discharged obligation requirement law principle Code
Excellence perhaps important obligation professional
The computing professional must strive achieve quality cognizant serious negative consequence may result poor quality system
Excellence depends individual take responsibility acquiring maintaining professional competence
A professional must participate setting standard appropriate level competence strive achieve standard
Upgrading technical knowledge competence achieved several way independent study attending seminar conference course involved professional organization
ACM member must obey existing local state province national international law unless compelling ethical basis
Policies procedure organization one participates must also obeyed
But compliance must balanced recognition sometimes existing law rule may immoral inappropriate therefore must challenged
Violation law regulation may ethical law rule inadequate moral basis conflict another law judged important
If one decides violate law rule viewed unethical reason one must fully accept responsibility one action consequence
Quality professional work especially computing profession depends professional reviewing critiquing
Whenever appropriate individual member seek utilize peer review well provide critical review work others
Computer professional must strive perceptive thorough objective evaluating recommending presenting system description alternative
Computer professional position special trust therefore special responsibility provide objective credible evaluation employer client user public
When providing evaluation professional must also identify relevant conflict interest stated
As noted discussion avoiding harm sign danger system must reported opportunity responsibility resolve
See guideline detail concerning harm including reporting professional violation
Honoring one commitment matter integrity honesty
For computer professional includes ensuring system element perform intended
Also one contract work another party one obligation keep party properly informed progress toward completing work
A computing professional responsibility request change assignment feel completed defined
Only serious consideration full disclosure risk concern employer client one accept assignment
The major underlying principle obligation accept personal accountability professional work
On occasion ethical principle may take greater priority
A judgment specific assignment performed may accepted
Having clearly identified one concern reason judgment failing procure change assignment one may yet obligated contract law proceed directed
The computing professional ethical judgment final guide deciding whether proceed
Regardless decision one must accept responsibility consequence
However performing assignment one judgment relieve professional responsibility negative consequence
Computing professional responsibility share technical knowledge public encouraging understanding computing including impact computer system limitation
This imperative implies obligation counter false view related computing
Theft destruction tangible electronic property prohibited Avoid harm others
Trespassing unauthorized use computer communication system addressed imperative
Trespassing includes accessing communication network computer system account file associated system without explicit authorization
Individuals organization right restrict access system long violate discrimination principle
No one enter use another computer system software data file without permission
One must always appropriate approval using system resource including communication port file space system peripheral computer time
This section draw extensively draft IFIP Code Ethics especially section organizational ethic international concern
The ethical obligation organization tend neglected code professional conduct perhaps code written perspective individual member
This dilemma addressed stating imperative perspective organizational leader
In context leader viewed organizational member leadership educational responsibility
These imperative generally may apply organization well leader
In context organization corporation government agency employer well volunteer professional organization
Because organization kind impact public must accept responsibility society
Organizational procedure attitude oriented toward quality welfare society reduce harm member public thereby serving public interest fulfilling social responsibility
Therefore organizational leader must encourage full participation meeting social responsibility well quality performance
Organizational leader responsible ensuring computer system enhance degrade quality working life
When implementing computer system organization must consider personal professional development physical safety human dignity worker
Appropriate ergonomic standard considered system design workplace
Because computer system become tool harm well benefit organization leadership responsibility clearly define appropriate inappropriate us organizational computing resource
While number scope rule minimal fully enforced established
Current system user potential user person whose life may affected system must need assessed incorporated statement requirement
System validation ensure compliance requirement
Designing implementing system deliberately inadvertently demean individual group ethically unacceptable
Computer professional decision making position verify system designed implemented protect personal privacy enhance personal dignity
This complement imperative public understanding
Educational opportunity essential facilitate optimal participation organizational member
Opportunities must available member help improve knowledge skill computing including course familiarize consequence limitation particular type particular professional must made aware danger building system around oversimplified model improbability anticipating designing every possible operating condition issue related complexity profession
The future computing profession depends technical ethical excellence
Not important ACM computing professional adhere principle expressed Code member encourage support adherence member
Adherence professional code ethic largely voluntary matter

ICT Contributes society human
Communication improves society human race whole
Each person fundamental human right protection need consideration
In addition respect diverse culture
Computing professional work towards reduction negative consequence resulting computing system
These range threat health negative social issue
During system design implementation computing professional ensure product socially responsible meet required social standard
They result kind harm health welfare individual
Computer professional thus make decision public welfare mind always disclose factor might threaten environment whole
They also prevent harm cost
These include prevention negative impact like loss information loss damage property well undesired environmental
The computing professional take caution taking part practice cause harm
These harmful practice like intentional destruction file modification modification program might lead serious loss useful resource thus causing unnecessary expenditure resource like time
On hand practice might accidentally lead harm
In condition people responsible undo mitigate side effect much
For harm prevention computing professional need minimize malfunction following accepted standard designing sand testing system
Under working environment professional report danger system might end resulting fatal minor accident
If organization superior take action concerning matter much significant blow whistle problem correction
Reporting violation much harmful self
Before making anyone report matter necessary aspect matter need assessing thoroughly
The assessment risk responsibility credible
Trustworthiness Honesty essential component trust honesty IEEE Board Directors Par

When organization lack honesty effective functioning
Computing professional honest supposed make deliberate false claim deceptive concerning system design system whole
Nevertheless provide full disclosure limitation problem facing particular pertinent system
It responsibility computer professional honest qualification
They offer condition may lead conflict interest
In term professional honesty much realistic stating claim based data
Honesty help avoid perceived conflict interest whenever possible well making disclosed party affected also reject form bribery
This help seeking accepting offering criticism technical work making acknowledgement well crediting others contribution clearly
Stating correct qualification assist maintaining technical competence
Being volunteer member organization like ACM IEEE also cause confusion especially individual make certain statement act certain way
Such statement act weight necessary
Members ACM IEEE therefore exercise caution
This ensure interpretated wrongly
Fair Actions Decisions Equity tolerance respect among virtue principle lead equal justice
These value govern computing professional

Software copy created proper authorization procedure followed
Respect person privacy confidentiality communication computing technology help collection exchange people information scale unprecedented civilization history
As effect high chance might lead violation individual group privacy
The professional obligated maintain privacy data integrity describes individual
This involves taking precaution ensures data accuracy well protection unauthorized access accidental disclosure unintended people minimized
In addition procedure installed give room individual receive record make correction appropriately
The principle imply part individual information collected system
Therefore retention period disposal information need defined indicated clearly
Information belongs someone used used unstated purpose without owner consent
This apply especially electronic mail
Monitoring electronic data without permission owner massage unacceptable
Information observed system maintenance handled lot confidentiality
If reason content nature information disclosed proper authority provided information

part concerned computing professional make decision regarding professional social conduct
Margaret Anne Pierce professor Department Mathematics Computers Georgia Southern University categorized ethical decision related computer technology usage three primary influence The conceptual foundation computer ethic investigated branch philosophical established
The term computer ethic first coined Walter Maner professor
The concept computer ethic originated MIT professor
While working artillery Wiener fellow engineer developed system communication part cannon tracked warplane part performed calculation estimate trajectory part responsible firing
Wiener termed science information feedback system discussed new field related ethical concern book
In Wiener second book delved deeper ethical issue surrounding information technology laid basic foundation computer ethic
A bit later year world first committed
A programmer able use bit computer code stop banking account flagged overdrawn
However law place time stop result charged
To make sure another person follow suit ethic code computer needed
In ACM adopted first code ethic
author computer crime led committee developed code
In medical teacher researcher Walter Maner noticed ethical decision much harder make computer added
He noticed need different branch ethic came dealing computer
The term computer ethic thus invented
In year Joseph Weizenbaum made second significant addition field computer ethic
He published book titled talked good world however never allowed make important decision human quality wisdom
By far important point make book distinction choosing deciding
He argued deciding computational activity making choice thus ability make choice make u human
At later time year professor Computer Science City College New York published article titled On approach study social issue computing
This article identified analyzed technical bias research social issue present computing
During adopted United States Congress drastically limiting government ability search bank record
During year professor Philosophy Southern Connecticut State University well Director Research Center Computing Society developed first ever curriculum university course computer ethic
Bynum also editor journal In journal held essay contest topic computer ethic published winning essay special issue Computers In United States Congress passed Small Business Computer Security Education Act created advisory council focus computer security related small business
In Professor Philosophy DartMouth College New Hampshire published essay called What Computer Ethics
In essay Moor state computer ethic includes following identification policy vacuum clarification conceptual muddle formulation policy use computer technology ethical justification policy
During year Deborah Johnson Professor Applied Ethics Chair Department Science Technology Society School Engineering Applied Sciences University Virginia got first major computer ethic textbook published
Johnson textbook identified major issue research computer ethic year publication first edition
In Robert Hauptman librarian St
Cloud University came information ethic term used describe storage production access dissemination information
Near time adopted act restricted United States government program identifying debtor
In year ACM adopted new set ethical rule called ACM code Ethics Professional Conduct consisted statement personal responsibility
Three year later Krystyna Professor Philosophy Southern Connecticut State University Coordinator Religious Studies Program well Senior Research Associate Research Center Computing Society came idea computer ethic eventually become global ethical system soon computer ethic would replace ethic altogether would become standard ethic information age
In Deborah Johnson revealed view quite contrary belief stated computer ethic evolve rather old ethic slight twist
Privacy one major issue emerged since internet become part many aspect daily life
Internet user hand personal information order sign register service without realizing potentially setting invasion privacy
Another example privacy issue concern Google tracking search
There feature within searching allows Google keep track search advertisement match search criterion turn mean using people product
There ongoing discussion privacy mean still needed
With increase social networking site people allowing private information shared publicly
On surface may seen someone listing private information social networking site surface site could sharing information individual
This idea versus situation
There many privacy statement state whether policy
Typically privacy policy mean individual tell company issuing privacy policy want information shared
mean information shared unless individual tell company share
Identifying issue arise well defining deal traditionally problematic
In solving problem relating ethical issue proposed unique method
In Davis model ethical problem stated fact checked list option generated considering relevant factor relating problem
The actual action taken influenced specific ethical standard
Various national international professional society organization produced code ethic document give basic behavioral guideline computing professional user
They include

In country world information revolution altered many aspect life significantly commerce employment medicine security transportation entertainment
Consequently information communication technology ICT affected good way bad way community life family life human relationship education career freedom democracy name example
Computer information ethic present essay understood branch applied ethic study analyzes social ethical impact ICT
The specific term computer ethic used past several different way
For example used refer application traditional Western ethic theory like utilitarianism Kantianism virtue ethic ethical case significantly involve computer computer network
Computer ethic also used refer kind professional ethic computer professional apply code ethic standard good practice within profession
In addition name cyberethics Internet ethic used refer computer ethic issue associated Internet
During past several decade robust rapidly growing field computer information ethic generated university course research professorship research center conference workshop professional organization curriculum material book journal
In mid innovative development science philosophy led creation new branch ethic would later called computer ethic information ethic
The founder new philosophical field American scholar Norbert Wiener professor mathematics engineering MIT
During Second World War together colleague America Great Britain Wiener helped develop electronic computer new powerful information technology
While engaged war effort Wiener colleague created new branch applied science Wiener named cybernetics Greek word pilot ship
Even War raging Wiener foresaw enormous social ethical implication cybernetics combined electronic computer
He predicted War world would undergo second industrial revolution automatic age enormous potential good evil would generate staggering number new ethical challenge opportunity
When War ended Wiener wrote book described new branch applied science identified social ethical implication electronic computer
Two year later published book explored number ethical issue computer information technology would likely generate
The issue identified two book plus later book included topic still important today computer security computer unemployment responsibility computer professional computer person disability information network globalization virtual community teleworking merging human body machine robot ethic artificial intelligence computer religion number subject
See Bynum
Although coined name cybernetics new science Wiener apparently see also creating new branch ethic
As result coin name like computer ethic information ethic
These term came use decade later
See discussion
In spite Wiener three relevant book lay powerful foundation use effective methodology today field computer information ethic
His thinking however far ahead scholar time many people considered eccentric scientist engaging flight fantasy ethic
Apparently one even Wiener recognized profound importance ethic achievement nearly two decade would pas social ethical impact information technology Wiener predicted late would become obvious scholar general public
In Wiener explored likely effect information technology upon key human value like
The metaphysical idea analytical method employed powerful could used effectively identifying analyzing resolving social ethical problem associated kind information technology including example computer computer network radio television telephone news medium journalism even book library
Because breadth Wiener concern applicability idea method every kind information technology term information ethic apt name new field ethic founded
As result term computer ethic typically used today name subfield Wiener much broader concern
In laying foundation information ethic Wiener developed cybernetic view human nature society led ethically suggestive account purpose human life
Based upon adopted great principle justice believed society ought follow
These powerful ethical concept enabled Wiener analyze information ethic issue kind
Wiener cybernetic understanding human nature stressed physical structure human body remarkable potential learning creativity human physiology make possible
While explaining human intellectual potential regularly compared human body physiology le intelligent creature like insect Given physiology human being possible take wide diversity information external world access information condition event within body process information way constitute reasoning calculating wondering deliberating deciding many intellectual activity
Wiener concluded purpose human life flourish kind organism human naturally Wiener account human nature presupposed metaphysical view universe considers world entity within including human combination information
Everything world mixture according Wiener actually
Consequently brain According Wiener metaphysical view everything universe come existence persists disappears continuous mixing mingling information
Living organism including human being actually pattern information persist ongoing exchange
Thus say human being We whirlpool river water
We stuff abides pattern perpetuate
Wiener The individuality body form rather bit substance
Wiener Using language today information age see example Lloyd Vedral would say according Wiener human being information object intellectual capacity well personal identity dependent upon persisting pattern information information processing within body rather specific bit
According Wiener human being flourish must free engage creative flexible action thereby maximize full potential intelligent being charge life
This purpose human life
Because people various level kind talent possibility however one person achievement different others
It possible nevertheless lead good human life flourish indefinitely large number way example diplomat scientist teacher nurse doctor soldier housewife midwife musician tradesman artisan
This understanding purpose human life led Wiener adopt called great principle justice upon society built
He believed adherence principle society would maximize person ability flourish variety flexibility human action
Although Wiener stated great principle assign name
For purpose easy reference let u call The Principle Freedom The Principle Equality The Principle Benevolence
Using Wiener word yield following list great principle pp
Justice requires liberty human develop freedom full measure human possibility embodied Justice requires equality A B remains position A B Justice requires good man man know limit short humanity Given Wiener cybernetic account human nature society follows people fundamentally social being reach full potential part community similar being
Society therefore essential good human life
however actually indeed violate three great principle justice
For reason Wiener explicitly adopted fourth principle justice assure first three would violated
Let u call additional principle The Principle Minimum Infringement Freedom What compulsion existence community state may demand must exercised way produce unnecessary infringement freedom
If one grant Wiener account good society human nature follows Sometimes ethical relativists use existence different culture proof could underlying ethical foundation society around globe
In response relativism Wiener could argue given understanding human nature purpose human life embrace welcome rich variety culture practice still advocating adherence great principle justice
Those principle offer even though leave room immense cultural diversity
The one restriction Wiener would require society must provide context human realize full potential sophisticated agent making decision choice thereby taking responsibility life
Wiener believed possible significant freedom equality human compassion prevail
Because Wiener think creating new branch ethic provide metaphilosophical comment analyzing information ethic issue case
Instead plunged directly analysis
Consequently want know Wiener method analysis need observe rather look metaphilosophical commentary upon procedure
When observing Wiener way analyzing information ethic issue trying resolve find example try
In given society network existing practice law rule principle govern human behavior within society
These policy borrow helpful word Moor constitute received policy cluster see Bynum Schubert reasonably society serve
Wiener methodology combine received policy cluster one society Wiener account human nature plus great principle justice plus critical skill clarifying vague ambiguous language
In way achieved effective method analyzing information ethic issue
Borrowing Moor later apt description computer ethic methodology Moor describe Wiener methodology follows In essentially society society received policy cluster reasonably method analyzing resolving information ethic issue likely result ethically good solution assimilated society
Note way information ethic require expertise trained philosopher although expertise might prove helpful many situation
Any adult function successfully reasonably society likely familiar existing custom practice rule law govern person behavior society enable one tell whether proposed action policy would accepted ethical
So must cope introduction new information technology whether computer professional business people worker teacher parent maker others engage information ethic helping integrate new information technology society ethically acceptable way
Information ethic understood important left information professional philosopher
Wiener information ethic interest idea method broad covering topic specific field computer ethic would call today also issue related area today called agent ethic see example Floridi Internet ethic Cavalier nanotechnology ethic Weckert
The purview Wiener idea method even broad enough encompass subfields like journalism ethic library ethic ethic bioengineering
Even late Wiener made clear view integration society newly invented computing information technology would lead remaking society second industrial revolution automatic age
It would affect every walk life would process requiring decade effort
In Wiener word new information technology placed human being presence another social potentiality importance good However think creating new branch ethic Wiener coin name computer ethic information ethic describe
These term beginning computer ethic came common use year later starting mid work Walter Maner
see Maner Today information age Wiener predicted half century ago come existence metaphysical scientific foundation information ethic laid continues provide insight effective guidance understanding resolving ethical challenge engendered information technology kind
In nearly three decade publication Wiener book Walter Maner noticed ethical question problem considered Medical Ethics course Old Dominion University often became complicated significantly altered computer got involved
Sometimes addition computer seemed Maner actually generated
He concluded new branch applied ethic similar already existing field like medical ethic business ethic
After considering name information ethic decided instead call proposed new field computer ethic
At time Maner know computer ethic work Norbert Wiener
He defined proposed new field one study ethical problem aggravated transformed created computer technology
He developed experimental computer ethic course designed primarily student computer science program
His course success student university wanted teach regularly
He complied wish also created starter kit teaching computer ethic prepared dissemination attendee workshop ran speech gave philosophy conference computing science conference America
In Helvetia Press National Information Resource Center Teaching Philosophy published Maner computer ethic starter kit monograph Maner
It contained curriculum material pedagogical advice university teacher
It also included rationale offering course university suggested course description university catalog list course objective teaching tip discussion topic like privacy confidentiality computer crime computer decision technological dependence professional code ethic
During early Maner widely disseminated Helvetia Press college university America elsewhere
Meanwhile Maner continued conduct workshop teach course computer ethic
As result number scholar especially philosopher computer scientist introduced computer ethic Maner trailblazing effort
While Maner developing new computer ethic course colleague Philosophy Department Old Dominion University Deborah Johnson became interested proposed new field
She especially interested Maner view computer generate ethical problem believe true
As result Maner Johnson began discussing ethic case allegedly involved problem brought computer
In discussion Johnson granted computer indeed transform old ethic problem interesting important way give new twist agree computer generated problem never seen
The resulting discussion initiated fruitful series comment publication nature uniqueness computer ethic series scholarly exchange started Maner Johnson later spread scholar
The following passage Maner keynote address drew number people discussion Over decade followed publication provocative passage extended uniqueness debate led number useful contribution computer information ethic
For example publication see Johnson Maner Tavani Himma Floridi Sanders Mather Bynum
By early Johnson joined staff Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute secured grant prepare set teaching material pedagogical module concerning computer ethic turned successful
She incorporated textbook published Johnson
On page noted computer pose new version standard moral problem moral dilemma exacerbating old problem forcing u apply ordinary moral norm uncharted She grant Maner claim however computer create ethical problem
Instead described computer ethic issue old ethical problem given new twist computer technology
Johnson book first major textbook field quickly became primary text used computer ethic course offered university country
For decade textbook set computer ethic research agenda topic ownership software intellectual property computing privacy responsibility computer professional fair distribution technology human power
In later edition Johnson added new ethical topic like hacking people computer without permission computer technology person disability ethic Internet
Also later edition Johnson continued discussion noting example new information technology provide new way instrument human action
Because agreed Maner new ethic question generated computer technology example Should ownership software protected law Do huge database personal information threaten privacy argued question merely new specie old moral issue protection human privacy ownership intellectual property
They insisted ethic problem requiring addition traditional ethical theory Maner claimed Maner
The year watershed year history computer ethic appearance Johnson textbook also James Moor classic paper What Is Computer Ethics published special issue journal
There Moor provided account nature computer ethic broader ambitious definition Maner Johnson
He went beyond description example computer ethic problem offering explanation computing technology raise many ethical question compared kind technology
Moor explanation revolutionary power computer technology computer logically malleable The logical malleability computer technology said Moor make possible people vast number thing able
Since one could question may never arisen whether one
In addition could done perhaps law standard good practice specific ethical rule ever established govern
Moor called situation policy vacuum vacuum might generate conceptual muddle In late Moor policy vacuum explanation need computer ethic account revolutionary logical malleability computer technology quickly became influential among growing number computer ethic scholar
He added additional idea including important notion According Moor human value important continued survival community essentially community value
Indeed community value core value soon would cease exist
Moor used core value examine computer ethic topic like privacy security Moor add account justice called consequentialism Moor theory combine core value consequentialism Bernard Gert deontological notion moral impartiality using blindfold justice
Moor approach computer ethic practical theory provides broad perspective nature information revolution
By using notion logical malleability policy vacuum conceptual muddle core value consequentialism provides following method The third step accomplished combining deontology consequentialism traditionally considered incompatible rival ethic theory achieve following practical result Beginning computer ethic work Norbert Wiener common thread run much history computer ethic namely concern Thus specific issue Wiener dealt case defending advancing value
For example working prevent massive unemployment caused robotic factory Wiener tried preserve security resource opportunity factory worker
Similarly arguing use machine Wiener tried diminish threat security peace
This approach computer ethic fruitful
It served example organizing theme major conference National Conference Computing Values Southern Connecticut State University see section exponential growth devoted impact computing upon
In late similar approach computer ethic called computer design emerged based upon insight potential problem avoided new technology development See example Brey Friedman Friedman Nissenbaum Introna Introna Nissenbaum Flanagan et
In early different emphasis within computer ethic advocated Donald Gotterbarn
He believed computer ethic seen ethic devoted development advancement standard good practice code conduct computing professional
Thus article Computer Ethics Responsibility Regained Gotterbarn said Throughout aspect computer ethic mind Gotterbarn worked advocate example Keith Miller Dianne Martin Chuck Huff Simon Rogerson variety project advance professional responsibility among computer practitioner
Even Gotterbarn part committee ACM Association Computing Machinery create third version organization Code Ethics Professional Conduct adopted ACM see Anderson et
Later Gotterbarn colleague ACM Computer Society IEEE Institute Electrical Electronic Engineers developed licensing standard software engineer
In addition Gotterbarn headed joint taskforce IEEE ACM create Software Engineering Code Ethics Professional Practice adopted organization see Gotterbarn Miller Rogerson
In late Gotterbarn created Software Engineering Ethics Research Institute SEERI East Tennessee State University see http early together Simon Rogerson developed computer program called SoDIS Software Development Impact Statements assist individual company organization preparation ethical stakeholder analysis determining likely ethical impact software development project Gotterbarn Rogerson
These many project focused attention upon advanced professionalization ethical maturation computing practitioner

In presentation The Computer Revolution Problem Global Ethics Krystyna made startling prediction see Górniak
She argued computer ethic eventually evolve global ethic applicable every culture earth
According Górniak hypothesis regional ethical theory like Europe Benthamite Kantian system well diverse ethical system embedded culture world derive local history custom unlikely applicable
Computer information ethic hand Górniak argued potential provide global ethic suitable Information Age The provocative Górniak hypothesis significant contribution ongoing uniqueness debate reinforced Maner claim made conference keynote address information technology force u discover new moral value formulate new moral principle develop new policy find new way think issue presented Maner Górniak speculate globally relevant concept principle would evolve information ethic
She merely predicted theory would emerge time global nature Internet resulting ethic conversation among culture world
Górniak may well right
Computer ethic today appears evolving broader even important field might reasonably called global information ethic
Global network especially Internet connecting people earth
For first time history effort develop mutually agreed standard conduct effort advance defend human value made truly global context
So first time history earth ethic value debated transformed context limited particular geographic region constrained specific religion culture
This could one important social development history Bynum Floridi
Consider global issue If computer user United States example wish protect freedom speech Internet whose law apply
Two hundred country interconnected Internet United States Constitution First Amendment protection freedom speech local law Internet apply rest world
How issue like freedom speech control pornography protection intellectual property invasion privacy many others governed law many country involved
Lessig If citizen European country example Internet dealing someone land government country considers dealing illegal European tried court country
In recent year rapid expansion global cyberbusiness
Nations appropriate technological infrastructure already place enjoyed resulting economic benefit rest world lagged behind
What political economic fallout inequality
In addition accepted business practice one part world perceived cheating fraud part world
Will wealthy nation widen already big gap rich poor
Will political even military confrontation emerge
If inexpensive access global information net provided rich poor alike people ghetto poor nation underdeveloped world etc
first time history nearly everyone earth access daily news free press text document art work great library museum world political religious social practice people everywhere
What impact sudden profound global education upon political dictatorship isolated community coherent culture religious practice etc
As great university world begin offer degree knowledge module via Internet lesser university damaged even forced business
The gap rich poor nation even rich poor citizen industrialized country already disturbingly wide
As educational opportunity business employment opportunity medical service many necessity life move cyberspace gap rich poor become even worse
Important recent development began appear confirming Górniak hypothesis particular metaphysical theory Luciano Floridi see example Floridi Flourishing Ethics theory present author combine idea Aristotle Wiener Moor Floridi see Bynum
Floridi developing information ethic theory henceforth argued purview computer ethic indeed ethic general widened include much simply human being action intention character
He developed FIE another macroethics term utilitarianism deontologism contractualism virtue ethic intended applicable ethical situation
On hand FIE traditional Western theory rather go beyond traditional theory overridden sometimes traditional ethical consideration
Floridi The name information ethic appropriate Floridi theory treat everything exists informational object process All entity described cluster data informational object
More precisely existing entity discrete encapsulated package containing At level abstraction informational system rather living system general raised role agent patient action environmental process change interaction equally described informationally
Floridi Since everything exists according FIE informational object process call totality exists universe considered whole infosphere
Objects process infosphere significantly damaged destroyed altering characteristic data structure
Such damage destruction Floridi call entropy result partial empoverishment infosphere
Floridi offer four fundamental principle FIE based upon idea everything infosphere least minimum worth ethically respected even worth overridden consideration By construing every existing entity universe informational least minimal moral worth FIE supplement traditional ethical theory go beyond shifting focus one ethical attention away action character value human agent toward evil harm dissolution destruction entropy suffered object process infosphere
With approach every existing entity human animal plant organization even artifact electronic object cyberspace piece intellectual property interpreted potential agent affect entity potential patient affected entity

In decade professional ethic advocate Donald Gotterbarn Keith Miller Dianne Martin professional organization Computer Professionals Social Responsibility Electronic Frontier Foundation Special Interest Group Computing Society SIGCAS ACM spearheaded project focused upon professional responsibility computer practitioner
Information computer ethic became required component undergraduate computer science program nationally accredited Computer Sciences Accreditation Board
In addition annual Computers Freedom Privacy conference began see ACM adopted new version Code Ethics Professional Conduct
In rapid growth information computer ethic spread Europe present author joined Simon Rogerson De Montfort University England create Centre Computing Social Responsibility organize first computer ethic conference Europe
That conference included attendee fourteen different country mostly Europe became key factor generating critical mass computer ethic scholar Europe

This article give overview professional ethic applied particular ethical guideline developer expected follow apply writing programming code also called part relationship
These rule shape differentiate good practice attitude wrong one creating making decision crucial delicate issue regarding programming project

He worked several advocate write ethical guideline creating code Ethics
He formed part creation Code Ethics Professional Conduct adopted ACM Software Engineering Code Ethics Professional Practice adopted IEEE ACM well
These code also include Programming Ethics principle
The world largest educational scientific computing society
It Code Ethics another set ethical principle also approved standard teaching practicing
These code Code Ethics Professional Conduct Software Engineering Code Ethics Professional Practice respectively guideline presented From Code Ethics Professional Conduct ACM From Software Engineering Code Ethics Professional Practice IEEE ACM University indirectly help form follow programming ethic
According Stephen Blythe computer science professor department university made goal encourage student class put practice good conduct
He add application ethical guideline might clearly visible first year computer science career
However student get senior field information programming ethic principle conveyed useful go business world Blythe
also train computer science major field programming ethic
They expect every student adhere ACM principle responsibility getting
It also needed student fully comprehend follow guideline World Programming
Breaking guideline established IEEE ACM Codes Ethics code result immediate termination membership correspondent
Moreover Stephen Blythe express programmer commits violation Code Ethics also prosecuted US law implicit relationship programming ethic business law agreement contract etc
Harm generated third party punishable US legal system
Intentionally making mistake like creating insecure password leaving security hole implementation program could put risk system security reliability expose programmer trial Savage
The specific sanction might result legal dispute vary one state another

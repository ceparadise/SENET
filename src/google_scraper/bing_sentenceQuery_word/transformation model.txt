A automated way modifying creating model
An example use model transformation ensuring family consistent precise sense software engineer define
The aim using model transformation save effort reduce error automating building modification model possible
Model transformation thought program take model input
There wide variety kind model transformation us differ input output also way expressed
A model transformation usually specifies model acceptable input appropriate model may produce output specifying model must conform
Model transformation language classified many way
Some common distinction drawn In principle model transformation may many input output various type absolute limitation model transformation take least one model input
However model transformation produce model output would commonly called model analysis model query
Endogenous transformation transformation model expressed language
Exogenous transformation transformation model expressed using different language
For example process conforming might transformed exogenous model transformation
A unidirectional model transformation one mode execution always take type input produce type output
Unidirectional model transformation useful situation output model
The relevant notion consistency simple input model consistent model transformation would produce output
For bidirectional model transformation type model sometimes input time output
necessary situation people working one model model must kept consistent
Then change either model might necessitate change order maintain consistency model
Because model incorporate information reflected may many model consistent given model
Important special case It particularly important bidirectional model transformation appropriate property make behave sensibly example making change unnecessarily discarding deliberately made change
A model transformation may written general purpose programming language specialised model transformation language also available
Bidirectional transformation particular best written language ensures direction appropriately related
The model transformation language collectively known
In model transformation language example language model transformation model conforms metamodel part model transformation language definition
This facilitates definition HOTs
transformation transformation input output

In computing process converting data one format structure another format structure
It fundamental aspect task application integration
Data transformation simple complex based required change data source initial data target final data
Data transformation typically performed via mixture manual automated step
Tools technology used data transformation vary widely based format structure complexity volume data transformed
A recast another form data transformation entire data value transformed recast without extracting data database
All data well designed database directly indirectly related limited set master network constraint
Each foreign key constraint dependent upon unique parent database table
Therefore proper master database table recast different unique index directly indirectly related data also recast restated
The directly indirectly related data may also still viewed original form since original unique index still exists master data
Also database recast must done way impact software
When data mapping indirect via mediating process also called
Data transformation divided following step applicable needed based complexity transformation required
These step often focus developer technical data analyst may use multiple specialized tool perform task
The step described follows first step data transformation process
Typically data profiled using profiling tool sometimes using manually written profiling script better understand structure characteristic data decide need transformed
process defining individual field mapped modified joined filtered aggregated etc
produce final desired output
Developers technical data analyst traditionally perform data mapping since work specific technology define transformation rule
visual ETL tool transformation language
process generating executable code
SQL Python R executable instruction transform data based desired defined data mapping rule
Typically data transformation technology generate code based definition metadata defined developer
step whereby generated code executed data create desired output
The executed code may tightly integrated transformation tool may require separate step developer manually execute generated code
final step process focus ensuring output data meet transformation requirement
It typically business user final data performs step
Any anomaly error data found communicated back developer data analyst new requirement implemented transformation process
Traditionally data transformation bulk batch process whereby developer write code implement transformation rule data integration tool execute code rule large volume data
This process follow linear set step described Data Transformation Process
Batch data transformation cornerstone virtually data integration technology data warehousing data migration application integration
When data must transformed delivered low latency term microbatch often used
This refers small batch data
small number row small set data object processed quickly delivered target system needed
Traditional data transformation process served company well decade
The various tool technology data profiling data visualization data cleansing data integration etc
matured enterprise transform enormous volume data feed internal external application data warehouse data store
This traditional process also limitation hamper overall efficiency effectiveness
The people need use data
business user play direct role data transformation process
Typically user hand data transformation task developer necessary coding technical skill define transformation execute data
This process leaf bulk work defining required transformation developer
The developer interprets business user requirement implement related
This potential introducing error process misinterpreted requirement also increase time arrive solution
This problem given rise need agility data integration
empowering user data enabling transform data interactively
There company provide data transformation tool
They aiming efficiently analyze map transform large volume data without technical process complexity currently exists
While company use traditional batch transformation tool enable interactivity user visual platform easily repeated script
Interactive data transformation IDT emerging capability allows business analyst business user ability directly interact large datasets visual interface understand characteristic data via automated data profiling visualization change correct data simple interaction clicking selecting certain element data
Although IDT follows data integration process step batch data integration key difference step necessarily followed linear fashion typically require significant technical skill completion
A number company primarily Trifacta Alteryx Paxata provide interactive data transformation tool
They aiming efficiently analyze map transform large volume data without technical process complexity currently exists
IDT solution provide integrated visual interface combine previously disparate step data analysis data mapping code data inspection
IDT interface incorporate visualization show user pattern anomaly data identify erroneous outlying value
Once finished transforming data system generate executable executed applied subsequent similar data set
By removing developer process IDT system shorten time needed prepare transform data eliminate costly error interpretation user requirement empower business user analyst control data interact needed
There numerous language available performing data transformation
Many require provided
In many case grammar structured using something closely resembling
There numerous language available purpose varying accessibility cost general usefulness
Examples language include Additionally company Trifacta Paxata developed transformational language DSL servicing transforming datasets
The development language linked increased productivity accessibility user
Trifacta Wrangle example domain specific language
Another advantage recent DSL trend DSL abstract underlying execution logic defined DSL also utilize logic various processing engine Dataflow
With DSL transformation language tied engine
Although transformational language typically best suited transformation something simple regular expression used achieve useful transformation
A like support use regular expression argument
This would allow instance particular pattern replaced another pattern using part original pattern
For example could transformed compact form like In word instance function invocation foo three argument followed function invocation two invocation would replaced single function invocation using original set argument
Another advantage using regular expression fail null transform test
That using transformational language choice run sample program transformation perform transformation
Many transformational language fail test

Richard Cardenas taught Physics year
He Physics focus Biological Physics
The state energy neither destroyed created
Instead energy transforms one form another
So exactly energy transformation
Well might guess defined process changing energy one form another
There many different kind energy transform one form another
There energy chemical reaction called energy thermal process called energy charged particle called
The process splitting atom combining atom give u another type energy called
And finally energy motion kinetic energy energy associated position potential energy collectively called
That sound like quite lot
Well worry actually pretty easy remember
Next explore kind possible transformation detail
energy stored within substance bond chemical compound
The energy stored chemical bond released transformed type chemical reaction
Think hungry
When eat piece bread satisfy hunger body break chemical bond bread us supply energy body
In process chemical energy transformed mechanical energy use move cover detail moment
It also transforms created metabolic process body generate heat
Most time chemical energy released form heat transformation chemical energy heat thermal energy called
Next two main type kinetic energy potential energy
energy associated motion object
Therefore object move kinetic energy
Likewise two type gravitational potential energy elastic potential energy
associated energy stored object location ground
energy stored object stretch compress
Potential energy converted kinetic energy vice versa
For example bungee jump bridge executing variety energy transformation
First prepare jump gravitational potential energy bungee cord slack elastic potential energy
Once jump convert gravitational potential energy kinetic energy fall
At time bungee cord begin stretch
As cord stretch begin store elastic potential energy
You stop bottom cord fully stretched point elastic potential energy
The cord whip back thereby converting stored elastic potential energy kinetic energy gravitational potential energy
The process repeat
energy carried charged particle move around conductor
A perfect example electrical energy released lightning storm
A lightning strike tree example electrical energy transformed heat thermal energy
The tree becomes hot may even burn result electrical discharge
Chemical energy also converted electrical energy
For example chemical energy battery converted electrical energy
The electrical energy involves motion electrical charge current used power everyday device like computer flashlight
Mechanical energy also transformed electrical energy
For example plant us mechanical energy flowing water generate electrical energy
Wind energy another mechanical electrical energy transformation
The mechanical energy wind transformed electrical energy transformed type energy
Finally energy stored nucleus atom
This energy manifested two different way
First fission process
In unstable nucleus break apart process release tremendous amount energy
The example fission process
In short energy released breaking tiny atomic nucleus release enough energy destroy city two
The energy nuclear fission converted electrical energy thermal energy mechanical energy
Get FREE access day create account
The nuclear energy process actually opposite fission
process fusing two different nucleus create another larger nucleus
This process also release tremendous amount energy
Of two type nuclear energy fusion desirable lack nuclear waste
Fission process leave residual effect like radiation fusion
Currently fission nuclear power plant research toward harnessing power nuclear fusion underway
There secondary type energy variation energy described
For example radiant energy solar energy result electrical energy nuclear energy
The sun release energy process fusion combining hydrogen atom make helium atom
The result release light energy solar energy also called
Another type energy sound energy
energy carried sound wave
However sound created mechanical electrical process classify mechanical electrical type energy
As see type energy transformed type energy
That basic concept behind energy transformation
The odd thing thermal energy usually end product transformation rather cause transformation
Most energy transformation process end production thermal energy
That said one main example thermal energy transformed another type energy engine
The temperature difference engine allows engine operate produce mechanical energy move automobile
However process also produce thermal energy
The state energy neither destroyed created
Rather energy transform one form another
Many energy transformation useful
For instance converting mechanical energy waterfall electrical energy converting nuclear energy electrical energy power city useful
Some harmful however releasing nuclear energy destroy small city
But main takeaway lesson type process think probably energy transformation involved
Try think everyday process look energy transformation

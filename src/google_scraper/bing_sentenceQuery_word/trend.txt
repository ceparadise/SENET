Credit Alicia Kubista Andrij Borys Associates Computer science expanding research field driven emerging application domain improving hardware software eliminate old bottleneck even create new challenge opportunity CS research
Accordingly number research paper published CS conference journal increasing rapidly past two decade
With growing emphasis externally funded research university scientific research increasingly influenced funding opportunity
Although many funded program developed close collaboration leading researcher aim identify precisely relationship funding publication related new topic
Trend analysis long researched applied many type datasets medical weather stock market
Many publication track research trend analyze impact particular paper development field topic study relationship different research field
The Web Science collected data since nearly million publication multiple scientific discipline analyzed various level detail looking overall trend pattern emerging field research influence individual paper related research area
Over past decade besides Web Science study also investigated overlap evolution social community around field topic
Rosvall Bergstrom explored method visualization scientific research analyzed impact research area quantified collective citation paper
Porter Rafols analyzed citation information find evidence collaboration across field scientific research
Other example network model studying structure social science collaboration network woman authorship CS publication ACM digital library
Several study focused challenge direction landscape specific CS field specific CS topic
In article interested learning evolution CS research
We collected data proposal grant supported National Science Foundation CS publication ACM Digital Library IEEE Xplore digital library
We analyzed research community research trend relation awarded grant change community trend well research topic
We found uncommonly high frequency specific topic included publication funding topic usually increase
We also analyzed CS researcher community finding small fraction author attribute work research area long time reflecting emphasis novelty new keywords frequent change academic research team stable core faculty turnover student postdoc
Finally work highlight dynamic CS research landscape focus constantly moving new challenge due new technological development
CS atypical academic discipline universe evolving quickly speed unprecedented even engineering
Naturally researcher follow evolution artifact adjusting research interest
We attempt capture vibrant coevolution
We used ACM IEEE NSF datasets collected data publication
For ACM dataset extracted number paper listed top category ACM Computing Classification System CCS
The ACM dataset included author title abstract year published publication venue keywords ACM classification category article
We used ACM CCS keywords respectively study broader static versus finer dynamic view CS landscape trend
In another analysis used keywords identify relationship researcher yielding smaller research group used ACM CCS alone
The IEEE Xplore dataset included similar information lacked topic classification like ACM CCS
Instead used research topic included Wikipedia article CS research area identified main Wikipedia CS article classify paper IEEE dataset
For NSF dataset retrieved title start date abstract funded grant proposal
For ACM IEEE datasets created two data publication venue paper analyzed period number publication grew approximately yearly year
To create research topic network made topic node connected two node weighted edge representing number abstract mention adjacent topic
Using sequence mining network extraction visualization bursty word detection clustering bursty keywords network evolution investigated change time CS research landscape interaction CS research community similarity dissimilarity research topic impact funding publication vice versa

We looked evolution CS research landscape see
Many ACM record collected spring ACM classification category thus excluded study causing drop record last two year
There drop every record included publication venue
For ACM except publication category increased year year fraction publication mathematics computing category shrank considerably
The keywords contributing drop control theory logic
We attribute drop shift focus general issue challenge specific area publication increasingly associated
For remaining category fastest growing publication information system
The frequently used keywords XML Internet Web service semantic Web
Likewise IEEE dataset showed research area information science information retrieval
To better see impact information system extracted top research topic ACM IEEE quantified result two way document frequency DF term frequency inverse document frequency TFIDF
For DF number document including TFIDF sum weight document weight document defined number document number time appears see Hoonlor et al
detailed result
Most publication collaboration data mining information retrieval machine learning privacy XML appeared showed noteworthy trend CS research
The term Internet World Wide Web appear publication related topic present since early
During period NSF grant nine IEEE paper mentioned NSFNET abstract two ACM paper included keyword
Other term net prodigy internetworking also appeared NSF dataset
Moreover prodigy bursty period period
TFIDF DF value showed rise information system contributed general interest data mining information retrieval topic whereas mathematics computing continued decrease year year period logic control theory contributing decline
includes research topic subnetworks culled ACM dataset Map Generator software package security multimedia subnetworks found World Wide Web Internet subnetworks found
In Web used keyword associated mostly multimedia information visualization whereas information retrieval used mostly Internet
However early Web used mostly data mining information retrieval Internet used mostly network protocol routing
Since privacy security become important Web context semantic Web Web Web service XML became major Internet topic

To evaluate influence research funding publication vice versa extracted ACM IEEE National Science Foundation datasets bursty period keywords based burstiness score time period defined interest time period document created time document total time document created
The burstiness score measure often compared occurrence
A positive score implies appears often bursty period total time
We recovered maximal segment burstiness score sequence document using maximum sum algorithm segment positive score corresponds bursty period
For pair datasets analyzed one keyword bursty period begin first long take keyword become bursty
For keywords one bursty period also looked burstiness score bursty period tabulated percentage case later burstiness score increased decreased unchanged
For pair keyword became bursty ACM data first became bursty NSF year later average reverse case average delay year
The longer delay show NSF initiate new area increase publication delayed time researcher need obtain grant start research leading publication
If keywords bursty datasets case keyword became bursty NSF dataset became bursty ACM dataset showing NSF funding often increase interest supported area
For another case reverse example burst appearing first NSF dataset data mining search engine becoming bursty NSF ACM
The reverse included bioinformatics ACM NSF semantic Web ACM NSF
For pair keyword first bursty IEEE became bursty NSF year later average reverse case average delay year
The difference two delay cause ACM dataset
Yet delay one year longer pair resulting conjecture larger ratio computer engineering topic IEEE ACM presumably larger fraction support IEEE publication source
In case keyword bursty NSF IEEE datasets became bursty NSF dataset first consistent ACM dataset
The case evenly split reverse concurrent appearance burstiness datasets
Only Internet telecommunication became bursty time datasets
Keywords bursty first IEEE dataset included database versus NSF procedural programming versus versus
network bursty IEEE never NSF dataset possibly indicating corresponding challenge funded mostly source see Hoonlor et al
detailed comparison
We also analyzed NSF dataset versus ACM IEEE datasets vice versa
For pair year searched year number entry changed compared previous four year first database
For change searched dataset change next four year
The relative change value ranged grouped bin size
We counted frequency change one dataset followed change
For NSF dataset versus either ACM IEEE dataset greater increase number NSF grant awarded given topic previous year followed increase probability number published paper topic least next three year next four year
Topics increase included data mining information extraction wireless network
On hand increase number published paper given topic ACM dataset followed probability increase usually le number NSF grant awarded topic example groupware knowledge management
For keyword multiple bursty period NSF dataset following bursty period burstiness score case
For IEEE dataset respectively ACM dataset
However interleaved overlapped bursty period NSF IEEE datasets bursty period appeared first IEEE dataset following NSF bursty period burstiness score case
In reverse case
The analysis ACM NSF datasets showed following NSF bursty period burstiness score case reverse case following ACM bursty period number
The reason large percentage equal burstiness score bursty period one dataset often subset bursty period another
Burstiness score tend decrease period following bursty period NSF dataset
Since novelty prized highly publication author tend stress new aspect work abstract keywords contributing observed pattern
Yet NSF burstiness period publication burstiness score likely increase decrease confirming sustained NSF funding essential maintaining interest given topic
Further analysis identified keywords associated bursty period burst together example wireless sensor network temporally related simulation security clustering order bursty period
This order corresponds temporal evolution area initially focused simulation network security finally clustering algorithm
The analysis also revealed data mining broadly used information retrieval
The former used computational science Web mining time series mining security latter used mainly topic
Text mining temporally related information retrieval data mining
Multiple bursty period keyword include interesting temporally correlated term
For example three bursty period keyword scheduling
In bursty period scheduling correlated listed order burstiness ranking genetic algorithm parallel processing performance evaluation embedded system approximation algorithm multimedia quality service optimization heuristic
In period keywords listed order approximation algorithm multimedia online algorithm real time embedded system fairness multiprocessor quality service genetic algorithm
Hence initially system parallel processing related scheduling later expanding genetic algorithm embedded system
In last year bursty period scheduling also correlated multimedia online algorithm fairness
An alternative look link done document frequency instead burstiness score

Here analyze research trend linear regression trend line changing popularity topic based fraction paper including given keyword year
We generated trend line keyword fraction used slope ranking
We fit trend line data preceding two six year order predict keyword fraction following year
In datasets observed trend based two year data positive slope fraction publication increased previous year current year subsequent year fraction declined
We also used trend line based NSF dataset predict fraction following year ACM IEEE datasets
The result show trend line poor predictor using ACM IEEE trend predict number grant awarded NSF accuracy model le
includes top top trend period period ACM IEEE
Unlike ACM dataset IEEE dataset show significant decrease top bottom trend research topic appear abstract longer keywords
Moreover used CS conference listed Wikipedia categorize paper IEEE ACM see Hoonlor et al
complete list category
We could statistically compare growth different area due vast difference number conference field number paper published conference
Nevertheless indicates growth approximately publication CS topic year year topic representing set CS conference conference covered two topic paper published conference indexed topic

Since looked back period also able monitor connection two field occurred changed
We extracted two set keywords never appearing together article appearing together least specified number article year
For IEEE dataset keeping algorithm node greatly reduced degree separation research topic created central node one highest total weight edge dominating research topic
We performed network analysis algorithm topic first removed algorithm node network term used almost every CS research paper describe data processed
During period algorithm database neural network frequent CS research topic CS research topic also mentioned along algorithm least persistent algorithm every year
Of CS research topic mentioned database persistent topic
Meanwhile topic appeared neural network persistent
Besides three frequent topic others persistent connection multiple research topic every year including programming language artificial intelligence clustering image processing computer vision network distributed system pattern recognition robotics software engineering integrated circuit
Also research topic including image analysis data transmission operating system linked three mentioned topic
In ACM network using keywords persistent link appeared confirming earlier observation certain research topic may important enough mentioned article abstract may represent article key research contribution
Another example lack link persistence neural network node IEEE ACM network
In former neural network central node almost every year
Yet ACM network never achieved status
Lack link persistence also evident algorithm database topic
In early user interface scheduling multimedia associated many CS research field
However late interest shifted Web information retrieval cooperative work
Throughout area connected others design usability security saw strong interest sensor network later wireless sensor network
We performed clustering yearly network keywords ACM dataset keyword appear multiple cluster using cluster measured similarity keywords We found list term clustered together network connectivity period though connected least document
We examined top frequently used keywords various degree separation see Hoonlor et al
result
During period simulation clustered many keywords database research including integration data warehouse relational database although either used used rarely author describe research simulation
Simulation instead clustered information retrieval feature selection filtering well topic related data mining machine learning artificial intelligence used directly describe research project often enough
Data mining rarely used describe research related mobile network related research topic

We used cSpade sequence mining algorithm analyze sequence publication major research category author requiring gap publication date appearance least document
We recorded maximum length publication sequence category measured percentage change number publication given author first year category
From author whose publication category calculated time took number author continued publishing paper category reduce half
For first analysis used ACM CCS identify major research category performed analysis using list conference six CS category finding rate publication growth differed category see Hoonlor et al
detail
We found relatively short time well significant drop rate especially computer application computing milieu data keywords indicating author category either briefly involved multiple research topic briefly collaborated someone else category
Researchers computer system organization computing methodology information system tended stay active category longer time
Moreover found difficult researcher publish artificial intelligence programming language year year unlike say interaction
Researchers interaction remain active longest followed researcher computer architecture see Hoonlor et al
detail
Note researcher continue publish one area long time area evolves may cover different topic different time period example interaction focused mainly interaction design visual design cooperative work augmented reality computer vision human factor ubiquitous computing early finally shifting social medium learning communication tangible user interface late
Investigating selected four prominent CS researcher analyzed publication discussed result
Jack Dongarra University Tennessee Knoxville renowned developing linear algebra software package system though interest evolved time
In example focused parallel algorithm linear equation routine linear algebra subprogram
In early focused parallel solution eigenvalue problem numerical software library system
From late focused linear algebra package multicore system
More recently also focused performance grid computing
Overall research interest evolved continuously response challenge created new computer technology
Another researcher area Francine Berman Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy NY characterized work mathematical modeling mapping scheduling problem
In early paper used keywords performance algorithm
From late focused grid computing bottom perspective job distribution performance
She described evolution broadening branching approach
Since made major shift cyberinfrastructure data preservation
In early George Cybenko Dartmouth College Hanover NH studied computing classification neural network
In late shifted mobile agent mobile network simulation
In early focused target tracking analyzing data extracting information Web wireless network
Since investigated privacy security issue including cybersecurity saying investigates subject le phase discovers open field often related previous work
One exception major shift moving one university another
As final example James Hendler Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy NY worked artificial intelligence since late
His major shift planning Web intelligence semantic Web
From late early work focused planning artificial intelligence later agent system Web technology
In focused mainly semantic Web past year also large data social network
Overall CS faculty research interest typically evolve every five year broadening scope branching new application well responding technological innovation
Less frequently perhaps career major shift new area

Using framework analyzing evolution social community developed Goldberg et tracked evolution CS researcher community searching overlapping community consecutive time period
We used network author represented bipartite graph node representing paper edge node representing paper author see table
plot number community survived one year next ACM IEEE datasets
The table list average evolutionary chain length average cluster size average size intersection two four consecutive cluster average relative density
We found recovered cluster high average relative density datasets
The average length evolutionary chain year approximately two core researcher associated cluster
This finding consistent typical university team consisting one two stable faculty three five graduate student postdoc joining leaving continuously
Every four year stable researcher typically remained original research group
Most CS publication mention keyword algorithm surprising abstract mention one topic related database neural network Internet
Our investigation also found Web become attractive source data application testbeds pulling various researcher working data mining information retrieval cloud computing network
Most research related Internet done since even though concept introduced shortly standardization protocol suite early
Web page evolved simple text written language HTML XML semantic Web ontology key component information retrieval human machine
While overall trend provide clear picture direction topic taking fraction publication topic oscillates year year point direction change one year consistently reversed subsequent year
The pattern reflected number grant awarded topic year
Since novelty prized publication grant application author tend stress novel aspect work abstract keywords contributing observed pattern
We also found strong evidence money preceding research research topic burst term NSF grant first likely burst publication within year
The opposite pattern least twice le frequent
Hence conclude funding necessary initial growth CS research topic essential maintaining research momentum researcher interest
Most author manage publish year particular research field
Moreover author tend publish major research category year
Only fraction continues publish field year year long time
This agrees well model academic research team permanent faculty represent small fraction overall team faculty student postdoc latter routinely changing topic leaving team
Moreover faculty member often active one area
Finally since novelty prized author tend pursue new direction research reflected article abstract keywords contributing observed pattern

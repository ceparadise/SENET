A instruction cause computer begin executing different instruction sequence thus deviate default behavior executing instruction order
may also refer act switching execution different instruction sequence result executing branch instruction
A branch instruction either always result branching may may cause branching depending condition
Branch instruction used implement program loop conditionals executing particular sequence instruction certain condition satisfied
Mechanically branch instruction change PC
The program counter memory address next instruction
Therefore branch cause CPU begin fetching instruction different sequence memory cell
When branch CPU program counter set jump instruction
So next instruction becomes instruction address
Therefore flow control change
When branch CPU program counter unchanged
Therefore next instruction executed instruction branch instruction
Therefore flow control unchanged
The term used referring program high level language well program written
In branch usually take form various form encapsulate instruction sequence executed condition satisfied
Unconditional branch instruction used unconditionally jump begin execution different instruction sequence
Machine level branch instruction sometimes called instruction
Machine level jump instruction typically form latter may depending condition
Usually distinct form jump often called subroutine invokations known automatically save originating address return address stack allowing single subroutine invoked multiple location code
In CPUs earlier instruction set condition flag register
The earlier instruction may instruction
It often close branch though necessarily instruction branch
The stored condition used branch
This temporary information often stored flag register may also located elsewhere
A flag register design simple slower simple computer
In fast computer flag register place bottleneck speed instruction could otherwise operate parallel several need set flag bit particular sequence
There also machine particular instruction condition may checked jump instruction
In simple computer design comparison branch execute arithmetic use power flag register branch
In fast computer design comparison branch run faster flag register branch comparison branch access register parallelism using CPU mechanism calculation
Some early simple CPU architecture still found microcontrollers may implement conditional jump rather conditional skip next instruction operation
A conditional jump call thus implemented conditional skip unconditional jump call instruction
Depending jump instruction typically shortened form word word often along informative letter extra parameter representing condition
Sometimes detail included well range jump offset size special addressing mode used locate actual effective offset
This table list machine level branch jump instruction found several architecture VAX others set signal clear signal
ARM PIC others opposite subtractive operation
This inverted function carry flag certain instruction marked part table otherwise noted
However carry additive operation handled way architecture
To achieve high performance modern processor
They consist multiple part partially process instruction feed result next stage pipeline start working next instruction program
This design expects instruction execute particular unchanging sequence
Conditional branch instruction make impossible know sequence
So conditional branch cause stall pipeline restarted different part program
Several technique improve speed reducing stall conditional branch
Historically branch prediction took statistic used result optimize code
A programmer would compile test version program run test data
The test code counted branch actually taken
The statistic test code used compiler optimize branch released code
The optimization would arrange fastest branch direction taken would always frequently taken control flow path
To permit CPUs must designed least predictable branch timing
Some CPUs even instruction set designed branch hint compiler tell CPU branch taken
The problem software branch prediction requires complex software development process
To run software hardware moved statistic electronics
Branch predictor part processor guess outcome conditional branch
Then processor logic gamble guess beginning execute expected instruction flow
An example simple hardware branch prediction scheme assume backward branch
smaller program counter taken part loop forward branch larger program counter taken leave loop
Better branch predictor developed validated statistically running simulation variety test program
Good predictor usually count outcome previous execution branch
Faster expensive computer run faster investing better branch prediction electronics
In CPU hardware branch prediction branch hint let compiler presumably superior branch prediction override hardware simplistic branch prediction
Some logic written without branch fewer branch
It often possible use instead branch
Another technique
In approach one instruction branch always executed
Therefore computer use instruction useful work whether pipeline stall
This approach historically popular computer
In family compatible CPUs complicates multicycle CPUs pipeline faster CPUs pipeline superscalar CPUs execute instruction order

Software written ISA run different implementation ISA
This enabled different generation computer easily achieved development computer family
Both development helped lower cost computer increase applicability
For reason ISA one important abstraction today
An ISA defines everything need know order program computer
What ISA defines differs ISAs general ISAs define supported state semantics set comprises computer machine language model
An instruction set architecture distinguished set technique used particular processor implement instruction set
Processors different microarchitectures share common instruction set

Architectures even le complexity studied MISC OISC
These theoretically important type commercialized
built discrete
On processing architecture given instruction may specify More complex operation built combining simple instruction executed sequentially otherwise directed instruction
Examples operation common many instruction set include Processors may include complex instruction instruction set
A single complex instruction something may take many instruction computer
Such instruction instruction take multiple step control multiple functional unit otherwise appear larger scale bulk simple instruction implemented given processor
Some example complex instruction include Complex instruction common CISC instruction set RISC instruction set RISC instruction set may include well

In VLIW architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous opcodes operand specified single instruction
Some exotic instruction set opcode field TTA operand
The instruction set lack operand specifier field including NOSC
Conditional instruction often predicate bit encode specific condition cause operation performed rather performed
For example conditional branch instruction executed branch taken condition true execution proceeds different part program executed branch taken condition false execution continues sequentially
Some instruction set also conditional move move executed data stored target location condition true executed target location modified condition false
Similarly IBM conditional store instruction
A instruction set include predicate field every instruction called
The size length instruction varies widely little four bit many hundred bit VLIW system
Processors used instruction size bit
The longest possible instruction byte bit
Within instruction set different instruction may different length
In architecture notably RISC typically corresponding architecture
In architecture instruction variable length typically integral multiple
Some variable encoding two fixed usually encoding instruction mixed freely must switched branch exception boundary
A RISC instruction set normally fixed instruction length often byte bit whereas typical CISC instruction set may instruction widely varying length byte
instruction le complicated handle instruction several reason check whether instruction straddle cache line virtual memory page boundary instance therefore somewhat easier optimize speed
The instruction constituting program rarely specified using internal numeric form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
The design instruction set complex issue
There two stage history microprocessor
The first CISC Complex Instruction Set Computer many different instruction
In however place like IBM research found many instruction set could eliminated
The result RISC Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture us smaller set instruction
A simpler instruction set may offer potential higher speed reduced processor size reduced power consumption
However complex set may optimize common operation improve memory efficiency simplify programming
Some instruction set designer reserve one opcodes kind
For example us us eight code CF DF EF FF use code range
Fast virtual machine much easier implement instruction set meet
The used much easier implement unprogrammed state memory interpreted
On system multiple processor algorithm much easier implement instruction set includes support something atomic
Any given instruction set implemented variety way
All way implementing particular instruction set provide implementation instruction set able run executables
The various way implementing instruction set give different tradeoff cost performance power consumption size etc
When designing processor engineer use block electronic circuitry often designed separately adder multiplexer counter register ALUs etc
Some kind often used describe decoding sequencing instruction ISA using physical microarchitecture
There two basic way build implement description although many design use middle way compromise Some design use combination hardwired design microcode control unit
Some CPU design use compile instruction set writable inside CPU processor FPGA
An ISA also software
Naturally due interpretation overhead slower directly running program emulated hardware unless hardware running emulator order magnitude faster
Today common practice vendor new ISAs microarchitectures make software emulator available software developer hardware implementation ready
Often detail implementation strong influence particular instruction selected instruction set
For example many implementation allow single memory load memory store per instruction leading RISC
For another example early way implementing led
The demand digital signal processing pushed opposite instruction implemented particular way
For example perform digital filter fast enough MAC instruction typical DSP must use kind fetch instruction two data word simultaneously requires
In early computer memory expensive minimizing size program make sure would fit limited memory often central
Thus combined size instruction needed perform particular task important characteristic instruction set
Computers high code density often complex instruction procedure entry parameterized return loop etc
therefore retroactively named
However typical frequent CISC instruction merely combine basic ALU operation add access one operand memory using direct indirect indexed etc
Certain architecture may allow two three operand including result directly memory may able perform function automatic pointer increment etc
instruction set may even complex powerful instruction
first widely implemented period rapidly growing memory subsystem
They sacrifice code density simplify implementation circuitry try increase performance via higher clock frequency register
A single RISC instruction typically performs single operation add register load memory location register
A RISC instruction set normally fixed whereas typical CISC instruction set instruction widely varying length
However RISC computer normally require often longer instruction implement given task inherently make le optimal use bus bandwidth cache memory
Certain embedded RISC ISAs like typically exhibit high density owing technique called code compression
This technique pack two instruction one instruction unpacked decode stage executed two instruction
MISC form separate instruction multiple instruction fit single machine word
These type core often take little silicon implement easily realized form
The code density MISC similar code density RISC increased instruction density offset requiring primitive instruction task
There research mechanism improving code density
The mathematics describes challenge limit
Instruction set may categorized maximum number operand specified instruction
In example follow direct calculated address referring memory cell refer machine register
Due large number bit needed encode three register instruction RISC architecture instruction invariably design Atmel AVR version
RISC architecture instruction usually design architecture
Each instruction specifies number operand register memory location immediate value
Some instruction give one operand implicitly stored top implicit register
If operand given implicitly fewer operand need specified instruction
When destination operand explicitly specifies destination additional operand must supplied
Consequently number operand encoded instruction may differ mathematically necessary number argument logical arithmetic operation
Operands either encoded opcode representation instruction else given value address following instruction
measure availability free register point time program execution
Register pressure high large number available register use thus higher register pressure often register content must memory
Increasing number register architecture decrease register pressure increase cost
While embedded instruction set suffer extremely high register pressure small register set RISC ISAs like enjoy low register pressure
CISC ISAs like offer low register pressure despite smaller register set
This due many addressing mode optimization addressing memory operand ALU instruction absolute addressing addressing spill CISC ISAs offer

What role stack microprocessor
Stack used largely function call depending language level programming may used temporarily store processor register data variable
Further stack may also used storage data using store partial data stack call
The And yes stack also used
Its nature carrying called function return back coupled weakness check language give nice way cause stack vulnerable unsafely written program
At lowest level stack place certain instruction store retrieve data data stored interrupt occurs
Microprocesors vary general type instruction When processor interrupt occurs due external device CPU save current program counter usually flag register stack jump handling subroutine
This allows handling subroutine process interrupt return whatever CPU current state preserved
While microprocessor one stack active time operating system make appear multiple stack
At least one OS one process one thread
In fact thread may implement multiple stack
At higher level whatever language used implement thread often use stack purpose store functional call parameter local variable function call return value speaking broad stroke consult language documentation specific detail
Thus concludes explanation stack
In ancient time subroutine call handled word memory RAM subroutine indicate called
To call subroutine one would something like This pattern might optimized caller place return address register routine store return spot entry
This pattern worked problem
Not generally waste memory also mean dealing recursive code
Adding stack made possible simplify code caller simply say store return address someplace suitable without disturbing earlier one called function simply say return recent caller returned yet
This allowed development code meant necessary store enough return address handle deepest nested chain function call would ever actually occur
It depends microprocessor
Generally role keeping local variable function parameter
And actually microprocessor central memory
Stack used function call
Its put good use nested function call recursive function call
It also used
On microprocessor also used context switch
cheer Some microprocessor improve efficiency take look wikipedia others microstack microroutines
It wide term fact
The stack temporary store data
The CPU may PUSH important data onto stack processing data
When finish task PULLS saved data stack
Its like pile plate
The bottom plate first bit data pushed onto stack
The top plate last data pushed
The top plate pulled first bottom plate last data pulled
It LAST IN FIRST OUT stack
In diagram X first pushed Y lastly A
The CPU go away process data
Upon completion task return pull saved data
First A pulled Y lastly X
The instruction pushing data PHA
Only data accumulator pushed onto stack
Other data pushed transferred accumulator first
The instruction pulling data stack PLA
Data stack transferred accumulator
The stack consists byte occupies page address
Just add answer micros PIC line callstack mean dynamically allocated hardware
The implication go many function call deep run stack true software also course often hardware based stack limiting require rethink program order function call
A stack implementation LIFO Last In First Out buffer
The FIFO First In First Out also known queue
But back LIFO
Stacks architecture allow software designer dispense strange stuff return address register interrupt return address register found RISC processor
reside stack mean single standardized unified method handling variable return
The use method separate stack simplifies implementation
RISC contrast us buffer though keep significatnt part related info elsewhere
RISC stack may faster sure definitely difficult understand
Actually stack teminology processor used language routine call
A routine use stack get parameter save local variable also call routine

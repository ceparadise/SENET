In duplication critical function system intention increasing reliability usually form backup improve actual system performance case receiver computer processing
In many system part control system may triplicated formally termed TMR
An error one component may two
In triply redundant system system three sub component three must fail system fails
Since one rarely fails sub component expected fail independently probability three failing calculated extraordinarily small often outweighed risk factor human error
Redundancy may also known term majority voting system voting logic
Redundancy sometimes produce le instead greater reliability creates complex system prone various issue may lead human neglect duty may lead higher production demand overstressing system may make le safe
In computer science four major form redundancy A modified form software redundancy applied hardware may usually designed redundant part well ensuring one part fails entire structure collapse
A structure without redundancy called meaning single broken component cause collapse entire structure
Bridges failed due lack redundancy include
Parallel combined system demonstrate different level redundancy
The model subject study reliability safety engineering
The two function redundancy passive redundancy
Both function prevent performance decline exceeding specification limit without human intervention using extra capacity
Passive redundancy us excess capacity reduce impact component failure
One common form passive redundancy extra strength cabling strut used bridge
This extra strength allows structural component fail without bridge collapse
The extra strength used design called margin safety
Eyes ear provide working example passive redundancy
Vision loss one eye cause blindness depth perception impaired
Hearing loss one ear cause deafness directionality impaired
Performance decline commonly associated passive redundancy limited number failure occur
Active redundancy eliminates performance decline monitoring performance individual device monitoring used voting logic
The voting logic linked switching automatically reconfigures component
Error detection correction Global Positioning System GPS two example active redundancy
Electrical power distribution provides example active redundancy
Several power line connect generation facility customer
Each power line includes monitor detect overload
Each power line also includes circuit breaker
The combination power line provides excess capacity
Circuit breaker disconnect power line monitor detect overload
Power redistributed across remaining line
author said sometimes redundancy backfire produce le reliability
This may happen three way First redundant safety device result complex system prone error accident
Second redundancy may lead shirking responsibility among worker
Third redundancy may lead increased production pressure resulting system operates higher speed le safely
Voting logic us performance monitoring determine reconfigure individual component operation continues without violating specification limitation overall system
Voting logic often involves computer system composed item computer may reconfigured using voting logic
Circuit breaker example form voting logic
Electrical power system use reconfigure active redundancy
Computing system adjust production output generating facility generating facility suddenly lost
This prevents blackout condition major event earthquake
The simplest voting logic computing system involves two component primary alternate
They run similar software output alternate remains inactive normal operation
The primary monitor periodically sends activity message alternate long everything All output primary stop including activity message primary detects fault
The alternate activates output take primary brief delay activity message cease
Errors voting logic cause output active inactive time cause output flutter
A reliable form voting logic involves odd number three device
All perform identical function output compared voting logic
The voting logic establishes majority disagreement majority act deactivate output device disagree
A single fault interrupt normal operation
This technique used system responsible operation
Each duplicate component added system decrease probability system failure according formula This formula assumes independence failure event
That mean probability component B failing given component A already failed B failing A failed
There situation unreasonable using two power supply connected socket way one power supply failed would
It also assumes one component needed keep system running

The term refer mixture material chemistry
The difference heterogeneous homogeneous mixture degree material mixed together uniformity composition
A mixture component make mixture uniformly distributed throughout mixture
The composition mixture throughout
There one observed homogeneous mixture
So would observe liquid gas liquid solid homogeneous mixture
There several example homogeneous mixture encountered everyday life You ca pick component homogeneous mixture use simple mechanical mean separate
You ca see individual chemical ingredient type mixture
Only one phase matter present homogeneous mixture
mixture component mixture uniform localized region different property
Different sample mixture identical
There always two phase heterogeneous mixture identify region property distinct another region even state matter liquid solid
Heterogeneous mixture common homogeneous mixture
Examples include Usually possible physically separate component heterogeneous mixture
For example centrifuge spin solid blood cell separate plasma blood
You remove ice cube soda
You separate candy according color
Mostly difference two type mixture matter scale
If look closely sand beach see different component shell coral sand organic matter
It heterogeneous mixture
If however view large volume sand distance impossible discern different type particle
The mixture homogeneous
This seem confusing
To identify nature mixture consider sample size
If see one phase matter different region sample heterogeneous
If composition mixture appears uniform matter sample mixture homogeneous
There error
Please try

Computer cluster may configured different purpose ranging general purpose business need support scientific calculation
In either case cluster may use approach
Note attribute described exclusive computer cluster may also use approach
cluster configuration share computational workload provide better overall performance
For example web server cluster may assign different query different node overall response time optimized
However approach may significantly differ among application
cluster used scientific computation would balance load different algorithm cluster may use simple assigning new request different node
Computer cluster used purpose rather handling operation web service database

One issue designing cluster tightly coupled individual node may
For instance single computer job may require frequent communication among node implies cluster share dedicated network densely located probably homogeneous node
The extreme computer job us one node need little communication approaching
In Beowulf system application program never see computational node also called slave computer interact Master specific computer handling scheduling management slave
In typical implementation Master two network interface one communicates private Beowulf network slave general purpose network organization
The slave computer typically version operating system local memory disk space
However private slave network may also large shared file server store global persistent data accessed slave needed
A special purpose tuned running astrophysical simulation using parallel treecode rather general purpose scientific computation
Due increasing computing power generation novel use emerged repurposed HPC cluster
Some example game console cluster cluster
Another example consumer game product workstation us multiple graphic accelerator processor chip
Besides game console graphic card used instead
The use graphic card rather GPU calculation grid computing vastly economical using CPU despite le precise
However using value become precise work CPU still much le costly purchase cost

The cluster may also virtualized various configuration maintenance take place
An example implementation virtualization manager
As computer cluster appearing
One element distinguished three class time early supercomputer relied
To date cluster typically use physically shared memory many supercomputer architecture also abandoned
However use essential modern computer cluster
Examples include Microsoft
Two widely used approach communication cluster node MPI PVM
PVM developed around MPI available
PVM must directly installed every cluster node provides set software library paint node parallel virtual machine
PVM provides environment task resource management fault notification
PVM used user program written C Fortran etc
MPI emerged early discussion among organization
The initial effort supported
Rather starting anew design MPI drew various feature available commercial system time
The MPI specification gave rise specific implementation
MPI implementation typically use socket connection
MPI widely available communication model enables parallel program written language etc
Thus unlike PVM provides concrete implementation MPI specification implemented system
One challenge use computer cluster cost administrating time high cost administrating N independent machine cluster N node
In case provides advantage lower administration cost
This also made popular due ease administration
When large cluster need access large amount data becomes challenge
In heterogeneous cluster complex application environment performance job depends characteristic underlying cluster
Therefore mapping task onto CPU core GPU device provides significant challenge

Computer Science encompasses theoretical practical approach computation
It said The ACM eighteen knowledge area We really separate data structure algorithm While possible study algorithm data structure exclusively theoretical level often study together introductory software engineering concept major topic grouping roughly follows During design system algorithm written data structure sketched must first
A collection value example A type together operation
An ADT data type internal structure internal working object type unknown user type
Users see effect operation
Types operation given picture signature A group element treated single object
Most ADTs seem collection type
Collection type The latter classification look like Operations common collection include A arrangement data purpose able store retrieve information
Usually data structure physical representation ADT
Data structure built The data structure chosen data type must meet resource constraint problem
Figure constraint start coding
These extremely important question must ask determine acceptable tradeoff We design algorithm carry desired software system
Good programmer tend use stepwise refinement developing algorithm understand tradeoff different algorithm problem
There several classification scheme algorithm This classification proved useful Choosing right algorithm

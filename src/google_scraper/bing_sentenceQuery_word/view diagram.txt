Venn diagram going nickname primary diagram set diagram logic diagram widely known
This kind diagram show possible logical relation finite collection different set
These diagram depict element point plane well set region inside closed curve
A Venn diagram consists multiple overlapping closed curve usually represented circle represents set
The point inside curve labeled S represent element set S point outside boundary represent element set S
In Venn diagram curve overlapped different way showing possible relation existing set
This kind diagram invented year paper work named On Diagrammatic Mechanical Representation Propositions Reasonings John Venn Philosophical Magazine Journal Science used teach elementary set theory well illustrate simple set relationship logic linguistics probability computer science
Venn never used term Venn diagram referred invention Eulerian Circles
An scaled Venn diagram Venn diagram area shape proportional number element contains
Venn diagram general similar Euler diagram invented Leonhard Euler century
Baron noted Leibniz century produced similar diagram Euler unpublished
In century Venn diagram better developed Henderson showed existence diagram rotational symmetry implied n prime number mean natural number greater positive divisor
Henderson also showed symmetric Venn diagram exist n
In year Peter Hamburger found symmetric Venn diagram n Griggs Killian Savage showed symmetric Venn diagram exist prime
Thus rotationally symmetric Venn diagram exist n prime number
Venn diagram Euler diagram incorporated part instruction set theory part new math movement
Since also adopted curriculum field
A Venn diagram built using collection simple closed curve plane
The principle diagram class also known set represented region relation one another possible logical relation class set indicated diagram
That diagram initially leaf room possible relation class
The actual given relation within diagram specified indicating particular region null
Venn diagram normally comprise overlapping circle
The inner part circle aid symbol represents element set
The exterior though implies element included set
For example Venn diagram one circle may represent group object made wood another circle may represent set table
The overlapping region would represent set wooden table
Any shape circle employed shown Venn higher set diagram
Venn diagram contain information relative absolute size set similar Euler diagram mentioned
However Venn diagram n component set must contain hypothetically possible zone correspond combination inclusion exclusion component set
The difference Euler diagram Venn diagram Euler diagram contain actually possible zone given context
In Venn diagram though shaded zone may represent empty zone
At time Euler diagram corresponding zone missing diagram
As example imagine one set representing dairy product another one cheese
In case Venn diagram contains zone cheese dairy product
Thus context cheese mean type dairy product Euler diagram cheese zone entirely contained within one zone cheese
In case Euler diagram typically le visually complex similar Venn diagram especially number intersection small

A symbolic according technique
Diagrams used since ancient time became prevalent
Sometimes technique us visualization onto surface
The word sometimes used diagram
The term diagram commonly used sense general specific meaning In science term used way
For example Anderson stated generally diagram pictorial yet abstract representation information example diagram whereas photograph video
On hand Lowe defined diagram specifically abstract graphic portrayal subject matter represent
In specific sense diagram chart contrast technical illustration map showing abstract rather representation information
The essence diagram seen Or Hall word diagram simplified figure caricature way intended convey essential meaning
These simplified figure often based set rule
The basic shape according White characterized term elegance clarity ease pattern simplicity validity
Elegance basically determined whether diagram simplest fitting solution problem
There least following type diagram type diagram Many type diagram commonly generated using diagramming software
Thousands diagram technique exist
Some example follow
Diagrams may also classified according use purpose example explanatory diagram

A way modelling domain level detail much domain model
Inside design class diagram class become object Objects created according Object Class Definition
An Object Class definition type template creating object
It includes declaration attribute operation associated object class
In UML object class represented section object attribute object operation
An example shown using object class model If one thing Object Oriented way top section would declaration variable bottom section
Now going get bog fast warning hehe
Now part need read An exam contains different type question Using draw Domain Model Design Class Diagram Domain
First thing first need identify Classes
Well quite obviously Classes straight top BUT look see
Well saw inherit something right inherit Question think one contain something variable operation etc etc really want write declaration time
But Multiple Choice question
They contain multiple answer surely need type could use Multiple Choice Question Options That mean class
So quick guidance Domain Model look like Here
Aside
I realised missed something im sooo sorry So yeah extra feature inside Design Class Diagram besides bleeding These extra feature forgot mention I think either leave comment email uni come bother hahaha OK go
Using Domain Model Design Class Diagram Domain Model
This look good take look

A capture idea represents entity relationship
A conceptual model field special case general
To distinguish type model also known
Conceptual modeling confused modeling discipline physical modelling
The conceptual model explicitly chosen independent design implementation concern example concurrency data storage
The aim conceptual model express meaning term concept used domain expert discus problem find correct relationship different concept
The conceptual model attempt clarify meaning various usually ambiguous term ensure problem different interpretation term concept occur
Such differing interpretation could easily cause confusion amongst stakeholder especially responsible designing implementing solution conceptual model provides key artifact business understanding clarity
Once domain concept modeled model becomes basis subsequent development application domain
The concept conceptual model mapped physical design implementation construct using either manual
The realization conceptual model many domain combined coherent platform
A conceptual model described using various notation object modelling
In UML notation conceptual model often described represent concept represent relationship concept association represent role type taken instance modelled concept various situation
In ER notation conceptual model described ER Diagram entity represent concept represent relationship concept
Regardless notation used important compromise richness clarity business meaning depicted conceptual model expressing directly form influenced design implementation concern
This often used defining different process particular company institute

Today UML accepted Object Management Group OMG standard modeling software development
UML stand Unified Modeling Language
UML helped extend original UML specification cover wider portion software development effort including agile practice
The key making UML diagram connecting shape represent object class shape illustrate relationship flow information data
To learn creating UML diagram The current UML standard call different type diagram class activity object use case sequence package state component communication composite structure interaction overview timing deployment
These diagram organized two distinct group structural diagram behavioral interaction diagram
Structural UML diagram Behavioral UML diagram backbone almost every method including UML
They describe static structure system
Package diagram subset class diagram developer sometimes treat separate technique
Package diagram organize element system related group minimize dependency package
Object diagram describe static structure system particular time
They used test class diagram accuracy
Composite structure diagram show internal part class
model functionality system using actor use case
illustrate dynamic nature system modeling flow control activity activity
An activity represents operation class system result change state system
Typically activity diagram used model workflow business process internal operation
describe interaction among class term exchange message time
Interaction overview diagram combination activity sequence diagram
They model sequence action let deconstruct complex interaction manageable occurrence
You use notation interaction overview diagram would see activity diagram
A timing diagram type behavioral interaction UML diagram focus process take place specific period time
They special instance sequence diagram except time shown increase left right instead top
Communication diagram model interaction object sequence
They describe static structure dynamic behavior system
In many way communication diagram simplified version collaboration diagram introduced UML known state machine diagram state diagram describe dynamic behavior system response external stimulus
State diagram especially useful modeling reactive object whose state triggered specific event
describe organization physical software component including source code binary code executables

Deployment diagram depict physical resource system including node component connection
There many different type UML diagram slightly different symbol set
Class diagram perhaps one common UML diagram used class diagram symbol center around defining attribute class
For example symbol active class interface
A class symbol also divided show class operation attribute responsibility
Visibility class member marked notation Lines also important symbol denote relationship component
Generalization Inheritance denoted empty arrowhead
Composition shown filled diamond
Aggregation shown empty diamond
Dependencies marked dashed line arrow
Using allows indicate property dependency
Multiplicity usually shown number one end arrow
Package diagram symbol defining package look like folder
Activity diagram symbol activity state including separate symbol initial state final state
The control flow usually shown arrow object flow shown dashed arrow
Use case diagram symbol actor use case

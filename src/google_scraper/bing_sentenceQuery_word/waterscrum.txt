hybrid approach combine development methodology
Generally speaking development team us waterfall approach regard development process software product one large project
At end project team release working software operation team installation maintenance
Typically business owner also called see finished product
In contrast development team us Scrum methodology would approach development project series small project called
Working software released periodically manner entire software product complete
Typically project business owner play active role throughout process join development team release
A flexible approach embrace traditional Agile development principle allows development team use whatever practice technique best meet need problem solved
Many organization use Agile principle Scrum communication technique product development employ traditional waterfall methodology planning budgeting documenting project progress
The need flexibility also given rise movement called approach blend task performed company development system operation team

What difference Scrum Agile Development
Are Sprint Iterations
Scrum one many iterative incremental agile software development method
You find detailed description process
In SCRUM methodology sprint basic unit development
Each sprint start planning meeting task sprint identified estimated commitment sprint goal made
A Sprint end review retrospective meeting progress reviewed lesson next sprint identified
During sprint team creates finished portion product
In Agile method iteration involves team working full software development cycle including planning requirement analysis design coding unit testing acceptance testing working product demonstrated stakeholder
So SCRUM sprint perform software development phase requirement analysis acceptance testing opinion say SCRUM sprint correspond AGILE iteration
As mentioned others Scrum iterative incremental agile software development method managing software project product application development
So Scrum fact type Agile approach used widely software development
So Scrum specific flavor Agile specifically referred agile project management framework
Also Scrum mainly two role inside
Role
Ancillary Role role It consists mainly three role
Scrum Master b
Product Owner c
Development Team
Ancillary Role The ancillary role Scrum team formal role infrequent involvement Scrum procession nonetheless must taken account
viz
Stakeholders Managers
Scrum Master There type meeting scrum Let know one need input
How Scrum fit Agile Development
While Agile methodology applied product development software industry industry well Scrum specific software development
Scrum methodology
It simply provides structure discipline framework Agile development
The whole project made series Sprints Sprint Cycles n Sprint duration
If denoted T Tn
Sprints could anywhere week
Sprints shorter week ideal used le frequently
At end Sprint functional working piece software produced user actually test
Original article SCRUM SCRUM type Agile approach
It Framework Methodology
It provide detailed instruction need done rather dependent team developing software
Because developing project know problem solved much left team essential case scrum
There team leader case assign task team member rather whole team address issue problem
It way everyone involved project right idea implementation project
The advantage scrum direction adjusted based completed work speculation prediction
Roles Involved Product Owner Scrum Master Team Members Agile Methodology Build Software application unpredictable nature Iterative incremental work cadence called sprint used methodology
Both Agile SCRUM follows system feature developed part sprint end sprint feature completed right coding testing integration product
A demonstration functionality provided owner end sprint feedback taken helpful next sprint
Manifesto Agile Development That value item right value item left
Agile Scrum term used project management
The Agile methodology employ incremental iterative work beat also called sprint
Scrum hand type agile approach used software development
Agile practice Scrum process following practice eXtreme Programming XP Kanban alternative process following Agile development practice
Waterfall methodology sequential design process
This mean eight stage conception initiation analysis design construction testing implementation maintenance completed developer move next step
As process sequential step completed developer go back previous step without scratching whole project starting beginning
room change error project outcome extensive plan must set beginning followed careful came disadvantage waterfall methodology
Instead sequential design process Agile methodology follows incremental approach
Developers start simplistic project design begin work small module
The work module done weekly monthly sprint end sprint project priority evaluated test run
These sprint allow bug discovered customer feedback incorporated design next sprint run
The process lack initial design step often criticized collaborative nature focus principle rather process
At outset I say Agile evolutionary methodology Unified Process focus Iterative Incremental Development IID
IID emphasizes iterative development construction phase actual coding incremental delivery
It would emphasize Requirements Analysis Inception Design Elaboration handled iteration
So Iteration mini project
In Agile take IDD bit adding reality like Team Collaboration Evolutionary Requirements Design etc
And SCRUM tool enable considering human factor building around Group principle
So Sprint mini project bettering pure IID model
So iteration implemented Agile way yes theoretically Sprints highlighting size iteration small delivery quick
I really differentiate Agile SCRUM I see SCRUM natural way putting Agile principle use

Recently I learnt new methodology based waterfall scrum
Some say new reality scrum pragmatist use nowadays
But definition Avalanche The Avalanche model Software Engineering project management combination sequential process Waterfall model Agile software development methodology What think two model
Are
More info Please clarify specific problem add additional detail highlight exactly need
As currently written hard tell exactly asking
See page help clarifying question
essentially development process applied development team work usually implementation step waterfall previous project management system remains place
Those article primarily listing reality shop development team full control process agile used across entire project
I believe either one really trying say adopted somewhat common
The second article focused company find model improve without massive process redesign
Avalanche best described faulty implementation scrum waterfall
Each iterates rapidly subset work communicate result step department
The result often phase happening time entire product
It also characterized extreme breakdown communication
Features often redesigned implemented tested department ca keep track stage feature
The result mass chaos confusion extremely difficult manage project poor morale work regularly read frequently invalidated changing
The key difference two scrum waterfall fundamentally break either model
Avalanche waterfall scrum slow motion catastrophe

In Greek εὑρίσκω I find discover technique designed quickly classic method slow finding approximate solution classic method fail find exact solution
This achieved trading optimality completeness speed
In way considered shortcut
A also called simply rank alternative branching step based available information decide branch follow
For example may approximate exact solution
The objective heuristic produce solution reasonable time frame good enough solving problem hand
This solution may best actual solution problem may simply approximate exact solution
But still valuable finding require prohibitively long time
Heuristics may produce result may used conjunction optimization algorithm improve efficiency may used generate good seed value
Results theoretical computer science make heuristic viable option variety complex optimization problem need routinely solved application
Heuristics underlie whole field Artificial Intelligence computer simulation thinking may used situation known
The criterion deciding whether use heuristic solving given problem include following In case may difficult decide whether solution found heuristic good enough theory underlying heuristic elaborate
One way achieving computational performance gain expected heuristic consists solving simpler problem whose solution also solution initial problem
Such heuristic unable find solution initial problem may find one much faster simple problem easy solve
An example approximation described solving TSP select order draw using
TSP known optimal solution even moderate size problem intractable
Instead used give good optimal solution approximation optimal answer reasonably short amount time
The greedy algorithm heuristic say pick whatever currently best next step regardless whether precludes good step later
It heuristic practice say good enough solution theory say better solution even tell much better case
Another example heuristic making algorithm faster occurs certain search problem
Initially heuristic try every possibility step like search algorithm
But stop search time current possibility already worse best solution already found
In search problem heuristic used try good choice first bad path eliminated early see
In acceptance speech discus heuristic search hypothesis physical symbol system repeatedly generate modify known symbol structure created structure match solution structure
Each successive iteration depends upon step thus heuristic search learns avenue pursue one disregard measuring close current iteration solution
Therefore possibility never generated measured le likely complete solution
A heuristic method accomplish task using search tree
However instead generating possible solution branch heuristic selects branch likely produce outcome branch
It selective decision point picking branch likely produce solution
Many virus scanner use heuristic rule detecting virus form malware
Heuristic scanning look code behavioral pattern indicative class family virus different set rule different virus
If file executing process observed contain matching code pattern performing set activity scanner infers file infected
The advanced part heuristic scanning work highly randomized polymorphic virus simpler string approach reliably detect
Heuristic scanning potential detect many future virus without requiring virus detected somewhere submitted virus scanner developer analyzed detection update scanner provided scanner user
Some heuristic strong underlying theory either derived manner theory inferred experimental data
Others learned empirically without even glimpse theory
The latter exposed number pitfall
When heuristic reused various context seen work one context without mathematically proven meet given set requirement possible current data set necessarily represent future data set see purported solution turn akin noise
conducted employing heuristic estimate probability incorrect outcome
To use heuristic solving problem necessary check heuristic
Given heuristic function meant approximate true optimal distance goal node directed graph containing total node vertex labeled admissible mean
If heuristic admissible may never find goal either ending dead end graph skipping back forth two node
The word heuristic came usage early century
It formed irregularly word meaning find

use following search parameter narrow result

The condensation come temperature cycling inside outside bottle
If water bottle reach higher temperature outside bottle vapor bottle become saturated relative inner surface temperature get condensation
This happen bottle temperature lag behind thermal cycle
car cooling evening bottle exposed heat source like sunlight
But condensation normal water I sure condensation would stay swishing water
Its conceivable condensate would le dissolved solid water bottom bottle I sure would affect surface property water droplet plastic bottle degree droplet would stable presence water
Normally difference surface tension two water would almost nothing
If surface plastic changed location condensate formed might reform droplet rinsing water I ca think good mechanism happening case
Sometimes glass shower door get soap scum form aid droplet formation change surface tension case buildup dissolved solid glass surface allows droplet reform
Is possible principal occurring inside poster water bottle due skin oil saliva secretion adhering bottle wall
Someone else mentioned maybe possible I even seen effect described OP practice
There post another person claimed see effect droplet staying reappearing post deleted
I think answer question I posed second post would help u determine going
If referring post deleted
It got voted reason
Guess people dont believe
removed Are droplet swirling droplet
That droplet colored red would droplet swirling still red
Or would bunch pink water pink droplet
Also droplet droplet
Or slosh water around water stick surface
If poured half new bottle shook would get similar droplet
ok sorry delay reply
My post say I thought original poster
I never really taken effort investigating drop property
Basicly talking least I think water bottle let say car get lot drop inside swirl around seem get pattern drop swirl
It pattern condensation determined something inside bottle instead new random distribution
I sure answer question I never made effort look
I would assume isnt like water drop exact cause make zero sense
Just drop seem form place normal thought would drop would form randomly

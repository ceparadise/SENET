What quote Level Indirection solves every Problem mean Computer Science
Generally mean increasing level abstraction one make problem easier
Be careful abstraction though full quote least I heard You solve every problem another level indirection except problem many level indirection
From book All problem computer science solved another level indirection famous quote attributed Butler Lampson scientist envisioned modern personal computer
Although attribute phrase David Wheeler
Kevlin Henney corollary except problem many layer indirection
It basically mean break problem smaller problem problem easy solve
You break problem several layer The routine top problem solving one indirected abstracted actual mean solving problem making flexible solve problem slightly different way later
Such important concept answer
Generally every problem presented solved necessarily direct code adjustment applying proxy forget pattern definition form
The interception instrumentation event highly undervalued
First must understand mean
Usually mean able provide alternate way solve problem ideally additional benefit
Other time nothing currently working indirection could solution
For example business need We need decide size IP block procure order provide IP addressing site
The problem choose block small need get bigger one
Not must administrator go get another block additional prefix must injected routing table access site
That extra time cost complexity
Is better way
Today IP address mean login located
us level indirection solve routing problem stated
It cost A new LISP capable server must exist map address site Two namespaces required one Location ID And additional benefit Eliminate site renumbering adding new block Reduction size routing table ISP make change moving site one host another Conserves address space locator address space assigned host With LISP ISP allocate fewer address per site The image show new layer indirection LISP solves problem adding simplifies thing altogether simpler
It different many way better
This quote broad implication
The key understanding focus word
Problem programming translating world entity equivalent computing component cost associating computing solution
Lets say trying solve issue cost developing something may want consider another expert work much cheaper time money
This another use indirection By posting answer agree

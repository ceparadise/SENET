Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I preparing presentation work using documentation provided supplier claim made GPON network capacity
Instantly looked odd I know advanced version InfiniBand go
I could find evidence supported supplier claim turning throughput GPON
The colleague given documentation I working said supplier claimed speed independent device network limited Optical Network Units ONUs endpoint device
That seems bit ridiculous considering data optical cable pulse light
Light travel vacuum surely speed network close way speed electromagnetic wave propagation wire I never heard manufacturer claim cable support speed
I brought supplier rep derisively let know capacity throughput
I aware lot people term interchangeable technical standpoint throughput amount data sent network specified amount time capacity
It would seem like capacity optical fibre flash light likely hold
NB question science behind computer data network I belongs despite reference particular hardware
The easiest way think situation say thing network capacity
To ear term capacity make sense data rest storage medium throughput data motion network data motion
I sure people used phrase network capacity mean something specific appear salesperson using way I suggest accept particular example sale literature appears kinda meaningless move
Not mention clever use make claim almost unfalsifiable
Capacity similar many term overloaded word
In example bring seems meaning equivalent throughput maximal amount information
transfer per time unit
However term used interchangeably ear capacity feel theoretical limit throughput feel practical limit
As capacity fiber channel due coding error technical limitation lead maximal throughput YOUR data
A different explanation may used setting one capacity link measured relative term ratio multiplied predefined maximal rate information transfer
This notation useful computing flow network

Why matter
Many people confused operating system report example new Terabyte TB GB hard drive reporting gigabyte GB usable capacity
Several factor may come play see reported capacity disk drive
Unfortunately two different number system used express unit storage capacity binary say kilobyte equal byte decimal say KB equal byte
The storage industry standard display capacity decimal
Even though binary byte decimal representation GB show greater capacity
In order accurately understand true capacity disk drive need know base unit measure binary decimal used represent capacity
Another factor cause misrepresentation size disk drive BIOS limitation
Many older BIOS limited number cylinder support
In past computer professional noticed binary nearly equal decimal started using prefix kilo mean
That worked well enough decade two everybody talked KB knew term implied byte
However almost overnight much numerous everybody bought computer trade computer professional needed talk physicist engineer even ordinary people know kilometer meter kilogram gram
Often two people begin discussing storage capacity refer binary value others refer decimal value without making distinction two
This caused much confusion past
In effort dispatch confusion major disk drive manufacturer use decimal value discussing storage capacity
In example right pie chart two different capacity measure
The first one decimal value total byte
The second value binary equivalent
Those value also represented next Used Space Free Space field

Much information available foundation modern science technology

often called technology consisting component used retain digital
It core function fundamental component computer
The CPU computer manipulates data performing computation
In practice almost computer use put fast expensive small storage option close CPU slower larger cheaper option farther away
Generally fast volatile technology lose data power referred memory slower persistent technology referred storage
In CPU consists two main part The ALU
The former control flow data CPU memory latter performs arithmetic data
Without significant amount memory computer would merely able perform fixed operation immediately output result
It would reconfigured change behavior
This acceptable device desk specialized device
machine differ memory store operating data
Such computer versatile need hardware reconfigured new program simply new instruction also tend simpler design relatively simple processor may keep successive computation build complex procedural result
Most modern computer von Neumann machine
A modern represents using
Text number picture audio nearly form information converted string binary digit value
The common unit storage equal bit
A piece information handled computer device whose storage space large enough accommodate simply
For example page print stored five million bit one byte per character
Data assigning bit pattern object
Many standard exist encoding like image encoding like video encoding like
By adding bit encoded unit redundancy allows computer detect error coded data correct based mathematical algorithm
Errors generally occur low probability due bit value flipping physical bit fatigue loss physical bit storage ability maintain distinguishable value due error inter communication
A random due random typically corrected upon detection
A bit group malfunctioning physical bit always specific defective bit known group definition depends specific storage device typically automatically taken use device replaced another functioning equivalent group device corrected bit value restored possible
The CRC method typically used communication storage
A detected error retried
method allow many case database represent string bit shorter bit string compress reconstruct original string decompress needed
This utilizes substantially le storage ten percent many type data cost computation compress decompress needed
Analysis storage cost saving cost related computation possible delay data availability done deciding whether keep certain data compressed
For certain type data information may kept storage prevent possibility unauthorized information reconstruction chunk storage snapshot
Generally lower storage hierarchy lesser greater access CPU
This traditional division storage primary secondary tertiary storage also guided cost per bit
In contemporary usage memory usually storage typically dynamic RAM form fast temporary storage
Storage consists storage device medium directly accessible typically drive device slower RAM retaining content powered
Historically called
Meanwhile storage device referred
also known often referred simply one directly accessible CPU
The CPU continuously read instruction stored executes required
Any data actively operated also stored uniform manner
Historically used rotating primary storage
By unreliable method mostly replaced
Core memory remained dominant advance technology allowed become economically competitive
This led modern RAM
It light quite expensive time
The particular type RAM used primary storage also
lose information powered
As shown diagram traditionally two primary storage besides main RAM Main memory directly indirectly connected central processing unit via
It actually two bus diagram
The CPU firstly sends number address bus number called indicates desired location data
Then read writes data using data bus
Additionally MMU small device CPU RAM recalculating actual memory address example provide abstraction task
As RAM type used primary storage volatile uninitialized start computer containing storage would source read instruction order start computer
Hence containing small startup program used computer read larger program storage RAM start execute
A technology used purpose called ROM terminology may somewhat confusing ROM type also capable
Many type ROM literally update possible however slow memory must erased large portion
Some run program directly ROM similar program rarely changed
Standard computer store program ROM rather use large capacity secondary storage well costly
Recently us refer historically called respectively
also known differs primary storage directly accessible CPU
The computer usually us channel access secondary storage transfer desired data using primary storage
Secondary storage lose data device powered
Per unit typically also two order magnitude le expensive primary storage
Modern computer system typically two order magnitude secondary storage primary storage data kept longer time
In modern computer usually used secondary storage
The time taken access given byte information stored hard disk typically thousandth second millisecond
By contrast time taken access given byte information stored memory measured billionth second nanosecond
This illustrates significant difference distinguishes memory rotating magnetic storage device hard disk typically million time slower memory
Rotating device drive even longer access time
With disk drive disk head reach proper placement data interest rotates subsequent data track fast access
To reduce seek time rotational latency data transferred disk large contiguous block
When data reside disk accessing large block hide latency offer opportunity design efficient
Sequential block access disk order magnitude faster random access many sophisticated paradigm developed design efficient algorithm based upon sequential block access
Another way reduce bottleneck use multiple disk parallel order increase bandwidth primary secondary memory
Some example secondary storage technology
key standalone
The secondary storage often formatted according format provides abstraction necessary organize data providing also additional information called describing owner certain file access time access permission information
Most computer use concept allowing utilization primary storage capacity physically available system
As primary memory fill system move chunk secondary storage device retrieving later needed
As retrieval slower secondary storage necessary overall system performance degraded
provides third level storage
Typically involves robotic mechanism insert removable mass storage medium storage device according system demand data often copied secondary storage use
It primarily used archiving rarely accessed information since much slower secondary storage
second millisecond
This primarily useful extraordinarily large data store accessed without human operator
Typical example include
When computer need read information tertiary storage first consult catalog determine tape disc contains information
Next computer instruct fetch medium place drive
When computer finished reading information robotic arm return medium place library
Tertiary storage also known near online
The formal distinction online nearline offline storage For example spinning hard disk drive online storage spinning drive spin automatically massive array idle disk nearline storage
Removable medium tape cartridge automatically loaded nearline storage tape cartridge must manually loaded offline storage
computer data storage medium device control
The medium recorded usually secondary tertiary storage device physically removed disconnected
It must inserted connected human operator computer access
Unlike tertiary storage accessed without human interaction
storage used since detached medium easily physically transported
Additionally case disaster example fire destroys original data medium remote location probably unaffected enabling
storage increase general since physically inaccessible computer data confidentiality integrity affected attack technique
Also information stored archival purpose rarely accessed storage le expensive tertiary storage
In modern personal computer secondary tertiary storage medium also used storage
Optical disc flash memory device popular much lesser extent removable hard disk drive
In enterprise us magnetic tape predominant
Older example floppy disk Zip disk punched card
Storage technology level storage hierarchy differentiated evaluating certain core characteristic well measuring characteristic specific particular implementation
These core characteristic volatility mutability accessibility addressability
For particular implementation storage technology characteristic worth measuring capacity performance
retains stored information even constantly supplied electric power
It suitable storage information
requires constant power maintain stored information
The fastest memory technology volatile one although universal rule
Since primary storage required fast predominantly us volatile memory
form volatile memory also requires stored information periodically reread rewritten otherwise would vanish
form volatile memory similar DRAM exception never need refreshed long power applied loses content power supply lost
An UPS used give computer brief window time move information primary volatile storage storage battery exhausted
Some system example integrated battery maintain volatile storage several minute
As commonly used data storage medium semiconductor magnetic optical paper still see limited usage
Some fundamental storage technology used past proposed development

A semiconductor memory chip may contain million tiny
Both form semiconductor memory exist
In modern computer primary storage almost exclusively consists dynamic volatile semiconductor memory
Since turn century type semiconductor memory known steadily gained share storage home computer
semiconductor memory also used secondary storage various advanced electronic device specialized computer designed
As early manufacturer started using SSDs default configuration option secondary storage either addition instead traditional HDD
us different pattern coated surface store information
Magnetic storage
The information accessed using one head may contain one recording transducer
A head cover part surface head medium must moved relative another order access data
In modern computer magnetic storage take form In early computer magnetic storage also used typical store information deformity surface circular disc read information illuminating surface observing reflection
Optical disc storage
The deformity may permanent read medium formed write medium reversible recordable medium
The following form currently common use optical disc storage magnetic state surface store information
The information read optically written combining magnetic optical method

Light induced magnetization melting magnetic photoconductors also proposed consumption storage
typically form long used store information automatic processing particularly computer existed
Information recorded punching hole paper cardboard medium read mechanically later optically determine whether particular location medium solid contained hole
A technology allow people make mark paper easily read widely used tabulating vote grading standardized test
made possible object sold transported computer readable information securely attached
While group bit malfunction may resolved error detection correction mechanism see storage device malfunction requires different solution
The following solution commonly used valid storage device Device mirroring typical RAID designed handle single device failure RAID group device
However second failure occurs RAID group completely repaired first failure data lost
The probability single failure typically small
Thus probability two failure RAID group time proximity much smaller approximately probability squared multiplied
If database tolerate even smaller probability data loss RAID group replicated mirrored
In many case mirroring done geographically remotely different storage array handle also recovery disaster see disaster recovery

I studying lisp language lisp routine general context know routine technical context talk starting learn routine
So real definition routine
already googled find anything The term derives common term language like BASIC one actually creates SUBroutines
BASIC actually difference SUBroutine FUNCTION nevertheless From Wikipedia entry In computer science subroutine As name subprogram suggests subroutine behaves much way computer program used one step larger program another subprogram
A subroutine often coded started called several time several place single execution program including subroutine branch back return next instruction call subroutine task done
Different different ecosystem thus different term describe general concept
I generally use term OOP environment day
Happy coding
For fun I Community
The list hopefully cover term correct widely accepted use given language mean
Informally used context language omitted unless defacto term used
Feel free add correct annotate appropriate
You ca find technical definition technical definition specific lisp
A outside vaudeville another name function
While many year since I programmed Lisp one ever used term formal way even used commonly
We talked
If someone said routine calculate many apple pie perfectly informal

When finished routine branch back next sequential instruction following instruction branched
A routine may also useful one program save programmer write code shared
Typically language routine requires variable input encoded specified interface called
The programmer use macro instruction instead include manage branching routine
Macro definition instruction also tend shared among programmer use multiple program especially software development project
In computer language many routine prepackaged routine specified programming interface

I read paper mentioned routine induction many time
But I google nothing showed
I think routine induction mean induction structure analyzing possible case proof
I right
Just make sure I asking
I going give bit nuanced answer
To begin going read many programming language theory related research paper get used phrase structural induction
It uncommon three word entirety proof sketch paper
The majority proof area boring also tedious
So boring tedious
If computer quickly find proof fully formally proof script elliptical style moderately justified
Sometimes author say find proof following nose
This mean structure theorem strongly suggests one next step
This combined searching behind
Structural induction follow nose step get faced problem proving something member inductively defined type like abstract syntax tree
So elliptical structural induction really statement obvious thing surprise
The word used sense normal usual plain
It mean proof induction nothing special happens

A also referred portion code may called executed anywhere program
For example routine may used save file display time
Instead writing code commonly performed task routine made called task need performed
Below basic example subroutine
In example user could call subroutine example typing anywhere within program program print
After subroutine completed program go return address directly hello run additional code

Karma Questions I want become computer scientist I want know normal day computer scientist like
Also I want know feel work big company Microsoft Apple Facebook etc
Student New York New York Karma Questions Enter phone number email send message update question


myEmail phone number email address required
United States America Software Engineer Google There always variation course multiple answer able build picture
I majored Computer Science college working Software Engineer Google
This common path technically different going Computer Science job
That would likely involve lot theoretical work I
On typical day Google I start checking email large part company California three hour later use email lot tends large amount built night I went home figure project start working
Sometimes I program needed run hour execute overnight I base start result reported
The division Google I large complicated program work revolves around
I usually handful different project involving
Right I adding feature customer investigating whether change one source data another one improving testing tool main program make better use Google infrastructure I involved finding place clean code base addition various small task
On given day I pick project based people waiting I get result old test simply I feel like I make progress start working
I actually spend much time writing new code main program I spend lot time examining see work add new piece writing test small change I make
I also write lot smaller program help thing like data analysis making tool others use
I usually work couple project different time day I get stuck one meeting usually happens least day I use boundary spur shift project
I work around hour day though vary slightly depending I making particularly large amount progress something want leave
I let make habit staying longer hour though since engineer degrades quality life
While working I try stay fairly focused though variety way take small mental break quick chat friend online work person work online people work website like Google News
I find I productive I give brief chance rest
So
Get work check email cycle among project mean writing code looking data I go home
I greatly enjoy though everyone
Thank much Eric
Senior Network Engineer Zynga Greetings Eddie
I pleased see variety answer question
Having weathered late worked several tech startup large r company since I happy ofder personal response question
In addition linear often repetitive task outlined thread professional I add variable On Call generally applies computer science type bona fide engineer work within Global Foundation Services GFS also sometimes referred DevEng DevOps SiteOps TechOps ITOps
The vast majority Tech organization operational infrastructure consists team On Call engineer share rotational Duty Roster defines escalation path Whom Shall I Contact Customer Affecting Outage
On Call engineer Network Engineering Site Reliability Engineering SRE typically support one company revenue stream Corporate Production
Production resource router switch firewall virtualized application server cluster database cluster typically reside physically secured datacenter environment
When something break On Call team called immediate service
The longer issue unscheduled website related maintenance example go unresolved revenue lost thoroughly company reputation damaged
As On Call Network Engineer I wear multiple hat often simultaneously I worked long hour straight scenario past however average day hour
proactive versus reactive work
Within dynamic context Internet environment remain long
The constant pace Big Business demand equipment data circuit upgraded seemingly endlessly
If think might enjoy almost academic work mind frequent stress occasional GRUELING hour career Network Engineering Site Operations may prove aspiration
Fiscal compensation reasonably good certainly quite acceptable however type work I perform daily considered utterly unacceptable many value insist upon static unchanging predictable seems popular term de rigueur
I know fewer peer held similar post endured divorce spouse specifically due interruptive unpredictable nature work
Your mileage may vary
I hope help
Good luck
Client Education Manager It truly depends type environment working
With related job around computer science find working ether waterfall agile based senario
Under waterfall I like call waterfail mentality find coding several project much communication client besides beginning end project
If working environment like important developed promised
There room change
The method called Agile
This iterative based mentality work one project time communicate client thoughout project
You still find coding lot interaction client throughout project
Note reflect type work implementing way work delivered
Software Engineer Test Sqrrl I test engineer experience bit different average developer lot procedure I get office around meeting talk yesterday planning today anything blocking u something stopping u moving forward completing task
It short meeting make sure team page
After I check email engineer startup mean inbox usually blissfully empty
I worked Amazon though I sift good amount email every morning
Then I pick whichever project I working day
We try avoid meeting afternoon startup even ca time
At bigger company meeting generally occur throughout day
My project usually consist writing automated test exercise new feature diagnosing test failure reviewing developer code occasionally manual testing release feature set automated testing wo work well
It definitely varies day day boring
I like say I get paid break people stuff actually fairly accurate
I generally office hour day typical startup ideal promote healthy balance work rest life
I sometimes office crunch time say working make deadline time rare perk make
Software developer general spoiled rotten
So summarise get sync team check email work project write code read code test code look data go home around pm
Much like Eric Google I enjoy much everybody

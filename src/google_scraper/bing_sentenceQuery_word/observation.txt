active acquisition
In living being observation employ
In science observation also involve recording data via use instrument
The term may also refer collected scientific activity
Observations absence presence property noted quantitative numerical value attached observed
The requires observation nature formulate test
It consists step Observations play role second fifth step scientific method
However need requires observation different observer comparable
Human impression making difficult record compare
The use developed allow recording comparison observation made different time place different people
Measurement consists using observation compare phenomenon observed
The standard unit artifact process definition duplicated shared observer
In measurement number standard unit equal observation counted
Measurement reduces observation number recorded two observation result number equal within process
Senses limited subject error perception
developed magnify human power observation also translate perceptible form event unobservable human sens
One problem encountered throughout scientific field observation may affect process observed resulting different outcome process unobserved
This called
For example normally possible check air pressure automobile tire without letting air thereby changing pressure
However field science possible reduce effect observation insignificance using better instrument
Considered physical process form observation human instrumental involve thus thermodynamically increasing
In specific field science result observation differ depending factor important everyday observation
These usually illustrated event appears different observed two different point view seeming violate common sense
The human sens function like video impartially recording observation
Human perception occurs complex unconscious process certain detail incoming sense data noticed remembered rest forgotten
What kept thrown away depends internal model representation world called psychologist built entire life
The data fitted schema
Later event remembered memory gap may even filled plausible data mind make fit model called
How much attention various perceived data given depends internal value system judge important individual
Thus two people view event come away entirely different perception even disagreeing simple fact
This notoriously unreliable
Several important way observation affected human psychology given
Human observation biased toward confirming observer conscious unconscious expectation view world
In psychology called
Since object scientific research discovery new phenomenon bias caused new discovery overlooked one example discovery
It also result erroneous scientific support widely held cultural myth hand supported idea racial superiority early century
Correct scientific technique emphasizes careful recording observation separating experimental observation conclusion drawn technique minimize observational bias
Another bias become prevalent advent large reward new discovery bias favor researcher desired hypothesis outcome
Called different deliberate falsification result happen researcher
Researchers great incentive desire given outcome misinterpret misjudge result even persuade seen something
Possible example mistaken discovery caused bias machine
Recent decade seen scientific scandal caused researcher playing fast loose observational method order get pet theory published
This type bias rampant correct scientific technique followed
The main defense bias besides correct research technique repetition experiment observation researcher incentive bias
For example emerging practice competitive field require physical result experiment serum made available competing laboratory independent testing
Modern scientific instrument extensively process observation presented human sens particularly computerized instrument sometimes question data processing chain observing end drawing conclusion begin
This recently become issue image published experimental data
The image enhanced bring feature researcher want emphasize also effect supporting researcher conclusion
This form bias difficult quantify
Some begun set detailed standard type allowed research result
Computerized instrument often keep copy raw data sensor processing ultimate defense processing bias similarly scientific standard require preservation original unenhanced raw version image used research data
An observational bias occurs researcher look think find positive result easy record observation
This called
Observe always everything result change get used thinking nothing love well change existing form make new one like
Observation term process filtering thought process
Input received via analyzed either rational irrational thought
You parent beat child action either good bad
Deductions behavior good bad may based way preference building relationship study consequence resulting observed behavior
With passage time impression stored consciousness many related observation together resulting relationship consequence permit individual build construct moral implication behavior

Scientists obtain great deal evidence use observing natural experimentally generated object effect
Much standard philosophical literature subject come century logical empiricist follower critic embraced issue accepted assumption even objected specific view
Their discussion observational evidence tend focus epistemological question role theory testing
This entry follows lead even though observational evidence also play important philosophically interesting role area including scientific discovery development experimental tool technique application scientific theory practical problem
The issue get attention standard philosophical literature observation theory distinction observables unobservables form content observation report epistemic bearing observational evidence theory used evaluate
This entry discus topic following heading Reasoning observation important scientific practice least since time Aristotle mention number source observational evidence including animal dissection Aristotle Aristotle b
But philosopher talk observation extensively much detail way become accustomed century logical empiricist transformed philosophical thinking
The first transformation accomplished ignoring implication long standing distinction observing experimenting
To experiment isolate prepare manipulate thing hope producing epistemically useful evidence
It customary think observing noticing attending interesting detail thing perceived le natural condition extension thing perceived course experiment
To look berry vine attend color shape would observe
To extract juice apply reagent test presence copper compound would perform experiment
Contrivance manipulation influence epistemically significant feature observable experimental result extent epistemologist ignore peril
Robert Boyle John Herschell Bruno Latour Steve Woolgar Ian Hacking Harry Collins Allan Franklin Peter Galison Jim Bogen Jim Woodward Rheinberger philosopher philosophically minded scientist historian sociologist science gave serious consideration distinction observing experimenting
The logical empiricist tended ignore
A second transformation characteristic linguistic turn philosophy shift attention away thing observed natural experimental setting concentrate instead logic observation report
The shift developed assumption scientific theory system sentence sentence like structure proposition statement claim tested comparison observational evidence
Secondly assumed comparison must understood term inferential relation
If inferential relation hold sentence like structure follows theory must tested observation thing observed sentence proposition etc
used report observation
Hempel
Schlick Friends line thought theorized syntax semantics pragmatic observation sentence inferential connection observation theoretical sentence
In hoped articulate explain authoritativeness widely conceded best natural social behavioral scientific theory
Some pronouncement astrologer medical quack pseudo scientist gain wide acceptance religious leader rest case faith personal revelation ruler governmental official use political power secure assent
But claim enjoy kind credibility scientific theory attain
The logical empiricist tried account appeal objectivity accessibility observation report logic theory testing
Part meant calling observational evidence objective cultural ethnic factor bearing validly inferred merit theory observation report
So conceived objectivity important logical empiricist criticism Nazi idea Jews Aryans fundamentally different thought process physical theory suitable Einstein kind inflicted German student
In response rationale ethnic cultural purging German educational system logical empiricist argued objectivity observational evidence rather ethnic cultual factor used evaluate scientific theory
Galison
Less dramatically effort working scientist put producing objective evidence attest importance attach objectivity
Furthermore possible principle least make observation report reasoning used draw conclusion available public scrutiny
If observational evidence objective sense provide people need decide theory accept without rely unquestioningly authority
Francis Bacon argued long ago best way discover thing nature use experience term observation well experimental result develop improve scientific theory
The role observational evidence scientific discovery important topic Whewell Mill among others century
Recently Judaea Pearl Clark Glymour student associate addressed rigorously course developing technique inferring claim causal structure statistical feature data give rise Pearl Spirtes Glymour Scheines
But work exceptional
For part philosopher followed Karl Popper maintained contrary title one best known book thing logic discovery
Popper Drawing sharp distinction discovery justification standard philosophical literature devotes attention latter
Theories customarily represented collection sentence proposition statement belief logical consequence
Among maximally general explanatory predictive law Coulomb law electrical attraction repulsion Maxwellian electromagnetism equation example along lesser generalization describe limited natural experimental phenomenon ideal gas equation describing relation temperature pressure enclosed gas general description positional astronomical regularity
Observations used testing generalization kind
Some philosopher prefer represent theory collection state physical phenomenal system law
The law given theory So conceived theory adequately represented one linguistic formulation system sentence proposition
Instead structure function semantic model sentential propositional representation
Suppe This entry treat theory collection sentence sentential structure without deductive closure
But question take arise pretty much way theory represented accordance semantic account
One answer question assumes observation perceptual process observe look listen touch taste smell something attending detail resulting perceptual experience
Observers may good fortune obtain useful perceptual evidence simply noticing going around many case must arrange manipulate thing produce informative perceptible result
In either case observation sentence describe perception thing perceived
Observers use magnifying glass microscope telescope see thing small far away seen seen clearly enough without
Similarly amplification device used hear faint sound
But observe something perceive every use instrument augment sens qualifies observational
Philosophers agree observe moon Jupiter telescope heart beat stethoscope
But minimalist empiricist like Bas Van Fraassen deny one observe thing visualized using electron perhaps even light microscope
Many philosopher mind microscope find unnatural say high energy physicist observe particle particle interaction look bubble chamber photograph
Their intuition come plausible assumption one observe one see looking hear listening feel touching
Investigators neither look direct gaze toward attend visually experience charged particle moving bubble chamber
Instead look see track chamber bubble chamber photograph
The identification observation perceptual experience persisted well much Carl Hempel could characterize scientific enterprise attempt predict explain deliverance sens Hempel
This accomplished using law lawlike generalization along description initial condition correspondence rule auxiliary hypothesis derive observation sentence describing sensory deliverance interest
Theory testing treated matter comparing observation sentence describing observation made natural laboratory setting observation sentence true according theory tested
This make imperative ask observation sentence report
Even though scientist often record evidence form picture graph table number Hempel say meaning observation sentence applies observational record well
According Hempel called phenomenalist account observation report describe observer subjective perceptual experience
This view motivated assumption epistemic value observation report depends upon truth accuracy regard perception thing observer know certainty true accurate thing appear
This mean confident observation report true accurate describe anything beyond observer perceptual experience
Presumably one confidence conclusion exceed one confidence one best reason believe
For phenomenalist follows report subjective experience provide better reason believe claim support report kind evidence
Furthermore
Lewis right think probability established basis dubitable evidence Lewis observation sentence would evidential value unless report observer subjective experience
But given expressive limitation language available reporting subjective experience expect phenomenalistic report precise unambiguous enough test theoretical claim whose evaluation requires accurate grained perceptual discrimination
Worse yet experience directly available room doubt whether different people understand observation sentence way
Suppose evaluate claim basis someone else subjective report litmus solution looked dripped liquid unknown acidity
How could decide whether visual experience one would use word report
Such consideration led Hempel propose contrary phenomenalists observation sentence report directly observable intersubjectively ascertainable fact physical object Observers sometmes trouble making fine pointer position color discrimination thing susceptible precise intersubjectively understandable description subjective experience
How much precision degree intersubjective agreement required given case depends tested observation sentence used evaluate
But thing equal expect data whose acceptability depends upon delicate subjective discrimination reliable data whose acceptability depends upon fact ascertained intersubjectively
And similarly record drawing observer take position pointer reliable easier ass drawing purport capture subjective visual experience pointer
The fact science seldom solitary pursuit suggests one might able use pragmatic consideration finesse question observation report express
Scientific practical policy typically used purpose best served public evaluation
Furthermore development application scientific theory typically requires collaboration many case promoted competition
This together fact investigator must agree accept putative evidence use test theoretical claim imposes pragmatic condition observation report observation report must investigator reach agreement relatively quickly relatively easily whether provides good evidence test theory Cf
Neurath
Feyerabend took requirement seriously enough characterize observation sentence pragmatically term widespread decidability
In order observation sentence said sentence must contingently true false competent speaker relevant language quickly unanimously decide whether accept reject basis happens look listen etc
appropriate way appropriate observation condition Feyerabend
The requirement quick easy decidability general agreement favor Hempel account observation sentence report phenomenalist
But one rely data whose virtue widespread acceptance
Presumably data must posse additional feature virtue serve epistemically trustworthy guide theory acceptability
If epistemic trustworthiness requires certainty requirement favor phenomenalists
Even trustworthiness require certainty thing quick easy decidability
Philosophers need address question two requirement mutually satisfied
Many thing scientist investigate interact human perceptual system required produce perceptual experience
The method investigator use study thing argue plausible may scientist rely exclusively perceptual system obtain evidence need
Thus Feyerabend proposed thought experiment measuring equipment rigged register magnitude quantity interest theory could tested well output record human perception Feyerabend
Feyerabend could made point historical example instead thought experiment
A century earlier Helmholtz estimated speed excitatory impulse traveling motor nerve
To initiate impulse whose speed could estimated implanted electrode one end nerve fiber ran current coil
The end attached bit muscle whose contraction signaled arrival impulse
To find long took impulse reach muscle know stimulating current reached nerve
But Helmholtz resort called artificial method observation Olesko Holmes
This meant arranging thing current coil could deflect galvanometer needle
Assuming magnitude deflection proportional duration current passing coil Helmholtz could use deflection estimate duration could see
This artificial observation confused using magnifying glass telescope see tiny distant object
Such device enable observer scrutinize visible object
The miniscule duration current flow visible object
Helmholtz studied looking seeing something else
Hooke argued designed instrument execute kind strategy century
The moral Feyerabend thought experiment Helmholtz distinction perception artificial observation working scientist happy call thing register experimental equipment observables even register sens
Some evidence produced process convoluted hard decide anything observed
Consider functional magnetic resonance image fMRI brain decorated color indicate magnitude electrical activity different region performance cognitive task
To produce image brief magnetic pulse applied subject brain
The magnetic force coordinate precession proton hemoglobin bodily stuff make emit radio signal strong enough equipment respond
When magnetic force relaxed signal proton highly oxygenated hemoglobin deteriorate detectably different rate signal blood carry le oxygen
Elaborate algorithm applied radio signal record estimate blood oxygen level place signal calculated originated
There good reason believe blood flowing downstream spiking neuron carry appreciably oxygen blood vicinity resting neuron
Assumptions relevant spatial temporal relation used estimate level electrical activity small region brain corresponding pixel finished image
The result computation used assign appropriate color pixel computer generated image brain
The role sens fMRI data production limited thing monitoring equipment keeping eye subject
Their epistemic role limited discriminating color finished image reading table number computer used assign
If fMRI image record observation hard say activity blood oxygen level proton precession radio signal something else
If anything observed radio signal interact directly equipment would seem better candidate blood oxygen level neuronal activity
Furthermore hard reconcile idea fMRI image record observation traditional empiricist notion much may needed draw conclusion observational evidence calculation involving theoretical assumption background belief must allowed pain loss objectively intrude process data production
The production fMRI image requires extensive statistical manipulation based theory radio signal variety factor detection along belief relation blood oxygen level neuronal activity source systematic error
In view functional brain imaging differs looking seeing photographing measuring thermometer galvanometer way make uninformative call observation
And similarly many method scientist use produce evidence
Terms like observation observation report occur nearly much scientific philosophical writing
In place working scientist tend talk
Philosophers adopt usage free think standard example observation member large diverse growing family data production method
Instead trying decide method classify observational thing qualify observables philosopher concentrate epistemic influence factor differentiate member family
In particular focus attention question data produced given method used answer must done use data fruitfully credibility answer afford
Bogen It interest record perceptual observation always epistemically superior data experimental equipment
Indeed unusual investigator use evidence evaluate perceptual data correct error
For example Rutherford Pettersson conducted similar experiment find certain element disintegrated emit charged particle radioactive bombardment
To detect emission observer watched scintillation screen faint flash produced particle strike
Pettersson assistant reported seeing flash silicon certain element
Rutherford
Rutherford colleague James Chadwick visited Petterson laboratory evaluate data
Instead watching screen checking Pettersson data saw Chadwick arranged Pettersson assistant watch screen unbeknownst manipulated equipment alternating normal operating condition condition particle could hit screen
Pettersson data discredited fact assistant reported flash close rate condition Steuwer
Related consideration apply distinction observable unobservable object investigation
Some data produced help answer question thing register sens experimental equipment
Solar neutrino flux frequently discussed case point
Neutrinos interact directly sens measuring equipment produce recordable effect
Fluxes emission studied trapping neutrino allowing interact chlorine produce radioactive argon isotope
Experimentalists could calculate flux solar neutrino emission Geiger counter measurement radiation isotope
The epistemic significance neutrino unobservability depends upon factor reliability data investigator managed produce validity source information flux
It validity depend among many thing correctness investigator idea neutrino interact chlorine Pinch
But also unobservables detected whose feature inferred data kind
These unobservables epistemically unavailable
Whether remain depends upon whether scientist figure produce data study
The history particle physic see
Morrison see Valenstein
Empirically minded philosopher assume evidential value observation observational process depends sensitive whatever used study
But turn depends adequacy theoretical claim sensitivity may depend
For example challenge use thermometer reading support description prediction explanation patient temperature challenging theoretical claim whether reading thermometer like one applied way similar condition indicate patient temperature well enough count favor
At least regardless whether investigator explicitly endorses even aware use e would undermined falsity
All observation us observation evidence theory laden sense
Cf
Chang Azzouni
As example thermometer illustrates analogue Norwood Hanson claim seeing theory laden undertaking apply well equipment generated observation
Hanson
But observation observational process theory laden provide reality based objective epistemic constraint scientific reasoning
One thing say theoretical claim epistemic value parcel observational evidence depends may may quite correct
If even know way establish correctness evidence may good enough us put
But cold comfort investigator establish
The next thing say scientific investigation ongoing process course theoretical claim whose unacceptability would reduce epistemic value parcel evidence challenged defended different way different time new consideration investigative technique introduced
We hope acceptability evidence established relative one stretch time even though success dealing challenge one time guarantee future challenge satisfactorily dealt
Thus long scientist continue work need time epistemic value parcel evidence established
This come surprise anyone aware science fallible
But ground skepticism
It perfectly reasonable trust evidence available present even though logically possible epistemic trouble arise future
Thomas Kuhn Norwood Hanson Paul Feyerabend others cast suspicion objectivity observational evidence another way arguing one use empirical evidence teat theory without committing oneself theory
Although example use present case feature equipment generated evidence tend talk observation perceptual process
Kuhn writing contain three different version idea

Perceptual Theory Loading
Perceptual psychologist Bruner Postman found subject briefly shown anomalous playing card black four heart reported seen normal counterpart red four heart
It took repeated exposure get subject say anomalous card look right eventually describe correctly
Kuhn
Kuhn took study indicate thing look observer different conceptual resource
For discussion theory conceptual perceptual loading see Lupyan
If black heart look like black heart repeated exposure somehow allowed subject acquire concept black heart
By analogy Kuhn supposed observer working conflicting paradigm look thing conceptual limitation keep visual experience Kuhn
This would mean example Priestley Lavoisier watched experiment Lavioisier seen accorded theory combustion respiration oxidation process Priestley visual experience agreed theory burning respiration process phlogiston release

Semantical Theory Loading Kuhn argued theoretical commitment exert strong influence observation description understood mean Kuhn Longino
If proponent caloric account heat describe understand description observed result heat experiment way investigator think heat term mean kinetic energy radiation
They might use word temperature report observation without understanding way

Salience Kuhn claimed Galileo Aristotelian physicist watched pendulum experiment would looked attended thing
The Aristotelian paradigm would required experimenter measure ignore radius angular displacement time per swing Kuhn
These last salient Galileo treated pendulum swing constrained circular motion
The Galilean quantity would interest Aristotelian treat stone falling constraint toward center earth Kuhn
Thus Galileo Aristotelian would collected data
Absent record Aristotelian pendulum experiment think thought experiment
Taking order plausibility point important fact scientific practice
Data production including experimental design execution heavily influenced investigator background assumption
Sometimes include theoretical commitment lead experimentalists produce misleading evidence
In case may lead experimentalists ignore even fail produce useful evidence
For example order obtain data orgasm female stumptail macaque one researcher wired female produce radio record orgasmic muscle contraction heart rate increase etc
But Elisabeth Lloyd report researcher wired heart rate male macaque signal start recording female orgasm
When I pointed vast majority female stumptail orgasm occurred sex among female alone replied yes knew interested important orgasm Lloyd
Although female stumptail orgasm occuring sex male atypical experimental design driven assumption make feature female sexuality worth studying contribution reproduction Lloyd
Fortunately thing always happen
When investigator often able eventually make correction come appreciate significance data originally salient
Thus paradigm theoretical commitment actually influence saliency influence neither inevitable irremediable
With regard semantic theory loading important bear mind observer always use declarative sentence report observational experimental result
They often draw photograph make audio recording etc
instead set experimental device generate graph pictorial image table number record
Obviously investigator conceptual resource theoretical bias exert epistemically significant influence record set equipment record detail include emphasize form representation choose Daston Galison
But disagreement epistemic import graph picture bit data often turn causal rather semantical consideration
Anatomists may decide whether dark spot micrograph caused staining artifact light reflected anatomically significant structure
Physicists may wonder whether blip Geiger counter record reflects causal influence radiation wanted monitor surge ambient radiation
Chemists may worry purity sample used obtain data
Such question well represented semantic question relevant
Late century philosopher may ignored case exaggerated influence semantic theory loading thought theory testing term inferential relation observation theoretical sentence
With regard sentential observation report significance semantic theory loading le ubiquitous one might expect
The interpretation verbal report often depends idea causal structure rather meaning sign
Rather worrying meaning word used describe observation scientist likely wonder whether observer made withheld information whether one detail artifact observation condition whether specimen atypical
Kuhnian paradigm heterogeneous collection experimental practice theoretical principle problem selected investigation approach solution etc
Connections component loose enough allow investigator disagree profoundly one theoretical claim agree design execute record result experiment
That neuroscientist disagreed whether nerve impulse consisted electrical current could measure electrical quantity agree linguistic meaning accuracy observation report including term potential resistance voltage current
The issue section touch distant linguistic descendent issue arose connection Locke view mundane scientific concept empiricist called idea derive content experience Locke
Looking patient red spot fever investigator might report seen spot measles symptom patient measles
Watching unknown liquid dripping litmus solution observer might report seeing change color liquid PH le acid
The appropriateness description test outcome depends relevant concept operationalized
What justifies observer report observed case measles according one operationalization might require say observed measles symptom red spot according another
In keeping Percy Bridgman view one might suppose operationalizations definition meaning rule analytically true every liquid turn litmus red properly conducted test acidic
But faithful actual scientific practice think operationalizations defeasible rule application concept rule application subject revision basis new empirical theoretical development
So understood operationalize adopt verbal related practice purpose enabling scientist work
Operationalizations thus sensitive subject change basis finding influence usefulness Feest
Definitional investigator different research tradition may trained report observation conformity conflicting operationalizations
Thus instead training observer describe see bubble chamber whitish streak trail one might train say see particle track even particle
This may reflect Kuhn meant suggesting observer might justified even required describe seen oxygen transparent colorless though atom invisible though
Kuhn To contrary one might object one see confused one trained say one see therefore talking seeing colorless gas invisible particle may nothing picturesque way talking certain operationalizations entitle observer say
Strictly speaking objection concludes term observation report reserved descriptionsthat neutral respect conflicting operationalizations
If observational data utterance meet Feyerabend decidability agreeability condition import semantic theory loading depends upon quickly sentence reasonably sophisticated language user stand different paradigm reach decision assert deny
Some would expect enough agreement secure objectivity observational data
Others would
Still others would try supply different standard objectivity
The example Pettersson Rutherford scintillation screen evidence attests fact observer working different laboratory sometimes report seeing different thing similar condition
It plausible expectation influence report
It plausible expectation shaped training supervisor associate theory driven behavior
But happens case well party dispute agreed reject Pettersson data appeal result mechanical manipulation laboratory could obtain interpret way without compromising theoretical commitment
Furthermore proponent incompatible theory often produce impressively similar observational data
Much disagreed nature respiration combustion Priestley Lavoisier gave quantitatively similar report long mouse stayed alive candle kept burning closed bell jar
Priestley taught Lavoisier obtain took measurement phlogiston content unknown gas
A sample gas tested run graduated tube filled water inverted water bath
After noting height water remaining tube observer add nitrous air call nitric oxide check water level
Priestley thought thing oxygen believed change water level indicated much phlogiston gas contained
Lavoisier reported observing water level Priestley even abandoned phlogiston theory became convinced change water level indicated free oxygen content Conant
The moral example although paradigm theoretical commitment sometimes epistemically significant influence observer perceive relatively easy nullify correct effect
Typical response question maintain acceptability theoretical claim depends upon whether true approximately true probable significantly probable competitor whether save observable phenomenon
They try explain observational data argue possession one virtue
Truth
It natural think computability range application thing equal true theory better false one good approximation better bad one highly probable theoretical claim better le probable one
One way decide whether theory theoretical claim true close truth acceptably probable derive prediction use observational data evaluate
HD confirmation theorist propose observational evidence argues truth theory whose deductive consequence verifies whose consequence falsifies Popper
But law theoretical generalization seldom ever entail observational prediction unless conjoined one auxiliary hypothesis taken theory belong
When prediction turn false HD trouble explaining conjuncts blame
If theory entail true prediction continue conjunction arbitrarily selected irrelevant claim
HD trouble explaining prediction confirm irrelevancy along theory interest
Ignoring detail large small bootstrapping confirmation theory hold observation report confirms theoretical generalization instance generalization follows observation report conjoined auxiliary hypothesis theory generalization belongs
Observation count theoretical claim conjunction entail
Here HD observation argues theoretical claim assumption auxiliary hypothesis true Glymour
Bayesians hold evidential bearing observational evidence theoretical claim understood term likelihood conditional probability
For example whether observational evidence argues theoretical claim might thought depend upon whether probable much probable denial conditional description evidence together background belief including theoretical commitment
But Bayes theorem conditional probability claim interest depend part upon claim prior probability
Once one use evidence evaluate theory depends part upon one theoretical commitment
Earman
Roush Francis Bacon Bacon said allowing one commitment theory determine one take epistemic bearing observational evidence theory anything even worse ignoring evidence altogether
HD Bootstrap Bayesian related account conformation run risk earning Bacon disapproval
According reasonable adherent competing theory disagree observational data bear claim
As matter historical fact disagreement occur
The moral fact depends upon whether disagreement resolved
Because component theory logically le probabilistically independent one another adherent competing theory often find way bring close enough agreement auxiliary hypothesis prior probability draw conclusion evidence
Saving observable phenomenon
Theories said save observable phenomenon satisfactorily predict describe systematize
How well theory performs task need depend upon truth accuracy basic principle
Thus according Osiander preface Copernicus locus classicus astronomer way attain true cause regularity among observable astronomical event must content saving phenomenon sense using Theorists use assumption calculating tool without committing truth
In particular assumption planet rotate around sun must evaluated solely term useful calculating observable relative position satisfactory approximation
Pierre Duhem articulates related conception
For Duhem physical theory Experimental law general mathematical description observable experimental result
Investigators produce performing measuring experimental operation assigning symbol perceptible result according operational definition Duhem
For Duhem main function physical theory help u store retrieve information observables would otherwise able keep track
If theory supposed accomplish main virtue intellectual economy
Theorists replace report individual observation experimental law devise higher level law fewer better experimental law better mathematically derived Duhem
A theory experimental law tested accuracy comprehensiveness comparing observational data
Let EL one experimental law perform acceptably well test
Higher level law evaluated basis well integrate EL rest theory
Some data fit integrated experimental law interesting enough worry
Other data may need accommodated replacing modifying one experimental law adding new one
If required addition modification replacement deliver experimental law harder integrate data count theory
If required change conducive improved systematization data count favor
If required change make difference data argue theory
It unwelcome fact idea theory testing data typically produced way make impossible predict generalization used test derive instance generalization data non ad hoc auxiliary hypothesis
Indeed unusual many member set reasonably precise quantitative data agree one another let alone quantitative prediction
That precise publicly accessible data typically produced except process whose result reflect influence causal factor numerous different kind irregular behavior single theory account
When Bernard Katz recorded electrical activity nerve fiber preparation numerical value data influenced factor peculiar operation galvanometer piece equipment variation among position stimulating recording electrode inserted nerve physiological effect insertion change condition nerve deteriorated course experiment
There variation investigator handling equipment
Vibrations shook equipment response variety irregularly occurring cause ranging random error source heavy tread Katz teacher
Hill walking stair outside laboratory
That short list
To make matter worse many factor influenced data part irregularly occurring transient shifting assembly causal influence
With regard kind data interest philosopher physic consider many extraneous cause influenced radiation data solar neutrino detection experiment spark chamber photograph produced detect particle interaction
The effect systematic random source error typically considerable analysis interpretation required take investigator data set conclusion used evaluate theoretical claim
This applies much clear case perceptual data machine produced record
When early century astronomer looked telescope pushed button record time saw moon pas crosshair value data point depended upon light reflected moon also upon feature perceptual process reaction time psychological factor varied time time observer observer
No astronomical theory resource take thing account
Similar consideration apply probability specific data point conditional theoretical principle probability confirming disconfirming instance theoretical claim conditional value specific data point
Instead testing theoretical claim direct comparison raw data investigator use data infer fact phenomenon event regularity process etc
whose instance uniform uncomplicated enough make susceptible systematic prediction explanation Bogen Woodward
The fact lead melt temperature close C example phenomenon widespread regularity among electrical quantity involved action potential period orbital path planet etc
Theories expected predict explain thing individual temperature reading nevertheless evaluated basis useful predicting explaining phenomenon used detect
The hold action potential opposed electrical data feature calculated orbit planet contrast data positional astronomy
It reasonable ask genetic theory probable given similar upbringing similar environment offspring schizophrenic parent parent develop one symptom DSM classifies indicative schizophrenia
But would quite unreasonable ask predict explain one patient numerical score one trial particular diagnostic test diagnostician wrote particular entry report interview offspring schizophrenic parent Bogen Woodward
The fact theory better predicting explaining fact feature phenomenon data bad thing
For many purpose theory predict explain phenomenon would illuminating useful practical purpose theory predicted explained member data set
Suppose could choose theory predicted explained way neurotransmitter release relates neuronal spiking fact average transmitter released roughly every spike theory explained predicted number displayed relevant experimental equipment one single case
For purpose former theory would preferable latter least applies many case
And similarly theory predict explain something probability schizophrenia conditional genetic factor theory predicted explained probability faulty diagnosis schizophrenia conditional fact psychiatrist training
For purpose would preferable theory predicted specific description case history
In view together fact great many theoretical claim tested directly fact phenomenon behooves epistemologist think data used answer question phenomenon
Lacking space detailed discussion entry mention two main kind thing investigator order draw conclusion data
The first causal analysis carried without use statistical technique
The second statistical analysis
First investigator must distinguish feature data indicative fact phenomenon interest safely ignored must corrected
Sometimes background knowledge make easy
Under normal circumstance investigator know thermometer sensitive temperature pressure gauge pressure
An astronomer chemist know spectrographic equipment applied know data indicate
Sometimes le obvious
When Ramon Cajal looked microscope thin slice stained nerve tissue figure fiber could see one focal length connected extended thing could see another focal length another slice
Analogous consideration apply quantitative data
It easy Katz tell equipment responding Hill footfall stair electrical quantity set measure
It harder tell whether abrupt jump amplitude high frequency EEG oscillation due feature subject brain activity artifact extraneous electrical activity laboratory operating room measurement made
The answer question feature numerical data indicative phenomenon interest typically depend least part known cause conspire produce data
Statistical argument often used deal question influence epistemically relevant causal factor
For example known similar data produced factor nothing phenomenon interest Monte Carlo simulation regression analysis sample data variety statistical technique sometimes provide investigator best chance deciding seriously take putatively illuminating feature data
But statistical technique also required purpose causal analysis
To calculate magnitude quantity like melting point lead scatter numerical data investigator throw outlier calculate mean standard deviation establish confidence significance level
Regression technique applied result estimate far mean magnitude interest expected fall population interest range temperature pure sample lead expected melt
The fact little learned data without causal statistical related argumentation interesting consequence received idea use observational evidence distinguishes science pseudo science religion cognitive scientist one use observational evidence support claim astrologer medical quack use
To find epistemically significant difference one must carefully consider sort data use come employed
The virtue scientific opposed theory evaluation depend reliance empirical data also data produced analyzed interpreted draw conclusion theory evaluated
Secondly take many example refute notion adherence single universally applicable scientific method differentiates science
Data produced used far many different way treat informatively instance single method
Thirdly usually always impossible investigator draw conclusion test theory observational data without explicit implicit reliance theoretical principle
This mean counterpart Kuhnian question theory loading epistemic significance arise connection analysis interpretation observational evidence question must answered appeal detail vary case case
Grammatical variant term observation applied impressively different perceptual process record result produce
Their diversity reason doubt whether general philosophical account observation observables observational data tell epistemologist much local account grounded close study specific kind case
Furthermore scientist continue find way produce data called observational without stretching term point vagueness
It plausible philosopher value kind rigor precision generality l logical empiricist exact philosopher aspired could better examining developing technique result logic probability theory statistic machine learning computer modeling etc
trying construct highly general theory observation role science
Logic rest seem unable deliver satisfactory universally applicable account scientific reasoning
But illuminating local application use scientist well philosopher

Scientists curious people
They love exploring natural world around asking question everything
But must first make
These sensory experience lead scientist ask question seek answer natural phenomenon
While many observation seen heard also occur touch smell
For example might hear two bird singing might notice blood metallic taste
You might feel skin hair stand get cold see certain flower garden closing night morning smell strong odor skunk backyard one evening
All observation
You seeing hearing tasting feeling smelling world around observation lead wonder occurrence find answer question
Why bird sing way
What component blood make taste metallic
Why hair stand end
How garden flower know day
And skunk I run away
Okay last one scientific question get idea
Observations first step overall scientific process scientist go
This process involves scientist making observation asking question looking answer often experimentation interpreting result sharing scientific community
Sometimes result clear process repeated multiple time
In fact many time experiment repeated expanded upon observation made experiment
Sometimes scientist answer one question based observe process answering first question come even question
Let use flower growing backyard example
Initially observed specific plant close flower night open day
Your scientific question observation might occur
Based knowledge plant might hypothesize process tied amount sunlight plant receiving signal day night
The next step run experiment test hypothesis
You put several plant room light controlled follows normal daily cycle
You put another set plant room light time yet another set plant placed room dark time

At end experiment find flower plant light room open time one dark room closed time one cycle room opened closed change light
So know happens perhaps wondering HOW work
Or maybe wondering plant flower plant flower stay open time matter much light
From formulate new hypothesis based question run new experiment test hypothesis find answer
And know maybe result lead ask even interesting flower
Sounds like way becoming good scientist
Asking good question important part good scientist question come mind without basis
They come scientist make sensory experience lead scientist ask question seek answer natural phenomenon
Scientists constantly observing thing occur around natural world
Astute observation foundation good scientific question lead hypothesis tested experimentation
Sometimes interesting observation occur experiment
These new observation lead new question natural process lead new refined experiment
And big component science seeing listening feeling smelling tasting asking
If like two thing consider working scientific field fit right

Want watch later
Meet Samantha
She found charge company next project
Samantha nervous never charge
Because want best decided take step slowly look option proceeding
Because company tight budget even tighter time frame Samantha need make sure carefully estimate cost time take project competed
She decided use process comparing past project similar help estimate cost time frame might current project
act using former project estimate long much current project take cost
In word technique center comparison
This mean data available better estimate
Thus collecting data project build database used future project comparison cost time
So would Samantha use method
Well analogous estimating great tool current project working limited information actual cost data
Without enough information accurately decide time frame cost important find way gather information
For example creating commercial customer decide use analogous estimating would look past commercial similar
So let say new commercial new business town need second long
After searching found two commercial done past
One upcoming charity event new restaurant
Obviously restaurant commercial line current project
Even better previous commercial new restaurant also roughly second long help comparison
When done looking past project realize total cost commercial created six month ago
So estimate cost create current commercial also
While analogous estimating focus lesson way estimate cost time
There also estimate cost time us relationship variable instead
In word take account many unit needed project combination cost per unit time frame
Get FREE access day create account
In order use parametric estimating correctly also need scale measurement
For example took previous project manager three day find one quality employee work project Samantha need find four quality employee could estimate take day assemble team
Now need scalable mean previous project manager spent first day studying project instead finding employee past project really took two day find quality employee
This mean Samantha expect spend day finding team member optional day studying project wish
process comparing past project current project order estimate time cost
Analogous estimating done limited data current project
The data collected past project better comparison
While analogous estimating great way roughly figure cost time estimating practice
another method us estimate take consideration relationship variable scale measurement

Could someone explain resource regarding
Post comment
I think correct thinking computer science primarily subdomain mathematics despite name
Back day fogey CompSci took programmer seems like many school breaking CompSci part math Software Engineering separate discipline
thank god
overlap IMHO distinct field
Agreed
I say subdomain Logic overlap quite bit mathematics unless conflate mathematics logic case distinction little value
But logic give thing like function
I would say intercept mathematics logic wholly contained either union
Functions proof
Lambda calculus related object subject mathematical logic contain even define notion function
The computability function problem mathematical physic
Dependent type theory function type developed foundation mathematics I think overly narrow notion Logic
Computer Science started subdomain mathematics
The reason CS mathematics specific aspect reality
Physics also application mathematics specific aspect reality physical world noone seems wonder wether discrete science
The reason CS decade life real question aspect reality CS studying building
So imo CS discrete science field study whole new layer reality two beeing physical world society human world virtual world created human
If accept software environment new layer reality would interesting implication
There trend split CS Software engineering say
That split theoritical practical side studying thing building thing
Like real world
It must admitted difference noted science mathematics completely sharp even aside fact practice mathematics empirical content
Some area mathematics applied modelling aspect physical universe grey indeed
The basic problem one confident fact derived mathematical method extent mathematical object considered accurate model relevant part universe
One completely confident mathematics mathematical object question relevant part universe quite confident example computer science physical object analysed made conform mathematically precise pattern part theoretical physic theory survived extensive testing
However one usually confident say economic projection
The moral applying mathematics problem real world one must judiciously temper use mathematical knowledge technique empirical knowledge testing
In accompany book structure interpretation computer program highly rated CS textbook spend first minute talking issue relationship computer science science computer A lot unrelated stuff got thrown Computer Science department decade involves computer loose sense
That like throwing physic economics Maths department use math
The first subset CompSci I like talk Machine Learning ML
This involves spotting pattern datasets make prediction
Basically Statistics
Among colleague Machine Learners often little interest rest Computer Science
compiler database structure algorithm software engineering
And MLers much closely related Statisticians would like think
You might think different experience working type people bigger variety Stats department
ML subdepartment compared difference two sub department
MLers tend think Big Data example Statisticians apply many method huge data also
There tends certain syndrome MLers Statisticians
So ML taken CompSci merged Stats
Then combined department would help scientist analyse data biologist physicist economist
After ML taken still computer science compiler construction lot discrete math stuff optimization
And finally forget software engineering whole lot stuff design
In summary Machine Learning taken merged Statistics
Software Engineering separated also along bunch related thing related applying software real world
That would leave Computer Science department
I sure studied much machine learning
Although probability statistic used heavily method used ML honestly much part statistic Chomsky Grammars part discrete mathematics fairly certain Chomsky taught discrete mathematics field
ML far computative general statistic education
Although Statistical analysis benefit greatly field much application theory merged
It sound like grudge machine learning professor department
Leo Breiman inventor decision tree wrote piece called asking Statisticians aware success ML
In article said A friend mine prominent statistician Berkeley Statistics Department visited Los Angeles late
After I described decision tree method first question What model data In telling story Breiman implication decision tree generative model
His logic decision tree good making prediction therefore interest statistician
On face I agree
My problem Breiman realize decision tree model
Maybe Breiman explicitly think invented decision tree implicitly
This allows connection Stats
And also connection maximum likelihood estimation
Also well known corresponds Maximum Likelihood Estimation Normally distributed model fixed variance
Traditionally OLS method minimizing loss equivalent estimating mean implication distribution take form long mean
But loss function correspond different model variance also behaviour minimization expected loss
The point tempted initially think OLS sort method estimate mean without assumption model
But choice loss function combined fact must deal observed loss expected loss mean arbitrary choice within OLS usually lead parametric model Normally distributed fixed variance
ML far computative general statistic education
There lot say
often thought solely preserve Stats department
In uni anyway
Being good MCMC requires good computer programmer
Some model require software least complex ML algorithm
And MCMC computation efficiency
Often two MCMC method constructed exactly stationary distribution
output identical average
Then difference speed
Writing fast MCMC requires number related skill
First useful good programmer understanding data structure algorithm
It also useful able mathematically represent state chain simple
Being able requires math skill understanding statistical model
But remember application knowledge speed method
I sure analogous situation ML
Finally importantly fast MCMC requires good selection move algorithm
This bit art requires certain experience alongside talent
Again requires good math skill prove move correct
In MCMC usually trivial create algorithm desired stationary distribution
The issue discriminant correct algorithm speed scalability modern MCMC driven goal
There lot math high level also help good data structure algorithm example efficiently updating sufficient statistic small change state chain
extended In ideal world CS department would closely involved MCMC
MCMC method applicable outside Stats might useful tackling ML problem
It case MCMC method inspired even published article CS literature
But CS people turn nose MCMC
Their logic MCMC requires math modelling abillity therefore stats therefore slow therefore nothing teach
It sound like grudge machine learning professor department
Now I ready answer I grudge number people including people I met people
Including people working Stats department CS department
Of course many people pretty sensible university department accordingly
But still people comfortable believing Those guy department nothing teach
It sound like grudge machine learning professor department
That interesting point I know I useful response
I think colouring judgement
More practically I suppose first issue opinion depend much personality
Even without fair say CS department Stats department unique flavour
Along variety within department
So hard give definitive answer CS ML
I write another reply technical note
Grudge harsh word
Honestly person studying machine learning university ignoring thing like compiler design data structure branch computer science neglecting broader education
ML depends heavily computational theory statistic
You might argue marriage two
Surely scholar ML neglect study parallel technique algorithm design one arguably core theoretical computer science
Aha
This interesting
machine learning textbook available free I guess may heard already
But anything computer outside ML algorithm
It feel expects reader able programming book help teach programming
There code snippet far I see
I feel textbook programming statistic stretch physic bioinformatics
Yes need able program
But great programmer certainly need know compiler sort stuff
neglecting broader education Well student expecting computer science education yes
But I would tempted argue student might want see ML
Similarly I would hate responsible Stats undergrad without giving much education programming possible
EDIT I think I agree broad education
The issue I take implication ML student Stats student different term broad education
I suppose lot different type student
I describe three type based level dependence excellence programming
First everybody anything scientific numerate need able basic programming start career
As proceed career important take responsibility improving
But need genius software focus thing specific degree subject
For specializing yes probably need reasonably good programmer Day One
They would need implement correct set macro Excel need make moderately complex still correct software
Again might hardcore programmer
It would nice teach CS ca let distract core algorithm directly relevant
Finally people really dedicated algorithm core computer science
If like code output compiler want submit improvement compiler
Maybe graphic engine computer game
These people need good compiler
While writing primary point I believe Stats student ML student belong level hierarchy
They need competent programmer better perhaps many numerate people
And yes would like teach coolest challenging thing CS
Theoretical computer science largely sub field mathematics like type mathematics used advance theory branch scientific question fundamental physic quantum information processing economics algorithmic game theory plus many others I le familiar
At time theoretical computer science even become
Of course computer science theory also plenty applied empirical field heck lesser extent database machine learning bioinformatics practical design algorithm look top conference field regularly see empirical evidence efficiency benchmark performance real world environment
Unfortunately field tend stay closer engineering rather trying answer fundamental question could argue science
In end extent computer science philosophy math science engineering depends largely researcher research programme
Many best computer scientist manage straddle four discipline
Computer science much computer astronomy telescope
It really subset mathematics
Your question really becomes Is math science
I would say yes although everyone would agree
I say subset logic overlap quite bit mathematics
Aha Computer Science degree include course Hardware
There example opinion term computer science become umbrella term covering everything involving involves computer
It enough point supplemental hardware course undergraduate degree look content active research computer science actually
I ca answer question I think weigh defining CS
look content active research computer science actually Fair enough
But active research computer science
If mean research done employee Computer Science department University often include stuff Machine Learning I believe merged Statistics really involve computer
In discipline fact calculation ca done pen paper therefore need automated electronic computer enough make active research computer science
That I would remove Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence whatever Computer Science
My impression even computer scientist view science
I might go trend bit suggest question quite right one ask
The application computer field I believe intended enable superior management information would suggest computer science study information specifically computer pertain
Computer science would therefore merely prominent
The question whether information science consquently computer science rightly called science I think would come whether information empirically observable independent existence reality
Perhaps empirical time take example numerical optimization particular linear programming
For linear programming problem M constraint N variable simplex O N choose M time complexity theory could iterate possible extremum finding optimum people devised problem case
However still empirically measure long take average various kind LP problem would hard reason
unfamiliar linear programming simplex algorithm intuitively speaking problem defines polyhedron simplex crawl along vertex fancy algebraic footwork proven strictly improve optimal solution show none exists keeping M basic variable step Computer Science revolves around concept computation make much subset mathematics
It process occurs
It process occurs nature Are implying mathematics occur nature
Not I doubting computation subset rather something independent
Are implying mathematics occur nature
I happily take position neither computer science mathematics property universe property way use language
Nature von neumann device Nor kind computer discussed computer science
Quantum computing Harvard Architecture Turing Machines neural net come comp sci rubric
meh nature like machine either
I think nature I think full one
This opinion
What computation
deleted We model cell finite state machine model laptop von Neumann RAM machine
It mean thing might develop alternative theory future
It important remember philosophic distinction
I think depends classify computer science
For instance restrict development webpage etc
might believe type coding akin language science
However computer also involved performing experiment obtaining empirical data although I suggest caution trying propagate science purely empirical endeavor
For instance many computer simulation feasible economic way obtain data experiment
Moreover computer science contributed interesting discussion called experimental mathematics
Computer Science PhD Student

You plan developing similar application
It thus assumed analogous estimation month
Parametric estimation done per unit basis us relation variable arrive cost duration

For example take day produce piece content mangy day take produce piece content
We differentiated two kind estimation
Now let u shift estimate budget

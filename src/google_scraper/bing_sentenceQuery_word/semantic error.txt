I keep coming across use word I never understand use meaning conveyed
Phrases like add semantics read semantics semantic web semantically correctly way confuse I referring web
Is word another way say grammar syntax
Thanks
Semantics meaning various element program whatever
For example let look code Both variable integer
From compiler point view exactly
However judging name one width something count thing
Syntactically okay since assign integer
However semantically totally wrong since width number child probably relationship
In case say semantically incorrect even compiler permit
Syntax structure
Semantics meaning
Each different context give different shade meaning term
HTML example new tag meant provide meaning data wrapped tag
The tag conveys data contained within information around
See meaning markup
Take look
Contrast older familiar HTML tag like
Each one affect appearance HTML content rendered browser ca tell u
They contain information meaning
It mean meaning got left already accounted syntax grammar
For example defined grammar valid statement say nothing
Increment one semantics
semantics description supposed put page
Semantic web generally web link search meaning word
The semantically correct way something mean right thing
The word adjective simply mean related word level computer science
For instance Semantic data model data model semantic meaningful understood anyone regardless background expertise
le semantic Java Java us meaningful word class method field
semantics refer tag describe
Check wiki page Very good description
It Computer Science terminology ask What behind Computer Science lingo
I afraid get recursive loop like
In HTML world semantic used talk meaning tag rather considering output look
For example common italicize foreign word also common italicize emphasized word
You could simply wrap foreign emphasized word tag describes look describe look way
A better tag use emphasized word conveys semantics emphasis
The browser stylesheet render italic consumer page know word emphasized
For example could properly read emphasized word
From view almost like looking syntax grammatical way
I ca speak semantics broad term When people talk semantics web normally referring idea stripped away cs javascript etc left bare bone html would make sense read
It also take account using correct tag correct markup
This stem old layout table used tabular data using list present content
You would use something le important
That would make sense

There many programming language
To execute compiled interpreted
An IDE integrated development environment used write code test error translate program
There different type error prevent computer program working way
Three key error type
Runtime error error cause program computer crash even appears nothing wrong program code
Running often cause runtime error
This could written wrong order
Syntax error mistake way code written
program syntactically correct
Common syntax error include spelling mistake incorrect use punctuation use capital letter
This piece code designed add two number together display result There four syntax error
Can identify
The syntax error The syntactically correct code would Semantic error logical error program work produce different result designed expected
A program semantic error without error reported
This code contains semantic error
The program run obvious problem see output result
The first two line ask user suggest number value
However function return data type
If user give value first second number stored string
When add two string together eg answer
Adding together produce answer
If try program valid program error work first time
However would notice unexpected result
The correct code would require value set
However integer need output string along rest outputted message
The correct code Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

I always thought referring syntax language referring semantics language
But I informed apparently case
What difference
Semantics Meaning Syntax Symbolic representation So two program written different language could thing semantics symbol used write program would different syntax
A compiler check syntax error derive semantics language rule mapping syntax machine instruction say wo find semantic error error
calculating wrong result code say add instead add
Actually two level three describe logical entity programming language interaction
defines expressed character
For example concept pointer arithmetic part C semantics way operator used express pointer operation part syntax
Sometimes two language share part semantics syntax differs wildly
C use value type reference type character type define different case two language syntactically similar semantics match consider Java JavaScript similarity often confuse beginner
I explain simple example language Is syntactically correct statement
It noun verb etc
But semantically wrong statement conceivable correct meaning
Syntax arrange language token
Semantics token mean usually particular arrangement token mean
You specify whether refer programming language general language used programming XML RDF data type system etc
Brian Meek writes
He refers word syntax semantic used data description stumble upon word specification data format better replace word make clear must work meaning
The relation syntax semantic least exactly specified data better described term
Semantic encoded syntax
As recording nested one language syntax another semantics
If one go beyond realm data nesting virtually infinite described Umberto Eco unlimited semiosis
To give example People usually stop level take semantic end final semantic unless human interprets data mind
As soon one try express semantic form data becomes syntax
If described something similar syntax
If ca
Semantics hand program chunk source code
And sometimes line two blurry
One way understand distinction look kind error get program syntax semantics incorrect
A syntax error failure source code match language grammar example semicolon one required
A semantic error failure satisfy language requirement C example call constraint example might writing incompatible type
The language grammar tell addition look like powerful enough express requirement type left right operand
Logical error using would correct generally detectable compiler though case compiler warn questionable code
Syntax lexical symbol say
Semantics mean
Consider C Different syntax semantics
C Same syntax different semantics integer
grammatical arrangement word sentence
word order
English programming syntactically correct
English programming syntactically valid
whether syntactically valid statement meaning
English programming python syntactically correct static semantic error
meaning associated syntactically correct string symbol static semantic error
sentence syntactically semantically correct meaning may intended
English two meaning
flying plane dangerous plane flying dangerous
Programming computer generate error message told something MIT Syntax refers formal rule governing construction valid statement language
Semantics refers set rule give meaning statement
Errors due syntax occur program ruels programming language violated misused
Errors due semantics occur program statement meaningful
Word order basic principal syntax trying understand written use syntactic cue word order help give sentence structure meaning
Semantics individual interpretation meaning sentence based prior knowledge
Therefore sentence seemingly make syntactic sense meaning using semantic cue
Syntax concerned linguistically grammatically correct
Semantics requires one prior knowledge far beyond anything language specific
The sentence Baby milk drink syntactic meaning semantics people would interpret meaning Baby drink milk prior knowledge tell u baby drink milk therefore find meaning key word
like
They really independent universal concept related pair word particular context indicate opposite direction
But thing strategy one scale tactic another
So writing code language syntax language using desired behaviour semantics
But implementing discussing compiler language syntax grammar perhaps type system semantics everything built
And
Syntax computer understands semantics human understands
A care whit design code compiled machine level hard time deducing design
Developers care design good design reducing complexity abstracting complex behavior interaction different kind problem lend different semantics
The choice language largely easily efficiently semantics want use expressed syntax
Very short example plain c In example syntax token different meaning semantic depending used
In x assignament mean substraction operation In assignament mean negative sign operation

It occurred today although I adopted infrequently use term semantics referring language element naming convention I sense formal definition
made eye glaze
I sense meaning context I encountered common usage respect linguistics I typically use term refer
This definition though idea
I major never taken Computer Science course
Is taught CS
Is accurate definition boiled statement two rather exhaustive exhausting article
A definition cribbed
This pretty much exactly inferred definition
The sticking point made eye glaze precisely defining model computation
There many different formal model computation lead different form semantics
Operational Semantics probably closest way people informally model semantics fragment code run interpreter changing state abstract routine
This approach break many model concurrency nondeterminism sematics better suited situation
It language element term formally mean term usually
This mean express term language effectively assuming underlying kind model depends semantic talking
As see wikipedia page mainly kind semantics From decription understand semantic something well defined inside context need specified context otherwise could give language formal definition term From perspective theory practice programming language language element semantics
Naming convention
And semantics nothing anything except perhaps implementation correct sometimes called faithful semantics
Beyond hard generalize many different style semantics
There style semantics called operational semantics given program semantics tell program executed abstract machine another variant semantics say program executed result
There axiomatic semantics roughly fact prove individiual program
The axiomatic semantics collection valid proof technique
It implementation ensure provable claim true
There also static semantics meant broadly requirement imposed compile time program considered good well formed
Stuff like variable defined used static semantics
But mostly people say static semantics mean type checking
Finally possible speak semantics abstract data type class interface among others
This usage good deal looser boil specification behavior permissible
I advise avoid word semantics context use word contract specification instead
It avoid confusing thing
Commentary always helpful try boil complex subject one two sentence
And come programming language
The Wikipedians mean well often complex confusing plain wrong

I simple doubt C programming language
Then represents type error
It lexical error compiler correctly make token also syntax error clearly
I think semantic error phase compiler check meaningful statement scoping binding variable declared function declared variable declared twice etc
But hand I also think linker error semantic phase throw error function intmain declared directly used
We reproduce error using code The following error returned compile time Every function type
In sense type error fall category static semantic error
On hand error caused typo
This sort error considered lexical error fall syntax error
There lot whether certain error syntactical static semantic
My opinion case error lexical considering cause

There common way classify type error computer programming
At bottom post address third type error sometimes studied
Let look example syntax error
In first example statement would worked old version Python python one big change came new requirement put parenthesis around
Syntax error much easier catch able catch
In fact many IDE give warning syntax error need even run program
Logic error hand quite challenging diagnose fix
Look Java code try determine logic error syntax error
And answer scroll want give answer away
keep scrolling
The Syntax completely valid programmer confused syntax error
This would
Yes third type error many people recognize would example one
This particular error much harder error identify missing semicolon think new Hide Seek Champion
Well showed many people include third error type called clearly differ syntax error overlap logic error
At least semantic error often lead error logic unexpected result
Semantic error involve meaning symbol wrote
Here example semantic error pointer based language C The first show second show memory address pointer
Ok ok tough one understand without studied pointer based language I know
But classic example semantic error
A easy understand semantic error example using reserved word variable name
In Python code Python semantic error would fine language like JavaScript reserved keyword JavaScript
Let use English language
The difference two class error understood looking English language version
Semantics course refers meaning group word syntax refers rule use combine word meaning
In English syntax rule grammar
It possible string bunch word together syntactically correct way ie sticking grammar rule create sentence meaning fails semantics Consider classic example reproduced Colourless green idea sleep furiously Now error syntax semantics
The answer
Because syntax grammar word fine take word try combine meaning
That problem semantics
Unfortunately answer
As nice use analogy English try understand semantics syntax programming language human language
Natural language context statement understood
In English sometimes needed understand meaning
instance We would assume person placed inside violin case
But consider example This text ambiguous teacher England teaching history teacher teaching English history equally valid interpretation
And computer language generally based context free grammar Read That programming language le likely ambiguity caused context mind argue semantic error subset logic error least small portion overall error pie
Other way classify error type Compile v run time go compiler like C Java go compiler catch certain type error
These error called
Compile time error syntactical semantic
On hand dynamic language like Python JavaScript catch error run time
Any error caught compiler
A compiler translates source code form understood machine
Compilers catch type error
So declare variable Java instance code treat String
Then compiler catch error point
In fact one main reason many programmer prefer static language
Static language like Java require declare kind data variable argument
Compilers able catch syntax error semantic error let look two generic pseudo code example
Errors caught run time
Dynamic language like Python go compiler
Instead code run interpreter
However even compiled language like Java end run time error instance example Java Run Time Error In code compiler catch error arr exist actually run code learn error

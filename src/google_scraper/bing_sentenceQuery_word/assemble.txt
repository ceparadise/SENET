An often abbreviated programmable device strong often correspondence language
Each assembly language specific particular computer architecture
In contrast generally across multiple architecture require
Assembly language may also called
Assembly language converted executable machine code referred
The conversion process referred
computational step assembler run
Assembly language us represent typically also etc
Many operation require one order form complete instruction assembler take number named constant well register operand freeing programmer tedious repetitive calculation
Depending architecture element may also combined specific instruction using data well fixed address
Many assembler offer additional mechanism facilitate program development control assembly process aid
An program creates translating combination mnemonic operation addressing mode numerical equivalent
This representation typically includes well control data
The assembler also calculates constant expression resolve memory location entity
The use symbolic reference key feature assembler saving tedious calculation manual address update program modification
Most assembler also include facility performing textual substitution generate common short sequence instruction instead
Some assembler may also able perform simple type
One concrete example may ubiquitous assembler various vendor
Most able perform replacement long jump replaced short relative jump number pass request
Others may even simple rearrangement insertion instruction assembler help optimize sensible exploit efficiently possible
Like early programming language assembler available since first generation text based
However assembler came first far simpler write
This mnemonic along addressing mode operand instruction translates rather directly numeric representation particular instruction without much context analysis
There also several class translator semi automatic property similar assembly perhaps one better known example
There may several assembler different particular
For instance instruction add memory data register processor might original whereas would written used
Despite different appearance different syntactic form generally generate numeric see
A single assembler may also different mode order support variation syntactic form well exact semantic interpretation ideal mode special case programming
There two type assembler based many pass source needed many time assembler read source produce object file
In case assembler must able determine size instruction initial pass order calculate address subsequent symbol
This mean size operation referring operand defined later depends type distance operand assembler make pessimistic estimate first encountering operation necessary pad one instruction later pas erratum
In assembler address may recalculated pass allow replacing pessimistic code code tailored exact distance target
The original reason use assembler speed assembly often second pas would require rewinding rereading program source rereading deck
Later computer much larger memory especially disc storage space perform necessary processing without
The advantage assembler absence erratum make assembler directly produce executable code faster
following code snippet assembler would able determine address backward reference assembling statement would able determine address forward reference assembling branch statement indeed may undefined
A assembler would determine address pas would known generating code pas More sophisticated provide language abstraction See detail
A program written assembly language consists series processor instruction known variously directive comment data
Assembly language instruction usually consist mnemonic followed list data argument parameter
These translated instruction loaded memory executed
For example instruction tell processor move
The binary code instruction followed identifier register use
The identifier register following load register data
This binary computer code made expressing follows
Here mean copy following value hexadecimal representation value
Assembly language family provides abbreviation instruction machine code written follows assembly language complete explanatory comment required semicolon
This much easier read remember
In assembly language mnemonic MOV may used family related instruction loading copying moving data whether immediate value value register memory location pointed value register
Other assembler may use separate opcode mnemonic L move memory register ST move register memory LR move register register MVI move immediate operand memory etc
The opcode copy value register move
Assembly language example follow
The syntax MOV also complex following example show
In case MOV mnemonic translated directly opcode range assembler programmer know remember
Transforming assembly language machine code job assembler reverse least partially achieved
Unlike many simple assembly statement machine language instruction
However case assembler may provide essentially macro expand several machine language instruction provide commonly needed functionality
For example machine lack branch greater equal instruction assembler may provide pseudoinstruction expands machine set le branch zero result set instruction
Most assembler also provide rich language discussed used vendor programmer generate complex code data sequence
Each machine language
Computers differ number type operation support different size number register representation data storage
While computer able carry essentially functionality way differ corresponding assembly language reflect difference
Multiple set syntax may exist single instruction set typically instantiated different assembler program
In case popular one usually supplied manufacturer used documentation
There large degree diversity way author assembler categorize statement nomenclature use
In particular describe anything machine mnemonic extended mnemonic
A typical assembly language consists type instruction statement used define program operation Instructions statement assembly language generally simple unlike
Generally mnemonic symbolic name single executable machine language instruction least one opcode mnemonic defined machine language instruction
Each instruction typically consists plus zero
Most instruction refer single value pair value
Operands immediate value coded instruction register specified instruction implied address data located elsewhere storage
This determined underlying processor architecture assembler merely reflects architecture work
often used specify combination opcode specific operand assembler use extended mnemonic mask NO OPeration nothing one step mask often used support specialized us instruction often purpose obvious instruction name
For example many CPU explicit NOP instruction instruction used purpose
In CPUs instruction used encode instruction
Some disassemblers recognize decode instruction
Similarly IBM assembler use extended mnemonic zero mask
For SPARC architecture known
Some assembler also support simple generate two machine instruction
For instance assembler instruction recognized generate followed
These sometimes known
Mnemonics arbitrary symbol published Standard uniform set mnemonic used assembler
The standard since withdrawn
There instruction used define data element hold data variable
They define type data length data
These instruction also define whether data available outside program program assembled separately program data section defined
Some assembler classify
Assembly directive also called command given assembler directing perform operation assembling instruction
Directives affect assembler operates may affect object code symbol table listing file value internal assembler parameter
Sometimes term reserved directive generate object code generate data
The name often start dot distinguish machine instruction
make assembly program dependent parameter input programmer one program assembled different way perhaps different application
Or used manipulate presentation program make easier read maintain
Another common use reserve storage area data optionally initialize content known value
Symbolic assembler let programmer associate arbitrary name memory location various constant
Usually every constant variable given name instruction reference location name thus promoting
In executable code name subroutine associated entry point call subroutine use name
Inside subroutine destination given label
Some assembler support lexically distinct normal symbol use GOTO destination
Some assembler NASM provide flexible symbol management letting programmer manage different automatically calculate offset within assign label refer literal value result simple computation performed assembler
Labels also used initialize constant variable relocatable address
Assembly language like computer language allow comment added program ignored assembly
Judicious commenting essential assembly language program meaning purpose sequence binary machine instruction difficult determine
The raw uncommented assembly language generated compiler disassemblers quite difficult read change must made
Many assembler support others support repeatedly macro involving sequence text line variable constant embedded
This sequence text line may include opcodes directive
Once macro defined name may used place mnemonic
When assembler process statement replaces statement text line associated macro process existed source code file including assembler expansion macro existing replacement text
Macros sense date IBM
In assembly language term macro represents comprehensive concept context define directive typically used create short single line macro
Assembler macro instruction like macro language lengthy program executed interpretation assembler assembly
Since macro name expand several indeed many line code used make assembly language program appear far shorter requiring fewer line source code higher level language
They also used add higher level structure assembly program optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameter similar feature
Macro assembler often allow macro take
Some assembler include quite sophisticated macro language incorporating language element optional parameter symbolic variable conditionals string manipulation arithmetic operation usable execution given macro allowing macro save context exchange information
Thus macro might generate numerous assembly language instruction data definition based macro argument
This could used generate data structure unrolled loop example could generate entire algorithm based complex parameter
For instance sort macro could accept specification complex sort key generate code crafted specific key needing test would required general procedure interpreting specification
An organization using assembly language heavily extended using macro suite considered working language since programmer working computer conceptual element
Underlining point macro used implement early written SNOBOL Implementation Language SIL assembly language virtual machine targeted physical machine transpiled native assembler via
This allowed high degree portability time
Macros used customize large scale software system specific customer mainframe era also used customer personnel satisfy employer need making specific version manufacturer operating system
This done example system programmer working Conversational Monitor System Virtual Machine IBM real time transaction processing Customer Information Control System system began still run many large CRS credit card system today
It also possible use solely macro processing ability assembler generate code written completely different language example generate version program using pure macro assembler program containing line COBOL code inside assembly time operator instructing assembler generate arbitrary code
IBM us macro perform
The user specifies option coding series assembler macro
Assembling macro generates build system including control statement
This realized concept macro processing independent concept assembly former modern term word processing text processing generating object code
The concept macro processing appeared appears C programming language support preprocessor instruction set variable make conditional test value
Note unlike certain previous macro processor inside assembler C preprocessor lack ability either loop go latter allowing program loop
Despite power macro processing fell disuse many high level language major exception remaining perennial assembler
Macro parameter substitution strictly name macro processing time value parameter textually substituted name
The famous class bug resulting use parameter expression simple name macro writer expected name
In macro intention caller would provide name variable global variable constant b would used multiply
If foo called parameter macro expansion occurs
To avoid possible ambiguity user macro processor parenthesize formal parameter inside macro definition caller parenthesize input parameter
Some assembler incorporated element encode execution flow
The earliest example approach originally proposed March implemented Marvin Kessler IBM Federal Systems Division extended macro assembler similar control flow block
This way reduce eliminate use operation assembly code one main factor causing assembly language
This approach widely accepted early latter day assembly language use
A curious design assembler processor developer operating system reported first commercial
The language classified assembler worked raw machine element memory reference incorporated expression syntax indicate execution order
Parentheses special symbol along structured programming construct controlled sequence generated instruction
built object language C compiler rather logical syntax fan
There little apparent demand sophisticated assembler since decline assembly language development
In spite still developed applied case resource constraint peculiarity target system architecture prevent effective use language
Assemblers strong macro engine allow structured programming via macro switch macro provided package note code complete program Assembly language use word date introduction
The first assembly language developed following work
The EDSAC assembler called featuring mnemonic
SOAP Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program assembly language computer written Stan Poley
Assembly language eliminate much tedious programming needed earliest computer freeing programmer tedium remembering numeric code calculating address
They widely used sort programming
However use largely supplanted language search improved
Today assembly language still used direct hardware manipulation access specialized processor instruction address critical performance issue
Typical us system
Historically numerous program written entirely assembly language
The first computer operating system developed entirely assembly language written ESPOL Algol dialect
Many commercial application written assembly language well including large amount software written large corporation
eventually displaced much work although number large organization retained application infrastructure well
Most early microcomputer relied assembly language including operating system large application
This system severe resource constraint imposed idiosyncratic memory display architecture provided limited buggy system service
Perhaps important lack language compiler suitable microcomputer use
A psychological factor may also played role first generation microcomputer programmer retained hobbyist wire plier attitude
In commercial context biggest reason using assembly language minimal bloat size minimal overhead greater speed reliability
Typical example large assembly language program time IBM PC operating system compiler early application program
According industry insider assembly language best computer language use get best performance console notoriously challenging develop program game
The arcade game another example
Assembly language long primary development language many popular home computer
This large part BASIC dialect system offered insufficient execution speed well insufficient facility take full advantage available hardware system
Some system even IDE highly advanced debugging macro facility
Some compiler available successor capability combine inline assembly source program statement
Upon compilation assembler produced inline machine code
There always debate usefulness performance assembly language relative language
Assembly language specific niche us important see
As July programming language popularity rank assembly language ahead example
Assembler used optimize speed optimize size
In case speed optimization modern claimed render language code run fast assembly despite found
The complexity modern processor memory make effective optimization increasingly difficult compiler well assembly programmer
Moreover increasing processor performance meant CPUs sit idle time delay caused predictable bottleneck cache miss operation
This made raw code execution speed many programmer
There situation developer might choose use assembly language Assembly language still taught program
Although programmer today regularly work assembly language tool underlying concept remain important
Such fundamental topic encoding processing design would hard study detail without grasp computer operates hardware level
Since computer behavior fundamentally defined instruction set logical way learn concept study assembly language
Most modern computer similar instruction set
Therefore studying single assembly language sufficient learn I basic concept II recognize situation use assembly language might appropriate III see efficient executable code created language

We mostly write programme high level language
So studying I came across assembly language
So assembler convert assembly language machine language compiler high level language
I found assembly language instruction like move move etc
And rather hard study
So assembly language created one came first even high level language
Why I studying assembler computer engineering class
So assembly language created
Assembly language created exact shorthand machine level coding would count day
It work machine level code instruction operand
Which one came first
Wikipedia good article Why I studying assembler computer engineering class
Though true probably wo find writing next customer app assembly still much gain learning assembly
Today assembly language used primarily direct hardware manipulation access specialized processor instruction address critical performance issue
Typical us device driver embedded system system
Assembly language close processor get programmer well designed algorithm blazing assembly great speed optimization
It performance efficiency
Assembly language give complete control system resource
Much like assembly line write code push single value register deal memory address directly retrieve value pointer
source So assembly language created
one came first even high level language
Yes assembly one first programming language used text input opposed soldering wire using plug board flipping switch
Each assembly language created one processor family processor instruction mapped directly run processor
Why I studying assembler computer engineering class
If need program device driver write compiler understanding processor work invaluable required
The best way understand write code assembly
If take look compiler writes code common see option without knowing assembly probably ca understood
If resolve bug input definitely need know assembly understand output assembly code lucky augmented higher level statement high level language
Let add one le practical aspect
This probably historic reason reason today
Assembly compared language
It hide anything done software simple sense relatively small fixed set operation
This helpful exact algorithm analysis
Semantics control flow simple counting operation expected number done annotating control flow graph transition count probability
Knuth TAoCP book great effect demonstrating rigorous algorithm analysis
Anecdote colleague learned read Java Bytecode exactly purpose
Why need assembly language
Well actually one language ever called machine language machine code
It look like It language CPU speaks technically different type CPUs speak different version
It also suck look try understand
Fortunately section binary corresponds particular meaning
It divided number section These value correspond So operation would add number register put value register
If literally put value CPU tell go add two number
The operation subtract could something instead
Whatever value make CPU subtraction
So program could look like try understand since I made particular version machine code explain thing Does suck read
Definitely

Well every machine code corresponds particular action let make simple English shorthand understand program convert real binary machine code give CPU run
So original instruction could look like Note English version
So write line English really writting friendlier understandable machine code
Well That exists originally created
To understand need read answer key understand High level language single representation machine code

C Python whatever This sound like addition assuming register register end register
But line
Try representing line bit binary telling CPU go
You ca
Machine code single operation instruction perform addition subtraction whatever else variable
So converted machine code first
This compile interpret high level language
Well program need assembly
Well say program running slowly expect want know
Looking machine language output line might look like Just get one line Python done
So really want debug

Rather ask compiler kindly give output form actually understand easily assembly language version corresponding machine code
Then figure compiler something dumb try fix
Extra note Raphael advice You could actually construct CPU work thing binary code like ternary base decimal code even ASCII
For practical purpose though really stuck binary
There answer Gary Burt All answer point Some people keep harping assembly language different numeric code CPU understands
This whilst true completely miss point
As far translation go assembly language numeric binary hex whatever one thing
If grok assembly know actual computer work
grokking assembly involves If grok assembly well nearly complete picture CPU connected keyboard work
You need use knowledge like brain surgeon us scalpel
Unless grok assembly thus CPU operating table never free clutch abstraction RAM machine god forbid Turing machine
Assembly also help understand manages defeat protection scheme
Q

It knowledge assembly matter knowledge machine working matter
If want know machine must understand mean speaking language machine
If stuck abstraction
That science good never complete picture
It like learning speak Unless aim guru level best stick know
Because fun

Since World War II recent decade Cold War growing belief effectiveness force Science Technology S T nation building
Government chief mandate briefly put development nation trusted economic social quality life etc
One major vehicle believed achieve end Science Technology S T
Programs government exploit venue developm nt S T Policy program
Chief activity S T change Innovation
An understanding Innovation process including structure source functional institutional player required order promote support sustain
The prime feedback Governments mechanism extensive set S T Indicators
S T Indicators help policy maker body government institution advisory capacity evaluate past present policy design implement new one
The study Indicators includes topic concept indicator model input output indicator contributor user indicator gathering analysis reporting indicator standard classification weakness strength
This paper report aspect recent study S T Indicators
It yet another step continued research issue National S T Policy framework graduate study School Communications Simon Fraser University SFU Vancouver Canada
The scientific advancement humanity achieved past two century hard soft science transportation communication agriculture health many front weight entire recorded history precedes
For born past two three decade like present writer inconceivable economic analysis policy without considering Science Technology
Today public mind many economist politician S T play core role development society one aspect
R D commonly accepted scientific activity measurement used Governments measure investment
The medium report analysis R D
Business magazine regularly publish data regarding R D investment firm
Stock Exchange reacts R D investment planning
More corporation considering R D data long term planning
It safe conclude today social structure Science Technology pivotal role play
Government official policy analyst economist corporate Chief Executive Offices CEO closely follow Science Technology change continuously evaluate impact try position respective institution benefit form become known
Ignoring S T detrimental Governments academic industry leader
It powerful force claimed attention best mind past decade
Understanding process scientific technological change measuring promoting using public advantage one advantage subject study deliberation large number researcher
Of special interest paper field Indicators
In order discus indicator word said model used describing S T change economic model relationship S T nature indicator usage innovation R D standard
In addition catalog S T indicator Canada produced compendium term maintained
Perhaps prevalent economical model used conjunction S T model
In model economic development directly dependant capital labour resource
To complete picture also added parameter
In mathematician language economics function capital labour resource knowledge This model indicates increased knowledge would turn result economic prosperity thing equal course
Increasing knowledge one would conclude key issue economic policy case Science policy
The first activity increase scientific knowledge readily come one mind Research Development R D
R D held nation public eye renowned activity increasing scientific knowledge explicit goal
The truth statement R D share increased knowledge disputed
A cursory study show venue increasing pool knowledge
The measurement technique employed firm acquisition adaptation diffusion new knowledge technology still early stage development
However let consider following two complimentary way available firm Scientific knowledge may brought firm industry country purchasing licensing patent
Firms may also acquire new knowledge mechanism instance searching public information system
New knowledge also imported form machinery method procedure purchased
That purchase technology intensive capital good bring embedded knowledge buyer
Therefore knowledge expressed term R D Purchased knowledge Embedded knowledge
In another word one way acquiring new knowledge
These may thought input model knowledge generation The study determination distribution generated knowledge various source knowledge one focal point Science Policy
This sort study requires modeling system measurement
In way field user S T Indicators
A word need said relationship Innovation R D
Often Innovation R D used interchangeably
That fine discussion limited R D related issue indicator R D
However distinction made help prevent misunderstanding along way clarifies scope study activity measurement performed published
For part study report produced researcher R D
Even interested process structure innovation often find directed people field towards literature primarily R D innovation
This situation give rise mental mpression equates R D innovation
R D seen people occupy entire sphere innovation activity
This impression point I like identify resolve section
Equating R D Innovation mistake student S T Policy must avoid
But perhaps root problem time solution traced document term defined standard use case I referring
In pursuing content manual standard one might lose sight explicit limitation defined manual
Published method standard usually include definition scope premise
In wake excitement generated pursue manual reader may neglect limitation imposed discussion author
The following passage Frascati Manual clarifies scope proposed standard practice R D therefore subordinate innovation one activity contributes directly scientific technological change
The implication study innovation one content solely issue R D
In fact identification activity relationship measurement becomes integral part innovation study
Despite said importance R D structure innovation denied
Wherever sign R D one conclude degree innovation must taking place
However innovative activity necessarily explicit R D activity least sense defined current standard
In another word R D maybe taken innovation
The concept indicator interesting field science
Some thing easy measure directly mass speed object
Sometimes difficult perhaps impossible directly measuring phenomenon quality life happiness course innovation
Indicators used tell u thing difficult measure
Technically building block constructed based information available phenomenon study
Often two term statistic indicator used interchangeably case present paper
As literal meaning word indicates indicator indication thing usually indicator emphasizing specific aspect well
For reason indicator known indirect measurement thing
As indicator imperfect measurement therefore several studied see trend concept described
By examining set indicator analyst discern trend behavior phenomenon hand
Monitoring fluctuation movement number indicator group time reveals relationship element
Indicators science technology may defined S T data need adjusted size economy labour represent
Therefore indicator expressed term ratio two statistic specific numerator general denominator
For example gross expenditure research development GERD GDP
This particular indicator suggests GERD related GDP smaller economy expected close larger economy
For u start elaborating system indicator defined need start initial understanding structure science technology
For instance one would expect performing S T activity would cost therefore funding institution provide monetory resource S T activity performing institution perform S T activity
So would natural want know fund much w way
Who performs activity distributed among player
We also know nature S T activity vary based aim performing institution hint classification S T activity based sector industry field science
Therefore would desirable know measure S T activity various field science technology
It also known whole range people involved S T activity researcher professor university technician
How many people involved
What qualification
What distribution force sector
performing institution
The point initial understanding structure source must place
It suggested initial perspective structure source S T existed prior establishing current system S T Indicators standard
This initial structure although explicit literature seen manual standard practice survey widely used
Further observed since inception standard year ago significant change made structure S T Indicators
The continuous r vision update manual standard Frascati response need international comparison rather mark change perception S T
This static state may suggest underlying perception S T structure source changed least significantly changed initial one
No matter structure model S T activity adopted almost certainly true measurement input model much easier output
In case output measured correlation input difficult task specially output In prevalent structure S T activity unit measurement
These course input system
Measuring term money people strength weakness
Money useful measure many area economic social indicator also expressed monetary unit
Therefore monetary measurement S T activity allows comparison investment S T area specially statistical unit closely match
Monetary data extended period time show trend expenditure S T activity
The availability monetary data due financial requirement funding nd performing institution another advantage form measurement
Many R D policy determined control financial resource available specially government
In sense monetary measurement play important role providing trend policy scientific activity
The expectation monetary unit effect exchange rate national comparison time among constraint monetary measurement
Measuring people problematic monetary one
Ease head count usefulness determining supply demand advantage
However person spends entire day S T activity specially working multiple project
Therefore concept PYs used obtain per caput data
Differences normal working day sector sector country country yet another complicating factor comparison data related human resource involved R D activity
People involved S T activity various qualification act widely different capacity role
For instance highly qualified scientist contribute different capacity laboratory technician
This situation requires classification type activity level qualification
And lastly monetary measurement expectation human unit effect another category
In system indicator three party need collaborate system successful
First party includes considered data contribute statistic funding institution performer
They usually referred
One classification statistical unit input R D activity detailed one found OECD Frascati Manual
Sources data may categorized three major group
One provides following The second group comprises includes private organization government granting body public private enterprise awarding contract S T activity
This group source following data The third group comprises institution S T activity performed
This perhaps important source data
This group consists four major sector Government business private higher education
Each sector challenge collecting S T data
The business sector composed firm different size economic activity therefore number different survey may required
Larger firm well established report ng procedure implemented various S T activity
However case involved multiple S T activity difficult report distribution resource activity accurately
Smaller firm however many number engaged S T activity therefore sampling would misleading
Small S T performing firm maybe identified data second group funding institution order make bett r sampling group
In government sector number group involved S T activity may far le business sector
They also may different level government local regional national different mandate defense education
Governments largest single source fund S T activity
Due accountability public government usually well established accounting system make data readily available
The private sector largely composed funding institution
It includes foundation organization
The last sector higher education represents difficult source data term collection
The reason difficulty may found fact people sector wide range activity source funding many
S T activity may part teaching function
Students progress research may also involved S T activity
Estimation play greater role collecting data sector sector
The second player data
Included would government local regional national level policy analyst recently large corporation
These special classification user beyond grouping user
Agencies unit provide advice government control body S T economic policy agency large S T operation funding responsibility legislature may cited public sector
Anyone else interested influencing public sector would fall private sector
The third final player data
The collection data involve process
In following excerpt Stead outline activity collector S T data
There little said collector S T data literature
The study infrastructure local regional national level identification establishment information technology IT required support facilitate activity accurate speedy collection S T data task enterprise placement enhancement national system S T indicator goal
Each sector S T data challenge identifying collecting reporting S T activity
In general lack proper record S T activity primary source problem producing accurate data
This problem acute higher education institution
Sources S T statistical data specially business higher education sector appropriate accounting system based S T activity therefore financi l expenditure human resource must estimated
It level estimation required main source concern
There set document put forth international standard practice survey S T related activity
Notably among set two one United Nations Educational Scientific Cultural Organization UNESCO Organizations Economic Development OECD
The UNESCO OECD document compatible yet different OECD set although within UNESCO recommendation specific R D need OECD member country list OECD member country see Compendium
Also OECD considers S T activity relate R D
The UNESCO Division Statistics Science technology organized systematic collection analysis publication standardization data concerning science technology since
It primarily concern human financial input R D
UNESCO achievement development measuring scientific technical activity marked following publication In set last one response need expressed international standard could used applied member state
The OECD document set includes following These document continuously updated OECD
counterpart item emphasized UNESCO set last item
No paper indicator related science technological change complete without mentioning sister document
With first draft year ago achieves goal defining standard practice classification purpose R D input data
It widely used frequently sited paper like one
Frascati fit within recommendation UNESCO time specific need OECD member country
Member country collecting data related S T since
However international comparison impossible presence difference concept method scope data collected
Frascati result need standardize data collected reporting
The practice described Manual brought light many aspect innovation thereby contributing significantly growing knowledge structure source innovation
A side effect knowledge realization data exclusively R D particular limited input true measure subject hand
Although necessary R D input data need augmented type data form better perspective innovation
There therefore several point bear mind considering Manual
It exclusively deal R D input data In measurement expenditure devoted R D include government fiscal incentive offered term tax credit R D performing firm
This fiscal incentive government tax revenue forgone promoting R D
In case Canada tax credit amount substantial source funding R D performing firm
Embedded approach adopted Frascati Manual classification description indicator assumption based linear model
It assumes linear model growth scientific knowledge
Briefly linear model advocate innovation take place linear fashion start research invention moving onto innovation finally diffusion new technique
Linear model though widely used increasingly believed abstract adequ tely represent dynamic S T change
Nevertheless continues inform policy maker
For reason economic historian Nathan Rosenberg said linear model
There model used describing system innovation model model
The three latter model take much sophisticated approach describing structure S T change Linear model

Frascati Manual assumes uniformity structure resource innovation across industry country
Such uniformity exist
In fact ever increasingly unfoldment perception R D data bring suggests marked difference process innovation industry country structure source
Another aspect assumption based uniformity related degree effectiveness measured unit system
For example assumes every dollar spent one industry country equal effect dollar spent another industry country
The hold human resource measured across industry country
In summary pursuing content Frascati Manual employing proposed standard creating national system R D Indicators one conscientious explicit scope implicit assumption limitation briefly outlined
Canada member country OECD
It concept definition methodology collection statistic research development based OECD guideline adaptation Canadian situation
Grouping basis framework Canada system indicator measurement people money involved Canada S T activity indicator input side economic return patent citation data output side
This section outline categorization Canadian R D player found report
For detailed definition discussion see Frascati Manual Statistics Canada
The purpose listing primarily displaying entire categorization several level detail
It help building bird eye view landscape Canadian player viewed reporting agency specially Statistics Canada
Current indicator Canada scientific technological activity The first five activity cataloged section
A brief description note usage calculation strength weakness included
A selected type chart report found activity also listed
The standard measuring indicator S T expenditure summary statistic gross domestic expenditure R D GERD
For part Canadian GERD compatible OECD definition difference exist
OECD considers Natural Sciences Engineering NSE Social Sciences Humanities SSH measuring GERD
Canada however includes NSE
Statistics SSH exist OECD version Canadian GERD presented two form NSE alone NSE SSH together
GERD reported matrix funding performing sector
Such matrix essentially measure flow R D fund one unit another
The matrix illustrated
The following paragraph outline major characteristic GERD usage R D measurement
The GERD indicator S T activity
It appropriately used summery R D activity basic flow fund
It serf general indicator S T activity detailed inventory R D project within organization sector country
It estimate show trend R D expenditure sector region country year year
In capacity GERD estimate sufficiently reliable th ir main use aggregate indicator science policy
Sum Intramural Extramural expenditure
Procedures measuring R D expenditure listed Frascati Manual There two criterion include fund R D flow As single aggregate indicator show trend R D expenditure sector region country year year
In capacity GERD estimate sufficiently reliable main use aggregate indicator science policy
The Federal Government highly involved S T activity funder performer
The Federal Government largest funding institution Canada billion generous Tax Incentive program billon totaling billion
Half expenditure billion intramural S T activity place Federal Government one major performer well
Therefore monetary personnel data reported Federal Government funder performer S T activity
The following categorization personnel engaged R D activity found statistical report The following breakdown personnel R D activity also used The widely used indicator personnel working S T Highly Qualified Personnel HQP
What follows describes characteristic indicator
Head count used determining supply demand planning training hiring
used calculate per caput expenditure
There two widely used indicator The strength HQP data lie usage help determining supply demand planning training hiring
Head count equivalent data assumes uniform effect people engaged R D
Canada also collect report output R D activity
One indicator measurement scientific literature form publication citation
One series statistic count number publication
It usually reported field research
Another series count citation Canadian publication internationally reported field research
Both series usually associated university sector publication method dissemination therefore direct indicator
One main usage international comparison
It also help identifying author high impact paper journal leading university corporation subject area
There national international database publication registered
Data collected includes date author institution subject matter citation
One prominent database Science Citation Index SCI database developed maintained Institute Scientific Information ISI
ISI index includes paper published since citation
For university sector citation analysis direct measurement
Citation direct indicator university sector must used caution Government industry
Scientists working Government consultant industry disseminate work mean often receive proper acknowledgment work
Another problem series indicator found corporate secrecy prevents publication scientist work industry
There issue concern citation ata Patent good measure accumulation national intellectual capital
It represents one aspect country R D effort
Its good approximation technological sophistication
Patent office record used determine figure
Canadian Intellectual Property Office CIPO maintains record
CIPO received application granted patent
Indicators based underlying statistical data R D activity
The classification collection interpretation R D data reflect perception structure resource activity objective innovation
This perception must need evolve former set study bring better understanding innovation
At time three four decade pause redefine perception consequently update standard survey classificatio innovation study reflect new dynamic framework
A observation already made recent literature Three major result may observed total experience Innovation study
First innovation wide industrial distribution
It confined large firm
Innovation Small Enterprises SME pervasive
Total sum SME personnel innovative activity comparable large firm personnel
Second follows R D necessarily good indicator innovation intensity
R D maybe taken innovation
Where R D found probably innovation taking place exact measure intensity determined R D alone
In addition absence R D necessarily indicate absence innovative activity
Thirdly considerable variation structure source purpose innovation among industry
This observation implies industry specific study required build accurate picture
In general innovation far pervasive originally perceived far variable structure resource activity outcome recognized current policy instrument method standard
This diversity exists among country importantly within national bounder institution industry therefore diversity
A system policy instrument method informed structure source innovation diversity order design enact effective policy measure
Therefore policy depend better understanding innovational complexity variation process hardly begun explored empirical term
This compendium started previous study
This new listing new entry bringing total undser entry multiple item
As growing entry seem fall distinct category The future version compendium group entry appropriate heading based searchable database provided Internet Web Browser interface
There many working definition acronym found core manual Innovation Indicators
As subject thesis closely related I decided start compiling glossary term covering acronym definition major reference one
Such compendium essential help finding exact definition reference various terminology quickly

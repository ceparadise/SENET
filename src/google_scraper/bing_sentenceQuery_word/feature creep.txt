ongoing expansion addition new product especially
These extra feature go beyond basic function product result rather simple design
The common cause feature creep desire provide consumer useful desirable product order increase sale distribution
However product reach point everything designed manufacturer left choice adding unneeded function sometimes cost efficiency sticking old version cost perceived lack improvement
Another major cause feature creep might decides implement multiple different viewpoint use case product
Then feature added support approach might necessary feature multiple paradigm complicating total feature
A product typically go introduction growth maturity decline
The serve functional example whose life cycle
At introduction stage manufacturer introduces new product basic feature set say portable cassette player play pause stop fast forward rewind eject order engage consumer support use acceptance meanwhile competitor wait see product create market worth investing quickly produce product le
With sufficient growth competitor enter space providing choice consumer often competing merely price cheaper alternative flagship brand product offering
At maturity stage competitive product occupying space new feature introduced stereo extra bass shock proof jogging waterproof rain etc
order differentiate brand beyond merely price point create brand demand price demand
The trailblazer looking fend new challenger new challenger looking get leg trailblazer
It stage proliferation feature occurs often
A strong indicator maturity stage reached beyond feature creep trailblazer price start drop response downward pressure competition
This may occur practical feature implemented point referred feature saturation
Obsolescence primary cause decline time technology advance beyond incumbent market segment leading technology
The portable music player platform CD platform predominated
Each successive platform shift effectively rendered previous platform outdated
Feature creep one common source schedule overrun
It thus endangers even kill product project
There several method control feature creep including strict limit allowable feature multiple variation pruning excess feature
Temptation later feature creep may avoided degree basing initial design strong software fundamental logical separation functionality data access
It actively controlled rigorous delaying change later delivery phase project
Another method controlling feature creep maintain multiple variation product feature kept limited variation
Because addition new feature might exceed available resource minimal core basic version product maintained separately ensure operation smaller operating environment
Using basic product variation might support need user would subjected complexity extra expense feature requested user
The extra feature still available crept version product
At point cost maintaining particular subset feature might become prohibitive pruning used
A new product version could simply omit extra feature perhaps transition period would used old feature eventual removal system
If multiple variation product might phased use
Occasionally uncontrolled feature creep lead product far beyond scope originally intended known
However common consequence feature creep delay cancellation product may become expensive originally intended
Often reasonably software project one moderate amount feature creep survive even thrive many iteration successor release may suffer substantial delay decision taken rewrite whole code base addition introducing new technology
For example Microsoft planned minor release successor codenamed adapting feature Blackcomb many eventually cancelled Vista turned become major release took five year development
A similar fate suffered originally supposed
The decision Netscape Communications Netscape Navigator browser Communicator Internet suite Mozilla soon made obvious underlying code difficult required complete rewrite Mozilla fostered creation
This caused significant delay Netscape skipped company purchased AOL
The subsequent release Netscape widely criticized code project reached stability Netscape three year decision rework Internet suite
By time Microsoft Internet Explorer browser Netscape usage share diminished single digit
Even reaching stability attaining necessary new feature named Mozilla AOL built Netscape viewed
Just year later group Mozilla developer decided separate browser component eventually became
Double Fine Adventures project another example project delayed feature creep
Originally supposed release date October first half game released January second half followed late April required two separate funding round complete
Feature creep combined short deadline often lead
The desired change may large enough warrant redesign existing project foundation deadline pressure instead requires developer make work le elegant approach
The humorous feeping creaturism coined emphasize developer dislike situation personifying product misshapen creature hack prowling dark harbinger creep come

Feature creep refers software hardware becomes complicated difficult use result many feature
In addition poorer usability feature creep cause product actually become le stable unintended result various component
The term primarily used reference software also used hardware
The thing software package software vendor need keep releasing new version order keep generating revenue
It hard sell new version something old version
As result feature included even though average user might never use
The modern computer main component closely similar computer produced decaess ago
Some would argue progress actually bunch unused feature make computer le stable
For example DOS one common OSs older PCs replaced version Windows vast majority installation
Windows literally thousand additional feature far far DOS
However DOS crash remain rare whereas Windows crashing regular basis

Learn something new every day email Feature creep also called scope creep refers tendency project requirement exceed original estimation
It common development major computer project engineer decide additional feature added product release make usable enjoyable target market
It also happen client contracting project keep adding wish list
Feature creep affect overall project well delaying release time considerably causing frustration company executive
It also ultimately weaken product clogging interesting unneeded feature company need take care avoid
The problem mitigated tightly organized recognizes exact requirement project work together meet
A project aware risk feature creep help head pas refocusing team reminding client original goal project
On occasion exceeding estimation actually necessary especially large project engineer exploring new concept
In instance several team member meet together evaluate feature creep occurring decide whether valid result direction project moving
Especially case software temptation succumb feature creep often intense
Software developer constantly thinking new way improve product certain point project manager must put stop
Feature creep case reduced frequent project meeting remind participant project goal stated beginning
When developing kind new product team always meet together starting work agree created team want product accomplish goal
Efforts discourage scope creep designed punish creativity
Rather team member make note additional feature think would interesting useful submit along weekly project note
If member team agree feature vital added project development
If feature interesting necessary particular project release tabled development later release project whether new software car sort device
Iluviaporos That game software need ensure kind unique hook first place
If game another generic first person shooter example yes make sure latest bell whistle order competitive
If spend time story making sure solid mechanic compelling visuals though matter absolute latest gimmick
And go software
You want able provide something unique stuff everyone else providing
If got something unique concentrating rather trying add extra product
browncoat I think matter never allowing new technology current game design though
Gamers like latest thing game game massive investment
If put year work release based capability medium three year ago one going want play
You keep adding new feature forever never release game also put mediocre product
You make sure understand current market stay competitive within
Feature creep video game serious problem plenty project abandoned
The trouble technology continues advance fast rate game take year finish even kept strictly schedule
The temptation always change game progress incorporate latest technology
But always thing add take time money
One editor review suggestion make change warranted
Note depending number suggestion receive take anywhere hour day

Creep material science propensity solid material move slowly deform permanently influence mechanical stress
It happen result exposure high level stress still beneath yield strength material
Creep severe material subjected heat long period generally increase near melting point
Creep usually concern engineer metallurgist assessing component operate high stress high temperature
Design consideration important avoid creep
Creep also known cold flow
Creep deformation certain applied load
It occurs high temperature thermal creep also happen room temperature certain material albeit much slower
Creep may may constitute failure mode
For example moderate creep concrete sometimes welcomed relief tensile stress might otherwise lead cracking
Depending magnitude applied stress duration deformation may become large component longer perform example creep turbine blade may cause blade contact casing resulting failure blade
Since creep minimum temperature related material melting point creep seen relatively low temperature material
Plastics metal including many solder begin creep room temperature seen markedly old lead pipe
Creep deformation important system high temperature endured nuclear power plant jet engine heat exchanger also design many everyday object

Feature creep also known requirement creep scope creep tendency product feature project requirement increase development beyond originally foreseen
Feature creep also suggests ongoing behavior addition new feature performed without consideration original project goal without corresponding increase project budget schedule
The one thing certain development process change
People change
Businesses change
While important able adapt ongoing project requirement change timely fashion must ensure addition line business goal provides measurable business value impact project scope budget schedule known
A disadvantage uncontrolled feature creep Sorry
Feature creep unavoidable
It happens
Sometimes good reason expanding product feature set
Ensure every new feature added product directly support overall purpose goal
You allowing enough time requirement gathering ensure vision
Then new feature must explicit REAL impact cost schedule overall complexity quality product
Don discount small change
Small addition great impact
That change took one hour implement may little impact budget schedule may create complexity impact technical quality product increase maintenance cost
The recommendation dealing feature creep avoid expect plan
Then use change control process evaluating assessing newly requested feature

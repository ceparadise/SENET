operator function space
This point view turned particularly useful study
The usage word go back implying function whose argument function name first used book subject
However general concept functional previously introduced Italian mathematician physicist
The theory nonlinear functionals continued student Hadamard particular
Hadamard also founded modern school linear functional analysis developed mathematician around
In modern introductory text functional analysis subject seen study vector space endowed topology particular
In contrast deal mostly space use topology
An important part functional analysis extension theory infinite dimensional space also known
The basic historically first class space studied functional analysis
Such space called
An important example norm arises inner product
These space fundamental importance many area including
More generally functional analysis includes study endowed norm
An important object study functional analysis defined Banach Hilbert space
These lead naturally definition
completely classified unique Hilbert space every
Hilbert space fully understood Hilbert space isomorphic
Separability important application functional analysis Hilbert space consequently mostly deal space
One open problem functional analysis prove every bounded linear operator Hilbert space proper
Many special case already proven
General complicated Hilbert space classified simple manner
In particular many Banach space lack notion analogous
Examples Banach space real number
Given also measure set sometimes also denoted vector equivalence class whose power finite integral function one If integral may replaced sum
That require Then necessary deal equivalence class space denoted written simply case set
In Banach space large part study involves space linear map space underlying field functionals
A Banach space canonically identified subspace bidual dual dual space
The corresponding map general onto
A general Banach space bidual need even isometrically isomorphic way contrary situation
This explained dual space article
Also notion extended arbitrary function Banach space
See instance article
Important result functional analysis include The one fundamental result functional analysis
Together considered one cornerstone field
In basic form asserts family thus bounded operator whose domain pointwise boundedness equivalent uniform boundedness operator norm
The theorem first published also proven independently
Let
Suppose collection continuous linear operator
If one There many theorem known one particular many application functional analysis
Let operator multiplication Theorem Let bounded operator Hilbert space
Then measurable function unitary operator This beginning vast research area functional analysis called see also
There also analogous spectral theorem bounded Hilbert space
The difference conclusion may
The central tool functional analysis
It allows extension defined subspace whole space also show enough linear functionals defined every make study interesting
If
exists linear extension whole space exists linear functional The also known theorem named fundamental result state
More precisely The proof us completeness essential theorem
The statement theorem longer true either space assumed true taken
The closed graph theorem state following If graph linear map closed

Most space considered functional analysis infinite dimension
To show existence space may require
However somewhat different concept usually relevant functional analysis
Many important theorem require usually proved using although strictly weaker suffices
The needed prove many important theorem also requires form axiom choice
Functional analysis present form includes following tendency

Tools analysis useful study many problem theoretical computer science
Perhaps surprisingly many case discrete feature problem allow application sophisticated analytical tool
A seminal example phenomenon use inequality analysis Boolean function first demonstrated Kahn Kalai Linial
Results discrete analysis play important role hardness approximation computational learning computational social choice communication complexity

Functional analyst also known computer system analyst system analyst study way computer system function
When find problem recommend system procedure make operation efficient effective
Functional analyst may work within organization employee outside consultant
Functional analyst begin job gathering information interview employee manager studying procedure system currently place
They design computer system meet organization requirement researching emerging technology new solution using technique data modeling creates rule computer follow
They typically prepare report balance cost benefit present manager
When given functional analyst install configure new system upgrade existing one
They run test ensure system meet specification write user manual documentation train existing user new capability
A bachelor degree computer information science typical profession although business liberal art major might also acceptable candidate strong computer background
Some larger employer complex function prefer MBA concentration information system

application law establish relationship
To establish function operant behavior one typically examines contingency first identifying EO AO identifying antecedent trigger behavior identifying behavior identifying consequence behavior continues maintain
Functional assessment employ principle derived natural science behavior analysis determine reason purpose motivation behavior
The robust form functional assessment functional analysis involves direct manipulation using experimental design multielement design reversal design various antecedent consequent event measurement effect behavior interest method functional assessment allows demonstration clear cause behavior
Functional analysis consequence analysis commonly used certain type psychotherapy better understand case change behavior
It particularly common although also part Aaron Beck
In addition functional analysis modified behavior chain analysis often used
There several advantage using functional analysis traditional assessment method
Firstly behavioral observation reliable traditional method
This observing individual objective stand point regular environment allows observer observe antecedent consequence problem behavior
Secondly functional analysis advantageous allows development behavioral intervention either antecedent control consequence control specifically designed reduce problem behavior
Thirdly functional analysis advantageous intervention young child developmentally delayed child problem behavior may able answer question reason action
Despite benefit functional analysis also disadvantage
The first standard method determining function determined show different methodology appear bias result toward particular function well effective improving outcome
Second Gresham colleague review JABA article found functional assessment produce greater effect size compared simple program
However Gresham et al
combined three type functional assessment descriptive assessment indirect assessment reliably found produce result limited validity Third although functional assessment conducted variety host population
much current functional assessment research limited child developmental disability

Functional analysis methodology used explain working complex system
The basic idea system viewed computing function generally solving information processing problem
Functional analysis assumes processing explained decomposing complex function set simpler function computed organized system subprocessors
The hope type decomposition performed subfunctions defined simpler original function result easier explain
A detailed treatment functional analysis provided Cummins
He proposes methodology defines functional analysis
In first stage function defined
In second stage performed
The function decomposed organized set simpler function
This analysis proceed recursively decomposing subfunctions
In third stage analysis stopped bottom level function
This mean operation operation explained appealing natural law mechanical biological principle
If functional analysis applied information processing system level subsumed function defines functional architecture information processor
Functional analysis important cognitive science offer natural methodology explaining information processing carried
For instance black box diagram offered model theory cogntive psychologist represents result carrying analytic stage functional analysis
Any proposal constitutes cognitive architecture viewed hypothesis nature cognitive function level function subsumed

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

In program described designed remember preceding event user interaction remembered information called system
The set state system occupy known
In state space often system internal behaviour interaction environment consists separately occurring individual action event accepting input producing output may may cause system change state
Examples system circuit component
The output digital circuit computer program time completely determined current input state
circuit divided two type whose output dependent present input signal whose output function current input past history input
In sequential logic information past input stored electronic memory element
The stored content memory element given point time collectively referred circuit contains information past circuit access
Since two possible state finite number memory element digital circuit certain finite number possible state
If number binary memory element circuit maximum number state circuit
Similarly computer program store data represent storage location computer
The content memory location given point program execution called program
way designing describes computation term program state statement change program state
In language program describes desired result specify change state directly
A specialized definition state used computer program operate sequentially stream data program
Serial program operate incoming data character packet sequentially one time
In program information previous data character packet received stored variable used affect processing current character packet
This called data carried previous processing cycle called state
In others program information previous data stream start fresh data input called
The output sequential circuit computer program time completely determined current input current state
Since memory element two possible state total number different state circuit assume finite fixed number memory element
If binary memory element digital circuit distinct state
The concept state formalized abstract mathematical called used design sequential digital circuit computer program
An example everyday device state
To change channel TV user usually press channel channel button remote control sends coded message set
In order calculate new channel user desire digital tuner television must stored number
It add one subtracts one number get number new channel adjusts TV receive channel
This new number stored
Similarly television also store number control level produced speaker
Pressing volume volume button increment decrement number setting new level volume
Both number part TV state
They stored preserve information TV turned turned TV return previous station volume level
As another example state content memory element
When computer laptop go save energy shutting processor state processor stored computer restored computer come hibernation processor take operation left
Following state distinguished

learn share knowledge build career
One topic seems come regularly mailing list online discussion merit lack thereof Computer Science Degree
An argument seems come time negative party coding number year never used recursion
So question This question exists historical significance please use evidence ask similar question
This question answer frozen changed
More info
There number good explanation thread answer use language
In majority major imperative language implementation
every major implementation C Basic Python Ruby Java C vastly preferable recursion
To see walk step language use call function Doing step take time usually little bit take iterate loop
However real problem step
When many program start allocate single chunk memory stack run memory often always due recursion program crash due
So language recursion slower make vulnerable crashing
There still argument using though
In general code written recursively shorter bit elegant know read
There technique language implementers use called eliminate class stack overflow
Put succinctly function return expression simply result function call need add new level onto stack reuse current one function called
Regrettably imperative optimization built
By way Mario typical name ArrangeString function join I surprised language choice already implementation
Simple english example recursion
In basic computer science sense recursion function call
Say linked list structure And want find long linked list recursion This could course done loop well useful illustration concept Whenever function call creating loop recursion
As anything good us bad us recursion
The simple example tail recursion last line function call However lame almost pointless example easily replaced efficient iteration
After recursion suffers function call overhead example could substantial compared operation inside function
So whole reason recursion rather iteration take advantage clever stuff
For example call function multiple time different parameter inside loop way accomplish
A classic example
You draw one simply recursion call stack branch direction If attempt thing iteration I think find take lot code accomplish
Other common use case might include traversing hierarchy
website crawler directory comparison etc
In practical term recursion make sense whenever need iterative branching
Recursion method solving problem based divide conquer mentality
The basic idea take original problem divide smaller easily solved instance solve smaller instance usually using algorithm reassemble final solution
The canonical example routine generate Factorial The Factorial n calculated multiplying number An iterative solution C look like There nothing surprising iterative solution make sense anyone familiar C
The recursive solution found recognising nth Factorial n Fact
Or put another way know particular Factorial number calculate next one
Here recursive solution C The first part function known sometimes Guard Clause prevents algorithm running forever
It return value whenever function called value le
The second part interesting known
Here call method slightly modified parameter decrement multiply result copy When first encountered kind confusing instructive examine work run
Imagine call FactRec
We enter routine picked base case end like If method parameter stopped guard clause end If substitute return value return value get This give clue final solution arrived fast track show step way That final substitution happens base case triggered
At point simple algrebraic formula solve equates directly definition Factorials first place
It instructive note every call method result either base case triggered call method parameter closer base case often called recursive call
If case method run forever
Recursion solving problem function call
A good example factorial function
Factorial math problem factorial example
This function solves C positive integer tested may bug
The canonical example factorial look like In general recursion necessarily fast function call overhead tends high recursive function tend small see suffer problem stack overflow anyone
Some say tend hard get case I really buy
In situation recursion make sense elegant clear way write particular function
It noted language favor recursive solution optimize much LISP come mind
Recursion refers method solves problem solving smaller version problem using result plus computation formulate answer original problem
Often time process solving smaller version method solve yet smaller version problem reach base case trivial solve
For instance calculate factorial number one represent
Thus method recurses find factorial multiplies whatever got give final answer
Of course find factorial first calculate factorial
The base case would case know return since
Consider In mathematics gcd two integer largest positive integer divide number without remainder
The definition gcd surprisingly simple mod remainder integer division
In English definition say greatest common divisor number zero number greatest common divisor two number greatest common divisor remainder dividing
If like know work see Wikipedia article
Let compute gcd example
Each step equal one In first step equal zero second part definition applies
mod go remainder
At step second part applies time mod divide remainder
At step second argument answer
Did notice gcd appears left right side equal sign
A mathematician would say definition recursive expression defining inside definition
Recursive definition tend elegant
For example recursive definition sum list first element list rest list
Note recurs inside definition end
Maybe prefer maximum value list instead You might define multiplication integer recursively turn series addition If bit transforming multiplication series addition make sense try expanding simple example see work
lovely recursive definition Recursive definition around know look
Notice definition simple base case gcd The recursive case whittle away problem get easy answer
With understanding appreciate algorithm
A recursive function one call
The common reason I found use traversing tree structure
For example I TreeView checkboxes think installation new program choose feature install page I might want check button would something like pseudocode So see checkRecursively first check node passed call node child
You need bit careful recursion
If get infinite recursive loop get Stack Overflow exception I ca think reason people use appropriate
It useful circumstance others
I think interesting technique coder perhaps end using often without real justification
This given recursion bad name circle
Recursion work best I like call fractal problem dealing big thing made smaller version big thing even smaller version big thing
If ever traverse search something like tree nested identical structure got problem might good candidate recursion
People avoid recursion number reason Most people included cut programming teeth procedural programming opposed functional programming
To people iterative approach typically using loop feel natural
Those u cut programming teeth procedural programming often told avoid recursion error prone
We often told recursion slow
Calling returning routine repeatedly involves lot stack pushing popping slower looping
I think language handle better others language likely dominant paradigm procedural
For least couple programming language I used I remember hearing recommendation use recursion get beyond certain depth stack deep
Recursion expression directly indirectly referencing
Consider recursive acronym simple example Here simple example many element set
better way count thing nice simple recursive example
First need two rule Suppose set like x x x
let count many item
We represent When applying recursive solution usually least rule If translate pseudocode get There lot useful example traversing tree example I sure people cover
For example take factorial But easy see factorial also So generally Of course tricky thing recursion want define thing term already done need place start
In example make special case defining factorial
Now see bottom Since defined factorial reach bottom
Generally speaking recursive procedure two part The recursive part defines procedure term new input combined already done via procedure

A base part make sure process repeat forever giving place start
It bit confusing get head around first look bunch example come together
If want much deeper understanding concept study mathematical induction
Also aware language optimize recursive call others
It pretty easy make insanely slow recursive function careful also technique make performant case
Hope help
I like definition In recursion routine solves small part problem divide problem smaller piece call solve smaller piece
I also like Steve McConnells discussion recursion Code Complete criticises example used Computer Science book Recursion
One problem textbook present silly example recursion
The typical example computing factorial computing Fibonacci sequence
Recursion powerful tool really dumb use either case
If programmer worked used recursion compute factorial hire someone else
I thought interesting point raise may reason recursion often misunderstood
EDIT This dig Dav answer I seen reply I posted
A method recursive call either directly indirectly
When use recursion
People use recursion complex write iterative code
For example tree traversal technique like preorder postorder made iterative recursive
But usually use recursive simplicity
To recurse solved problem nothing done
To recurse open problem next step recurse rest
Well pretty decent definition
And wikipedia good definition
So I add another probably worse definition
When people refer recursion usually talking function written call repeatedly done work
Recursion helpful traversing hierarchy data structure
An example A recursive definition staircase A staircase consists single step staircase recursion single step termination In plain English Assume thing The process repeating thing till done called recursion
I hope plain english answer looking
A recursive function function contains call
A recursive struct struct contains instance
You combine two recursive class
The key part recursive item contains
Consider two mirror facing
We seen neat infinity effect make
Each reflection instance mirror contained within another instance mirror etc
The mirror containing reflection recursion
A good programming example recursion
The structure recursive Node containing instance Node
Functions work binary search tree also recursive
This old question I want add answer logistical point view algorithm correctness point view performance point view
I use Java work Java support nested function
As I want recursion I might define external function exists code bump Java bureaucratic rule I might refactor code altogether I really hate
Thus I often avoid recursion use stack operation instead recursion essentially stack operation
You want use anytime tree structure
It useful reading XML
Recursion applies programming basically calling function inside definition inside different parameter accomplish task
Recursion strategy problem every step turn small thing one bigger thing time hammer
Suppose desk covered disorganized mess paper
How make one neat clean stack paper mess using recursion
Notice pretty intuitive aside counting everything strictly necessary
You might go way stack reality could would still work
The important part hammer With arm always put one stack top make bigger stack matter within reason big either stack
Recursion process method call iself able perform certain task
It reduces redundency code
Most recurssive function method must condifiton break recussive call
stop calling condition met prevents creating infinite loop
Not function suited used recursively
hey sorry opinion agrees someone I trying explain recursion plain english
suppose three manager Jack John Morgan
Jack manages programmer John Morgan going give every manager want know would cost
The answer obvious employee also manager
HERE come recursion
start top hierarchy
summery cost
start Jack Then check manager employee
find check manager employee
Add summery cost every time find manager
finished Jack go John employee Morgan
You never know much cycle go getting answer though know many manager many Budget spend
Recursion tree branch leaf called parent child respectively
When use recursion algorithm le consciously building tree data
In plain English recursion mean repeat someting
In programming one example calling function within
Look following example calculating factorial number Any algorithm exhibit recursion datatype basically consists case case datatype
example working type structural recursive algorithm would form really obvious way write algorith work data structure
look integer well natural number defined using Peano axiom see structural recursive algorithm integer look like factorial function trivial example form
function call use definition

Modern computer science dominated men
But always way
A lot computing pioneer people programmed first digital computer woman
And decade number woman studying computer science growing faster number men
But something changed
The percentage woman computer science flattened plunged even kept rising
What happened
We spent past week trying answer question clear single answer
But good starting place The share woman computer science started falling roughly moment personal computer started showing home significant number
These early personal computer much toy
You could play pong simple shooting game maybe word processing
And toy marketed men boy
This idea computer boy became narrative
It became story told computing revolution
It helped define geek created techie culture
Movies like came
And plot summary almost interchangeable awkward geek boy genius us tech savvy triumph adversity win girl
In researcher interviewed hundred computer science student Carnegie Mellon University one top program country
She found family much likely buy computer boy girl even girl really interested computer
This big deal kid got college
As personal computer became common computer science professor increasingly assumed student grown playing computer home
Patricia Ordóñez computer home math wiz school
My teacher realized I really good solving problem pulled boy special math say
We math instead recess
So Ordóñez got Johns Hopkins University figured would study computer science electrical engineering
Then took first intro class found male classmate way ahead grown playing computer
I remember one time I asked question professor stopped looked said know recall
And I thought never going excel
In never would happened Professors intro class assumed student came experience
But changed
Ordóñez got class earned first C life
She eventually dropped program majored foreign language
More decade later though returned computer
She found mentor eventually got computer science
Now assistant professor computer science University Puerto Rico
Imagine could call friend say Meet bar tell going economy
Now imagine actually fun evening
That going

The growing demand student around world UK qualification evidence UK university offer high level technical skill knowledge
Recent international comparison ranked teaching research UK university among best qualification comparison body NARIC rank UK qualification highest quality band worldwide
Yet many employer complain graduate taught skill want many large employer admit recruiting elite Russell Group university
How picture compare rest world
The USA also report increasing demand coupled skill shortage IT sector repeated across EU Canada Australia
By contrast much developing world employer willing invest qualification staff one reason significant demand UK postgraduate degree amongst international student
So many recent UK computer science graduate unemployed
Input based recent report commissioned investigated data produced Higher Education Statistics Agency HESA cite number interrelated factor affecting unemployment
Some factor obvious quality degree obtained location within UK institution study one key factor employment rate black minority ethnic BME student

Recently I received email blue someone read still incomplete essay I wrote combining Physics Computer Science
He said horrible physic asked CS student need take physic course
Here response along original email
Names withheld
After reading article combining Physics Computer Science I actually want know opinion experience far combining two
You see I majoring computer science one school I trying transfer requires least two year calculus based physic
I really good programming mathematics computer science I horrible physic
I really understand physic really needed someone like going focus OS design algorithm analysis perhaps give answer
Furthermore importantly bad physic automatically make bad programmer
Various thought particular order A fair question point would Fine programming computer science
I write program logically therefore I need physic thinking style
True
But going get solution
Before program something know programming
You come solution first
The thinking style practiced physic give idea solve difficult problem
Perhaps ca solve directly start making approximation problem figuring limitation finding work
That type thing get done physic class
At point I would encourage pick copy Design Unix Operating System Bach library thumb
Unix filled example type thinking
Perfect answer hard approximation made get efficient reasonably functioning system
File system design memory manager scheduler embodies type thinking
Physics course give opportunity learn practice skill
get wrong take long time cultivate skill got ta start somewhere practice naturally solving whatever problem looking
The general point I trying get across taking physic course computer science student may seem silly
As developer chance draw force diagram create Gaussian pill box compute electric field solve wave equation ever care harmonic oscillator
However style problem solving obtaining solution help greatly
I know frosh physic course brutal
A large part difficulty derives trying apply hard fast memorization rather trying reason way problem
At level course much developing problem solving skill solution
Hopefully professor emphasizes thinking part
Good luck

Keller You might uncertain computer science CS use every day
When use Google smartphone watch movie special effect lot CS
When order product Internet CS web site cryptography used keep credit card number secure way FedEx route delivery vehicle get order quickly possible
Nonetheless even computer scientist struggle answer question What CS Many science try understand thing work physic try understand physical world chemistry try understand composition matter biology try understand life
So computer science trying understand
Computers
Probably computer designed built human inner working known least people
Perhaps programming
Programming indeed important computer scientist grammar important writer telescope important astronomer
But nobody would argue writing grammar astronomy telescope
Similarly programming important piece computer science CS
If turn origin computer science root disparate field include engineering mathematics cognitive science among others
Some computer scientist design thing much like engineer
Others seek new way solve computational problem analyze solution prove correct much like mathematician
Still others think human interact computer software closely related cognitive science psychology
All piece part computer science
One theme unifies nearly computer scientist interested ranging rtificial intelligence oogenesis
Put another way computer scientist interested finding solution wide variety computational problem
They analyze solution determine goodness implement good solution create useful software people work
This diversity endeavor part make CS much fun
There several important concept heart computer science chosen emphasize six data problem solving algorithm programming abstraction creativity
When Google word pie recipe Google report find approximately million page ranked order estimated relevance usefulness
Facebook approximately billion active user generate billion comment Likes day
GenBank national database DNA sequence used biologist medical researcher studying genetic disease million genetic sequence billion DNA base pair
According International Data Corporation size Digital Universe reached zettabyte
How much
Jeffrey Heer computer scientist specializes managing visualizing large amount data put way A stack DVDs reached moon back would store approximately zettabyte data
Without computer science data would junk
Searching recipe Google friend Facebook gene GenBank would impossible without idea tool computer science
Doing meaningful thing data challenging even dealing million billion thing
In book interesting thing smaller set data
But much applicable large amount data
When presented computational problem first objective find computational solution algorithm solve

The alien Google search pumpkin pie find following Assuming know perform basic cooking step measuring ingredient cracking egg stirring licking spoon etc
could make tasty pie following step precisely
Out respect gastronomical computer scientist rarely write recipe algorithm anything food
As computer scientist would likely write algorithm calculate precisely would write algorithm make pie
Let consider algorithm Take dart one time dart When thrown dart divide number landed inside circle total number n dart threw multiply
This give estimate
Figure show scenario
Figure Using dartboard approximate That description algorithm work
Here The area circle π case made radius board
The area square
Since assuming dart equally likely end anywhere square expect proportion land circle ratio area circle area square
Therefore throw n dart determine number k land inside circle approximately
So multiplying ratio give u approximation
Happily computer robotically throw physical dart instead simulate dart throwing process computer generating random coordinate describe dart land
The computer throw million virtual dart fraction second never miss thing considerably safer roommate
Although noted earlier computer science exclusively programming ultimately usually want implement algorithm operate data
Learning program bit like learning speak write new language
The good news programming vocabulary nearly complicated spoken language
In book program language called Python whose syntax particularly easy learn
But fooled thinking real programming real language used real programmer write real software
Moreover idea learn transferable learning language later
While data algorithm programming might seem like whole story truth important idea behind scene
Software often immensely complex difficult even impossible single person keep interacting piece mind
To deal complex system computer scientist use notion idea designing one part program ignore inessential detail part program long high level understanding
For example car engine drivetrain electrical system component
These component designed individually assembled work together
The designer drivetrain need understand every aspect engine work enough know drivetrain engine connected
To drivetrain designer engine In fact engine divided component engine block distributor others
These part viewed abstract entity interact one another
When designing engine block need think every detail distributor work
Software system even complicated car
Designing software requires think abstraction order ensure many people contribute project without everyone needing understand everything order test software methodically order able update future simply replacing one component new improved component
Abstraction therefore key idea design large system software particular
This book strives prepare write program interesting thing data
In process hope convey computer science enormously creative endeavor requires innovative exploration even experimentation
Often time one way solve problem
In case even clear best way solve problem
Different solution different merit
While Google Facebook GenBank wonderfully easy use many challenge continue design continual updating system
These challenge often lead group computer scientist working together find different solution evaluate relative merit
While challenge confront book modest scope hope share sense problem solving creativity heart computer science

Auden The best way get feel computer science jump right start solving computer science problem
So let
In section examine solution important problem How make sure never least room
To solve problem use simple programming language named Picobot control robot loosely based Roomba vacuum cleaner robot
You probably wondering happened Python programming language said would using throughout book
Why sweeping Python carpet brushing aside language plan use remainder book
The answer although Python simple powerful
programming language easy learn Picobot language learn
The entire language take minute learn yet allows powerful interesting computation
So able start serious computer science get sucked discussion programming language
This new whether programmed offer Eureka experience
So dust browser join u
It humblest turned killer app household robot
Imagine Roomba vacuum named Picobot goal suck debris free space around ideally without missing nook cranny
The robotics community call task ensuring grass mown surface receives paint Martian soil surveyed
At first problem might seem pretty easy
After parent gave vacuum cleaner told vacuum room without missing spot probably pretty great job without even thinking much
Shouldn straightforward convey strategy robot
Unfortunately couple obstacle make Picobot job considerably difficult
First Picobot limited sight sense directly around
Second Picobot totally unfamiliar environment supposed clean
While could probably walk around room blindfolded without crashing thing Picobot lucky
Third Picobot limited memory
In fact even remember part room seen part
While challenge make Picobot job job programming Picobot difficult also make coverage problem interesting computer science problem worth serious study
Our first task solving problem represent way computer handle
In word need define data working solve problem
For example represent obstacle room
Where Picobot
We could represent room plane list coordinate object corner coordinate Picobot location
While representation reasonable actually use slightly simpler approach
Whether lawn sand environment simpler cover discretized cell shown Figure
This first example abstraction ignoring detail environment simplifying something easily work
You Picobot similarly simplified occupy one grid square green one travel one step time one four compass direction north east west south
Picobot travel onto obstacle blue also wall mentioned know position obstacle ahead time
What Picobot sense immediate surroundings four cell directly north east west south
The surroundings always reported string four letter order meaning first see neighboring cell orth next ast est finally outh
If cell north empty letter first position
If cell north occupied letter first position The second letter indicates whether eastern neighbor empty occupied third west fourth south
At position corner Figure example Picobot sensor would report surroundings
There sixteen possible surroundings Picobot shown Figure textual representation
Figure There four type cell Picobot environment map green Picobot blue cell wall gray cell free space
Picobot sense whether empty cell visited dark light gray sense whether four immediate neighbor free space obstacle
Figure There sixteen possible surroundings string Picobot
The one Picobot completely enclosed occur simulator
As seen Picobot sense immediate surroundings
This important process
For example Picobot process moving north sens cell north wall try continue moving north
In fact simulator allow
But Picobot know whether moving north direction
Picobot innate sense direction
Instead make use powerful concept called
The state computer person almost thing simply current condition happy sad underwater outer space etc
In computer science often use state refer internal information describes computer
Picobot state extremely simple single number range
Somewhat surprisingly enough give Picobot pretty complex behavior
Although Picobot state numeric helpful think English term
For example might think state meaning I heading north I go However important note none state number special meaning u make decision
Moreover Picobot actually sense direction pointing
But define conception direction Picobot pointing defining appropriate set state
For example imagine Picobot want perform task continually moving north get wall
We might decide state mean I heading north I go I get wall north I consider next
When Picobot get wall might want enter new state I heading west I go I get wall west I think
We might choose call state state entirely u
Figure The five part two Picobot rule
One useful way interpret idea state attribute distinct intention state
With two rule Picobot initial state state represents go west far As see next job Picobot programmer define state meaning control Picobot make interesting thing
Now know represent Picobot surroundings represent state
But make Picobot anything
Picobot move following set rule specify action possibly state change
Which rule Picobot chooses follow depends current state current surroundings
Thus Picobot complete thought process follows Picobot us rule express thought process
Figure show two example rule
The first rule English say If I state western neighbor contains obstacle take one step east change state The second rule say If I state obstacle around move one step west stay state Taken together two rule use local information direct Picobot across open area westward boundary
Figure The result running Picobot section four rule
At step Picobot examines list rule written looking rule applies
A rule applies state part rule match Picobot current state surroundings part rule match current surroundings
What happens NO rule match Picobot current state surroundings
The Picobot simulator let know box robot stop running
Similarly one rule applies Picobot also complain
Figure show Picobot follows first rule match current state surroundings time step
But state
No rule specify Picobot action state
Just state represents go west task specify two rule make state go east task These rule transition back state creating infinite loop back forth across open row
Try
Note Picobot website start Picobot randomly selected empty cell
Note also Picobot start along top bottom wall rule match move
We remedy defect next section
Table Two equivalent formulation general behavior Picobot
Both set rule use two state wildcard character allows much succinct representation left right
By way sometimes might want Picobot move result applying rule
Rather specifying move direction E W N S may use letter X indicate stay
For example rule saying I state wall north move enter state The problem previous example rule specific
When going west really care whether wall present north south east
Similarly going east care neighboring cell north south west
The wildcard character indicates care surroundings given position N E W S
Table rule use wildcard direct Picobot forever visit vacuum row start
So far looked write rule make Picobot move
But trying solve problem Picobot usually helpful take global view Picobot accomplishing task translate approach rule
In word want develop algorithm allows Picobot accomplish desired task task usually cover entire room
In previous section Picobot modest goal simply moving back forth empty room
The algorithm accomplishing task following Now question becomes translate algorithm rule previous section As written difficult see connection step algorithm Picobot rule
We see Picobot need two state keep track direction moving step step still exactly clear algorithm translates precise rule
Essentially Picobot rule applies fashion
In word Picobot particular state see particular environment take certain action potentially enters new state
With minor modification rewrite algorithm follow Picobot rule structure directly Repeat following step forever Now see clearly direct translation step algorithm Picobot rule step algorithm translates directly rule Picobot state represents Picobot movingWest state represents Picobot moving East
Formulating algorithm way key writing successful program Picobot
Table rule direct Picobot visit entirety starting row
This section challenge develop set rule direct Picobot cover entirety empty rectangular room room Figure
The set work regardless big room regardless Picobot initially begin
Because Picobot distinguish unvisited cell may know visited every cell
The online simulator however detect report successful complete traversal environment
Try
You might find helpful simply play around modifying rule given
For example might start altering rule Figure neighboring row clearing current one
However idea might solve problem encourage plan algorithm express algorithm way easily translatable Picobot rule
Once developed Picobot program completely traverse empty room try write program complex environment
You see MAP option Picobot Web page scroll forward backward collection map created
You also edit map clicking cell mouse clicking empty cell turn wall clicking wall turn empty cell
Figure Picobot maze
One environment particularly interesting maze shown Figure
Notice maze wall connected outer boundary empty cell adjacent wall
A smaller maze property shown Figure
Any maze property completely explored simple algorithm called prefer
Imagine moment maze rather Picobot
In contrast Picobot clear sense direction pointing two hand
You start facing north right hand touching wall
Now visit every empty cell simply walking maze making sure right hand always touching wall
Pause moment convince true
Notice also algorithm visit every cell wall connected outer boundary shown maze Figure b empty cell adjacent wall shown Figure c
Figure A maze wall connected outer boundary empty cell adjacent wall
b A maze wall connected outer boundary
c A maze empty cell adjacent wall
Converting rule set Picobot rule interesting computational challenge
After sense direction right hand guiding around wall whereas Picobot neither hand sense orientation
To teach Picobot rule need use state represent direction Picobot pointing
It may seem impossibly large number situation must considered fact number situation finite actually quite small make possible program Picobot task
To get started seems pretty natural use four state represent Picobot pointing north south east west
Now need introduce rule allow Picobot behave right hand touch wall
Assume state arbitrarily choose correspond representing Picobot pointing north
Picobot imaginary right hand pointing east
If wall east none north rule would tell u take step north keep pointing north
Taking step north problem
Keep pointing north mean stay state On hand state wall east Picobot take step east think pointing east
Pointing east mean changing another state intended encode information
This fun challenge encourage stop try
Remember program work regardless Picobot start maze property wall connected outer boundary empty cell adjacent wall
Is possible write Picobot program fully explore room give
Surprisingly answer possible prove fact mathematically
Picobot computational capability enough guarantee coverage environment
However adding one simple feature Picobot programmed fully explore room
That feature ability drop sense pick marker along way
The fact computational challenge elementary Picobot lead u suggests computation computer far omnipotent
And time done reading book learned prove certain problem beyond limit computer solve
Enter search term module class function name

The people answering question mostly consists either instructor bootcamps people attended bootcamps
However I intend answer question employer point view
I former CTO FiscalNote AI company deal government analytics When I looking hire new engineer I looking someone least equivalent computer science degree
coding bootcamp count CS degree
Here reason I WOULD NOT consider bootcamp developer I trying bash bootcamp developer anyway I stating may best hire heavy company
I encourage people switch technical field I want people technical career
But point view spending lot money take easy route I say easy get skip horrible algorithm class college dev bootcamp good
You miss important part CS
Yes go bootcamp learn practical right away
But different learning MS Excel understanding programming algorithm behind
What I recommend maybe sit couple CS class university near university allow sit in take couple free online class Stanford etc
I really think spend hard earned money dev bootcamp
As employer I would choose hire someone computer science degree rather bootcamp certificate
I informal poll recruiter I worked recently current former company generalizing said If want work software company minority job IMO desirable one better getting computer science related degree

higher searching overseas work
A lesser alternative get bootcamp degree get basic skill use get lower tier software engineering job put year look higher tier employer

method solution problem depends solution smaller instance problem opposed
The approach applied many type problem one central idea computer science
The power recursion evidently lie possibility defining infinite set object finite statement
In manner infinite number computation described finite recursive program even program contains explicit repetition
Most computer programming language support recursion allowing call within program text
Some define looping construct rely solely recursion repeatedly call code
prof language computationally powerful Turing complete imperative language meaning solve kind problem imperative language even without iterative control structure
A common tactic divide problem type original solve combine result
This often referred combined store result solving avoid solving repeatedly incurring extra computation time referred
A recursive function definition one meaning input function produce result without recurring one meaning input program recurs call
For example function defined recursively equation
Neither equation constitutes complete definition first base case second recursive case
Because base case break chain recursion sometimes also called terminating case
The job recursive case seen breaking complex input simpler one
In properly designed recursive function recursive call input problem must simplified way eventually base case must reached
Functions intended terminate normal example exception
Neglecting write base case testing incorrectly cause
For function one computes obvious base case implied input data one may add number term added series example provide criterion establishes base case
Such example naturally treated successive term output partial sum converted recursion using indexing parameter say compute th term th partial sum
Many must process generate arbitrarily large quantity
Recursion one technique representing data whose exact size know programmer specify data definition
There two type definition inductive definition
An inductively defined recursive data definition one specifies construct instance data
For example defined inductively using syntax The code specifies list string either empty structure contains string list string
The definition permit construction list finite number string
Another example inductive positive Similarly recursive often used model structure programming language
Language designer often express grammar syntax grammar simple language arithmetic expression multiplication addition This say expression either number product two expression sum two expression
By recursively referring expression second third line grammar permit arbitrarily complex arithmetic expression one product sum operation single expression
A coinductive data definition one specifies operation may performed piece data typically coinductive definition used data structure infinite size
A coinductive definition infinite string given informally might look like This similar inductive definition list string difference definition specifies access content data via function content may whereas inductive definition specifies create structure may created
related coinduction used compute particular instance possibly infinite object
As programming technique used often context programming language preferable recursion desired size precision program output unknown
In case program requires definition infinitely large infinitely precise result mechanism taking finite portion result
The problem computing first n one solved corecursive program

Recursion contains single known recursion contains multiple known
Standard example single recursion include list traversal linear search computing factorial function standard example multiple recursion include search
Single recursion often much efficient multiple recursion generally replaced iterative computation running linear time requiring constant space
Multiple recursion contrast may require exponential time space fundamentally recursive able replaced iteration without explicit stack
Multiple recursion sometimes converted single recursion desired thence iteration
For example computing Fibonacci sequence naively multiple iteration value requires two previous value computed single recursion passing two successive value parameter
This naturally framed corecursion building initial value tracking step two successive value see
A sophisticated example using allows iterative tree traversal rather multiple recursion
Most basic example recursion example presented demonstrate function call
recursion occurs function called another function called either directly indirectly
For example call direct recursion call call indirect recursion Chains three function possible example function call function function call function function call function
Indirect recursion also called symmetric term though simply difference emphasis different notion
That call call turn call point view alone indirectly recursing point view alone indirectly recursing point view mutually recursing
Similarly set three function call called set mutually recursive function
Recursion usually done explicitly calling function name
However recursion also done via implicitly calling function based current context particularly useful known
Some author classify recursion either structural generative
The distinction related recursive procedure get data work process data Functions consume structured data typically decompose argument immediate structural component process component
If one immediate component belongs class data input function recursive
For reason refer function STRUCTURALLY RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
Thus defining characteristic structurally recursive function argument recursive call content field original input
Structural recursion includes nearly tree traversal including XML processing binary tree creation search etc
By considering algebraic structure natural number natural number either zero successor natural number function factorial may also regarded structural recursion
alternative Many recursive algorithm generate entirely new piece data given data recur
refers kind generative recursion
Examples generative recursion include
This distinction important function
A classic example recursive procedure function used calculate The function also written This evaluation recurrence relation demonstrates computation would performed evaluating pseudocode This factorial function also described without using recursion making use typical looping construct found imperative programming language The imperative code equivalent mathematical definition using accumulator variable The definition translates straightforwardly example iteration implemented recursively
The computes two integer written recursively
Function definition greatest common divisor express The recursive program equivalent iterative algorithm computation shown show step evaluation would performed language eliminates tail call
Below version algorithm using explicit iteration suitable language eliminate tail call
By maintaining state entirely variable using looping construct program avoids making recursive call growing call stack
The iterative algorithm requires temporary variable even given knowledge Euclidean algorithm difficult understand process simple inspection although two algorithm similar step
The Towers Hanoi mathematical puzzle whose solution illustrates recursion
There three peg hold stack disk different diameter
A larger disk may never stacked top smaller
Starting disk one peg must moved another peg one time
What smallest number step move stack
Example implementation Although recursive function explicit solution Tower Hanoi sequence reduced explicit formula
The algorithm method searching single element cutting array half recursive pas
The trick pick midpoint near center array compare data point data searched responding one three possible condition data found midpoint data midpoint greater data searched data midpoint le data searched
Recursion used algorithm pas new array created cutting old one half
The binary search procedure called recursively time new smaller array
Typically array size adjusted manipulating beginning ending index
The algorithm exhibit logarithmic order growth essentially divide problem domain half pas
Example implementation binary search C An important application recursion computer science defining dynamic data structure
Recursive data structure dynamically grow theoretically infinite size response runtime requirement contrast size static array must set compile time
Recursive algorithm particularly appropriate underlying problem data treated defined recursive term
The example section illustrate known structural recursion
This term refers fact recursive procedure acting data defined recursively
As long programmer derives template data definition function employ structural recursion
That recursion function body consume immediate piece given compound value
Below C definition linked list node structure
Notice especially node defined term
The next element pointer another effectively creating list type
Because data structure defined recursively procedure operate implemented naturally recursive procedure
The procedure defined walk list list empty list pointer value NULL
For node print data element integer
In C implementation list remains unchanged procedure
Below simple definition binary tree node
Like node linked list defined term recursively
There two pointer left pointing left right pointing right
Operations tree implemented using recursion
Note two pointer left right tree operation may require two recursive call At two recursive call made given call defined
The example illustrates binary tree
A special case binary tree data element node order
Since number file may vary practical way traverse thus enumerate content
Traversing filesystem similar therefore concept behind tree traversal applicable traversing filesystem
More specifically code would example filesystem
This code blend line least somewhat recursion
It essentially recursive implementation best way traverse
It also example direct indirect recursion
The method rtraverse purely direct example method traverse indirect call rtraverse
This example need base case scenario due fact always fixed number file directory given filesystem
In actual implementation rather pure recursive function single check base case otherwise recursive step number modification may made purpose clarity efficiency
These include On basis elegance wrapper function generally approved base case frowned upon particularly academia
Hybrid algorithm often used efficiency reduce overhead recursion small case recursion special case
A function directly called recurse instead calling separate auxiliary function actually recursion
Wrapper function used validate parameter recursive function skip perform initialization allocate memory initialize variable particularly auxiliary variable level recursion partial computation handle exception error
In language support auxiliary function nested inside wrapper function use shared scope
In absence nested function auxiliary function instead separate function possible private called directly information shared wrapper function using
base case also known consists checking base case making recursive call checking next call base case instead calling checking base case
particularly done efficiency reason avoid overhead function call immediately return
Note since base case already checked immediately recursive step need checked separately one need use wrapper function case overall recursion start base case
For example factorial function properly base case
immediately returning
may miss mitigated wrapper function
primarily concern many base case encountered Null pointer tree linear number function call hence significant saving algorithm illustrated search
tree corresponds considering leaf node child base case rather considering empty node base case
If single base case computing factorial provides saving
Conceptually considered either base case recursive step checking base case recursion considered different base case one step removed standard base case complex recursive step namely check valid recurse considering leaf node rather Null node base case tree
Because complicated flow compared clear separation base case recursive step standard recursion often considered poor style particularly academia
A basic example given DFS binary tree see section standard recursive discussion
The standard recursive algorithm DFS In instead In term standard step move base case check recursive step
Alternatively considered different form base case recursive step respectively
Note requires wrapper function handle case tree empty root node Null
In case height node Null pointer child leaf cut number function call half worst case
In C standard recursive algorithm may implemented The algorithm may implemented Note use Boolean AND operator recursive call made node valid
Note first term AND pointer node second term bool overall expression evaluates bool
This common idiom recursive
This addition evaluation Boolean OR operator check right child left child fails
In fact entire function replaced single Boolean expression return statement legibility suffers benefit efficiency
Recursive algorithm often inefficient small data due overhead repeated function call return
For reason efficient implementation recursive algorithm often start recursive algorithm switch different algorithm input becomes small
An important example often implemented switching data sufficiently small
Hybrid recursive algorithm often refined derived hybrid merge sort
Recursion iteration equally expressive recursion replaced iteration explicit stack iteration replaced tail recursion
Which approach preferable depends problem consideration language used
In iteration preferred particularly simple recursion avoids overhead function call call stack management recursion generally used multiple recursion
By contrast recursion preferred tail recursion optimization leading little overhead sometimes explicit iteration available
Compare template compute x defined x f n x x For imperative language overhead define function functional language overhead define accumulator variable x
For example factorial function may implemented iteratively C assigning loop index variable accumulator variable rather passing argument returning value recursion Most use today allow direct specification recursive function procedure
When function called program keep track various instance function often using although method may used
Every recursive function transformed iterative function replacing recursive call simulating call stack explicitly managed program
Conversely iterative function procedure evaluated computer see expressed term recursive function iterative control construct routinely rewritten recursive form
However practice rewriting depends feature language
notable mainstream language function call including may cause stack allocation would occur use looping construct language working iterative program rewritten recursive form may although tail call elimination may feature covered language specification different implementation language may differ tail call elimination capability
In language favor iterative looping construct usually significant time space cost associated recursive program due overhead required manage stack relative slowness function call function call particularly typically fast operation difference usually le noticeable
As concrete example difference performance recursive iterative implementation factorial example depends highly compiler used
In language looping construct preferred iterative version may much several order magnitude faster recursive one
In functional language overall time difference two implementation may negligible fact cost multiplying larger number first rather smaller number iterative version given happens may overwhelm time saved choosing iteration
In programming language maximum size much le space available recursive algorithm tend require stack space iterative algorithm
Consequently language sometimes place limit depth recursion avoid stack overflow one language
Note caveat regarding special case
Multiply recursive problem inherently recursive prior state need track
One example contrast list traversal linear search list singly recursive thus naturally iterative
Other example include function
All algorithm implemented iteratively help explicit programmer effort involved managing stack complexity resulting program arguably outweigh advantage iterative solution
function function recursive call hence build deferred operation
For example gcd function shown
In contrast factorial function also recursive call tail position build deferred multiplication operation must performed final recursive call completes
With treat call rather function call function gcd execute using constant space
Thus program essentially iterative equivalent using imperative language control structure like loop
The significance tail recursion making call tail call caller return position need saved recursive call return branch directly previously saved return position
Therefore language recognize property tail call tail recursion save space time
In simple case function calling instruction placed recursive call executed per recursion instruction placed recursive call
The latter executed repeatedly maximum recursion reached
Consider example The recursive algorithm expressed
They usually simplified single term
If function form Then thus represents number recursive call level recursion represents factor smaller input next level recursion
number piece divide problem represents work function independent recursion
partitioning recombining level recursion

In practice collecting requirement system user customer stakeholder
The practice also sometimes referred
The term elicitation used book research raise fact good requirement collected customer would indicated name requirement gathering
Requirements elicitation never sure get requirement user customer asking system OR NOT Safety Reliability
Requirements elicitation practice include interview questionnaire user observation workshop role playing
Before requirement analyzed modeled specified must gathered elicitation process
Requirements elicitation part requirement engineering process usually followed analysis specification requirement
Commonly used elicitation process stakeholder meeting interview
For example important first meeting could software engineer customer discus perspective requirement
The requirement elicitation process may appear simple ask customer user others objective system product accomplished system product fit need business finally system product used basis
However issue may arise complicate process
In Christel Kang identified problem indicate challenge requirement elicitation Requirements quality improved approach In Sommerville Sawyer suggested set guideline requirement elicitation address concern identified Christel Kang In Goldsmith suggested problem pyramid six step must performed sequence However Goldsmith note identifying real problem exceedingly difficult
In Alexander proposed set complementary approach discovering requirement Alexander suggested approach could conducted individual group focused meeting known workshop via thing artifact
In Miller proposed battery question elicit requirement
Her approach build stakeholder profile interview stakeholder extensively
The question grouped three section focused user need In suggested usage Ancillary Functionality Requirements instead Requirements connotes never functional
Second requirement fact fulfill requirement supportive main Core Functionality Requirements

The appropriate requirement elicitation approach use artifact driven
There various reason choosing approach
First background study existing online insurance system
The background study help establish merit demerit system therefore establish add remove
Secondly approach us knowledge acquisition method card sort whereby stakeholder able organize idea story board help describing interaction prototype
It illustrates stakeholder main feature system revamp
The prototype assist getting early feedback
The card sorting knowledge acquisition approach cost effective reliable Brown University Tutors California Institute Technology Tutors Carnegie Mellon University Tutors Columbia University Tutors Dartmouth University Tutors Emory University Tutors Harvard University Tutors Massachusetts Institute Technology Tutors New York University Tutors Notre Dam University Tutors Oklahoma University Tutors Pennsylvania State University Tutors Princeton University Tutors Stanford University Tutors University California Tutors Oxford University Tutors Yale University Tutors Enter email address associated account email link reset password

The Computing paradigm aim support maximal reuse web service according requirement
This target becomes even viable cloud computing platform
At present requirement often represented certain existing standard interoperable service description language WSDL
However general service requestors may find language hard use directly service requirement often partially understood elicited
This chapter formulates requirement analysis automated feedback control process classical philosophy replaced continuous learning negotiation adaptation process
Conventional requirement analysis collaborative process carried requirement analyst stakeholder
The requirement analyst usually drive activity including elicitation analysis prioritization addressing question What information shall collected stakeholder
In order question asked
How settle comprehensive list functional requirement
How settle comprehensive list desired quality service
How minimize number question asked ensuring adequate information elicited stakeholder
How adjust elicitation process according answer obtained earlier question
The research discipline Requirements Engineering RE accumulated body knowledge guide analyst going requirement elicitation process
Of course intuition experience also play vital role
During recent year Architecture SOA paradigm Papazoglou et al
recognized novel way structure complex service demand timely
Among advantage SOA adapt change rapidly provide effective application integration
It worth mentioning matter neatly SOA defined relationship service responsibility one service built run somewhere
Cloud Computing embrace various technique networking virtualization software service SaaS Web web infrastructure distributed computing also Services Computing
Cloud Computing platform provide large scalable computing resource Internet user Peng et al

Cloud Computing drawn attention research well industry community
There basic technique Cloud Computing example Bigtable Chandra et al
Google File System GFS Ghemawat et al MapReduce Dean et al

There Clouding Computing infrastructure Xen Cloud Platform XCP Nimbus OpenNebula Sotomayor et al
Eucalyptus
Any earlier enterprise software architecture prior cloud computing lead capacity problem chaotic situation
The estimation capacity business application challenging estimating capacity requirement SOA service especially large quantity service even challenging
Thus cloud computing SOA come together
Services defined within SOA best deployed within cloud gain advantage software Marks Lozano
On hand cloud application best defined term service
The two inseparable

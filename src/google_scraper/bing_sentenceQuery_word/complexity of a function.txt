In measure estimate time taken running
Time complexity commonly estimated counting number elementary operation performed algorithm supposing elementary operation take fixed amount time perform
Thus amount time taken number elementary operation performed algorithm differ
Since algorithm running time may vary different input size one commonly considers maximum amount time taken input given size
Less common usually specified explicitly average time taken input given size make sense finite number possible input given size
In case time complexity generally expressed size input
Since function generally difficult compute exactly running time usually critical small input one focus commonly behavior complexity input size increase complexity
Therefore time complexity commonly expressed using typically input size measured number needed representing
Algorithm complexity classified function appearing big O notation
For example algorithm time complexity algorithm time complexity constant
The following table summarizes class commonly encountered time complexity
In table poly polynomial
An algorithm said also written time value bounded value depend size input
For example accessing single element take constant time one performed locate
In similar manner finding minimal value array sorted ascending order first element
However finding minimal value unordered array constant time operation scanning array needed order determine minimal value
Hence linear time operation taking O n time
If number element known advance change however algorithm still said run constant time
Despite name constant time running time independent problem size upper bound running time bounded independently problem size
For example task exchange value necessary called constant time even though time may depend whether already true
However constant time required always
Here example code fragment run constant time If O equivalent stated standard notation O
An algorithm said take
Due use computer frequently base log sometimes written lg
However logarithm log log differ constant multiplier notation discarded thus O log standard notation logarithmic time algorithm regardless base logarithm
Algorithms taking logarithmic time commonly found operation using
An O log n algorithm considered highly efficient ratio number operation size input decrease tends zero increase
An algorithm must access element input take logarithmic time time taken reading input size order
An example logarithmic time given dictionary search
Let u consider contains entry sorted
We suppose one may access th entry dictionary constant time
Let denotes th entry
Under hypothesis test word dictionary may done logarithmic time consider denotes
If done
Else continue search way left half dictionary otherwise continue similarly half part dictionary
This algorithm similar method often used find entry paper dictionary
An algorithm said run O log constant
For example solved polylogarithmic time
An algorithm said run often spelled
In particular includes algorithm time complexity defined well others O algorithm
Typical algorithm exact yet run time use NC matrix determinant calculation Grover search alternatively guaranteed assumption input structure logarithmic time many tree maintenance algorithm
However set string position indicated first log n bit string may depend every bit input yet computable time
The specific term usually reserved algorithm unlike run classical serial machine model allowed prior assumption input
They however allowed indeed must randomized trivial task
As algorithm must provide answer without reading entire input particular heavily depend access allowed input
Usually input represented binary string assumed algorithm time O request obtain value
time algorithm typically randomized provide solution
In fact property binary string zero one easily proved decidable time algorithm
time algorithm arise naturally investigation
An algorithm said take time time complexity O
Informally mean large enough input size running time increase linearly size input
For example procedure add element list requires time proportional length list
This description slightly inaccurate since running time significantly deviate precise proportionality especially small value
Linear time best possible time complexity situation algorithm sequentially read entire input
Therefore much research invested discovering algorithm exhibiting linear time least nearly linear time
This research includes software hardware method
There several hardware technology exploit provide
An example
This concept linear time used string matching algorithm
An algorithm said run quasilinear time also referred time positive constant linearithmic time case
Using algorithm Õ
Quasilinear time algorithm also O every constant ε thus run faster polynomial time algorithm whose time bound includes term
Algorithms run quasilinear time include In many case log running time simply result performing Θ log operation time
For example creates inserting element array one one
Since insert operation take log time entire algorithm take log time
require least log number comparison worst case log
Θ log
They also frequently arise
An said
For example simple quadratic

The algorithm run strongly polynomial time Any algorithm two property converted polynomial time algorithm replacing arithmetic operation suitable algorithm performing arithmetic operation
If second requirement met true anymore
Given integer take space proportional n Turing machine model possible compute n multiplication using
However space used represent proportional thus exponential rather polynomial space used represent input
Hence possible carry computation polynomial time Turing machine possible compute polynomially many arithmetic operation
Conversely algorithm run number Turing machine step bounded polynomial length input take number arithmetic operation bounded polynomial number input number
The computing two integer one example
Given two integer running time algorithm bounded number Turing machine step polynomial size binary representation
At time number arithmetic operation bounded number integer input constant case always two integer input
Due latter observation algorithm run strongly polynomial time
Its real running time depends magnitude number integer input
An algorithm run polynomial time strongly polynomial said run
A example problem weakly algorithm known known admit strongly algorithm
Weakly confused
The concept polynomial time lead several complexity class computational complexity theory
Some important class defined using polynomial time following
P smallest class deterministic machine term machine model change
For example change Turing machine machine lead quadratic speedup algorithm run polynomial time one model also
Any given complexity class corresponding problem solved polynomial time machine
An algorithm said take bounded polynomial
It ω time constant input parameter typically number bit input
For example algorithm run step input size requires superpolynomial time specifically exponential time
An algorithm us exponential resource clearly superpolynomial algorithm weakly superpolynomial
For example run time input grows faster polynomial large enough input size must become impractically large dominated polynomial small degree
An algorithm requires superpolynomial time lie outside
posit algorithm impractical many case
Since unresolved algorithm problem currently known run polynomial time
algorithm algorithm run slower polynomial time yet slow exponential time
The worst case running time time algorithm fixed
If constant c definition time algorithm equal get polynomial time algorithm le get time algorithm
time algorithm typically arise problem another problem
For example one take instance NP hard problem say convert instance another problem B size instance becomes
In case reduction prove problem B reduction show polynomial time algorithm B unless time algorithm thus
Similarly problem know time algorithm polynomial time algorithm known
Such problem arise approximation algorithm famous example directed time approximation algorithm achieving approximation factor n number vertex showing existence polynomial time algorithm open problem
Other computational problem time solution known polynomial time solution include problem goal union clique
Although solvable conjectured planted clique problem polynomial time solution planted clique conjecture used prove difficulty several problem computational
The complexity class consists problem time algorithm

On hand many graph problem represented natural way adjacency matrix solvable subexponential time simply size input square number vertex
This conjecture problem known
Since conjectured problem time algorithm inapproximability result field make assumption problem time algorithm
For example see known inapproximability result problem
The term used express running time algorithm may grow faster polynomial still significantly smaller exponential
In sense problem time algorithm somewhat tractable exponential algorithm
The precise definition generally agreed upon list two widely used one
A problem said time solvable solved running time whose logarithm grow smaller given polynomial
More precisely problem time every ε exists algorithm solves problem time O
The set problem complexity class defined term follows
Note notion term ε sense ε part input ε may algorithm problem
Some author define time running time
This definition allows larger running time first definition time
An example time algorithm classical algorithm integer factorization run time length input
Another example algorithm run time
Note make difference whether algorithm allowed size instance number vertex number edge

When k incremented two additional time
When x k incremented x additional time
Let u assume n

Although time space complexity resource viewed computational resource
Complexity measure generally defined
Other complexity measure used complexity theory include
The complexity algorithm often expressed using

In particular although DTIME contained DTIME would interesting know inclusion strict
For time space requirement answer question given time space hierarchy theorem respectively

Thus pair complexity class one properly included
Having deduced proper set inclusion proceed make quantitative statement much additional time space needed order increase number problem solved
More precisely state The state The time space hierarchy theorem form basis separation result complexity class
For instance time hierarchy theorem tell u P strictly contained EXPTIME space hierarchy theorem tell u L strictly contained PSPACE
Many complexity class defined using concept reduction
A reduction transformation one problem another problem
It capture informal notion problem least difficult another problem
For instance problem solved using algorithm difficult say
There many different type reduction based method reduction Cook reduction Karp reduction Levin reduction bound complexity reduction
The commonly used reduction reduction
This mean reduction process take polynomial time
For example problem squaring integer reduced problem multiplying two integer
This mean algorithm multiplying two integer used square integer
Indeed done giving input input multiplication algorithm
Thus see squaring difficult multiplication since squaring reduced multiplication
This motivates concept problem hard complexity class
A problem class problem every problem reduced
Thus problem harder since algorithm allows u solve problem
Of course notion hard problem depends type reduction used
For complexity class larger P reduction commonly used
In particular set problem hard NP set problem
If problem hard said
This mean hardest problem
Since many problem could equally hard one might say one hardest problem
Thus class problem contains difficult problem NP sense one likely Because problem P NP solved able reduce known problem Π another problem Π would indicate known solution Π
This solution Π would yield solution Π
Similarly NP problem reduced set finding problem solved polynomial time would mean P NP
The complexity class P often seen mathematical abstraction modeling computational task admit efficient algorithm

Problems known intractable sense include
If NP P problem also intractable sense
However identification inexact solution large exponent large constant term grows quickly may impractical practical size problem conversely solution grows slowly may practical realistic input solution take long time worst case may take short time case average case thus still practical
Saying problem P imply large case problem hard even
For example decision problem shown P yet algorithm written solve problem reasonable time case
Similarly algorithm solve wide range size le quadratic time routinely handle large instance
To see algorithm generally unusable practice consider program make operation halting
For small say assuming sake example computer operation second program would run year order magnitude
Even much faster computer program would useful small instance sense intractability problem somewhat independent technological progress
However algorithm take operation practical get relatively large
Similarly polynomial time algorithm always practical
If running time say unreasonable consider efficient still useless except small instance
Indeed practice even algorithm often impractical realistic size problem

How calculate time complexity algorithm program need help How calculate time complexity algorithm program
The common metric calculating time complexity Big O notation
This remove constant factor running time estimated relation N N approach infinity
In general think n j actual running time code
Not positive probably theta n n
theta
The reason I say outer loop O n inner loop always one le whatever value ما هو معنى تقدير برنامج كمبيوتر I quite agree
Very strongly worded
Just understanding mean time complexity find using Omega Theta actual execution time program
Correct
The two related
Also method best two method How calculate time complexity algorithm program
The common metric calculating time complexity Big O notation
This remove constant factor running time estimated relation N N approach infinity
In general think like Is constant
The running time statement change relation Is linear
The running time loop directly proportional When N double running time
Is quadratic
The running time two loop proportional square When N double running time increase N Is logarithmic
The running time algorithm proportional number time N divided
This algorithm divide working area half iteration
Is N log N
The running time consists N loop iterative recursive logarithmic thus algorithm combination linear logarithmic
In general something every item one dimension linear something every item two dimension quadratic dividing working area half logarithmic
There Big O measure cubic exponential square root nearly common
Big O notation described O type type measure
The quicksort algorithm would described O N log N
Note none taken account best average worst case measure

Also note VERY simplistic explanation
Big O common also complex I shown
There also notation big omega little big theta
You probably wo encounter outside algorithm analysis course
Big Oh denotes fewer expression iteration
Big Omega denotes expression iteration
Big Theta denotes expression iteration
Little Oh denotes fewer expression iteration
Little Omega denotes expression iteration
Thanks lovely explanation Narue
I couple question though
I assume said complexity following code O N log N meant average case measure
If I calculate best worst would I
I tried best correct I wrong would list element best case scenario would O
I assume said complexity following code O N log N meant average case measure
Correct
Average best case complexity easier figure worst case
If I calculate best worst would I
To calculate best case simply assume perfect partition right middle time
This roughly halve data set time complexity O Nlog N like average case except tighter bound Big O correct use Big Theta correct
To calculate worst case assume worst possible partition would basically left rightmost item one half contains single element half contains everything else
It fairly easy see linear worst case time complexity O N
I tried best correct I wrong would list element best case scenario would O
You could say Big O notation assume number element
It measurement growth data set get larger
So O mean double number element time algorithm take
O N mean number element double time algorithm take process
Thanks narue
One question
I understood calculate O simple algorithm O depend upon size N well
I read online book somewhere O two value algorithm one N large another N small
Is correct
If I calculate value say n small n
I know complexity O large n small n
O notation remove constant left largest growth rate dominant N increase
Naturally N small constant dominant factor make sense keep equation rather removing N guaranteed small
I know complexity O large n small n
It still O n example totally dominates algorithm opposed n dominates
That I thought say different rather figure page say different
It got confused
rather figure page say different No say exactly thing
O notation upper bound tight bound
And without assuming size N constant irrelevant
But theta tight bound right
So theta equation vary
Sorry I new I think english
My english great one big reason I problem
If feel like reading post slowly carefully describe notation mean
All function kind behavior n grows towards infinity
For example f n n grows towards infinity f n get closer closer zero
Whereas f n n grows towards infinity f n grows
Functions grow different speed
If two function equal obviously grow speed
But wait
Two function deemed grow speed separated constant multiple
For example f n g n f g deemed grow pace g n n constant multiple apart
That g n f n n grows arbitrarily large
But consider scenario f n n n g n Then behavior f n g n n grows arbitrarily large
Well f n g n n n n
Which simplifies f n g n Which mean n grows large f n n g n
What mean
f g case separated constant multiple
The multiple f g grows larger larger time progress without stopping
We say f grows faster g happens
Or g grows slower f
Just try sample value n Try
First f g f g f g
We easily see hopefully ratio f g constant
Now consider scenario f n n n g n n In case function ratio f n g n n n n n
What value ratio n grows towards infinity
The answer
Let simplify expression n n n n n n n n n n n n
So f n g n n n
So n grows large term n n get arbitrarily rediculously small
As n grows large value n n get closer closer
We could plug value let try
f g f g f g
So ratio two function approach constant value n grows large
Hence f g said grow pace
In comparing growth rate function rule
If f n g n grows control getting larger larger n get larger f said grow faster
If f n g n settle towards constant positive value f said grow pace
If f n g n get closer closer zero mean reciprocal g n f n growing control g said grow faster Or f said grow slower Now big O notation
Big O notation actually refers entire function
The notation O represents entire set function grow slower pace
For example O represents entire set function grow slower pace
In word g n n since n grows slower follows g lie set O
Likewise h n n n since h grows pace follows h lie set O
It also true h lie set O h grows slower
Assuming leading term positive quadratic function always grow slower cubic polynomial always grow slower polynomial always grow slower polynomial
Because O represents function grow equal used represent upper bound
The notation refer different set function
For example represents function grow slower speed
f n n lie set O lie
g n n lie
Theta represents function grow rate
Omega represents function grow faster equal
In computer program course interested much time take program run form notation useful representing use
When say algorithm run O time saying algorithm runtime worse multiple
When use Theta saying algorithm runtime multiple
And Omega used say amount time algorithm take run grows rate larger equal expression rate growth
Disclaimer statement post strictly true mathematically speaking
One I noticed big notation us slightly different meaning grows slower grows speed grows faster one I gave
Wow I going copy keep
Thank much
Quick question since theta exact rate growth ca two value right
I understand question maybe rephrase
But maybe answer O set function grow slower rate
Omega set function grow faster rate
Theta consist function lie O Omega
Now one attempt target directly question seems saying Suppose calculated algorithm take f n operation f n n
Since polynomial grows rate could say function f lie set Theta
It also lie set O Omega reason
Here statement f lie Theta n
f lie Theta
These false function f grows faster n grows slower
However statement f lie Theta
This true function f grows pace
Here true statement f lie Theta
f lie Theta n
f lie Theta
f lie Theta
f lie Theta log n
In case function f grows pace inside expression
In one case equal
So answer question A function algorithm runtime depicted different theta expression
However theta expression
Remember Theta refers set function grow pace
Well Theta refers exactly set
If function grows pace also grows pace
Theta Theta n Theta Theta Theta log n Theta
If algorithm runtime theta bound write theta expression different way like mean thing
A function two theta bound
Different Theta Theta represent completely different set function
I would writing actual Greek character theta I knew type way writing word Theta normal
Sorry stupid question
I understood question second read earlier post thanks

tell look algorithm calculate time complexity Count total number fundamental operation algorithm performs relative value For example
The function set value ret
This one operation
Then function test condition loop exactly n time
It run body loop exactly n time
The body loop performs exactly fundamental operation ret n n
The condition one fundamental operation comparison
Calling function count fundamental operation
So total number fundamental operation n The sum composed operation calling function setting ret performing total n test condition loop total n operation body loop
This simplifies n fundamental operation O n
What I mean operation
Any operation take amount time bounded constant
Count total number fundamental operation algorithm performs relative value For example
The function set value ret
This one operation
Then function test condition loop exactly n time
It run body loop exactly n time
The body loop performs exactly fundamental operation ret n n
The condition one fundamental operation comparison
Calling function count fundamental operation
So total number fundamental operation n The sum composed operation calling function setting ret performing total n test condition loop total n operation body loop
This simplifies n fundamental operation O n
What I mean operation
Any operation take amount time bounded constant
Since O notation discard constant really little need include first place see dominant growth
Straight away see loop dominate relies length n nested loop time complexity O n
Not everyone math nerd like
Sure everybody solves problem sort explanation lack clarity make process sort magic voodoo
Besides really thing I explained calculating algorithm complexity via route O O n O O n substituting big O notation bit earlier
Besides really thing I explained Kinda sorta
You counting individual operation I looking loop deriving complexity guestimate many time loop iterates
sort explanation lack clarity I think add clarity removing complicated intermediate junk overwhelms many people
Accuracy always synonymous clarity
Take standard
It written accuracy mind language used emphasizes
But I know anyone would say immediately clear said
make process sort magic voodoo
Not really
It iteration count
Once simple ruleset give want
For example n nested n O
n n nested O n
log n nested n O n
Once someone know notation one mean intuitive
The right way experience confuses hell people
That say right way unnecessary
I think flip flopping order simple way learned first concept understood right way introduced thorough understanding
The way I explained simple way complete answer take one sentence
Count number fundamental operation take place much simpler le nerdy complicated description iteration count nested loop
I looking measure term either second millisecond runtime algorithm real data
program
What would best implementation
This would either C
However I looking example something similar along line one would get script execution time render time typical PHP program
You seen bottom forum PHP based web page seen calculation
Would one way implement
How would I implement without using many system dependent library
window rather either custom standard library
Any thought
At first I thought calling algorithm function say myTestFunction I would make system call request time function completed run returned original call position make system call simple subtraction somehow time would result
Of course I could dreaming I yet fully investigate would done
Any way

please tell u come conclusion average case
average case best case
somebody give example exponential time complexity
previous saw example everything except exponential one
Thanks good explanation
good job
So answer question A function algorithm runtime depicted different theta expression
However theta expression
Remember Theta refers set function grow pace
Well Theta refers exactly set
If function grows pace also grows pace
question theta
applied Oh Omega also
O notation remove constant left largest growth rate dominant N increase
Naturally N small constant dominant factor make sense keep equation rather removing N guaranteed small
I know complexity O large n small n
It still O n example totally dominates algorithm opposed n dominates

This first three post series
The second post talk
The third article talk
notation used really scary concept
I thought real programmer talked code
It scary academic description made little sense
This frustrating underlying concept actually hard
Simply put notation programmer talk algorithm
Algorithms another scary topic I cover another post purpose let say algorithm mean function program far
A function notation determined responds different input
How much slower give list thing work instead list thing
Consider code So call function like pretty quick
We loop thing list find first argument function return True
If get end find return False
The complexity function
I explain mean second let break mathematical syntax
read Order N function also known Order function
I think approximation deal order magnitude
Orders magnitude mathematical term basically tell difference class number
Think difference
If picture closest friend people really big difference
Similarly difference pretty big fact difference junker car lightly used one
It turn approximation long within order magnitude pretty close
If guess number gumballs machine within order magnitude said gumballs
gumballs would
A gumball machine whose number gumballs probably within order magnitude
Back dissecting say graph time take run function different sized input
array item item item etc see approximately corresponds number item array
This called linear graph
This mean line basically straight graph
Some may caught code sample item always first item list code would really fast
This true approximate performance something
The worst case code thing searching list
Note The math term upper bound mean talking mathematic limit awfulness
If wanted see graph function ignore function change variable
You type Wolfram Alpha plot x show diagonal line
The reason swap n x graphing program want variable name corresponds x axis
The getting bigger left right corresponds giving bigger bigger array function
The represents time higher line slower
Runtime characteristic O n function So example
Consider function This bit silly example bear
This function called called constant time
What mean matter big input always take amount time compute thing
If go back Wolfram see always stay matter far right go
If pas list million integer take time going pas list integer
Constant time considered best case scenario function
Runtime characteristic O function Consider function This match every item list every item list
If gave array get back
This part field mathematical field study combination thing
This function algorithm want sound fancy considered
This every item list aka input size operation
So
Below comparison graph reference
You see function get slow quickly something operates constant time much better
This particularly useful come data structure I post soon
Comparison O n v O n v O function This pretty high level overview notation hopefully get acquainted topic
There give depth view topic warned hop mathematic notation quickly
If anything make sense send
I also written
I thinking writing book topic
If something like see please express interest

Computational complexity theory subfield theoretical computer science one whose primary goal classify compare practical difficulty solving problem finite combinatorial object
given two natural number relatively prime

A famous conjecture often regarded fundamental theoretical computer science state P also properly contained NP
P NP
Demonstrating complexity class remain important open problem complexity theory
But even present state development subject connects many topic logic mathematics surrounding field manner bear nature scope knowledge subject
Reflection foundation complexity theory thus potential significance also well

The resource involved carrying algorithm decide instance problem typically measured term number processor cycle
elementary computational step amount memory space
storage auxiliary calculation required return solution
The method complexity theory useful deciding efficiently expend resource also helping u distinguish effectively decidable problem posse efficient decision method first place
In regard traditional distinguish class
solved practice efficient algorithm class
lack algorithm may thus regarded intrinsically difficult decide despite possibly decidable principle
The significance distinction readily appreciated considering additional example
A familiar example computational problem
deciding n PRIMES
This problem intensely studied mathematics long development digital computer
See history primality testing recent survey state art
After number preliminary result century problem PRIMES shown posse decision algorithm

This qualifies PRIMES feasibly decidable relative standard widely accepted complexity theory algorithmic analysis see
Two related problem used illustrate sort contrast difficulty complexity theorist seek analyze RELATIVE PRIMALITY Given natural number posse greatest common divisor


FACTORIZATION Given natural number exist
RELATIVE PRIMALITY solved applying Euclid greatest common divisor algorithm
input repeatedly compute remainder rem x rem rem return yes otherwise
It may shown number step sequence always le equal x
This mean order determine relatively prime suffices calculate number remainder proportional number digit decimal representation smaller two number
As may also accomplished efficient algorithm
long division may plausibly maintained capable pair number x
writing numerical representation binary decimal notation blackboard storing numeral memory digital computer current design either computer also able carry algorithm order decide whether relatively prime
This hallmark problem
one decided practice sense everyday concretely embodied computation
FACTORIZATION decision variant familiar problem finding given number
unique sequence prime exponent x
It difficult see existed efficient algorithm deciding FACTORIZATION would also exist efficient algorithm determining prime factorization
It also easy see function taking prime factorization effectively computable traditional sense computability theory
For instance computed
In simplest form trial division operates successively testing divisibility integer smaller keeping track divisor found thus far
As number division required procedure proportional might first seem particularly onerous task employ method factor number moderate size using paper pencil calculation say x
Note however conventionally denote natural number using binary decimal numeral
A consequence length expression typically supplied input numerical algorithm represent input x N proportional rather x b base notation system question
As consequence possible concretely inscribe positional numeral moderate length denote astronomically large number
For instance binary numeral digit denotes number larger estimated age universe second binary numeral digit denotes number larger estimated age universe Planck time
There thus natural number whose binary representation easily inscribe human mathematician foreseeable computing device carry trial division algorithm
This might seem particularly troubling algorithm indeed naive sense admits several obvious improvement
need test divisibility number x find initial factor need test prime finitely many stored lookup table
Nonetheless mathematician attempting find efficient method factorization several hundred year
The efficient factorization algorithm yet developed similar trial division algorithm requires number primitive step grows roughly proportion
size input opposed length binary representation
A consequence observation exist concretely inscribable number say order decimal digit following property currently unaware factorization ii highly unlikely could currently find even access whatever combination currently available computing equipment algorithm wish
Like problem introduced FACTORIZATION considerable practical importance perhaps famously security well known cryptographic protocol assume intractable general case see
But foregoing observation still entail fundamental limitation ability know number prime factorization
For might still hoped research yield efficient algorithm allow u determine prime factorization every number might take practical interest
A comparison Euclid algorithm trial division provides useful context describing property might expect algorithm posse
For note prior observation suggest ought measure size input x N numerical algorithm rather term length binary representation
If let df x denote quantity easy see efficiency Euclid algorithm given function grows proportionally fixed fact whereas efficiency trial division given function proportional fixed fact
The difference growth rate function illustrates contrast currently taken complexity theorist touchstone feasibility traditionally taken touchstone intractability
For instance could shown polynomial time factorization algorithm exists might seem reasonable conclude FACTORIZATION genuinely intractable problem
Although currently unknown whether case contemporary result provide circumstantial evidence FACTORIZATION indeed intractable see
Stronger evidence adduced intractability conjecture SAT TSP INTEGER PROGRAMMING similarly great many problem practical interest subject like logic graph theory linear algebra formal language theory game theory combinatorics
The technical development complexity theory aim make comparison computational difficulty precise show classification certain problem intractable admits rigorous mathematical analysis
As seen computational complexity theory problem considered proportion difficulty carrying efficient algorithm may decided
Similarly one problem understood another problem case posse efficient decision algorithm efficient algorithm deciding
In order make definition precise number technical convention employed many borrowed adjacent field


It useful summarize proceeding
A reference model computation M chosen represent algorithm
M assumed model sense accurately reflects computational cost carrying sort informally specified algorithm encountered mathematical practice
The deterministic T traditionally selected purpose
See discussion reasonable model justification choice

The efficiency two machine compared according time space complexity
In particular given function f N N define order growth O f n g n c n g n c f n
set function f n ignoring scalar factor
For instance fixed k N following function O constant n n
However O
A machine said another machine n O n conversely
Space complexity comparison machine performed similarly
The time space complexity problem measured term worst case time space complexity asymptotically efficient algorithm deciding
In particular say O n worst case time complexity time efficient machine deciding O n

Several complexity class consider

With convention place record several respect meaning assigned word complexity computational complexity theory differs assigned term several field
In computational complexity theory problem
finite combinatorial object like natural number formula graph assigned complexity
As seen assignment based time space complexity efficient algorithm membership problem decided
A distinct notion complexity studied
Rather studying complexity set mathematical object subject attempt develop notion complexity applicable individual combinatorial object
natural number formula graph etc
For instance Kolmogorov complexity finite string x defined size smallest program fixed universal Turing machine output given empty string input
In setting complexity object thus viewed measure extent description compressed algorithmically
Another notion complexity studied
Like computational complexity theory descriptive complexity theory also seek classify complexity infinite set combinatorial object
However complexity problem measured term logical resource required define instance relative class finite structure appropriate signature
As see approach often yield alternative characterization class studied computational complexity theory
Yet another subject related computational complexity theory

Like computational complexity theory algorithmic analysis study complexity problem also us time space measure n x defined
The methodology algorithmic analysis different computational complexity theory place primary emphasis gauging efficiency specific algorithm solving given problem
On hand seeking classify problem according degree intrinsic difficulty complexity theory must consider efficiency algorithm solving problem
Complexity theorist thus make greater use complexity class P NP PSPACE whose definition robust across different choice reference model
In algorithmic analysis hand algorithm often characterized relative hierarchy running time n n n n within P
The origin computational complexity theory lie early development algorithmic analysis
The former subject began work Gödel Church Turing Kleene Post originally undertaken attempt answer Hilbert

Church also showed class F function extensionally coincident class F R defined
Turing showed class F T function computable Turing machine extensionally coincident F
The extensional coincidence class F F R F T provided first evidence would later dub
CT understood assign precise epistemological significance Church Turing negative answer
For acknowledged F R hence also F F T contain effectively computable function follows problem shown
undecidable algorithm whatsoever regardless efficiency showing characteristic function x recursive
CT thus allows u infer fact problem x proven
word problem effectively decidable
It evident however justification classification stronger stock place CT
One form evidence often cited favor thesis coincidence class function computed member R T point mathematical robustness class recursive function
Two related form inductive evidence follows many independently motivated model computation subsequently defined describe class function ii thesis generally thought yield classification function thus far coincided ability compute relevant principle sense
But even correctness CT granted also important keep mind concept computability seek analyze one divorced certain respect everyday computational practice
For note CT classify f x effectively computable even computable Turing machine time space complexity function n n whose value may astronomically large even small input
Examples sort notwithstanding often claimed Turing original characterization effective computability provides template general analysis could mean function computable mechanical device
For instance argue process Turing originally arrived definition Turing machine generalized yield abstract characterization mechanical computing device
Such characterization may turn understood describing property physical system would obey order concretely implementable
For instance requirement Turing machine may access modify tape cell currently scanned head may generalized allow modification machine state bounded distance one computational locus
Such requirement turn understood reflecting fact classical physic allow possibility action distance
On basis CT also sometimes understood making prediction function
value determined measuring state physical system might hope use practical computing device
We might thus hope refinement condition potentially along line proposal discussed eventually provide insight mathematical model computation appear yield accurate account others exigency concretely embodied computation complexity theory seek analyze
Church Thesis often cited paradigm example case mathematical method successfully employed provide precise analysis informal concept

It also natural ask whether concept feasible computability described admits mathematical analysis similar Church Thesis
We saw FACTORIZATION example problem antecedent mathematical practical interest efficient algorithm historically sought
The task efficiently solving combinatorial problem sort exemplified TSP INTEGER PROGRAMMING PERFECT MATCHING grew importance due role scientific industrial clerical application
At time availability digital computer began make many problem mechanically solvable mass scale first time
This era also saw several theoretical step heralded attempt develop general theory feasible computability
The basic definition time space complexity Turing machine model first systematically formulated paper called On Computational Complexity Algorithms
This paper also origin Hierarchy Theorems see demonstrate sufficiently large increase time space bound Turing machine computation allows problem decided
A systematic exploration relationship different model computation also undertaken period
This included variant traditional Turing machine model additional head tape auxiliary storage device stack

Demonstrating coincidence class function computed model M M thus often yield additional information relative efficiency
For instance generally possible extract definition simulation M M time space x x value function f x computed time n space n machine M also computed time n space n machine M
For wide class model significant discovery efficient simulation found

An algorithm based dynamic programming solves instance problem recursively breaking subproblems whose optimal value computed stored manner efficiently reassembled achieve optimal overall solution

TSP could improved O via use dynamic programming
The question thus arose whether possible improve upon algorithm TSP also problem SAT efficient algorithm sought known exist
In order appreciate stake question observe naive algorithm TSP work follows enumerate set possible tour compute weight check cost tour
Note however node may contain many n tour
This example algorithm
one solves problem exhaustively enumerating possible solution successively testing whether correct
Somewhat precisely problem said admit brute force solution exists feasibly decidable relation family uniformly defined finite set x exists feasibly sized witness x
Such often called membership
The procedure deciding x exhaustively searching certificate checking x hold step known
For instance membership propositional formula atomic letter among problem SAT established searching set possible valuation function type v determine exists v
Note however since function yield exponential time decision algorithm
Many problem came light like SAT TSP easily seen posse exponential time brute force algorithm polynomial time algorithm could found
On basis gradually came accepted sufficient condition decidable problem intractable efficient algorithm solved best exponential time complexity
The corresponding positive hypothesis possession polynomial time decision algorithm regarded sufficient ground regarding problem feasibly decidable first put forth

Paralleling similar study brute force search Soviet Union subsequent paper also provided informal description complexity class NP
In particular characterized class containing problem exists good characterization
membership instance may verified using brute force search find certificate feasible size certifies membership
These observation provided groundwork come known see CET provides characterization notion feasibly computable function discussed similar form Church Thesis
The corresponding thesis decision problem hold problem feasibly decidable case class P
As formulated however CET relies informal notion model computation
A precise formulation given replacing notion specific model T A discussed
CET widely accepted within theoretical computer science reason broadly parallel traditionally given favor Church Thesis
For instance definition class FP stable across different model computation manner highlighted Invariance Thesis also exist several machine independent characterization class consider
Such result testify robustness definition polynomial time computability
It also possible make case CET parallel argument For case compute value function decide problem uniformly class instance concerned practice typically precisely discovered polynomial time algorithm implemented current computing hardware hence also Turing machine
And instance currently unable uniformly compute value function decide problem argument take interest typically case discovered polynomial time algorithm many case may also posse circumstantial evidence algorithm exist
Nonetheless several feature CET suggest regarded le well established Paramount amongst yet know whether P properly contained complexity class NP appear contain highly intractable problem
The following additional caveat also often issued respect claim class computational problem decide practice neatly aligns decidable polynomial time using conventional deterministic Turing machine
CET classifies function whose efficient algorithm time complexity c arbitrarily large scalar factor exponent
This mean function computable algorithm time complexity would still classified feasible
This despite fact would unable compute value practice input
CET classifies function whose efficient algorithm time complexity order growth inclusive n
However algorithm would run efficiently applied sort input likely concerned algorithm time complexity say O
There exist problem efficient known decision algorithm exponential time complexity worst case fact known NP general case see operate polynomial time either average case large subclass problem instance practical interest

For instance optimization version problem VERTEX COVER defined posse simple polynomial time approximation algorithm allows u find solution

There model computation hypothesized yield different classification problem respect appropriate definition polynomial time computability
A notable example existence procedure known solves problem FACTORIZATION polynomial time relative model computation known Quantum Turing Machine see
According Thesis complexity class P describes class feasibily decidable problem
As seen class defined term reference model T virtue assumption reasonable model computation
Several model computation also studied complexity theory presumed accurate representation cost concretely embodied computation rather help u better understand limit feasible computability
The important model N
Recall T T represented tuple Q finite set internal state finite tape alphabet start state transition function mapping pair q pair q
Here chosen set action

Such function hence type Q Q
On hand Turing machine N N form Q Q required

If machine however may one configuration related current configuration current head position
In case finite infinite sequence said computation sequence initial configuration case among configuration related similarly undefined configuration exists
We also redefine required machine always halt
initial configuration computation sequence finite length x x configuration encoding input computation sequence x x x x accepting state x computation sequence x x x n x rejecting state
Note definition treat accepting rejecting computation asymmetrically
For x computation sequence starting x may still lead rejecting state long lead accepting state
On hand x computation x required lead rejecting state
machine sometimes described making undetermined choice among different possible successor configuration various point computation
But foregoing definition actually describe tree T possible computation sequence starting given configuration deterministic machine example depicted Figure
Given asymmetry noted generally case branch T x must surveyed order determine decision input
A potential computation tree T x Turing machine starting initial configuration x
Accepting state labeled rejecting state
Note although tree contains accepting computation sequence length maximum depth still count towards determination n depth T x
The time complexity n machine maximum depth computation tree T x input
Relative definition machine used implement many brute force algorithm time polynomial
For instance SAT problem solved machine input us part tape construct guess string representing valuation assigning truth value propositional variable computes using method truth table polynomial
As SAT case satisfying valuation exists correct method deciding SAT relative convention iii
This mean SAT solved polynomial time relative N
This example also illustrates adding original deterministic model T enlarge class decidable problem
For N N decides possible construct machine T also decides successively simulating finitely many possible sequence choice might made course computation
It evident time complexity f n must generally check O f n sequence choice fixed order determine output input length
While availability simulation show class language decided N decided T

On hand second machine class defined include deterministic model whose member used efficiently simulate computation
This shown include number standard model discussed
For model definition polynomial time polynomial time polynomial space coincide
Experience borne member first machine class one consider model computation course formulating Thesis
It also widely believed member second machine class provide realistic representation complexity cost involved concretely embodied computation
Demonstrating formally would however require proving separation result complexity class currently unresolved
Thus widely believed second machine class properly extends first currently open problem
Recall complexity class set language decided within given time space complexity bound n n respect fixed model computation
To avoid pathology would arise define complexity class unnatural time space bound
one standard restrict attention complexity class defined n n
n said time constructible case exists Turing machine input consisting

Similarly n said space constructible case exists Turing machine input halt visited exactly n tape cell
It easy see time space constructible function include arise complexity algorithm typically considered practice n n etc
When interested deterministic computation conventional base definition classical complexity class defined section model T
Supposing n n respectively time space constructible function class TIME n SPACE n defined follows Since polynomial single variable order O class known respectively defined P k N TIME PSPACE k N SPACE
It also standard introduce class EXP k N TIME L SPACE n
In addition class based deterministic model T analogous complexity class based model N also studied
In particular class NTIME n NSPACE n defined follows The class NP NPSPACE NEXP NL defined analogously P NP EXP L

Central among demonstrate class TIME n form proper hierarchy sense n grows sufficiently faster n TIME n proper superset TIME n similarly NTIME n SPACE n
If TIME n TIME n
If NTIME n NTIME n
If SPACE n SPACE n
These result may demonstrated modification diagonal argument originally demonstrated undecidability classical
Nonetheless Theorem already number interesting consequence relationship complexity class introduced
For instance since function k satisfy hypothesis part see TIME always proper subset TIME
It also follows part P TIME f n time bound f n order growth

Similarly part ii respectively implies P EXP NP NEXP
And similarly follows part iii L PSPACE
Note since every deterministic Turing machine definition machine clearly P NP PSPACE NPSPACE
Some additional information relationship time space complexity reported following classical result Suppose f n time space constructible
Then The first result recapitulates prior observation machine running time f n may simulated deterministic machine time exponential f n
In order obtain Theorem note process carried space bounded f n provided make sure erase cell used prior simulation starting new one
Another classical result relates SPACE f n NSPACE f n For space constructible function n NSPACE n SPACE n
A corollary PSPACE NPSPACE suggesting computationally le powerful respect space appears respect time
The foregoing result establish following basic relationship among complexity class also depicted Figure As seen consequence Theorem L PSPACE P EXP
It thus follows least one first four displayed inclusion must proper also least one third fourth fifth
Inclusion relationship among major complexity class
The depicted inclusion currently known proper L PSPACE P EXP
At moment however currently known
although various heuristic argument cited favor properness displayed inclusion none proven hold
Providing unconditional proof claim remains major unfulfilled goal complexity theory
For instance following often described single important open question theoretical computer science Is P properly contained NP
The significance Open Question well several additional unresolved question inclusion relation among complexity class considered greater length
Having introduced major class studied complexity theory next turn question internal structure
This studied using notion reducibility one problem another problem complete class
Informally speaking problem said another problem case method solving would also yield method solving
The reducibility may thus understood showing solving least difficult solving
A problem said complexity class C case member C problem C reducible
The completeness C may thus understood demonstrating representative difficult problem C
The concept reduction completeness originally introduced computability theory
Therein number different definition reduction studied familiar see

For simplicity consider former
For language X Y said case exists polynomial time computable function f x In case write X say f x polynomial time reduction
Note polynomial time reducible via f x efficient algorithm deciding membership would also yield efficient algorithm deciding membership follows input compute f x ii use decide f x accepting rejecting
It easy see reflexive relation
Since composition two polynomial time computable function also polynomial time computable also transitive
We additionally say class C Y C X implies X C
It also easy see class P NP PSPACE EXP NEXP EXPSPACE closed relation
A problem said class C X X C
Finally said C hard C also member C
Since major focus research complexity theory study problem complete class NP

A canonical example problem variant Halting Problem N whose unbounded deterministic version also canonical complete problem computability theory BHP Given index Turing machine N N input time bound represented string accept step
It evident BHP NP since input N efficient universal machine determine accepts time polynomial
To see BHP hard NP observe Y NP corresponds set string accepted machine N N polynomial running time p n
If define f x N p easy see f x polynomial time reduction BHP
Since BHP NP follows closure NP problem P P NP
Since widely thought case provides evidence BHP intrinsically difficult computational problem
But since BHP closely related model computation N may appear little practical significance
It thus considerably interest wide range seemingly unrelated problem originating many different area mathematics also NP
One mean demonstrating given problem NP show BHP may reduced
But since mathematically natural problem bear relationship Turing machine mean obvious reduction exist
This problem circumvented beginning study NP independently demonstrated following SAT NP
We already seen SAT NP
In order demonstrate Theorem thus suffices show problem X NP polynomial time reducible SAT
Supposing X NP must Turing machine N Q accepting polynomial time complexity p n
The proof Theorem proceeds showing input length construct propositional formula N x satisfiable accepts within p n step
Although SAT still problem particular system logic combinatorial nature BHP
In light Theorem opened door showing great many problem NP showing SAT may efficiently reduced
For instance problem TSP INTEGER PROGRAMMING introduced NP

VERTEX COVER Given graph G V E natural number k exist set vertex V cardinality edge u v least one member
SET COVERING Given finite set finite family S subset natural number exist subfamily S S cardinality S
The problem SAT shown NP Cook original paper
The example cited taken list problem previously identified context shown NP
The reduction required show completeness problem typically require construction come known

For instance order see SAT may reduced INDEPENDENT SET first observe CNF formula form
propositional variable
A formula form satisfiable case exists valuation satisfying least one literal
On hand suppose consider family graph partitioned n disjoint triangle manner depicted Figure
It easy see independent set size graph must contain exactly one vertex triangle
This turn suggests idea using graph form gadget representing clause CNF formula
The graph formula
A reduction SAT INDEPENDENT SET described follows Let CNF formula consisting clause depicted
We construct graph V E consisting node respectively labeled literal comprising th clause
Additionally contains edge connecting node triangle corresponding literal depicted Figure
Now define mapping instance SAT instance INDEPENDENT SET f n
As contains vertex hence O edge evident f x computed polynomial time
To see f reduction SAT INDEPENDENT SET first suppose valuation
Then must least one literal every clause
Picking node corresponding literal triangle thus yield independent set size
Conversely suppose V independent set size
By construction contains exactly one vertex
And since edge pair node labeled oppositely signed literal different triangle contain contradictory literal
A satisfying valuation constructed setting v node labeled appears v otherwise
Since transitive composing polynomial time reduction together provides another mean showing various problem NP
For instance completeness TSP originally demonstrated via series reduction Thus although problem listed seemingly unrelated sense concern different kind mathematical object
logical formula graph system linear equation etc
fact NP taken demonstrate computationally universal NP manner BHP
It also follows transitivity existence polynomial time algorithm even NP problem would entail existence polynomial time algorithm problem NP
The existence algorithm would thus run strongly counter expectation virtue extensive effort devoted finding efficient solution particular NP problem INTEGER PROGRAMMING TSP
Such problem thus standardly regarded constituting difficult problem NP
As long Open Question answered positive
P NP NP problem thus fit description effectively decidable problem intrinsically difficult sense described
As see however mean hardest problem studied complexity theorist
Nor complexity theory incapable making distinction difficulty problem lie inside P P NP presuming latter class
In contrast Turing machine model N acceptance rejection convention deterministic model computation T
In word deterministic machine either accept reject input necessary sufficient exist single halting computation x x
The output machine determined whether x accepting rejecting configuration
A consequence complexity class like P defined term model
language X P complement X df x x also P
If define class coC consist problem whose complement class C thus follows P coP
In contrast guarantee class NP defined term model closed complementation
For consider problem SAT belonging class
SAT
complement SAT consists set formula exist satisfying valuation
contradictory formula propositional logic
From follows SAT VALID
set valid propositional formula
As observation provides easy polynomial time reduction SAT VALID latter thus member coNP also complete class
Note however order show VALID requires show true respect valuation
As exist valuation formula containing n propositional variable mean evident membership arbitrary formula VALID decided polynomial time algorithm implemented Turing machine relative acceptance rejection convention describe
In fact following another fundamental unresolved question contemporary complexity theory Are class NP coNP distinct
It widely believed like Open Question Open Question affirmative answer
But observe NP problem could shown coNP would also follow NP coNP
This turn suggests problem known class NP coNP unlikely NP symmetric consideration also unlikely coNP
This class consists problem posse polynomial sized certificate demonstrating membership
It easy see NP coNP includes problem P
But class also contains problem currently known feasibly decidable
An important example FACTORIZATION defined
For one hand number divide serf certificate membership n FACTORIZATION
And hand order demonstrate membership n FACTORIZATION suffices exhibit prime factorization factor le
This follows prime factorization unique unlike falsifying valuation case VALIDITY primality individual factor verified polynomial time AKS algorithm
Hence FACTORIZATION NP coNP simultaneously
As computational problem practical importance considerable effort put finding efficient algorithm FACTORIZATION
If inability find efficient factorization algorithm indeed indicative problem P positive answer Open Question would entail natural mathematical problem feasibly decidable also NP
This turn suggests degree structure problem lying P NP presuming class may provide yet finer grained analysis intrinsic computational difficulty provided Thesis alone
If initial attempt find efficient algorithm solving problem known decidable unsuccessful common strategy attempt show NP
For assuming P NP follows thesis feasible algorithm solving exist
Nonetheless field make use discrete mathematics often give rise decidable problem thought considerably difficult NP one
For recall consequence Theorem class EXP NEXP
exponential time exponential time properly extend P
Hence problem complete class currently classified infeasible regardless Open Question resolved
Such problem include several decision problem logic considered well version problem considered section
A complexity class likely properly contained EXP still contains many apparently infeasible problem arise computational practice PSPACE
A prototypical example problem PSPACE formulated using notion QBF

true quantified boolean formula
We may define problem TQBF Given quantified boolean formula true

This result suggests close connection problem decided using unbounded time feasible amount memory space could solved able answer certain kind existential universal query single step using bounded number alternation two kind query
This observation used give alternative characterization several complexity class considered
Recall instance NP informally characterized set problem membership established providing certificate appropriate sort
SAT established exhibiting satisfying valuation
Similarly coNP similarly characterized set problem established existence certificate
VALID also established exhibiting satisfying valuation
On basis observation difficult prove following Call relation R x x R x P
A problem NP case exists polynomial decidable relation R x polynomial p x x p R x
A problem coNP case exists polynomial decidable relation R x polynomial p x x p R x
Proposition provides basis defining hierarchy complexity class
PH based logical representation computational problem
We first define alternative name class P
P
We define class problem form X x p R x R x n class problem form X x q S x S x n p n q n polynomial
set problem n n
Finally class PH defined k N
It follows immediately Proposition NP coNP
It also evident foregoing definition containment relation depicted Figure
It also difficult show PH PSPACE
These relationship similar obtain analogously defined Arithmetic Hierarchy studied computability theory see
But whereas shown standard diagonal argument arithmetic hierarchy collapse following also currently unresolved question fundamental importance Is PH proper hierarchy
case k k k
Is PH properly contained PSPACE
The Polynomial Hierarchy
To better understand Open Questions b also expected decided positively useful explore relationship PSPACE characterization PH term quantifier alternation
To end first show problem TQBF may redefined term game player called thought attempting demonstrate true another player called thought attempting demonstrate true
Supposing form play defined follows A verification game sequence move countermove possible reply guaranteed result win
Let u call problem deciding whether winning strategy TWO PLAYER SAT
As move two player mirror interpretation QBF formula difficult see TWO PLAYER SAT case TQBF
And initial quantifier may efficiently construct equivalent formula quantifier required alternating form interspersing dummy quantifier needed
It thus follows like TQBF TWO PLAYER SAT also PSPACE
Although TWO PLAYER SAT defined term simple game similar result obtained suitable variation variety well familiar board game
Consider instance following variation standard rule Go game played n board ii winner game player stone end round
demonstrated PSPACE following problem GO Given board position n game Go exist winning strategy black

What game common definition winning strategy player move first involves alternation existential universal quantifier manner mimic definition class comprise PH
Taking account suppose define TWO PLAYER SAT variant TWO PLAYER SAT wherein alternation quantifier thus follows game formula class round
TWO PLAYER SAT may shown complete class Polynomial Hierarchy
Note however value increase expect become difficult decide membership TWO PLAYER SAT much way appears become difficult determine whether given player winning strategy increasingly long game Go chess
This observation provides part reason currently expected answer Open Question positive
For see assertion PH equivalent assertion problem determining whether winning strategy verification game harder deciding question game n
A related observation bear status Open Question
For note PH PSPACE TWO PLAYER SAT would complete PH PSPACE
Since PH defined k N would follow TWO PLAYER SAT
But case would problem determining whether winning strategy verification game would harder deciding question game n
As run contrary expectation also widely believed PH PSPACE also former class differs latter failing complete problem
Even taking account current inability resolve Open Questions hierarchy complexity class depicted Figure ranging P EXP represent robust benchmark computational difficulty available
Beyond hierarchy wide array additional class also studied believed demarcate additional structure either inside P P NP
Comprehensive consideration diversity class beyond scope current survey
But complement understanding class defined relative T N useful consider three additional class NC BPP BQP defined relative model computation
One way defining NC term model computation P known PRAM machine
This model variant conventional RAM model described allows parallelism
A PRAM machine consists sequence program q n comprised finite sequence instruction performing operation register
Each program also control separate processor program counter accumulator
The processor operate parallel write common block register adopting policy resolving conflict
Finally number program hence processor comprising fixed vary size input according function q n
In way PRAM machine recruit processor operate larger input although number processor employed must fixed uniformly size input
Although PRAM model deterministic easy see member used efficiently simulate operation Turing machine recruiting sufficiently many processor carry path given computation tree parallel
This model hence member van Emde Boas second machine class considered reasonable model computation
Nonetheless P useful theoretical model provides formal medium implementing procedure call certain operation carried simultaneously parallel
It long known certain problem
matrix multiplication graph reachability sorting admit parallel algorithm case faster efficient known sequential one see
But observation would still little practical significance algorithm question achieved speed cost employ exponentially many processor relative size input
For case seems would little hope building computing device could concretely implemented
It notable however parallel algorithm problem mentioned require number processor polynomial size input also require time
O n fixed
This motivates definition NC class problem solved PRAM machine time O n using O processor fixed c k N
In particular amount defined sum number step required processor performed machine satisfying definition polynomial size input
We seen Thesis suggests P coincides class problem feasibly decided algorithm implementable relative sequential model computation T
In much way often suggested NC coincides class problem feasibly decided algorithm implemented relative parallel model P see

In particular shown PRAM machine run time O n using O processor simulated polynomial time sequential machine
From follows NC subset P
NC interest part opposite inclusion known hold
following question also open Is NC properly contained P
The current consensus like Open Questions Open Question also answered positive
In case heuristic argument derives observation NC P would case every problem possessing O sequential algorithm could sped sense admitting parallel algorithm requires time O n using O k processor
Even allowing case substantially larger thought unlikely virtue fact certain problem P appear inherently sequential sense exhibiting structure make resistant parallelization
In particular conjectured true P problem determining whether boolean circuit evaluates true formula Horn fragment propositional logic satisfiable
Another active area research complexity theory concern class defined term model computation
Instances model assumed access genuine source randomness
fair coin quantum mechanical random number generator used determine course computation
This basic idea given rise number different paradigm modeling probabilistic computation original Turing machine model N early exemplar
As seen however Turing machine employed practical model probabilistic computation

It difficult see possessed algorithm deciding implementable machine satisfying iii could correctly decide whether x arbitrarily high probability applying algorithm repeatedly checking whether majority computation accepted rejected
As standard Turing machine model T corresponds special case C follows P BPP
For long time also thought PRIMES might example problem BPP P
However know problem P virtue AKS primality algorithm
At present known candidate separating class also known NP contained BPP although latter shown included
Thus although might first seem plausible ability make random choice course computation allows u practically solve certain problem resist efficient deterministic algorithm open problem whether true
A final complexity class attracted considerable attention recent year known BQP
BQP defined analogously BPP using model Q instead model C
Such model roughly characterized device make use phenomenon entanglement interference perform operation data represented sequence

Based early suggestion number model proposed precise definition BQP based
Quantum Turing Machine
Several algorithm discovered implemented device run faster best known classical algorithm problem
Among searching unsorted database run time O whereas best possible classical algorithm O n integer factorization run O n whereas best known classical algorithm O n
Since shown quantum model simulate model classical Turing machine BQP contains P BPP
And seen BQP contains least one problem
FACTORIZATION known contained P
Although shown BQP PSPACE relationship former class NP currently well understood
In particular polynomial time quantum algorithm discovered solving NP problem implementable widely accepted model quantum computation
There also considerable controversy whether prove possible construct physical realization model sufficiently robust reliably solve instance problem currently solved using classical hardware
Even proof P BQP found empirical investigation would thus required determine bearing quantum computation either limit feasible computation status thesis
Nonetheless quantum computation active area research present
There date surprisingly little philosophical engagement computational complexity theory
Although several question origin computability theory

And despite ongoing interest logical knowledge resource bounded reasoning field epistemology decision theory social choice theory recently begun make use concept result
This section attempt bridge gap highlighting connection computational complexity traditional topic logic philosophy
The appreciation complexity theory outside theoretical computer science largely due notoriety open question
Of Open Question henceforth P NP attracted greatest attention
Along long standing unresolved question pure applied mathematics Riemann Hypothesis Hodge Conjecture subject major prize competition
Millennium Problems Cook
It also frequently focus survey article popular exposition

There indeed several reason suspect resolution P NP prove far reaching practical theoretical consequence outside computer science
Perhaps significant revolves around possibility despite various heuristic argument currently offered favor hypothesis P NP remains possibility P NP true
Recall P characterized class problem membership efficiently whereas NP characterized class problem membership efficiently appropriate certificate provided
If turned P NP difficulty two task would coincide polynomial factor problem NP
Some consequence would task finding satisfying valuation propositional formula harder constructing truth table task factoring natural number would difficult verifying given factorization correct etc
Our intuition strongly reflect fact former problem pair difficult latter
But beyond collapsing distinction currently appear almost coincidence P NP would also radical effect situation currently face mathematics
For suppose T recursively axiomatic theory sufficiently strong formalize current mathematical theorizing
Zermelo Fraenkel set theory Axiom Choice ZFC supplemented needed large cardinal hypothesis
Observe regardless proof theoretic strength T following question derivability theory still presumably decidable polynomial time PROOF CHECKING T Given formula language T finite object D appropriate sort
derivation sequence tree D proof axiom T
For standard definition also case order O T length n D say measured number symbol D
We thus check derivable proof size guessing sequence symbol length checking polynomial time whether proof
It thus follows following problem NP PROVABILITY T Given formula language T natural number exist valid T D length D valid proof
We course generally interested question whether provable T restriction length derivation
case express Riemann Hypothesis T theory like ZFC
But letter von Neumann observed able efficiently decide PROVABILITY T would already enormous significance mathematical practice
For note seems plausible assume human mathematician ever able comprehend proof containing million symbol page
If able efficiently check PROVABILITY T say n obtained negative answer Gödel concludes would reason think
For case demonstration PROVABILITY T sufficiently large sufficiently powerful T would sufficient show hope ever comprehending proof even one exist
But note since PROVABILITY T NP happened P NP task determining whether mathematical formula derivable preferred mathematical theory proof feasible length would checkable efficient algorithm
Gödel suggests would following consequence Building observation several recent commentator also underscored significance Open Question suggesting P NP would entail dispensability creativity mathematics also number task
theory construction music composition traditionally thought involve element insight
But although coincidence P NP would intriguing consequence also seems likely discovery proof validating consensus view P NP would regarded foundationally significant
As seen sort evidence often cited favor proper inclusion P NP failure protracted attempt find polynomial time algorithm problem NP strong practical interest either deciding practice proving intractable
A proof P NP would thus effect validating inductive evidence would provide additional evidence Thesis provides correct analysis notion feasibility
In particular would allow u unconditionally assert NP problem intractable general case
Recall however inductive consideration form part overall evidence cited favor P NP
In particular various heuristic consideration also point class NP coNP PH PSPACE hence positive answer Open Questions
But case P NP question would resolved negatively manner run strongly counter current expectation see Sections
Given convergence several form evidence conjecture P NP also reasonable ask statement proven difficult resolve practice
For note although statement originates theoretical computer science may easily formulated statement natural number
In particular P NP equivalent statement index exponent exists propositional formula deterministic Turing machine correctly decide membership SAT step
Using familiar technique difficult see statement formalized language arithmetic
statement form x x x contains bounded numerical quantifier
Based logical form alone currently exclude possibility independent Peano arithmetic PA even stronger axiom system ZFC
But although early result suggested P NP may independent weak axiomatic theory
believed statement unlikely independent stronger theory like PA approximate mathematical axiom employ practice
In particular showed possible use current proof theoretic technique show independence PA demonstration would also show NP close P sense made precise using technique circuit complexity
As thought implausible suggests currently posse reason suspect P NP likely independent PA let alone ZFC currently open number theoretic statement
But time consensus also developed unlikely able settle status P NP basis currently known method proof
A familiar example method diagonalization employed proof undecidability classical Halting Problem follows recursive language properly included recursively enumerable one
We seen variant method used show P EXP proof Theorem
But diagonalization proof yielding separation typically relativize computation following sense proof yield C C complexity class C C suitable modification also typically yield C C oracle A
Baker Gill Solovay famously established existence oracle P NP P NP
As would expect proof P NP based diagonalization relativize suggests possible use method separate P NP
Despite negative character result often taken bear status P NP resolving open question remains important topic research theoretical computer science
Several program separating complexity class recently explored using technique circuit complexity proof theory algebraic geometry
However current consensus approach still need substantial refinement genuinely new method required order yield desired separation
It thus seems reasonable summarize current status P NP
problem follows P NP widely believed true basis convergent inductive heuristic evidence ii currently reason suspect statement formally independent mathematical theory accept practice iii proof P NP still considered beyond reach current technique

Another connection logic computational complexity provided arithmetical theory similar form familiar system Primitive Recursive Arithmetic Peano arithmetic

From onwards number similar result obtained link level Polynomial Hierarchy class theory collectively known
In course studying relationship arithmetic complexity theory often useful consider function addition set
For instance may consider class FP df function computable deterministic Turing machine polynomial time
Similarly define class function computable deterministic Turing machine polynomial time use oracle set level PH

A first link formal arithmetic complexity provided Cobham original characterization FP term functional algebra similar defined
The class question generated following class basis function F We also define following variant primitive recursion The function f x said defined g x x z x z k x case f x k x x
We define class F function definable limited recursion notation least class containing F closed composition foregoing scheme
A slight variant Cobham original result may stated follows f x FP f x F
Like Theorems Theorem significant provides another characterization important complexity class
Recall however Cobham working time mathematical status notion feasibility still debate
So also reasonable ask definition F understood providing independently motivated analysis feasible computability akin analysis Church Turing often said provided effective computability
Relative standard discussed seems reasonable maintain basis function F feasibly computable also property preserved composition
Now suppose f x defined limited recursion notation g x x z x z k x
In case f x x f x depending whether even odd
From follows depth recursion required compute value f x proportional
proportional opposed f x defined h x f x ordinary primitive recursion
This suggests feasibility also preserved function defined limited recursion notation
It harder motivate inclusion function x F condition f x k x Definition ground alone
For feature definition F see precisely effect placing polynomial bound auxiliary function computed sort recursion described
On hand indirect reference polynomial rate growth avoided similar functional characterization FP due using form positive definability string using structural modification traditional primitive recursion scheme

Since term language arithmetic polynomial positive coefficient follows Theorem provably total function I polynomial rate growth
In particular exponentiation provably total theory
For reason Parikh referred I anthropomorphic system
In order obtain arithmetical theory describe P higher level PH precisely two approach pursued respectively due
Buss presented sequence theory whose provably total function correspond level hierarchy
These theory stated language L x x intended interpretation
Whereas traditional bounded quantifier form x x form x x L involving
The syntactic class defined manner reminiscent class defined traditional arithmetical hierarchy

The direct link philosophy mathematics computational complexity theory thus far arisen context discussion view traditionally known
This view prominently associated turn best known questioning whether expression denote natural number
Presuming expression denote contended taken describe referred
number may count practice
On basis outlined foundational program wherein feasibility treated basic notion traditional argument favor validity mathematical induction uniqueness natural number series called question
Antecedents view may found

Recall one tenet traditional form finitism associated natural number conceived comprising completed infinite totality
Strict finitists sometimes described going one step actively denying infinitely many natural number
However following characteristic claim theorist explicitly endorse In emphasizing practical aspect use numeral represent natural number course performing arithmetical computation evident concern motivate strict finitism anticipate also inspired development complexity theory
Nonetheless strict finitism attracted follower
To see observe make clear strict finitists propose identify natural number familiar sequence unary numeral
If regard expression token rather type make sense consider task concretely counting number constructing unary representation sense described
For recall characteristic feature numeral may generated certain initial symbol application finite set syntactic formation rule
unary numeral generated applying formation rule initial symbol
But acknowledged also seems difficult resist following additional thesis In attempting accommodate simultaneously must confront tension led many author follow concluding strict finitism lack coherent formulation
For suppose let F x symbolize denotes feasible number sense
Then would seem follow ought accept But would also seem follow also accept accept expression denoting infeasible number
Dummett observed two different form classical intervene show iii inconsistent
For one hand applying mathematical induction
principle definite property P x natural number may infer x P x P x P x P predicate F x may conclude x F x ii
But F follows universal instantiation contradiction iii
And hand even without appealing induction contradiction also derived form conditional sorites argument deriving F result repeatedly applying series F F F F F obtained ii universal instantiation
Although would uncharitable think unaware observation first person directly reply charge inconsistent appears
His response understood consisting two part bear analysis informal notion feasibility considered Sections
On one hand Parikh considers refers PA
This theory formulated language L F x supplemented term closed primitive recursive function contains statement F fixed primitive recursive term intended denote infeasible number
Finally PA contains axiom PA induction schema restricted formula containing F x
In light latter restriction possible mimic inductive form sorites argument PA
But course PA still inconsistent virtue conditional form argument
Nonetheless Parikh showed appropriate choice proof contradiction PA must long
For instance consider x let primitive recursive term consequence Parikh result proof contradiction PA must order step long
For example proof must least line long
This suggests possibility reply behalf strict finitist Dummett argument strict finitism The inductive form sorites ruled virtue fact F x definite
property natural number
At least certain choice conditional form also threat derivation contradiction iii long carried practice
The possibility reply notwithstanding also natural ask point whether notion feasibility considered complexity theory might also vague manner could render susceptible sort soritical argument envisioned
Note however discussion thus far suggests notion feasibility strict finitists interested property
This keeping way seen notion treated complexity theory
For instance order employ Thesis judge whether problem feasibly decidable consider order growth time complexity n efficient algorithm deciding
From perspective complexity theory feasibility thus notion applies individual natural number either time complexity function type N N rate growth
Next observe following consequence thesis O
constant time feasible rate growth
Since polynomial order growth feasible follows O feasible O
order growth O feasible
On basis one might indeed fear intuition feasibly computable function codified thesis exhibit kind instability intuitively acceptable principle feasibly constructible number
To see case however observe compare growth rate f g N N standard ordering natural number rather following ordering It consequence definition O O n O O
polynomial order growth form respect
However also follows O O k N
O point infinity sitting polynomial order growth respect ordering rate growth
And follows order reached sequence feasible order growth O O n O O When analyzed according thesis hence appears naive notion feasible computability suffer sort instability Dummett take plague notion feasibly constructible number
These observation point another theme within writing strict finitists suggests also anticipate way predicate like feasible infeasible employed complexity theory
For instance suggests feasible number closed addition multiplication explicitly state regarded closed exponentiation
The possibility exponentiation understood play role formulation strict finitism also suggested fact particular example infeasible number put forth others typically employed exponential iterated exponential notation form n
This turn suggests another reply argument strict finitism
Recall theory I introduced allows u define graph exponential function via x z sense I I x z x z x z x
But seen I prove totality exponential function also shown Buss theory S
From follows theory S z z consistent
By completeness theorem logic thus exists model M language bounded arithmetic M S z z
But although follows Theorem polynomial time computable function defined input M also exists object domain M satisfying z z
And follows expression would conventionally write fails denote value M
Of course model M S z z must nonstandard
Thus must domain M infinite also exist natural number sense M infinitely many predecessor viewed outside M
One might thus first think use structure like M explore consequence strict finitism would antithetical proponent
Note however theorist typically careful avoid explicitly asserting finitely many feasible number
Instead give example expression whose denotation exist would infeasibly large
given formulation
Certainly claim feasibly constructible number would invite challenge strict finitist nominate number
And nomination would turn invite rejoinder feasibly constructible must well
But sort model M consideration definite description largest exists virtue fact element n M M z n z form proper initial segment
The existence model might thus taken elucidate claim distinct natural number sequence distinguished primitive recursive function closed
The direct link complexity theory epistemology thus far discussed mediated observation deciding logical validity related property generally computationally difficult task
For one hand traditional view epistemology
knowledge certain statement paradigm case
If correct would seem credit normal epistemic agent knowledge class logically valid sentence system propositional logic commonly taken underlie everyday reasoning
But hand result presented make clear problem deciding whether validity one system computationally intractable
The apparent clash philosophical view knowledge predict logical validity ought easy come know
virtue fact require empirical confirmation technical fact validity satisfiability problem even weakest familiar system intractable origin two development traditionally interest epistemologist problem study theory
The problem logical omniscience often presented originated within subject known
In setting knowledge treated modal operator sentence form assigned intended interpretation
The goal set axiom rule characterize reason statement form
For instance principle knowledge statement entail truth rendered principle knowledge conjunction entail knowledge conjuncts rendered
Other principle
express failure know entail know failure considered controversial
However consensus view defensible choice logic knowledge lie
The precise axiomatization adopted notwithstanding use modal logic model reasoning knowledge following two consequence VALID ii respectively report agent knowledge includes propositional tautology set sentence know closed logical consequence
Note however result seem implausible relative everyday understanding knowledge
For one hand infinitely many distinct propositional tautology even relatively short one many otherwise normal epistemic agent fail recognize
And generally acknowledged set sentence know believe least explicit sense closed logical consequence
This often illustrated observing otherwise competent epistemic agent might know axiom mathematical theory
PA without knowing theorem
Infinitude Primes
The result summarized Sections underscore severe problem
Note first problem deciding whether given formula tautology coNP hence likely intractable
But also seen result proof complexity strongly suggest proof system agent likely adopt reasoning propositional logic
natural deduction infinitely many statement whose simplest proof length least exponential relative size
It thus likely exist short tautology
fewer propositional letter whose shortest proof conventional natural deduction system astronomically long
Similar remark apply problem determining whether finite set sentence consistent task surely epistemic import everyday reasoning
In particular readily seen consistency checking simply canonical NP problem SAT
It already consequence Thesis together expected positive answer Open Questions problem computationally intractable
But abandon simplifying assumption everyday reasoning based classical propositional logic validity consistency checking become harder
For instance think agent reason knowledge others using modal logic corresponding validity satisfiability problem become PSPACE
And assume reason propositional relevance logic classical logic intuitionistic logic validity problem becomes RE

This development traced work decision theory cognitive psychology attempt take account human agent face resource limitation everyday decision making
The attempt develop model decision take resource limitation account sometimes presented counterpoint often employed economics political science
In context decision making often modeled form optimization
In particular traditionally required fully rational agent able find optimal choice among array alternative potential infeasibility carrying search amongst notwithstanding
These development serve part background debate epistemology originated Cherniak theory
Cherniak attempt provide characterization rationality responsive traditional normative characterization well complexity theoretic result difficulty deductive inference sort discussed
According account minimally rational agent need make valid inference follow belief proof system classical logic
He suggests inference selected may depend sort heuristic considered cognitive psychologist
As Cherniak proposes use heuristic may benefit agent certain circumstance even potentially unsound one regarded falling generalized account rationality informed computational complexity theory

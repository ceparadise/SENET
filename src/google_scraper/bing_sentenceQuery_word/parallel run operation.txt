type many calculation execution carried simultaneously
Large problem often divided smaller one solved time
There several different form parallel computing
Parallelism employed many year mainly interest grown lately due physical constraint preventing
As power consumption consequently heat generation computer become concern recent year parallel computing become dominant paradigm mainly form
Parallel computing closely related frequently used together often conflated though two distinct possible parallelism without concurrency concurrency without parallelism multitasking CPU
In parallel computing computational task typically broken several often many similar subtasks processed independently whose result combined afterwards upon completion
In contrast concurrent computing various process often address related task typical separate task may varied nature often require execution
Parallel computer roughly classified according level hardware support parallelism computer multiple within single machine use multiple computer work task
Specialized parallel computer architecture sometimes used alongside traditional processor accelerating specific task
In case parallelism transparent programmer parallelism explicitly particularly use concurrency difficult write sequential one concurrency introduces several new class potential common
different subtasks typically greatest obstacle getting good parallel program performance
A theoretical single program result parallelization given
Traditionally written
To solve problem constructed implemented serial stream instruction
These instruction executed one computer
Only one instruction may execute instruction finished next one executed
Parallel computing hand us multiple processing element simultaneously solve problem
This accomplished breaking problem independent part processing element execute part algorithm simultaneously others
The processing element diverse include resource single computer multiple processor several networked computer specialized hardware combination
dominant reason improvement
The runtime program equal number instruction multiplied average time per instruction
Maintaining everything else constant increasing clock frequency decrease average time take execute instruction
An increase frequency thus decrease runtime program
However power consumption chip given equation switched per clock cycle proportional number transistor whose input change processor frequency cycle per second
Increases frequency increase amount power used processor
Increasing processor power consumption led ultimately May cancellation processor generally cited end frequency scaling dominant computer architecture paradigm
empirical observation number transistor microprocessor double every month
Despite power consumption issue repeated prediction end Moore law still effect
With end frequency scaling additional transistor longer used frequency scaling used add extra hardware parallel computing
Optimally parallelization would number processing element halve runtime doubling second time halve runtime
However parallel algorithm achieve optimal speedup
Most speedup small number processing element flattens constant value large number processing element
The potential speedup algorithm parallel computing platform given Since show small part program parallelized limit overall speedup available parallelization
A program solving large mathematical engineering problem typically consist several parallelizable part several serial part
If part program account runtime get time speedup regardless many processor added
This put upper limit usefulness adding parallel execution unit
When task partitioned sequential constraint application effort effect schedule
The bearing child take nine month matter many woman assigned
Amdahl law applies case problem size fixed
In practice computing resource become available tend get used larger problem larger datasets time spent parallelizable part often grows much faster inherently serial work
In case give le pessimistic realistic assessment parallel performance Both Amdahl law Gustafson law assume running time serial part program independent number processor
Amdahl law assumes entire problem fixed size total amount work done parallel also whereas Gustafson law assumes total amount work done parallel
Understanding fundamental implementing
No program run quickly longest chain dependent calculation known since calculation depend upon prior calculation chain must executed order
However algorithm consist long chain dependent calculation usually opportunity execute independent calculation parallel
Let two program segment
Bernstein condition describe two independent executed parallel
For let input variable output variable likewise
independent satisfy Violation first condition introduces flow dependency corresponding first segment producing result used second segment
The second condition represents second segment produce variable needed first segment
The third final condition represents output dependency two segment write location result come logically last executed segment
Consider following function demonstrate several kind dependency In example instruction executed even parallel instruction instruction us result instruction
It violates condition thus introduces flow dependency
In example dependency instruction run parallel
Bernstein condition allow memory shared different process
For mean enforcing ordering access necessary
Subtasks parallel program often called
Some parallel computer architecture use smaller lightweight version thread known others use bigger version known
However thread generally accepted generic term subtasks
Threads often need update shared
The instruction two program may interleaved order
For example consider following program If instruction executed instruction executed program produce incorrect data
This known
The programmer must use provide
A lock programming language construct allows one thread take control variable prevent thread reading writing variable unlocked
The thread holding lock free execute section program requires exclusive access variable unlock data finished
Therefore guarantee correct program execution program rewritten use lock One thread successfully lock variable V thread proceed V unlocked
This guarantee correct execution program
Locks necessary ensure correct program execution greatly slow program
Locking multiple variable using lock introduces possibility program
An lock multiple variable
If lock lock
If two thread need lock two variable using lock possible one thread lock one second thread lock second variable
In case neither thread complete deadlock result
Many parallel program require subtasks
This requires use
Barriers typically implemented using software lock
One class algorithm known altogether avoids use lock barrier
However approach generally difficult implement requires correctly designed data structure
Not parallelization result
Generally task split thread thread spend portion time communicating
Eventually overhead communication dominates time spent solving problem parallelization splitting workload even thread increase rather decrease amount time required finish
This known
Applications often classified according often subtasks need synchronize communicate
An application exhibit parallelism subtasks must communicate many time per second exhibit parallelism communicate many time per second exhibit rarely never communicate
Embarrassingly parallel application considered easiest parallelize
Parallel programming language parallel computer must also known memory model
The consistency model defines rule operation occur result produced
One first consistency model model
Sequential consistency property parallel program parallel execution produce result sequential program
Specifically program sequentially consistent result execution operation processor executed sequential order operation individual processor appear sequence order specified program
common type consistency model
Software transactional memory borrows concept applies memory access
Mathematically model represented several way
introduced Carl Adam Petri doctoral thesis early attempt codify rule consistency model
Dataflow theory later built upon created physically implement idea dataflow theory
Beginning late developed permit algebraic reasoning system composed interacting component
More recent addition process calculus family added capability reasoning dynamic topology
Logics Lamport mathematical model also developed describe behavior concurrent system
created one earliest classification system parallel sequential computer program known
Flynn classified program computer whether operating using single set multiple set instruction whether instruction using single set multiple set data
The SISD classification equivalent entirely sequential program
The SIMD classification analogous operation repeatedly large data set
This commonly done application
MISD rarely used classification
While computer architecture deal devised application fit class materialized
MIMD program far common type parallel program
According Some machine hybrid category course classic model survived simple easy understand give good first approximation
It widely used scheme
From advent VLSI fabrication technology computer architecture driven doubling amount information processor manipulate per cycle
Increasing word size reduces number instruction processor must execute perform operation variable whose size greater length word
For example processor must add two processor must first add bit integer using standard addition instruction add bit using instruction lower order addition thus processor requires two instruction complete single operation processor would able complete operation single instruction
Historically microprocessor replaced microprocessor
This trend generally came end introduction processor standard computing two decade
Not early advent architecture processor become commonplace
A computer program essence stream instruction executed processor
Without parallelism processor issue le one
These processor known processor
These instruction combined group executed parallel without changing result program
This known parallelism
Advances parallelism dominated computer architecture
All modern processor
Each stage pipeline corresponds different action processor performs instruction stage processor pipeline different instruction different stage completion thus issue one instruction per clock cycle
These processor known processor
The canonical example pipelined processor processor five stage instruction fetch IF instruction decode ID execute EX memory access MEM register write back WB
The processor pipeline
Most modern processor also multiple
They usually combine feature pipelining thus issue one instruction per clock cycle
These processor known processor
Instructions grouped together
similar scoreboarding make use two common technique implementing execution parallelism
Task parallelism characteristic parallel program entirely different calculation performed either different set data
This contrast data parallelism calculation performed different set data
Task parallelism involves decomposition task allocating processor execution
The processor would execute simultaneously often cooperatively
Task parallelism usually scale size problem
Main memory parallel computer either shared processing element single processing element local address space
Distributed memory refers fact memory logically distributed often implies physically distributed well
combine two approach processing element local memory access memory processor

Distributed memory system memory access
Computer system make use fast memory located close processor store temporary copy memory value nearby physical logical sense
Parallel computer system difficulty cache may store value one location possibility incorrect program execution
These computer require system keep track cached value strategically purge thus ensuring correct program execution
one common method keeping track value accessed thus purged
Designing large cache coherence system difficult problem computer architecture
As result shared memory computer architecture scale well distributed memory system
communication implemented hardware several way including via shared either multiported memory shared interconnect network myriad including fat hypercube hypercube one processor node
Parallel computer based interconnected network need kind enable passing message node directly connected
The medium used communication processor likely hierarchical large multiprocessor machine
Parallel computer roughly classified according level hardware support parallelism
This classification broadly analogous distance basic computing node
These mutually exclusive example cluster symmetric multiprocessor relatively common
A processor processor includes multiple called core chip
This processor differs processor includes multiple issue multiple instruction per clock cycle one instruction stream thread contrast processor issue multiple instruction per clock cycle multiple instruction stream
designed use prominent processor
Each core processor potentially superscalar every clock cycle core issue multiple instruction one thread
Intel best known early form
A processor capable simultaneous multithreading includes multiple execution unit processing superscalar issue multiple instruction per clock cycle thread
hand includes single execution unit processing unit issue one instruction time thread
A symmetric multiprocessor SMP computer system multiple identical processor share memory connect via bus
prevents bus architecture scaling
As result SMPs generally comprise processor
Because small size processor significant reduction requirement bus bandwidth achieved large cache symmetric multiprocessor extremely provided sufficient amount memory bandwidth exists
A distributed computer also known distributed memory multiprocessor distributed memory computer system processing element connected network
Distributed computer highly scalable
The term distributed computing lot overlap clear distinction exists
The system may characterized parallel distributed processor typical distributed system run concurrently parallel
A cluster group loosely coupled computer work together closely respect regarded single computer
Clusters composed multiple standalone machine connected network
While machine cluster symmetric difficult
The common type cluster cluster implemented multiple identical computer connected
Beowulf technology originally developed
The vast majority supercomputer cluster
Because grid computing system described easily handle embarrassingly parallel problem modern cluster typically designed handle difficult require node share intermediate result often
This requires high bandwidth importantly interconnection network
Many historic current supercomputer use customized network hardware specifically designed cluster computing Cray Gemini network
As current supercomputer use standard network hardware often
A massively parallel processor MPP single computer many networked processor
MPPs many characteristic cluster MPPs specialized interconnect network whereas cluster use commodity hardware networking
MPPs also tend larger cluster typically far processor
In MPP CPU contains memory copy operating system application
Each subsystem communicates others via interconnect
fifth fastest world according June ranking MPP
Grid computing distributed form parallel computing
It make use computer communicating work given problem
Because low bandwidth extremely high latency available Internet distributed computing typically deal problem
created example
Most grid computing application use software sits operating system application manage network resource standardize software interface
The common distributed computing middleware BOINC
Often distributed computing software make use spare cycle performing computation time computer idling
Within parallel computing specialized parallel device remain niche area interest
While tend applicable class parallel problem
use FPGA computer
An FPGA essence computer chip rewire given task
FPGAs programmed
However programming language tedious
Several vendor created language attempt emulate syntax semantics programmer familiar
The best known C HDL language
Specific subset based also used purpose
AMD decision open technology vendor become enabling technology reconfigurable computing
According Michael Chief Operating Officer first walked AMD called u stealer
Now call u partner
computing GPGPU fairly recent trend computer engineering research
GPUs heavily optimized processing
Computer graphic processing field dominated data parallel operation
In early day GPGPU program used normal graphic APIs executing program
However several new programming language platform built general purpose computation GPUs releasing programming environment respectively
Other GPU programming language include
Nvidia also released specific product computation
The technology consortium Khronos Group released specification framework writing program execute across platform consisting CPUs GPUs
others supporting
Several ASIC approach devised dealing parallel application
Because ASIC definition specific given application fully optimized application
As result given application ASIC tends outperform computer
However ASICs created
This process requires mask set extremely expensive
A mask set cost million US dollar
The smaller transistor required chip expensive mask
Meanwhile performance increase computing time described tend wipe gain one two chip generation
High initial cost tendency overtaken computing rendered ASICs unfeasible parallel computing application
However built
One example PFLOPS machine us custom ASICs simulation
A vector processor CPU computer system execute instruction large set data
Vector processor operation work linear array number vector
An example vector operation vector number
They closely related Flynn SIMD classification
computer became famous computer
However vector CPUs full computer generally disappeared
Modern include vector processing instruction SSE
created programming parallel computer
These generally divided class based assumption make underlying memory memory distributed memory shared distributed memory
Shared memory programming language communicate manipulating shared memory variable
Distributed memory us
two widely used shared memory APIs whereas MPI widely used system API
One concept used programming parallel program one part program promise deliver required datum another part program future time
also coordinating effort make HMPP directive open standard called
The OpenHMPP programming model offer syntax efficiently offload computation hardware accelerator optimize data movement hardware memory
OpenHMPP directive describe remote procedure call RPC accelerator device
GPU generally set core
The directive annotate code describe two set functionality offloading procedure denoted codelets onto remote device optimization data transfer CPU main memory accelerator memory
The rise consumer GPUs led support either graphic APIs referred dedicated APIs language extension
Automatic parallelization sequential program parallel computing
Despite decade work compiler researcher automatic parallelization limited success
Mainstream parallel programming language remain either best programmer give compiler parallelization
A fully implicit parallel programming language Parallel
As computer system grows complexity usually decrease
technique whereby computer system take snapshot record current resource allocation variable state akin information used restore program computer fail
Application checkpointing mean program restart last checkpoint rather beginning
While checkpointing provides benefit variety situation especially useful highly parallel system large number processor used
As parallel computer become larger faster becomes feasible solve problem previously took long run
Parallel computing used wide range field economics
Common type problem found parallel computing application Parallel computing also applied design particularly via system performing operation parallel
This provides case one component fail also allows automatic result differ
These method used help prevent single event upset caused transient error
Although additional measure may required embedded specialized system method provide cost effective approach achieve redundancy commercial system
The origin true MIMD parallelism go back
In April Gill Ferranti discussed parallel programming need branching waiting
Also IBM researcher discussed use parallelism numerical calculation first time
introduced computer accessed memory module
In Amdahl Slotnick published debate feasibility parallel processing American Federation Information Processing Societies Conference
It debate coined define limit due parallelism
In company introduced first Multics system symmetric multiprocessor system capable running eight processor parallel
project among first multiprocessor processor
The first multiprocessor snooping cache
SIMD parallel computer traced back
The motivation behind early SIMD computer amortize processor multiple instruction
In Slotnick proposed building massively parallel computer
His design funded earliest SIMD effort
The key design fairly high parallelism processor allowed machine work large datasets would later known
However ILLIAC IV called infamous supercomputer project one fourth completed took year cost almost four time original estimate
When finally ready run first real application outperformed existing commercial supercomputer
In early started developing came known theory view biological brain
In Minsky published claim mind formed many little agent mindless
The theory attempt explain call intelligence could product interaction part
Minsky say biggest source idea theory came work trying create machine us robotic arm video camera computer build child block
Similar model also view biological brain massively parallel computer
brain made constellation independent agent also described

Before I explain parallel computing important understand Suppose lot work done want get done much faster hire worker
If work separate job depend take amount time easily parceled worker get done time faster
This easy called
Just embarrassing mean fact probably exactly
A different option would parallelize job discussed run parallelizations one another
However shown probably le efficient way work
Occasionally true computer job one processor may require storing many result disk parallel job may spread intermediate result RAM different processor
RAM much faster disk
However program spending lot time using disk embarrassingly parallel smart way go
Assume unless analyze situation determine
Embarrassingly parallel simple get worker free cheapest solution well
What job take widely different amount time still interaction
If enough start handing every worker one worker done come back request another
This work fairly well especially put longer job first shorter one later
This form parallelization still pretty simple unless teenager job see Do Teenagers Deserve Negative Wages
Many departmental computer one processor run fashion servicing job arrive
This also many airline run queue queuing theory known single queue multiple server system efficient multiple queue multiple server system common checkout line grocery store
Suppose instead work single job take long time
Now something reorganize job somehow breaking piece done concurrently
For example job build house broken plumbing electrical etc
However many job done time specific ordering putting foundation wall go
If worker time period waiting around task foundation finished
Not getting job done time faster
Such life parallel programmer
Definition use two processor core computer combination solve single problem
The programmer figure break problem piece figure piece relate
For example parallel program play chess might look possible first move could make
Each different first move could explored different processor see game would continue point
At end result combined figure best first move
Actually situation even complicated program looking ahead several move different start end board position
To efficient program would keep track one processor already evaluated position others would waste time duplicating effort
This must parallel system work including famous IBM machine beat Kasparov
Other parallel computer system SGI Cray system every processor directly read write data every memory location
Think like everyone using blackboard calculation everyone chalk eraser decide write anywhere board
For system standard known collection language extension Fortran
Shared memory computer must use many part support sharing hence tend expensive distributed memory system
However often easier write program shared memory system distributed memory one
Yet computer exploit graphic processor GPUs achieve parallelism
However GPU may core serious restriction programability serious performance problem much data movement
Further language use GPUs rapidly evolving unclear use CUDA OpenCL accelerator extension incorporated OpenMP etc
What doubled however number processor single chip
Some smartphones core processor buy CPU chip core number soon increase
Even Apple watch core
These called chip
There also graphic processing unit GPUs highly specialized processor
This closer Moore talking really said number transistor would keep doubling
The rate improvement slow significant increase number transistor continue least decade
If core computer pretty easy find task done simultaneously waiting keystroke running browser embarrassingly parallel
However number processor keep increasing parallelization problem mentioned become increasingly serious
There parallel computer core people planning one
Overall mean massive need make use parallelism chip almost problem use many combined together large problem

The next improvement
In multiprogramming system multiple program submitted user allowed use processor short time
To user appeared program executing time
Problems resource contention first arose system
Explicit request resource led problem
Competition resource machine instruction lead
Vector processing another attempt increase performance one thing time
In case capability added machine allow single instruction add subtract multiply otherwise manipulate two array number
This valuable certain engineering application data naturally occurred form matrix
In application le data vector processing valuable
The next step parallel processing introduction
In system two processor shared work done
The earliest version configuration
One processor master programmed responsible work system slave performed task assigned master
This arrangement necessary understood program machine could cooperate managing resource system
Solving problem led symmetric multiprocessing system
In SMP system processor equally capable responsible managing flow work system
Initially goal make SMP system appear programmer exactly single processor multiprogramming system
This standard behavior known
However engineer found system performance could increased someplace range executing instruction order requiring programmer deal increased complexity
The problem become visible two program simultaneously read write operand thus burden dealing increased complexity fall programmer specialized circumstance
The question SMP machine behave shared data yet resolved
As number processor SMP system increase time take data propagate one part system part grows also
When number processor somewhere range several dozen performance benefit adding processor system small justify additional expense
To get around problem long propagation time message passing system created
In system program share data send message announce particular operand assigned new value
Instead broadcast operand new value part system new value communicated program need know new value
Instead shared memory network support transfer message program
This simplification allows hundred even thousand processor work together efficiently one system
In vernacular system architecture system scale well
Hence system given name massively parallel processing system
The successful MPP application problem broken many separate independent operation vast quantity data
In need perform multiple search static database
In need analyze multiple alternative chess game
Often MPP system structured cluster processor
Within processor interact SMP system
It cluster message passed
Because operand may addressed either via message via memory address MPP system called machine Memory Addressing
SMP machine relatively simple program MPP machine
SMP machine well type problem providing amount data involved large

What difference term execution
I never quite able grasp distinction
The tag defines concurrency manner running two process simultaneously I thought parallelism exactly thing
separate thread process potentially run separate processor
Also consider something like asynchronous dealing concurrency parallelism
Concurrency parallelism two related distinct concept
Concurrency mean essentially task A task B need happen independently A start running B start A finished
There various different way accomplishing concurrency
One parallelism multiple CPUs working different task time
But way
Another work like Task A work certain point CPU working stop switch task B work switch back task A
If time slice small enough may appear user thing run parallel even though actually processed serial multitasking CPU
The two concept related different
mean two calculation happen within time frame usually sort dependency
mean two calculation happen simultaneously
Put boldly concurrency describes problem two thing need happen together parallelism describes solution two processor core used execute two thing simultaneously
Parallelism one way implement concurrency one
Another popular solution interleaved processing
coroutines split task atomic step switch back forth two
By far best known example concurrency JavaScript work one thread asynchronous callback wait previous chunk code finished executing
This important know guarantee function write atomic callback interrupt return
But also mean busy loop wo work ca set timeout loop fire loop prevent timeout callback executing
Concurrent execution generalized form parallel execution
For example parallel program also called concurrent reverse true
For detail read research paper Parallel processing subset concurrent processing
Concurrent processing describes two task occurring asynchronously meaning order task executed predetermined
Two thread run concurrently processor core interleaving executable instruction
For example thread run thread run etc
Parallel processing type concurrent processing one set instruction executing simultaneously
This could multiple system working common problem distributed computing multiple core system
In opinion application programming perspective difference two concept two word confusing confusion sake
I think thread interleaving brought simulate multicore processing back day multicore possibility
Why word outdated mindset
Mason Wheeler Penguin given answer
One Core task switching multicore concurrent strictly multicore parallel
My opinion two term rolled one I make effort avoid saying concurrent
I guess OS programming level distinction important application programmer perspective matter much
I written mapReduce Spark MPI cuda openCL multithreaded I never stop think job running interleaved thread multiple core
For example I write multithreaded sometimes I sure many core I get though way make demand many core get described
In spark I map reduce operation idea jvm handling hardware level
On GPUs I every thread assigned simple processor I always sync thread wherever problem might arise
With MPI communication machine specified explicitly could interleave function running multiple machine single core combine result via appropriate single threaded function
And use MPI coordinate bunch single core machine one multithreading
What difference make
I say none
Call parallel done
tdammer statement come close rest besides point
He say Put boldly concurrency describes problem two thing need happen together parallelism describes solution two processor core used execute two thing simultaneously Let analyse word
Current mean happening actual relevant moment
Con mean counter aligning
Parallel mean direction without crossing without eachother way
So concurrency implies competing resource
Parallelism
Parallel process may using resource considered problem issue
With concurrency issue dealt
Obviously term used differently different culture
My understanding following Parallelism way speed processing
Whether matrix multiplication single core multiple core even GPU outcome else program broken
It add new functionality program speed
While concurrency thing could sequentially
For example serving different webpage time client waiting next request
Though could simulate degree interleaving done elder day
Note behaviour concurrent program nondeterministic
It example clear client completly served first
You could run quite test get different result time regarding order request finished
The system guarantee client served b reasonable amount time
Usually work horse parallel computation aware care parallelism
While concurrent task often explicitly employ communication blocking queue synchronization locking mechanism

strategy system implementation new system slowly assumes role older system system operate simultaneously
This conversion take place technology old system outdated new system needed installed replace old one
After period time system proved working correctly old system removed completely user depend solely new system
The phrase parallel running refer process changing fragment business information technology operation new system technique applied human resource department existing staff stay board transition new staff
The new system need implemented built tested carrying job well according objective
This involves initial step To implement new system parallel running strategy applied new system run alongside old system specified time
Parallel running different term
There also possible strategy used implementation new system
All implementation strategy come advantage disadvantage
So depends requirement organisation choose implementation strategy want apply
During changeover new system existing system run side side agreed period time
This long enough ensure aspect new system confirmed work properly
Both input data perform
This compare prove new system
If new system accepted existing system stop running replaced new one
If old new system computerized input data held disk tape run concurrently system
If changing manual system computerized system main problem inputting data
Data need input manually may take long time
Parallel running allows result compared ensure new system working without error
If error found user refer old system resolve problem make modification new system thus operation continue old system problem sorted
This also allows training staff help gain confidence new system
The cost implementation expensive need operate two system time
It great expense term electricity operation cost
This would prohibitive large complex system
Parallel running implementation also requires lot time need frequent maintenance
This slow production firm worker need twice normal workload period time order achieve goal system
This involves inputting changing data system ensure information identical system
The practical example parallel running
New staff old staff work job
If new staff performance OK existing staff may needed replaced
Another example new firm undergos change ownership want recruit new staff operate firm
Making change cause problem new staff know basic operation
For reason firm keep existing staff board specified time normal job new staff shadow get experience require
Once result new staff match result existing staff term productivity operational job existing staff let go
Many business firm use strategy parallel running way ensure computer software capable task designed
The old software new software receive input business firm
The output software program compared period time make sure transition new system completely fault free
Another example publishing firm producing textbook
They decide run account part business investing new computerized system
The existing account system outdated suitable use new hardware
The new system implemented using parallel running strategy account invoice handled new old system
If new system function correctly data old system used
However everything need done twice slow account department cost money hiring staff
This system safe new system precisely tested every transaction compared result old system
It also applied using new computerized system create brief reference record generate order maintaining old manual system final financial control new system confirmed function correctly
After implementing new system come review phase normally take place three six review conducted Other Parallel Running pilot running
old system completely removed immediately replaced new option risky may still problem new system
It cheapest simplest form changeover something go wrong user fall back old system
The staff must fully trained advance file must input new system go live
In system introduced gradually
Parts old system replaced remaining part still running old system
As example school introducing Management Information System aspect school operation
It could introduce enrolment system four month later examination system four month timetabling system
As new module activated confirmed functioning correctly next module installed
It likely module work
For example timetable module assume student data order introduced must considered
new system installed small number user test evaluate new system
The new system implemented user considered fully tested able function correctly
The test user assist training others use new system
This implementation strategy useful system large number user ensure user use system effectively
Implementation computerized system manual system cause restructuring within organisation
People position status may change
These change alter people awareness employment security authority interaction staff
People refuse change new computer system may related inability system specific job requirement security aspect possible loss data concern making mistake using system effect health
Likewise computerized system affect manager term management role decision making process
Systems user friendly often meet le refusal user feel comfortable system sense control able evaluate stored input data
The system also sufficiently adaptable suit different background proficiency level user
Overcoming refusal change adoption new system management issue
This may influenced attitude towards system knowledge interaction
Thus communication skill required convince people benefit new system
People given opportunity learn evaluate system
Once seen experienced benefit new system ready accept run system The success system implementation affected way system operated
Thus education training using system carried various level considering size complexity system
Staff personal need informed overall information structure operate system
This give overall understanding system place information handled throughout organisation

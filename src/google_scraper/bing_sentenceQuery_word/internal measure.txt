Something I puzzled exactly computer regulate tell time
For example I write program Do wait second How processor know second
How time measured computer system
Is specific chip sole purpose
How work
Thanks reply I really interested computer science would love help could give
IIRC small crystal vibrates specific frequency electric current passed
Each movement counted specific number trigger clock cycle
While Joel answer correct reality bit complicated
First thing need taken consideration I going focus PCs several clock computer use
Most popular easiest understand
It basically chip simple clock inside
They usually type quartz crystal standard clock usually battery time keeping computer powered
The problem accurate seen Syntech link
The kHz crystal slow timekeeping modern system whose processor megahertz gigahertz range
Here come next point There internal clock used precise time measurement countdown
A simple clock
What wait certain amount time send interrupt CPU
When CPU receives interrupt stop whatever tend task generated interrupt
This way CPU constantly check something done
Instead focus job PIT tell job done
The PIT us MHz clock source therefore much precise simple RTC
Next interesting measurement system
The idea behind get much precise measurement time using processor clock source using various system timer
PIT MHz clock even earliest processor much higher clock
So timer updated every set amount processor cycle
At time processor stable clock use TSC nice way make precise time measurement
Use TSC however brings number problem
Different processor different tick rate measure time different speed
Later techniology advanced got modern processor change frequency
That major problem sicen CPU clock constant anymore ca use measure time
And
HPET us MHz clock therefore precise PIT
On hand clock source depend CPU clock used measure time even CPU clock change
Unlike PIT work countdown HPET measure time since computer turned compare current time time action needed
There time source available computer I believe need mentioned
Some computer connected atomic clock use precisely measure time
A le expensive option much common use external time source calibrate internal time source computer
For example GPS receiver used provide high precision time measurement GPS satellite internal atomic clock
Another option le common GPS receiver use special radio receiver decodes time information time keeping radio station example
Such time station high precision time source transmit output radio
Since radio wave travel speed light delay often insignificant
HPET us MHz clock HPET us Mhz clock
It precise Mhz never le

The performance CPU affected number core clock speed memory
There different type volatile memory
Computers require input hardware processing hardware output hardware
The hardware defines computer
Without computer could function
The CPU memory work together run program
You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
Most computer CPU separate graphic processing unit GPU image
The GPU around time faster CPU
It optimised produce graphic game film
The GPU responsible handling image free CPU task
CPU memory speed affect overall speed computer
If one significantly slower slow others
test used ass performance computer

Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville shown
It perform trillion calculation per second
That ability help run computer model complex dynamic system Earth changing climate
Computers use math data computer instruction create representation event
They also predict happening could happen complex situation climate system spread rumor throughout town
And computer spit result without people wait year take big risk
The scientist build computer model start important feature whatever event hope represent
Those feature may weight football someone kick
Or might degree cloud cover typical region seasonal climate
Features change vary known
Next computer modeler identify rule control feature relationship
The researcher express rule math
The math built model rather simple mostly addition subtraction multiplication logarithm note Jon Lizaso
He work Technical University Madrid Spain
Logarithms express number power number help simplify calculation working big number
Even still much work one person
We talking probably thousand equation explains
mathematical expression use number relate two thing equal
But usually look complicated x z Solving even equation might take whole day rate one equation every second
And single mistake might throw answer way
More difficult math might bump time needed solve equation average minute
At rate solving equation could take nearly three week took time eat sleep
And one mistake might throw everything
In contrast common laptop computer perform billion operation per second
And one second Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory Tennessee trillion calculation
How much trillion
That many second would come million year
A computer model also need algorithm data
set instruction
They tell computer make decision calculation
Data fact statistic something
With calculation computer model make prediction specific situation
For instance might show simulate result particular football player kick
Computer model also deal dynamic situation changing variable
For example likely rain Friday
A weather model would run calculation changing factor one one various combination
After would compare finding run
After adjusting likely factor would issue prediction
The model would also rerun calculation Friday got closer
To measure model reliability scientist might computer run calculation thousand even million time
Researchers also could compare model prediction answer already know
If prediction closely match answer good sign
If researcher must work find missed
It could include enough variable relied much wrong one
Computer modeling deal
Scientists always learning experiment event real world
Researchers use knowledge improve computer model
The better computer model useful become
A group rule procedure solving problem series step
Algorithms used mathematics computer program figuring solution
The weather condition prevailing area general long period
An electronic device process information based rule stored device
A program run computer creates model simulation feature phenomenon event
A set instruction computer us perform analysis computation
The writing instruction known Facts statistic collected together analysis necessarily organized way give meaning
For digital information type stored computer data typically number stored binary code portrayed string zero one
In mathematics statement two quantity equal
In geometry equation often used determine shape curve surface
The power exponent one base number must multiplied produce another number
For instance base system must multiplied produce
So logarithm base system
In base logarithm would would
computing To try imitate condition function appearance something
Computer program referred
mathematics A letter used mathematical expression may take one different value
experiment A factor changed especially one allowed change scientific experiment
For instance measuring much insecticide might take kill fly researcher might change dose age insect exposed
Both dose age would variable experiment
Being almost like something
An object concept virtually real would almost true real quite
The term often used refer something modeled accomplished computer using number using part
So virtual motor would one could seen computer screen tested computer programming device made metal

learn share knowledge build career
I recently started course data compression university
However I find use term entropy applies computer science rather ambiguous
As far I tell roughly translates randomness system structure
What proper definition computer science entropy
Entropy mean different thing In computing entropy randomness collected operating system application use cryptography us require random data
This randomness often collected hardware source either one mouse movement specially provided randomness generator
In information theory entropy measure uncertainty associated random variable
The term context usually refers Shannon entropy quantifies sense expected value information contained message usually unit bit
Equivalently Shannon entropy measure average information content one missing one know value random variable Entropy data compression may denote randomness data inputing compression algorithm
The entropy lesser compression ratio
That mean random text lesser compress
Shannon entropy represents absolute limit best possible lossless compression communication treating message encoded sequence independent random variable Shannon source coding theorem show limit average length shortest possible representation encode message given alphabet entropy divided logarithm number symbol target alphabet
My favorite definition practical focus found Chapter excellent book Andrew Hunt David Thomas While software development immune almost physical law entropy hit u hard
Entropy term physic refers amount disorder system
Unfortunately law thermodynamics guarantee entropy universe tends toward maximum
When disorder increase software programmer call software rot
There many factor contribute software rot
The important one seems psychology culture work project
Even team one project psychology delicate thing
Despite best laid plan best people project still experience ruin decay lifetime
Yet project despite enormous difficulty constant setback successfully fight tendency toward disorder manage come pretty well
One broken window left unrepaired substantial length time instills inhabitant building sense sense power care building
So another window get broken
People start littering
Graffiti appears
Serious structural damage begin
In relatively short space time building becomes damaged beyond owner desire fix sense abandonment becomes reality
The Broken Window Theory inspired police department New York major city crack small stuff order keep big stuff
It work keeping top broken window graffiti small infraction reduced serious crime level
Tip Do Live Broken Windows Do leave broken window bad design wrong decision poor code unrepaired
Fix one soon discovered
If insufficient time fix properly board
Perhaps comment offending code display Not Implemented message substitute dummy data instead
Take action prevent damage show top situation
Text taken I always encountered entropy sense Shannon Entropy
From In information theory entropy measure uncertainty associated random variable
The term context usually refers Shannon entropy quantifies sense expected value information contained message usually unit bit
Equivalently Shannon entropy measure average information content one missing one know value random variable
The information theoretic notion Entropy generalization physical notion
There many way describe Entropy
It measure randomness random variable
It also measure amount information random variable stochastic process contains
It also lower bound amount message compressed
And finally average number question need asked random entity determine value
Equation Entropy sample application probability calculation sum value rv probability value time log prob
p x logp x
This equation derived first principle property information
In term compression information theory entropy source average amount information bit symbol source convey
Informally speaking unlikely symbol surprise appearance brings
If source two symbol say equally likely symbol conveys amount information one bit
A source four equally likely symbol conveys two bit per symbol
For interesting example source three symbol first two twice likely third third surprising also le likely
There net entropy source calculated
You calculate entropy average surprise surprise symbol probability time negative binary log probability The negative binary log used course log value exclusive negative
The word entropy defined one sentence Imagine example expansion universe From beginning matter collected small point big bang could described system matter within one point
While today significantly information required describe system Universe one would need describe planetary position movement
In term information theory definition also work The letter add password system information needed describe password
Then measure different unit eg bit character like hello character entropy bit entropy charsize bit
From also come information way arrange information
If bit different way arranged
If talking password possible arrangement information bit longer going take cracking brute force dictionary attack
Here great alternate explanation information theory
Entropy measure
We also describe entropy would get outcome made initial prediction
Lets say bent coin give u head time tail time
Since one percent chance getting tail would surprised actually get tail
On hand wo surprising got head already percent chance getting head
let assume function called would give u amount surprise outcome average amount surprise probability distribution
This average amount surprise could also used measure uncertain
This uncertainty called
Entropy like hash code virus researcher well
Less entropy get would mean likely encrypted compressed code could potentially virus
A standard binary would higher entropy compressed encrypted one
Entropy many meaning typically Computer Science
It depends context
In security entropy mean much randomality place instance generate private key many application ask move mouse around generate entropy
This generates entropy taking human element randomality add hashing process generating key
Now also defnition software engineering entropy
This definition represents date code code many developer writing
Typically used reference near time refactor software project
The code project enourmous amount entropy many individual maintained project currently
Here third example usage I remembered
In topic simulated annealing far computer science concerned entropy described much decay happened evaluation algorithm
I guess answer question though concrete definition word except one find dictionary
How computer science tends apply term depends context term used applied
It easy make big deal entropy
To mind pretty
Basically quantifies average learn event like flipping coin taking branch instruction indexing array
Like comparison operation middle search algorithm certain probability P taking one branch taking
Suppose P binary search
Then take branch know bit log base
On hand take branch also learn bit
To get average amount information learn multiply learn first branch time probability take branch plus learn second branch time probability branch
time bit plus time bit bit plus bit total bit entropy
That expect learn average decision
On hand suppose linear search table entry
On first test probability YES entropy YES decision bit
So answer YES learn bit chance thousand
On hand NO much likely
It entropy roughly time roughly zero zero
Add two together average learn bit decision
That linear search slow
The entropy much expect learn decision small since going learn bit find entry table
Entropy computer science commonly refers random string bit
The following question making precise In simpler word Entropy defines randomness
like unpredictable something
In technical word computing entropy randomness collected operating system application use cryptography us require random data
This randomness often collected hardware source either one mouse movement specially provided randomness defined wikipedia
One easily conclude meaning entropy respect file measurement much disordered byte file
There various unit used defining entropy like nat shannon hartley
Well common unit used Shannon
The range value entropy must come per algorithm
So entropy value zero one say outcome certain
On contrary entropy value outcome unpredictable could
The formula given Shannon measure randomness outcome event event probability
This equation always result
For information go link In simple word know probability symbol langauge one compute average information content symbol language
Or The entropy language measure information content average symbol language Consider fair coin There two symbol probability entropy calculated h entropy refers extent software reshaped occasionally basing customer requirement hence cost reshaping meet customer reqrments becomes maximum
I heard people misuse thermodynamic definition entropy CS

Entropy definitely increasing system
When mean code getting worse worse

protection theft damage well service provide
Cyber security includes controlling physical access hardware well protecting harm may come via network access data code injection
Also due operator whether accidental security susceptible deviating secure procedure various method
The field growing importance due increasing reliance computer system growth including tiny device part Internet Things
A vulnerability weakness design implementation operation internal control
Most vulnerability discovered documented CVE database
An vulnerability one least one working attack exists
Vulnerabilities often hunted exploited aid manually using customized script
To secure computer system important understand attack made typically classified one category A computer system algorithm secret method bypassing normal authentication security control
They may exist number reason including original design poor configuration
They may added authorized party allow legitimate access attacker malicious reason regardless motif existence create vulnerability
DoS designed make machine network resource unavailable intended user
Attackers deny service individual victim deliberately entering wrong password enough consecutive time cause victim account locked may overload capability machine network block user
While network attack single IP address blocked adding new firewall rule many form DDoS attack possible attack come large number point defending much difficult
Such attack originate range technique possible including innocent system fooled sending traffic victim
An unauthorized user gaining physical access computer likely able directly copy data
They may also compromise security making modification installing software using wireless mouse
Even system protected standard security measure may able booting another operating system tool bootable medium
designed prevent attack
act surreptitiously listening private conversation typically host network
For instance program used eavesdrop system
Even machine operate closed system contact outside world eavesdropped upon via monitoring faint transmission generated hardware specification NSA referring attack
act masquerading valid entity falsification data username order gain access information resource one otherwise unauthorized obtain
There several type spoofing including describes malicious modification product
security service planting surveillance capability router example
describes situation attacker level restricted access able without authorization elevate privilege access level
For example standard computer user may able fool system giving access restricted data even full unrestricted access system
attempt acquire sensitive information usernames password credit card detail directly user
Phishing typically carried often directs user enter detail fake website whose look feel almost identical legitimate one
Preying victim trust phishing classified form
also known UI redress attack User Interface redress attack malicious technique attacker trick user clicking button link another webpage user intended click top level page
This done using multiple transparent opaque layer
The attacker basically click meant top level page routing irrelevant page likely owned someone else
A similar technique used hijack keystroke
Carefully drafting combination stylesheets iframes button text box user led believing typing password information authentic webpage channeled invisible frame controlled attacker
aim convince user disclose secret password card number etc
example impersonating bank contractor customer
A common scam involves fake CEO email sent accounting finance department
In early reported scam cost US business two year
In May team victim type cyber scam perpetrator impersonating team president resulting handover team employee tax form
Employee behavior big impact information security organization
Cultural concept help different segment organization work effectively work effectiveness towards information security within Relationship Organizational Culture Information Security provides following definition information security culture totality pattern behavior organization contribute protection information Andersson Reimers found employee often see part organization Information Security effort often take action ignore organizational Information Security best interest
Research show Information security culture need improved continuously
In Security Culture Analysis author commented never ending process cycle evaluation change To manage information security culture five step taken strategic planning operative planning implementation
The growth number computer system increasing reliance upon individual business industry government mean increasing number system risk
The computer system financial regulator financial institution like SWIFT investment bank commercial bank prominent hacking target cybercriminals interested manipulating market making illicit gain
Web site apps accept store brokerage account information also prominent hacking target potential immediate financial gain transferring money making purchase selling information
payment system also tampered order gather customer account data
Computers control function many utility including coordination valve opening closing water gas network
The Internet potential attack vector machine connected worm demonstrated even equipment controlled computer connected Internet vulnerable
In division investigated hacking incident energy company
Vulnerabilities many use local radio cellular communication cause problem billing fraud
The industry reliant series complex system could attacked
A simple power outage one airport cause repercussion worldwide much system relies radio transmission could disrupted controlling aircraft ocean especially dangerous radar surveillance extends mile offshore
There also potential attack within aircraft
In Europe NewPENS US NextGen program moving create dedicated network
The consequence successful attack range loss confidentiality loss system integrity outage loss aircraft even loss life
Desktop computer laptop commonly targeted gather password financial account information construct attack another target
device like sensor camera microphone GPS receiver compass could exploited may collect personal information including sensitive health information
Wifi Bluetooth cell phone network device could used attack vector sensor might remotely activated successful breach
The increasing number device also potential target
Large corporation common target
In many case aimed financial gain identity theft involves loss million client credit card detail recent breach
Some cyberattacks ordered foreign government government engage intent spread propaganda sabotage spy target
Many people believe Russian government played major role US presidential election using Twitter Facebook affect result election whether true ultimately determined congress
Medical record targeted use general identify theft health insurance fraud impersonating patient obtain prescription drug recreational purpose resale
Although cyber threat continue increase organization increase security training business
Not attack financially motivated however example security firm suffered serious series attack group retaliation firm CEO claiming infiltrated group motive appears embarrass data leak cripple company wiping workstation server
Vehicles increasingly computerized engine timing seat belt tensioners door lock many model
Additionally may use bluetooth communicate onboard consumer device cell phone network
expected even complex
All system carry security risk issue gained wide attention
Simple example risk include malicious used attack vector car onboard microphone used eavesdropping
However access gained car internal danger much greater widely publicised test hacker remotely carjacked vehicle mile away drove ditch
Manufacturers reacting number way pushing security fix air car computer system
In area autonomous vehicle September announced initial safety standard called state come uniform policy
Government computer system commonly attacked activist foreign power
Local regional government infrastructure control police intelligence agency communication student record financial system also potential target largely computerized
government control access facility use vulnerable
The IoT network physical object device vehicle building enables collect exchange data concern raised developed without appropriate consideration security challenge involved
While IoT creates opportunity direct integration physical world system also provides opportunity misuse
In particular Internet Things spread widely cyber attack likely become increasingly physical rather simply virtual threat
If front door lock connected Internet phone criminal could enter home press button stolen hacked phone
People could stand lose much credit card number world controlled device
Thieves also used electronic mean circumvent hotel door lock
either successfully attacked potentially deadly vulnerability demonstrated including diagnostic equipment implanted device including
There many report hospital hospital organization getting hacked including attack exploit virus sensitive data stored hospital server
On December US released recommendation medical maintain security device structure enforcement
Serious financial damage caused standard model estimating cost incident data available made public organization involved
Several computer security consulting firm produce estimate total worldwide loss attributable attack hostile digital act general
The loss estimate firm range billion worm virus billion form covert attack
The reliability estimate often challenged underlying methodology basically anecdotal
Security breach continue cost business billion dollar survey revealed security staff believe senior leadership take cyber precaution strategic priority
However reasonable estimate financial cost security breach actually help organization make rational investment decision
According classic analyzing optimal investment level information security one conclude amount firm spends protect information generally small fraction expected loss loss resulting
As motivation breach computer security vary attacker
Some activist others criminal looking financial gain
attacker common well resourced started amateur hacked recounted
A standard part particular system identify might motivate attack system might motivated breach
The level detail precaution vary depending system secured
A home military face different threat even underlying technology use similar
In computer security countermeasure action device procedure technique reduces eliminating preventing minimizing harm cause discovering reporting corrective action taken
End user security habit
Reimers Andersson conducted number study end user security habit found type repeated security best practice marked effect perception compliance good end user network security habit especially concerning malware ransomeware
Some common countermeasure listed following section alternately secure design mean software designed ground secure
In case security considered main feature
Some technique approach include The Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture design describe security control security countermeasure positioned relate overall
These control serve purpose maintain system quality attribute confidentiality integrity availability accountability
Techopedia defines security architecture unified security design address necessity potential risk involved certain scenario environment
It also specifies apply security control
The design process generally reproducible
The key attribute security architecture A state computer security conceptual ideal attained use three process threat prevention detection response
These process based various policy system component include following Today computer security comprises mainly preventive measure like firewall
A firewall defined way filtering network data host network another network implemented software running machine hooking case operating system built operating system provide real time filtering blocking
Another implementation physical firewall consists separate machine filtering network traffic
Firewalls common amongst machine permanently connected
Some organization turning platform extend data accessibility detect
However relatively organisation maintain computer system effective detection system fewer still organised response mechanism place
As result Reuters point Companies first time report losing electronic theft data physical stealing asset
The primary obstacle effective eradication cyber crime could traced excessive reliance firewall automated detection system
Yet basic evidence gathering using put criminal behind bar
Vulnerability management cycle identifying remediating mitigating especially
Vulnerability management integral computer security
Vulnerabilities discovered analyzes computer system search known vulnerability insecure software configuration susceptibility Beyond vulnerability scanning many organisation contract outside security auditor run regular system identify vulnerability
In sector contractual requirement
While correctness computer system possible yet common
Operating system formally verified include make small percentage market
properly implemented virtually impossible directly break
Breaking requires input stolen key stolen plaintext either end transmission extra cryptanalytic information
method mitigating unauthorized access system sensitive information
It requires something know password PIN something card dongle cellphone piece hardware
This increase security unauthorized person need gain access
The tight security measure le unauthorized hack
Social engineering direct computer access physical attack prevented mean difficult enforce relative sensitivity information
Training often involved help mitigate risk even highly disciplined environment
military organization social engineering attack still difficult foresee prevent
Enoculation derived seek prevent social engineering fraudulent trick trap instilling resistance persuasion attempt exposure similar related attempt
It possible reduce attacker chance keeping system date security patch update using security scanner hiring competent people responsible security
The effect data reduced careful
While hardware may source insecurity microchip vulnerability maliciously introduced manufacturing process assisted computer security also offer alternative computer security
Using device method case drive lock disabling USB port access may considered secure due physical access sophisticated required order compromised
Each covered detail
One use term computer security refers technology used implement secure
In DoD used standard current international standard defines number progressively stringent
Many common operating system meet standard Methodically Designed Tested Reviewed required highest level mean uncommon
An example Semiformally Verified Design Tested system used several military jet
In software engineering aim guard accidental introduction security vulnerability
It also possible create software designed ground secure
Such system
Beyond aim prove underlying system important example
Within computer system two many capable enforcing privilege separation ACLs
Using ACLs confine program proven insecure many situation host computer tricked indirectly allowing restricted file access issue known
It also shown promise ACLs giving access object one person never guaranteed practice
Both problem resolved capability
This mean practical flaw exist system designer certain utility must take responsibility ensure introduce flaw
Capabilities mostly restricted research commercial OSs still use ACLs
Capabilities however also implemented language level leading style programming essentially refinement standard design
An open source project area
The secure computer connected Internet shielded interference
In real world secure system
Responding forcefully attempted manner one would attempted physical security breach often difficult variety reason Some illustrative example different type computer security breach given

In early American apparel home good company announced victim hacker accessed system stored data merchandise return transaction
The computer worm known reportedly ruined almost Iran disrupting industrial PLCs targeted attack generally believed launched Israel United States although neither publicly admitted
In early document provided published exposing massive scale global surveillance
It also revealed NSA deliberately inserted backdoor standard encryption tapped link data centre
In hacking ring known Rescator broke computer stealing roughly million credit card computer stealing million credit card number
Warnings delivered corporation ignored physical security breach using believed played large role
The malware utilized absolutely unsophisticated uninteresting say Jim Walter director threat intelligence operation security technology company McAfee meaning heist could easily stopped existing administrator responded warning
The size theft resulted major attention state Federal United States authority investigation ongoing
In April year earlier data breach resulting theft approximately million personnel record handled office
The Office Personnel Management hack described federal official among largest breach government data history United States
Data targeted breach included name date place birth address fingerprint current former government employee well anyone undergone government background check
It believed hack perpetrated Chinese hacker motivation remains unclear
In July hacker group known The Impact Team successfully breached extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison
The group claimed taken company data user data well
After breach The Impact Team dumped email company CEO prove point threatened dump customer data unless website taken permanently
With initial data release group stated instructed take Ashley Madison Established Men offline permanently form release customer record including profile customer secret sexual fantasy matching credit card transaction real name address employee document email
The website may stay online
When Avid Life Media parent company created Ashley Madison website take site offline The Impact Group released two compressed file one second
After second data dump Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman resigned website remained functional
Conflict law cyberspace become major cause concern computer security community
Some main challenge complaint antivirus industry lack global web regulation global base common rule judge eventually punish cyber criminal
There global cyber law cyber security treaty invoked enforcing global cyber security issue
International legal issue cyber attack complicated nature
Even antivirus firm locates cybercriminal behind creation particular piece form often local authority take action due lack law prosecute
Authorship attribution cyber crime cyber attack major problem law enforcement agency
Computer virus switch one country another one jurisdiction another moving around world using fact capability globally police operation like
So Internet someone given free plane ticket online criminal world
Use added complexity situation
The role government make force company organization protect system infrastructure information also protect national infrastructure national
The question whether government intervene regulation polemical one
Indeed long existed definition cyberspace free government intervention
Where everyone agrees improvement cyber security vital government best actor solve issue
Many government official expert think government step crucial need regulation mainly due failure private sector solve efficiently cybersecurity problem
said panel discussion belief industry responds threaten regulation
If industry respond threat follow
On hand executive private sector agree improvement necessary think government intervention would affect ability innovate efficiently

I googled lot I find exact straight forward answer example
Any example would helpful
The primary key unique key table choose best uniquely identifies record table
All table primary key ever need update delete record need know uniquely identify
A surrogate key artificially generated key
They useful record essentially natural key table since possible two people born date name record log since possible two event happen carry timestamp
Most often see implemented integer automatically incrementing field GUIDs generated automatically record
ID number almost always surrogate key
Unlike primary key table need surrogate key however
If table list state America really need ID number
You could use state abbreviation primary key code
The main advantage surrogate key easy guarantee unique
The main disadvantage meaning
There meaning Wisconsin example see State column Address table know state talking without needing look state State table
A made value sole purpose uniquely identifying row
Usually represented auto incrementing ID
Example code A identifying column set column table
Can surrogate key unique combination column example compound key
MUST unique row
Example code All key identifier used surrogate thing identify
explained concept surrogate follows Database user may cause system generate delete surrogate control value value ever displayed
This commonly referred surrogate key
The definition immediately problematic however Codd assuming feature would provided DBMS
DBMSs general feature
The key normally visible least DBMS user obvious reason
The concept surrogate therefore morphed slightly usage
The term generally used data management profession mean key exposed used identifier
Note essentially unrelated key generated artificial perceived
All key consist symbol invented human machine
The possible significance term surrogate therefore relates key used created value
Extending database relational model capture meaning This great treatment describing various kind key A surrogate key typically numeric value
Within SQL Server Microsoft allows define column identity property help generate surrogate key value
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies record database table
Primary key must contain UNIQUE value
A primary key column contain NULL value
Most table primary key table ONE primary key
I think Michelle Poolet describes clear way A surrogate key artificially produced value often incrementing counter whose value range n n represents table maximum number row
In SQL Server create surrogate key assigning identity property column number data type
It usually help use surrogate key change composite key identity column

For example Is legit Data Warehouse table
A table many key need
Usually surrogate key used mean also want alternative key well variously called domain key natural key business key
The practice designating one key primary great significance
It simply convention mark one key preferred important way meaning database user
Typically primary key one referenced foreign key constraint table
It depends purpose key
Surrogate key mean different thing different people mind mean candidate key field combination field uniquely identify record primary key
For example social security number may surrogate key customer good one mind
If value alphanumeric example probably business key
If warehouse user likely need key sure include
On fact table several key unusually wide consider flaking keep fact table narrow
If synthetic key key created use warehouse avoid many problem associated business key sure include
Indeed may well key

Data warehouse typically use surrogate also known artificial identity key key dimension table primary key
They use Infa sequence generator Oracle sequence SQL Server Identity value surrogate key

Customer Number Customer table change make update difficult
Some table column stated primary key according business user change indexing numerical value probably better could consider creating surrogate key called say
This would internal system far client concerned may display
Another benefit get surrogate key SID Tracking SCD Slowly Changing Dimension
Let give simple classical example On January Employee belongs Business Unit would Employee Dimension
This employee turnover allocated Business Unit But June Employee muted Business Unit Business Unit
The entire new turnover belong new Business Unit old one belong Business Unit
If used natural business key employee within datawarehouse everything would allocated Business Unit even actually belongs
If use surrogate key could create June new record Employee Employee Dimension new surrogate key
This way fact table old data June SID Employee
All new data June would take SID employee
You could consider Slowly Changing Dimension enlargement natural key natural key Employee Employee Code becomes Employee Code Business Unit
But difference natural key enlargement process might part new key within fact table might able join new enlarge key need another id

We say Surrogate key User defined primary Was answer useful
I think already enough statement surrogate key
From experience huge advantage Our warehouse captured data existing system identified SALES unique number
We implemented Natural Business Key also generated unique Surrogate key
Seems pointless incoming business key numeric already
But
Six month project user announced feeder system would replaced two SALES system would run parallel year
Our existing system numeric natural key new system unique ID character field
We simply added character field existing dimension ETL looked using appropriate key existing system key new replacement ID
Either way matched converted source system independent surrogate key
No fuss
It worked
Surrogate key importance proven
So little room confusion Dimension SALESMAN Number null Primary Key Number Legacy system business key varchar New system business key Other attribute

submitted Hello
Earlier today I asked teacher Database design used auto incremented integer primary key surrogate key course
I done decent amount development first course database I naturally influenced le optimal design choice self taught
His response think surrogate key harmful avoided much possible came pretty big shock seing every I write always used surrogate key
His selling point using natural key key attribute business logic part adding surrogate introduces data increase number join required find data
We time talk long argument might brought
This sparked interest I started reading internet
Overall general opinion seems advocate using surrogate key smaller number people argue PKs natural attribute chosen already kind identifier part number social security number
I find material advocating usage natural key
The requirement primary key As might guessed teacher succeed convincing natural key way go I would even say I think good idea use natural key case might seem make sense like social security number part number
I see several problem natural key far outweigh pro
A natural key duplicated many place since involves business logic real chance change value time mean updated every single place used reference cascading update take care problem
I like relying user key even though database validate uniqueness constraint
My main point ever I really think natural key stable enough used safely
So opinion
Do know material advocating natural key
TL DR Surrogate Natural key
Post comment
This discussed heavily
I know much already researched link
There terrifying amount information asserted thread without single bit hard evidence back I beg research heavily making decision including natural key preference
To answer question like everyone else said depends
I personally go natural key wherever possible A lot subjective modern database really make either advantageous right silver bullet
Do research understand problem domain worry rest model first
People keep saying oh no SSN unique
Great throwing surrogate ID solved problem unless problem needed use FK I highly doubt
If answer constitutes unique row really take step back work domain problem actually trying solve application constitutes uniqueness
If answer constitutes unique row really take step back Yes
We able identify natural key every table probably put uniqueness constraint
And separately decide whether introduce surrogate key reason
Thanks input
I time read material yet I impression moderate approach picking best tool job superior method
However I still trouble coming example natural key minimal stable surrogate key always
I understand need secondary key choose use surrogate key I feel like would make sense use composite key many case single attribute rarely seems candidate key stable
Damn I wish top post
That last paragraph gold
I done lot lot work database payroll benefit tax across interconnected system
With metric assload record
Like million constitutes unique row context quite often problem domain solved poorly I seen many solution simple elegant wrong
Okay smartypants
What natural key blog post
Yes using autoincrement column index country silly
But idea always even often natural key data sillier
It really depends domain many table many application written today surrogate key reasonable choice
You need hostile
What natural key blog post
The natural key blog post commonly slug without seeing data want capture inside blog I ca answer question
Is single user
Single blog multiple blog
There many question need answered first
Using autoincrement column index country silly
Not inherently least different ISO standard storing country
ISO code stable long period time historic country longer exist want capture maybe choice invent identifier
The ISO code much different surrogate key defined external entity
Again depends problem domain requires
idea always even often natural key data sillier
It really depends domain many table many application written today surrogate key reasonable choice
Prove convinced yet convince
What user time
Should user allowed two post time
I claim definitely
Think What time
Is simply time post made never changed
Or carry meaning
In CMS software change published time example might entering post previously made old version software might entering post appear future
In case I think make perfect sense allow duplicate post time
If hand want enforce unique time I see different simply making time column integer ID
Except complex larger column
Okay user able two post time I guess key user time body
It reasonable allow two post identical content key absolutely monstrous
Just think foreign key going like
I would question duplicate post time lose ability deterministic ordering post
Note relying field purpose capturing ordering form time field
Time need UTC UNIX epoch many definition time
But still I think would warrant post time said choice make understand problem trying solve
If hand want enforce unique time I see different simply making time column integer ID
Except complex larger column
Ok traded complex larger column dubious problem first place another column leading larger storage thus larger backup potentially index large semantic model understand
I convinced trade worth
DB application developer year experience
I find academic tend advocate natural key professional developer tend use surrogate key
Why
Are academic smarter professional
No I think reason natural key seem like great idea theory theory fall apart confronted reality messiness data situation
I sure already come across example problem research
My advice surrogate key opposite umlcat
At least SQL Server integer IDENTITY column never return duplicate key even highly concurrent environment
Their monotonically increasing nature make ideally suited table clustered index new value always appended end table disk never inserted middle previously allocated page could result cascade page swapping
Integer surrogate key byte wide mean index entry per page compared compound natural key turn mean le turn mean higher performance
If absolutely must generate key value client highly concurrent scenario probably use GUIDs big integer cause system performance suffer somewhat
You also need prepared handle unlikely possibility collision
Also unless client generate sequential GUIDs may see lot disk inserting new row result needing swap data page
The problem using GUIDs key amplified even using natural key tend wide compared integer often little chance entered sequentially often higher chance collision
Depending choice ORM DB tool may find natural composite key well supported supported
compared integer key
I find irritating case composite key comprised multiple surrogate key actually best design
So bringing point I mean defend tool moronic limitation
However acknowledged exist might even forced use one
Tool support matter
Natural key nice make sense domain mentioned tooling probably main thing holding back
If using composite key easy using surrogate key I would use
Another thing Agile development DB undergo significant change simply easier deal surrogate
Yep good point
It much easier manage schema change surrogate key
Surrogate key encourage bad relational design
If aware fact disciplined mitigate risk
Also think data used natural key helpful organizing data index overhead minimized maximizing use get index
subset index cardinality consideration like
Again little thought go long way area even use surrogate key
Natural key useful larger complex structure identifying data tends passed around allowing forego join occasion
The main argument natural key applicable ORMs make using natural key hard work shame ORMs natural key
I tend use natural key unless I using framework take care database
I believe could give example
A mistake dev team made past Polymorphic Associations antipattern Having foreign key point different table based sort flag
I going blame surrogate key I pretty sure pattern impossible natural key
I tend favor surrogate key primary key let use example social security number There also advantage letting database pick key
If scenario record written together short period time accessed together greatly increase chance DB engine wo load bunch page disk
There also advantage letting database pick key
If scenario record written together short period time accessed together greatly increase chance DB engine wo load bunch page disk
Arguments like really tricky justify
While yes make measurable improvement right guarantee remain optimal advantageous future
One main point relational database logical separation start bringing physical model limit amount productivity separation give
However modelling way often mean sacrifice trade trust thing get better future
It difficult one
While yes make measurable improvement right guarantee remain optimal advantageous future I never understood decision database maintainer expected make
The database fully capable comprehending used time become confident efficient layout data changing layout advantageous
Keeping query count analyzing variance column used table joined etc time restructuring thing perform efficiently real use scenario production system mean unsolvable problem
Amen keep building database clean logical separation never truly get
But getting slowly
I tend favor surrogate key primary key let use example social security number The property list simply prove SSNs primary key
How many natural key actually true primary key
There many many property seem like primary key turn
And one really primary key like part number probably made arbitrarily assigned way surrogate key
This exactly I feeling
almost minimal stable primary key natural
I understand could solve using composite key would mean reference would key well increase complexity
My preference would use natural key natural key good enough
SSN perfect example natural key good enough reason ergane unique incomplete coverage security concern
The reason adding unnecessary surrogate key increase redundancy database pointlessly
If surrogate key candidate natural key table duplicating function particular benefit
Someone coming fresh database might reasonably ask I use
Why store
Having said I would say database system I designed built number table candidate natural key significantly outnumbered perhaps ratio
Clearly latter case one must use surrogate key
So philosophy keep database minimal
Use natural key
If natural key seems dodgy reason go surrogate instead
Also sweat much
I err side surrogate key case
Your intuition social security number correct
If chosen use SSN key creek without paddle
The possibility mentioned updating natural key cascading update reference bad special use case avoided
Join table however one example composite key sufficient surrogate key necessary
Whether component composite natural surrogate however immaterial
Keep mind nothing stopping indexing even uniquely something like social security column still allowing separate identity state
The argument surrogate key used introduce data flimsy
Knowledge data necessary functionality sufficient make decision without resorting blanket statement imagined performance impact
The argument requires join sound like vaguely based NoSQL thinking implies structuring data including denormalizing way efficient known usage pattern I ca really put finger mean
Certainly simple key efficient join composite key orthogonal key issue
The best partis SSN primary key invariably end damn fool creates web service get data let use SSNs search criterion
Then make public undocumented
True story
For lookup considerate store salted one way hash attribute like SSN
If user expect safeguarding privacy use personally identifiable information natural key transmit information plaintext
You look encryption decryption static key sensitive value amortization loss typically incurred data breach
SQL application Web application
This sort information entirely appropriate Intro DB course
First I say good discussion I love variety opinion
As thought I keep short
In personal experience I usually ended hybrid approach short natural key used appropriate surrogate key used key got larger
However best project
I believe RDBMSs like index VARCHARS store large portion string
Possibly others might interested reading Hubert Lubaczewski depesz finding difference performance integer character based index
See
Surrogate key improve performance hopefully smaller least integer type fast compare however I benchmark I rely knowledge
This point seems missed I consider obvious forgot mention
Thanks bringing
It ca stressed enough
All good point
See v
What faster
followup
I think I may read article one similar yes many case matter
However data set get may come play
My real personal opinion I rather join one column multiple even I probably done opposite time
My argument natural key simple one hubris
The hubris display comment seen embarrassment industry
I wo name name human perfect yet people comment acting
Sorry folk simply good evaluating potential natural key
And neither I
Across decade industry I yet encounter system natural key actually continued meet criterion time
I lost count time natural key proposed mightiest DBAs developer ended natural followed data loss corruption data firefights costly schema overhaul etc
Where I run problem I find natural key behind many
I avoid problem among thing avoiding natural key
The academic right perfect world
Sadly live one
It definitely depends situation
I use mix job I maintain DB company
I find normalize table use surrogate key basic level table use natural key unless ca find combination attribute assure unique identifier
I prefer using natural key possible
A lot data uniquely identified location time key composite
In case location defined list save space give location name integer
So case use surrogate
But
composite data would useless since join time location
If going using natural key many place database table probably normalized properly
That surrogate key come
If going using natural key many place database table probably normalized properly
That surrogate key come
What Earth
This normalization give
In fact go towards nothing natural key
Sorry tacking surrogate key normalization
Sorry I described poorly part
Yes natural key everywhere I meant case part composite key var char give unique integer id instead help save space
Instead saying Hey let var char part composite key showing everywhere database let abstract another table location name give unique int id use every instead
That I erroneously referring term surrogate natural key
My first thought lot data natural key satisfies requirement primary key
Not argument
If way assert uniqueness row time bigger problem
A lot good point
I agree natural key seem like good idea fall apart
Even example good candidate natural key I worked project time record make poor primary key
The time I found make sense pure type value etc
The kind data changed end user typically stay static
This data greatest benefit Natural Keys without downside
Your point stability key provided someone else good one I bitten
There identifier organization
Great natural key
Then find organization change identifier stuck updating dozen table instead one
Man I feel strange person love UUIDs almost everything
UUIDs worst key
They meaning order long
A key need meaning order
The long thing need evidence prove problem analysis decide drawback using UUID outweigh advantage
Right whether intend spreading Fear Uncertainty Doubt
minute tell bad idea use UUID almost everything
The apparent exception would case data two external source need synced even case I would try opting natural key instead
For simple explanation three nice take example
I product table record int primary key
Even though int still meaning getting chronology without order none indexed column
But working data table frequently real meaning necessarily store database part keeping working index data I looked mind
It much easier remember I looked remember
I literally people remember value record smaller table id without looking
Natural key even better regard personal memory
It make much easier write one query
Take comparison I need update single record ID much difficult compared Another thing length actual disk space processing
UUIDs least time size int slight extra processing longer key
Compounded key foreign
Even programming
With UUID I use none native type
If I debugging I come across UUID memory I write one one query
Also int natural key I would put URL UUID I need extra column SLUG id
I could tell annoying work table using UUIDs I write book
This sound typical Database professor
Then using kludgy database design typical programmer
Hi
I worked DB year
I used concept sometimes one better viceversa
Let remark two way work surrogate key
One way add record table database server generate key value like autoincrement field another application generate automatically key value send rest field
I trouble several database generate field like autoincrement field due several problem like database generate duplicated key specially people work paralell programming concurrent programming several sever core several CPU
I suggest choosing surrogate key generate key automatically application using good method example Universal Unique Identifiers
Another way table store integer key table time value read value incremented even used
Natural Keys better using common data requires easy identified
Imagine sell product store country delivery made
Instead making new table new surrogate autoincrement key country could use letter standard Internet country u ca Canada
Another important thing consider natural key exist also way handle
Single Fields like Security Numbers multiple key
Composite Key
Composite Keys used sometimes difficult handle
Its common design header parent table SaleHeader Products single key field detail child table SalesProducts key field composed header composed parent key consecutive number product
But need replace parent key case error want check field boring
Composite Keys also slow read query database severs even support
Cheers
TL DR There perfect solution Natural better short table commonly used data surrogate big table
But avoid key generated server avoid composite key
avoid key generated server strike exact opposite advice unless contention around auto increment id value bottleneck
What db encounter duplicate issued
Let second rbobby saying rely id generation possible
UUIDs imo unnecessary overkill
All mature SQL database reliable mechanism producing unique id proper unique id generation either already provided accomplished data store well
I trouble several database generate field like autoincrement field due several problem like database generate duplicated key specially people work paralell programming concurrent programming several sever core several CPU
What
This ca happen wrong db buggy
In MS SQL identity column
You create follows In case insert follows This work every database I ever used different syntax
MySQL call
PgSQL call SERIAL
These database designed even high load multithreading
DBs use locking like multithreading code ensure thing work
The way I ever seen fail people wrong generating manually like worse query db max key add one write back db without creating transaction huge recipe failure
I seen fail horrible abuse SQL
If reason generate IDs application I recommend better let db thing possible I use
I working DBs year professionally including MySql PgSql MS SQL
If using Oracle maybe right tends immensely different others
Oracle differently still support
You explicitly create SEQUENCE use sequence property matter many user try increment time get unique value need transaction lock
There case I found I prefer int key
MySQL also expects int key create anyway give access
Also natural key customer data record
Name
Multiple people name
Name Address
That going half dozen column depend yet another key address table normalized well
Probably email bizarre key also change
To best knowledge MySQL expect int key rather MySQL still uniquely label row regardless whether use surrogate ID
That almost entirely internal detail MySQL
Do information suggest otherwise
That going half dozen column depend yet another key address table normalized well
I able parse
If table well normalized property fully functional depend primary key
There another key normalized table perhaps foreign key subset key
But problem
Ca seem find article right understanding MySQL always creates integer rowids internally create unique integer field
So creating using natural key integer give access real key despite taking space db
perhaps foreign key subset key
But problem
If normalize table split address customer table seperate table
If use natural key use compound key containing field address table city state zip would absurd
You create surrogate key
Which give Customer name addressid
Address id street city state zip If want use natural key Customer use compound key
That sound like much problem realize much headache update
Say family live place one move away
You ca update address address table change two family member address still live
But instead add new record update customer table broken every table use name addressid foreign key customer
This break stable time rule OP mentioned primary id change
Someone could also change name phone number email address really nothing customer record stable enough used natural key unless work bank business ability request ssn
I guess I saying I found everything I deal surrogate key end working better almost time
So creating using natural key integer give access real key despite taking space db
My point best understanding even use surrogate autoincrementing primary key underlying secondary integer row
But I familiar MySQL assumption matter anyone reading post please research correct
Say family live place one move away
You ca update address address table change two family member address still live
Correct updating address directly changing address customer
But instead add new record update customer table broken every table use name addressid foreign key customer
We cascading foreign key least theoretically solved problem DBMS
My point best understanding even use surrogate autoincrementing primary key still underlying secondary integer row
I believe hidden key added integer primary key MySQL specific I know DBs
We cascading foreign key least theoretically solved problem DBMS
Yes going slower lock potentially many table considerably complex using surrogate key
Not say never reason I done usually work better system I worked way use surrogate instead
I think I recall talking MySQL put primary key InnoDB table automatically creates one field
At least I recall
I know fact table expected one
Yes I talking
Sorry poor explanation

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
As I understand basically mean exactly one key
If table say column also column known unique null eg social security number column could used key
Ignoring issue eg risk passing around SSN strictly schema design aspect would table effectively key
Would answer vary whether unique key column
If
A relation R third normal form every attribute R dependent candidate key R It implicit definition relation relation must key
Nothing Normal Form requires relation one key
Unfortunately book database design normalization plentiful example relation single key rather fewer example one key
This strike odd given multiple key appear common practice day
The dearth practical example literature seems one cause confusion role key database design
Another cause confusion popular mnemonic nothing key
That phrase usually attributed Bill Kent accurate definition
Since question based interpretation rule first look linked information emphasis mine I think confusion result misinterpreting term candidate key
There multiple candidate key table
This modifier term specify among group Primary Alternate
If table could one one key term Primary Key would misleading instead called something else maybe Parent Origin Identifying etc
But Primary implies secondary key called Alternate key
Alternate key indicated physical model Unique Constraint Unique Index
It also noted type Candidate Keys Primary Alternate referenced Foreign Keys even though one generally would thing without good reason
Would answer vary whether unique key column
If
No matter physical v logical modeling
You table field yet Primary Key defined
The table data easily even physical model enforce
This distinction similar whether Foreign Keys defined
You surely JOIN table orphaned record whether PKs FKs defined
And data correct without construct
But PKs FKs defined difference Referential Integrity logical Referential Integrity physical
Having constraint physical model simply help enforce rule logical model
With regard SSN familiar acronym Alternate Key Unique I would recommend considering SSN Alternate Key putting Unique Constraint Index even common SSN often considered Natural Key one exists real world
There two main reason Most time value get entered system someone filling form whether paper online
People make mistake data entry time especially source paper form entered someone reading someone else sloppy mine barely legible
Even data come another system sure source system validated info
Can sure bug data export
What bug data import
As I understand third normal form basically mean exactly one key
No
Boyce Codd Normal Form BCNF deal
A table mean partial key dependency column dependent proper subset key
Tables one example already candidate key single column
A table mean every column functionally dependent column thus creating
It matter one hundred candidate key
Actually BCNF final normal form regard functional dependancies
This table yet BCNF could multiple candidate key overlap
Thus use term mean fully normalized respect functional dependency really mean BCNF
If table say id column also column known unique null eg social security number column could used key
Not could want ensure data stored database remains consistent rule identified real world
Ignoring issue eg risk passing around SSN strictly schema design aspect would table effectively key
As explained whether table importantly BCNF orthogonal many candidate key contains
Would answer vary whether unique key column
If
No simply determining table nothing many candidate key
It instead everything ensuring column fully functionally dependent candidate key
But bring interesting point
Note unique key defined constraint DBMS unique defined business rule conceptual business model
Perhaps world always know person SSN thus serf candidate key person perhaps also introduce surrogate key logical schema call
Our business model includes rule stating SSN unique identifier person world
This implies descriptive attribute identity attribute
This rule change either forgot chose inform DBMS
This precisely constraint declared DBMS ensure data stored consistent rule business model
If create unique constraint SSN inadvertently create one row person SSN row different Person Id
An excellent primer topic Fabian Pascal Chris Date answer derived
While paper Fabian must read paper clearly defines difference conceptual logical physical level paper clearly defines various kind key specifically address question
Likewise Chris entire book must read Part II section devoted normalization respect functional dependency

Due data stored surrogate key strictly nescessary infer releationship cell row
But row represents countable identity row entity table would case database normalized refering one single surrogate key usually primary key easier keeping reference participant primary key
Maintaing index one compact column easier whole row example
In fact table surrogate key another application
Because data often combined many source chance run problem composite primary key several column combined used identify row uniquely well problem duplicate business key key taken various source system
Because surrogate key used lookup compactness important
Use incrementing integer fixed length hash keep business key source separte column
This question difficult answer I dont know software using manage dimension hierarchy
This influence thing lot
On typical denormalized Kimball architecture dimension table surrogate key used reference dimension table
In dimesion table several hierarhies meaning bit confusing
The surrogate key truly unique hierarchy highest cardinality number member determine many row dimension table
So practise key unique dimension table AND exactly ONE hierarchy one highest number member
If add versioning hierarchy slowly changing dimension exact meaning surrogate key deceptive
I generally find idea multiple hierarchy one dimension table quite apalling
True reduces number dimension reference fact table drawback
There several consequence denormalization dimension table ugly duplication
One risk double counting joining dimension table
This often fixed glossed software package used checking value summing reducing count
But common source counting anomaly summing error handled road really dirty hack
Of I see quite
yes A surrogate key unique one row used common handle relationship betweeen cell row
Due data stored surrogate key strictly nescessary infer releationship cell row
But row represents countable identity row entity table would case database normalized refering one single surrogate key usually primary key easier keeping reference participant primary key
Maintaing index one compact column easier whole row example

A synthetic key entity identifier key database sequence number factless key technical key arbitrary unique identifier unique identifier either modeled world database
The surrogate key derived application data unlike derived application data
There least two definition surrogate The definition relates rather used throughout article
See Date
An important distinction surrogate primary key depends whether database
Since store valid data correspondence surrogate modeled world primary key database
In case surrogate may used primary key resulting term
In temporal database however relationship primary key surrogate
Since may several object database corresponding single surrogate use surrogate primary key another attribute required addition surrogate uniquely identify object
Although Hall say nothing others argued surrogate following characteristic In surrogate key generated derived application data database
The significance surrogate key act primary key
It also possible surrogate key exists addition example HR number employee UUID employee
A surrogate key frequently sequential number
identity column column defined
Some database provide possible data type surrogate key

Having key independent column insulates database relationship change data value database design making database guarantee uniqueness
In necessary distinguish surrogate key
Every row would business key surrogate key
The surrogate key identifies one unique row database business key identifies one unique entity modeled world
One table row represents slice time holding entity attribute defined timespan
Those slice depict whole lifespan one business entity
For example table may hold temporal information keep track contracted working hour
The business key one contract identical row however surrogate key row unique
Some database designer use surrogate key systematically regardless suitability others use key already present data one
Some alternate name key describe way new surrogate value rather surrogate concept
Approaches generating surrogate include Surrogate key change row exists
This following advantage Attributes uniquely identify entity might change might invalidate suitability natural key
Consider following example In case generally new attribute must added natural key example column
With surrogate key table defines surrogate key must changed
With natural key table possibly related software use natural key change
Some problem domain clearly identify suitable natural key
Surrogate key avoid choosing natural key might incorrect
Surrogate key tend compact data type integer
This allows database query single key column faster could multiple column
Furthermore distribution key cause resulting index completely balanced
Surrogate key also le expensive join fewer column compare
While using several database application development system driver system much easier use integer GUID surrogate key every table instead natural key order support operation mapping
When every table uniform surrogate key task easily automated writing code way
It possible design follow pattern structure automatically verified
For instance key intended used column table might designed look differently intended used another column table thereby simplifying detection application error key misplaced
However characteristic surrogate key never used drive logic application would violate principle
The value generated surrogate key relationship data held row
When inspecting row holding foreign key reference another table using surrogate key meaning surrogate key row discerned key
Every foreign key must joined see related data item
This also make auditing difficult incorrect data obvious
Surrogate key unnatural data exported shared
A particular difficulty table two otherwise identical schema example test schema development schema hold record equivalent business sense different key
This mitigated exporting surrogate key except transient data obviously executing application live connection database
When surrogate key supplant natural key domain specific compromised
Relational database assume unique applied table primary key
The unique index serf two purpose enforce entity integrity since primary key data must unique across row ii quickly search row queried
Since surrogate key replace table identifying since identifying attribute likely queried query optimizer forced perform full table scan fulfilling likely query
The remedy full table scan apply index identifying attribute set
Where set index unique index
These additional index however take disk space slow insert deletes
Surrogate key result duplicate value
It part implementation ensure duplicate possible
Because surrogate key unnatural flaw appear modeling business requirement
Business requirement relying natural key need translated surrogate key
A strategy draw clear distinction logical model surrogate key appear physical implementation model ensure logical model correct reasonably well normalised ensure physical model correct implementation logical model
Proprietary information leaked sequential key generator used
By subtracting previously generated sequential key recently generated sequential key one could learn number row inserted time period
This could expose example number transaction new account per period
There way overcome problem Sequentially generated surrogate key imply event higher key value occurred event lower value
This necessarily true value guarantee time sequence possible insert fail leave gap may filled later time
If chronology important date time must separately recorded

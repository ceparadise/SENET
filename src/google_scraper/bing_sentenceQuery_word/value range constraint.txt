Can I define constraint numeric InnoDB allow value certain range
For example column table If using InnoDB Engine sir
As see create new table contains limiting value reference field Foreign Key enforce constraint referencial integrity
try But must also alter wavelength DEFAULT handle null value

I would like minimize linear function obj sel subject Value Value constant sel sel sort selector variable sel Everything pretty straightforward I need check constraint sel
In word obj OK sel picked I need check obj Value
Currently I using SAT solve similar problem I prefer study something else
Maybe I need consider different framework task
Any direction useful
Thanks advance
This solved depending upon whether solving case separately
Each case handled using integer linear programming might like read ILP solver
There two case
We optimize separately
The two case In case linear inequality skipped
So problem minimize objective function subject requirement
You solve using integer linear programming solver actually shooting fly cannon
Since required integer range mean know
So case really cover one possible assignment selector assignment
You simply evaluate value objective function particular mean objective function take value
So value always attainable
In case exists least one index linear inequality skipped
So kind problem looking sum subset small possible subject requirement greater Value
This could handled integer linear programming
Each integer unknown linear inequality want minimize linear objective function
Adding extra constraint ensure least one selector needed case
This mean could feed problem ILP solver see solution give
You might able find better algorithm borrowing technique used
In fact look like kind reverse knapsack
If negate constant looking subset negated constant whose sum large possible subject constraint Value
That sound like knapsack problem negated constant weight value object Value represents capacity knapsack
The one twist object might negative
Since special case weight value fact instance subset sum kind problem
The decision version youur problem given want know whether subset constant whose value range Value
If solve decision version serve optimization problem using binary search

Using SQL Server I script constraint field table acceptable range value
A check constraint like fieldname BETWEEN AND
Try This check would inclusive info BETWEEN MSDN According right question
This rule sound like business rule
Why implemented side
If incorrect value entered get error message
If user get error message would easier code giving message transaction reach server
What range modification
May rule change
I guess yes rule ALLWAYS change
Can range updated
In case value already entered database

In wherein stated form
Constraints differ common language specify step sequence step execute rather property solution found
This make constraint programming form
The constraint used constraint programming various kind used
A B true
others
Constraints usually embedded within programming language provided via separate
Constraint programming expressed form embeds constraint
This variant logic programming due Jaffar Lassez extended specific class constraint introduced
The first implementation constraint logic programming
Instead logic programming constraint mixed
Programming language support constraint include functional programming imperative programming
Mostly constraint implemented imperative language via separate library existing imperative language
Constraint programming embedding constraint host language
The first host language used language field initially called
The two paradigm share many important feature like logical variable
Today implementation include one library constraint logic programming
The difference two largely style approach modeling world
Some problem natural thus simpler write logic program natural write constraint program
The constraint programming approach search state world large number constraint satisfied time
A problem typically stated state world containing number unknown variable
The constraint program search value variable
Temporal concurrent constraint programming TCC temporal concurrent constraint programming MJV variant constraint programming deal time
Languages programming follow one two approach typical example refinement model typical example perturbation model
The refinement model general restrict variable single value lead several solution problem
However perturbation model intuitive programmer using mixed imperative constraint language
The constraint used constraint programming typically specific domain
Some popular domain constraint programming Finite domain one successful domain constraint programming
In area like constraint programming often identified constraint programming finite domain
All example commonly solved SMT solver
Finite domain solver useful solving often based one approximation
The syntax expressing constraint finite domain depends host language
The following program solves classical puzzle constraint logic programming The interpreter creates variable letter puzzle
The operator used specify domain variable range set value
The constraint mean two variable take value zero
When interpreter evaluates constraint reduces domain two variable removing value
Then constraint considered reduce domain simply stored
The last constraint specifies digit assigned letter must hold letter replaced corresponding digit
From constraint solver infers
All stored constraint involving variable M awakened case constraint remove value domain remaining variable
Constraint propagation may solve problem reducing domain single value may prove problem solution reducing domain empty set may also terminate without proving satisfiability unsatisfiability
The literal used actually perform search solution
Constraint programming often realized imperative programming via separate library
Some popular library constraint programming

I fairly large million row Oracle table date field number query constrained range like This constraint usually restricting table content thousand hundred thousand record
There also index support query well also include used Oracle according
Then I realised user input date constraint never include time variance cut greatly using
So I tried changing constraint without changing index still list field function When written like query performs quicker cost time lower varies exact query typical example
The index still shown employed
But index also adjusted including paired constraint rewritten like cost query go time lower
This course good news I understand happening since range constraint understanding make difference
Regardless whether date time date effort needed tell whether value question earlier later point time remains
Clearly something I see yet
Could example side effect index smaller efficiently navigated anything like

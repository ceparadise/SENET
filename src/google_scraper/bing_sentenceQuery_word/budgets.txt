This seal approval granted institution
public college university one six regional accrediting body
Middle States Association Colleges Schools
You learn difference regional accreditation national accreditation
Although nationally accredited school may cheaper easier get reason avoid
Attending regionally accredited school may make easier Regional accreditation applies college university
For program ask
The accredits applied science computing engineering technology program
It necessary degree ABET accreditation many good program without show school taking responsibility seriously
A thing note ABET procedure
Not necessarily
The field computer science field littered story made billion
Mark Zuckerberg Bill Gates David Karp folk fine without CS degree

It easy feel though need expensive laptop college often far case
student would probably totally fine almost laptop mostly engineering student need little horsepower
Here find exactly need
Engineering professional go often need incredibly powerful PC hardware
Needless say need compromise power affordability mobility fly window
While someone like perfect pick might student like would hard pressed hand cash could use purchase car book food mounting college debt
Fortunately hope
Engineering student like often run problem heading college
Many opinion Macbook right choice simply throw base model Macbook Air
Where major get anything certain engineering profession require use laptop meet specific requirement
With mind I decided take look requirement befit STEM student term usability preference need run common software
I personally shop laptop ME student I felt I share option I considered along deal available
I arranged guide three category Computer Science Engineering Mechanical Engineering
I put order increasingly powerful computing need
Those expensive option list like Inspiron perfect content creation need graphic design video editing plus CAD modelling work even light gaming
I also created link proper search filter Amazon said laptop picked option I feel stand
Usually especially good deal included hardware model
I also filled price range I feel fair meet exceed presented requirement
Specs Computer Science laptop based computer run commonly used editing platform
Eclipse rather meager list spec proof even laptop problem coding
Based specification list laptop might work CS need This le bargain basement option
This Windows machine solid review
The performs well us le energy idling little power efficient
The tradeoff soldered permanently
The Vivobook basically budget Ultrabook
ASUS known quality certainly delivers look premium laptop
The difference price Acer Chromebook get CPU twice powerful four time storage display Windows
A pretty great deal altogether opinion
This may seem bad deal next Vivobook hidden gem
It outpaces Vivobook Pentium quad core every benchmark thanks hyperthreading four thread two physical core
If need compiling powerhouse look sixth generation laptop EE list
Side note Many CS buddy look backlit keyboard machine typically premium feature
However since likely need one room consider buying external backlit keyboard
Coders use lot anyhow super cheap
I personally used
These spec laptop based laptop run
This demanding PCB design software I could find still demanding
people coding need CS folk plus need use light graphical tool designing board
Based list laptop might work best electrical computer engineering This repeat CS list deserves spot list well
This HP pretty generic modern look pack far power Vivobook far larger body near price point
This likely considerably power need EE
If sale like I researching great deal
The discrete graphic card really needed EE need graphical work certainly help
Computer engineer appreciate
This laptop model one better GPU SSD little extra cash
This one give better hardware per dollar
And one time Acer Aspire E another price hike give even better value
This almost fast Quad core HQ four core four thread two core four thread
In fact laptop faster processor far better graphic Macbook Air cost half much
These spec ME laptop based needed run program free student
I plenty experience design tool
Solidworks commonly used alternative heavier system requirement unspecific graphic hardware work I assume least
Note The recommended spec desktop workstation
VidRAM typical
Based spec laptop might best suit ME need See section detail since
Though relatively weak GPU still dedicated one
The quad core GTX considerably better previous Acer model plus includes backlit keyboard
While model may seem overpriced compared V especially worse CPU look way better opinion
Also Acer model stuff lot hardware cheap chassis Asus generally better quality look feel
It also lighter thinner
It come empty bay extra storage
Now proper rig editing graphic work even moderate gaming
While computing power marginally better sport twice CAD work often eats
Personally I big fan typical red n black gaming aesthetic laptop
It look le I prefer professional gaming laptop
This ultimately I got
Ultimately I chose based holiday sale offered time
I would recommend pursuing option condition nice sale
If uncompromised processing power machine back
The quad core beast
This option definitely powerful processor
You always
Keep mind Google search gaming laptop net plenty machine ME student need common get two class
Visit manufacturer webpage check pack capacity Wh specific model
You want beefy graphic power hungry
You typically run anything required engineering student campus desktop
So instance ME student afford laptop could always fall back campus resource get cheaper laptop
It also pay upgrade rather look fo whole new model come wanting
Online guide place Simply look laptop model look YouTube video tutorial
There chance done minute prior experience well longer count cloning time SSD swap
Remember Try spend le
Once cross line may well get desktop spend money saved good laptop
The performance desktop handily beat even mobile CPU desktop GTX ti edge mobile GTX
Together desktop component laptop spec would run easily
Good luck
go school see strong majority
student using mac
window preferred development environment amongst newer generation
sound much like advertisement window based I think sell MacBooks short based get money PDFs Movie Photo editing video codecs read write Microsoft office product plus plethora program ported Unix resale value longevity MacBook exceeds Windows laptop
Oh yeah run Windows natively
Excellent battery life
As senior IT support member major engineering university I tell used software run MACs user choose try problem child
Matlab autocad siemons ansys soldworks cmg abacus etc none work well mac please talk virtual machine running
We maybe Mac user mostly CS nobody Aero Me get Mac
Its preference way
Personally I happy junk window system Linux I get make decision market
This definitely true hardware engineering CS silicon valley least almost CS developer startup OS X
Of course future may change Ubuntu starting make dent least eye see
You almost use metric determine area person work
If carry around Mac engineer work software
If carry around Windows laptop hardware developer engineer
Don take wrong way I never intended article student silicon valley
The idea stretching dollar meet basic need student
Of course always get Mac ultrabook matter greatly exceed hardware need required student
I include Mac laptop list inadequate idea avoid overspending still capable machine
In word spend plenty
Because need
If article
I guess I reply followup I referring student
I talking location real job
I student I believe student become familiar relates profession training
If I professional EE I expect I hire comfortable tool industry generally expects used
If hand profession involves developing software run server likewise I expect I hire familiar tool used industry
I happen come latter industry prospective candidate know develop UNIX system preferably without IDEs I hire
Now statement general course exception center bell software developer position alike current dominant one software least location
As EE student I use Windows cause Circuit Simulation software available specifically use MultiSim I think lot CS major like Macs better programming environment offer
Also I disagree comment needing portability
Engineering student often need portability homework lab project require computer normally travel campus meet group member work friend
A lot EE friend I went ultrabooks light portable like Macbook Pros software need Windows pretty powerful EEs need much GPU rendering like MEs might CAD discrete graphic fine
Just curiosity get Acer Chromebook Chromebook run Eclipse
I impression run apps
I never owned one I really ignorant regard I think owning one time time always stop short I see severe limitation
Can anyone comment subject
Eclipse run Chrome OS confusion well warranted
You would need install Linux Windows like half price many Chromebooks Chromebook run Eclipse plenty Chrome OS programming environment
One great one I know Codeshare exactly replacement Eclipse still let code ton language color coded syntax save cloud storage free
My older brother said know several CS major university use Chromebooks main laptop I clue exact program use evidently substitute Eclipse I know
OK sound like I I known anyone actually one
I running Linux year usually use older used computer
I much budget new tend consider Chromebooks time time I seem hand hard earned cash
I hand noticing price dropping


way thank reply helpful
As Computer Science student I would find pick selection
important topic talking neural network application
If want high performance computing GPU must
Make sure nVidia GPU capable running CUDA DirectX higher new GPU
AMD might closing gap nVidia make life easier
Have considered ASUS ZenBook Pro computer Science Student
Will buying one laptop recommend provide low fps long time get response software
I still high school senior school laptop HP EliteBook folio integrated GPU includes processor ram While coding eclipse I get lagging using autocorrect option correct code wait long eclipse open
While modeling I find chrome IE explore always laggy sometimes crash I use tinker cad even run installation inventor
My laptop ASUS dual core ram integrated GPU difficult time installing Inventor Autodesk spends year minute open Inventor
My ASUS handle Inventor sure using draw model complete torture
Thus I worry ability recommended laptop consider buying mobile workstation
Workstations might overkill may I know performance laptop suggest
especially mechanical engineering category please regardless grammar spelling issue English first language I America year If pick one I recommend Mechanical Engineers specifically one discrete graphic handle Inventor fine
My current laptop nearly identical spec Inspiron handle problem even play modern game
I never issue speed using HP SSD main drive true laptop SSD demanding application

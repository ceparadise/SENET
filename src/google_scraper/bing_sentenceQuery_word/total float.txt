Why calculate total float free float basic difference
also What difference PERT CPM
Total float measured difference early late start date LS ES early late finish date LF EF
Total float represents amount time activity delayed without delaying overall project duration also called
If activity duration day occurring concurrently activity duration day activity day total float
Meaning delayed three day without effect project
However activity delayed day negative float situation day
This reflects fact project take two day longer anticipated
Free float measured subtracting early finish EF activity early start ES successor activity
Free float represents amount time schedule activity delayed without delaying early start date immediate successor activity within network path
Free float calculated last activity activity sequence
If Company XYZ million total share outstanding million restricted share free float would remaining million share available trading million million million
From Concerning Floats Projects type Total Float Obtained deducting Early start activity duration Late finish activity
That mean get slack obtained Late start Early Start well Late Finish Early Finish
Thus Total Float signifies total slack time available activity Project without delaying overall Project duration
Safety Float Obtained deducting Late start plus activity duration Late Finish activity
That mean slack time available due time Late finish Early early finish activity
This Float interfere float time available Predecessor activity
Free Float Obtained deducting Early start plus activity duration Early Finish Activity
We slack time available due time Early Start Late Start activity
However float eat away slack time available successor activity
Independent Float Obtained deducting Late start plus activity duration Early Finish
This float virtually leaf time breathing since predecessor activity started late successor activity scheduled early start utilizing time duration activity
Most time slack time available ZERO float
Amount time activity may delayed early start without delaying project finish date
Amount time task delayed without delaying early start successor
consider one activity A total duration day successor activity B starting day completing activity A free float tho activity impact activity B even activity A get delayed Days

When estimating time required complete activity use word effort duration etc
Is duration effort
NO
actual amount time spent carry activity
This expressed term person hour man day man month
It show total number person spent working activity
amount time taken carry activity
That start time end time nothing time elapsed complete activity
Duration measured etc
This count number people working activity
For example An activity take hour work one person
The person carrying activity contributes one hour per day
So total day taken day
Here effort hour duration day
After arrival total duration project estimation technique project manager present schedule
But Customer say duration reduced without comprising
Now left option Project Manager either add resource run activity parallel
nothing adding resource
Of course crashing happens cost increase adding extra resource
represents activity carried parallel instead series
Here disadvantage increase risk area may quality activity performed parallel
After need track closely activity coming critical path
And activity critical path tracking normal way
But say normal need know degree level
This determined parameter called
To find float slack perform Forward pas Backward pas
moving network diagram start finish covering path
Backward pas moving network diagram reverse way Finish start network diagram covering path
When forward backward pas end value Late Start LS Late Finish LF Early Start ES Early Finish EF
Float difference LS ES LF EF

amount time schedule activity delayed without delaying early start immediately following schedule activity
total amount time schedule activity may delayed early start date without delaying project finish date intermediary milestone
In given example total float activity free float also ES activity activity
Similarly free float activity advancing activity term schedule overcome risk anything may happens project
For example You need equipment day importing outside
Assume take day day order
Instead waiting day order avoid possible delay
That advancing order day day
deliberately delaying successor activity
For Example There two activity
The first one painting second one framing
After painting give time paint dry start framing
Deliberate delay successor activity called Lag

My real complaint PMP exam PMI approach general lie fact people may know terminology case may actually know various calculation clue effectively use information manage project
BR PDG Boston http Hi PDG Once challenged u
I give short answer let elaborate
Total Float belongs project whereas Free Float belongs individual activity
If project done contract debatable whether Float belongs buyer seller
In either case project resource
It used judiciously mainly cover risk unforeseen issue project
Now I pas ball
Please enlighten u subject

Regarding point PMP certification I think page
Nobody claiming PMs Super PMs
I see academic qualification similar school college degree
Again I debate many time various forum really tired
There end
Thanks
I appreciate input
Not bad answer Harwinder
I impressed
From claim legal precedent perspective unless otherwise stated contract float generally considered owned owner prime contractor
However owned prime contractor also split sub vendor
And although absolutely correct float cover mititage risk better complete answer would show much flexibility term time spread early late date S curve horizontally term resource spread vertically early data late date S curve Very people unless involved litigation truly understand effectively use float information better manage project
BR PDG Boston http PS For really interested topic sure download many free Recommended Practices RP AACE offer

I experiancing challenge PERT systerm CPA network diagramme assignment given
Can assist please
I contacted following email nhlokoz
Your Assistance highly appreciated Nice explanation confused OR student I related question I slightly confused
Each book Rita Head first others different way drawing network Activity A start Day duration ES activity A EF Activity B proceeds activity A duration Activity B ES B considering lag A B
Same way calculating LF LS author subtract day default others confusing If kindly help example helpful
In end calculating float make difference adding subtracting correspondingly adjusts
What standard practice please clarify
Anonymous That excellent observation
I answered question previously forum ca dig link right
I answer
You right
Different book follow different convention
Whether start first activity matter choice
Both method get answer
It make difference come calculating duration critical path float value
I prefer follow convention find Rita book calculate ES EF LS LF FF TF
The advantage convention need hour
The first day start
If first activity duration day ES EF ES Duration
The successor activity ES EF predecessor activity provided lead lag
In summary pick convention comfortable practice stick
Hope answer question
Thanks bringing
Harry bit puzzled use calculate ES first
But seeing explanation clear using
Thank If activity x ES duration EF
ES activity
However I seen calculation EF x
ES
Both method make difference CPM calculation long keep constant throughout
But ur PMI certification exam make difference choose PMI think correct given option
Use latter I think
Definitivamente son terminos que son necesarios comprender fondo para darles la aplicacion correcta en nuestros proyectos agradezco mucho los comentarios los felicito D Hello Williams I read Spanish
So I translated English others benefit
Here translated They definitely term necessary fully understand correctly applied project I much appreciate comment I congratulate D Thanks comment Continuing Soumit comment March I sharing link question
link removed This clearest description convention far
It say The Zero Method start finish end time period
In Zero Method start activity number finish previous activity critical path
The One Method start beginning time period finish end
In One Method finish previous activity critical path added get start next activity
It seems Rita Mulcahy us zero method Andy Crowe us one method So question remain Which one PMI use
Any recent exam taker care share experience
Are zero method one method official term describe calculation convention
formula FF ES next activity EF wrong FF ESn ES duration Hello Thanks feedback
Please elaborate source information
BR
Another excellent source information PMP PM Road Trip particular calculation free float put forward anon correct FF ES successor ES current duration current This found http I prefer one menthod reflects real world much better
I would never start first activity day zero make sense
You start day take full working day complete duration would working day
Then earliest start next activity day day

Hi I another question regarding identifying float utilizing
In case lead lag diagram float identified
For example might required wait day Activity B start Activity A say due planned maintainance
If go float calculation may considered buffer utilized
So really identify fload case lead lag
Thanks Harwinder wonderful example Harwinder I would like know Project float Rita book per understanding float critical path Project float existis
And How diffrenciate float lead lag
Thanks Ram Excellent job clarifying concept
My student lot trouble understanding crystal clear
Thanks I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO CALCULATE ACTIVITY DURATION IN CASE OF RLLATION IS FF OR FS FOR EXAMPLE CAN YOU EXPLAIN PLEASE HI Harwinder I think right part let elaborate little bit Free Float belongs every activity done target activity concern
actually Independent Float belong one activity
I agree PDG
But also favor Project Planning Tools support stake holder believe directed PMO Office In opinion asset project NOT exclusive Contractor
Thanks example helped Excellent explanation

PMP Exam Preparation Study Materials Lessons Learned Contact Hours PMP FAQ etc
By When I preparing PMP certification exam I never thought total float free float different concept
I used think two term synonym
Fortunately exam searching Google I came know difference two term
Therefore I believe many PMP aspirant like thinking way I
I writing blog post express understanding topic
I insist go concept carefully otherwise may face difficulty analyzing critical path
Total float aware commonly referred float
Total float amount time activity delayed without delaying project completion date
On critical path total float zero
Total float often known slack
You calculate total float subtracting Early Start date activity Late Start date Late Start date Early Start date Early Finish date Late Finish date Late Finish date Early Finish date
Now come free float
This going bit different might new
Free float amount time activity delayed without delaying Early Start successor activity
You calculate free float subtracting Early Finish date activity Early Start date next activity ES next Activity EF current Activity
Keep mind two activity converging single activity one two activity may free float
There disagreement whether first day project
In fact convention correct free choose like
I choose start project day
The following reason Anyway free select choice
Since mathematically two situation different formula used calculate free float also slightly different
Don worry result case
Free float Activity X Early Start next Activity Early Finish Activity X Free float Activity X Early Start next Activity Early Finish Activity X The difference two formula easy remember
If start day subtract formula
If start day need subtract Now move example
I start simple example go complex situation
While giving example I assuming aware drawing network diagram identifying critical calculating Early Start Early Finish Late Start Late Finish date activity
Don worry problem calculation I written blog post critical path method explaining thing
Please visit blog post understand concept better come back
Visit Okay let get started
Obviously path D critical path longest duration
As see given diagram two path path D path D
The path D critical path therefore total float
Since path D path total float
You two method calculate total float
In first method subtract duration path critical path
In second method find total float activity subtracting Early Start date Late Start date LS ES subtracting Early Finish date Late Finish date LF EF activity
Total float duration critical path duration path duration path D duration path D Hence total float day
On path D Activity A D lie critical path therefore total float
Only Activity C total float
As stated earlier calculate total float using either finish date start date
Here I show way find
First go Late Finish Early Finish date Total float Activity C LF Activity EF Activity C Now second formula Total float Activity C LS Activity C ES Activity C So duration mean formula provide result
From figure see Activity C free float activity lying critical path
Let find
Free float Activity C ES next Activity EF Activity C Hence free float activity C day
Now time move complex example
For given network diagram identify activity free float calculate free total float activity considering duration day
We know Free float ES next Activity EF current Activity In diagram Activity G free float Activity D G converging one common activity
Activity D free float successor activity E starting next day completing activity We know formula free float Free float activity G Early Start Activity E Early Finish Activity G Total float Activity G Late Finish Activity G Early Finish Activity G You see free float Activity G day total float day different
Please note exam asked calculate float activity calculate total float
Total float commonly referred float
Here blog post finish
If thought share comment section
This blog post updated correct error pointed Mr Murali Mr Bryan
If interested learning mathematical formula PMP exam try practice PMP exam sample question
image credit Master isolated Can please give example total float activity free float activity
Hello Kishore In fact I also planning draw network diagram see total float free float different case calculation little lengthy
So I avoided
I covered concept calculate total float free float example I hope understand calculate scenario
Even problem send scanned copy diagram I try explain wait blog post CPM I calculate total float free float complex diagram
I unable see network diagram question explanation like one total free float
Thanks compliment Ayushman
Hi Fahad Thanks explanation good diagram calculate
Looking ahead next post CPM complex diagram calculation
thankyou Soon see
Update Hello Drew post critical path method complex diagram calculation
hi please explain calculate float particular node like float node B
In given example two path
ABD ACD
The duration path ABD day duration path ACD day
Obviously path ABD critical path float critical path always zero
Therefore float activity B zero
However calculate float path ACD
day
Therefore flat activity C day
thanks lot Fahad explanation Do anything describing total float free float link along lead lag
I took simplest example explain concept
As I relationship diagram lead lag explaining float concept
But future I might write
Also There one type float interferring float maximum amount time activity delayed without delaying entire project delay early start succeceding activity
Well Interfering float Total float Free Float
amount total float available
one type float independent float maximum amount time activity delayed without delaying early start succeeding activity without affected allowable delay preceding activity
The PMBOK Guide recognizes two type float
total float free float
Thanks detailed explanation Total Float v Free Float
Sir gotting concept RACI Chart thus answer PMP question pls need assistance
Thanks detailed explanation Total Float v Free Float
Sir got concept RACI Chart thus answer PMP question pls need assistance
RACI stand responsible accountable consulted informed
It responsibility assignment matrix list name person mention whether responsible accountable consultant informed particular process
I attempting calculate date task must completed delay subsequent task Project
I using Free Float added Finish date
Most returned date make sense
However
I identified pattern exception yet
Any thought
Sorry Mike I good idea MS Project
Hello Fahad Seriously blog note prevented tearing hair
I initially knew definition free float never calculate question I came across I came across first pmp exam I took failed
Finally found free float calculation question oliver lehmann today confused answer
I found confusing answer pmzilla different people different opinion calculate
I really frustrated seeing many answer knowing sure calculate
even first website came google I typed calculate free float explained I still confident trusting
However blog explains completely example
I confident
Thanks lot really appreciate
I keep looking question I blog
This second time preparation pmp
I gone book total Rita achieve pmp success kim heldman pmp head first
The last I gone question since I felt explanation across book
I process completing many sample exam I come across I okay averaging across tough easy
initial lot
Daniel Hello Daniel I sorry hear failed exam first attempt
I hope pas exam next attempt
Just work improving weak spot
Don go many book
Two book PMBOK Guide enough pas exam
Fahad Hi I think one successor activity must take least early start greater I want explain point u take seems logical I think talking forward pas activity two predecessor activity take greater early finish date calculate early start successor activity
Okay
Let u say activity C two predecessor activity activity A activity B
It mean activity C started predecessor activity complete
If activity A finish day Activity B finish day activity C start day activity complete activity C started
Hope help
free float minimum early start succesor Late finish NOT THE GREATER EARLY START What mean
I appreciate lucid explanation topic
Thanks Fahmi
Dear Mr Fahad Thanks nice explanation Can explain example network diagram lead lag Finish Finish Start finish Start Start
Hello Ahmad The example given blog post enough PMP exam
Anyway I noted request I get time I update post example requested
Thanks Fahad I wait comment
Dear Fahad I beg differ explanation FF
As per definition FF duration activity delayed without impacting ES successor activity successor activity
Therefore activity D FF ZERO delay activity D impact ES Activity E eventhough doesnot impact activity B
Similarly FF activity G ZERO delay activity G impact ES Activity H eventhough doesnot impact activity As I understand FF activity NOT calculated taking largest ES date successor governed DEFINITION
Most importantly activity FF network Activity day Activity day Loading network CPM software could thoroughly validate explanation
Total Float Free Float different
An activity free float two successor activity
Hope help
I sorry say explanation FF flawed
It NOT true activity FF successor activity
Infact FF occur activity share common successor way
As I said activity FF network activity F I replying benefit others I seen string many people Khaled Joe HB Sadek etc raising question FF
I meant free float activity one successor activity
It two successor activity For clarification visit pmbok guide page free float amount time schedule activity delayed without delaying early start date successor violating schedule constraint
Hello Murali Let explain way
The PMBOK Guide say free float amount time schedule activity delayed without delaying early start date successor violating schedule And say Activities F I free float
How last activity respective path therefore affecting early start successor activity
Now saying activity D free float
Let u see PMBOK Guide definition applying
Activity D finishing day
Its successor Activity B starting day
Now clearly see activity D delayed day without affecting early start Activity B
This exactly PMBOK Guide saying
Please read definition
Hence Activity D free float day
Is clear
If activity END F I would free float would total float explained first simple example
On hand activity right START branching A D G activity would free float despite fact multiple successor
If delete H I diagram G would free float day total float day even though multiple successor
It share E successor In diagram D G would violate E H respectively delayed though would affect critical path right away
I sure D G really free float violate one successor long affect critical path
I would appreciate check clarify
Hello Bryan You right free float occur two activity share common successor
I amended blog post well
Dear Fahad Let explain position free float amount time schedule activity delayed without delaying early start date ANY successor violating schedule Please note word ANY definition For activity D successor namely activity B activity All explanation talking FF activity D respect Activity B first successor impact activity E second successor
Can delay activity D without delaying ES Activity E answer NO
Therefore per definition activity D Zero FF
The logic go activity G also ZERO FF delaying ES activity Nowhere defintion talk taking greatest ES amongst successor calculating FF activity
Nowhere defintion talk taking ONE successor calculating FF activity
Also NOT MANDATORY multiple successor FF even activity single successor FF provided CONVERGING network
That reason FF stringent TF
The reason FF activity completed per ES date
Therefore project TF owned FF owned Contractor
Now coming activity F I successor activity END milestone activity duration ZERO
As CP duration determined day activity F FF day activity I FF day
Coincidentally equal respective Total Floats well
As I mentioned first reply please update logic CPM software like MS Project validate explanation
Please send network diagram You right two activity converge may free float
I corrected error blog post
Regarding second point You saying Free Float F This mean Free Float F Late Finish F Early Finish F Are sure
I believe calculating total float mixing free float
Formula calculate free float Free Float activity ES next Activity EF Activity As activity END milestone activity Zero duration ES EF
FF activity ES activity END EF Activity F In word activity F delayed day without delaying ES activity END project completion FF activity ES activity END EF Activity I Now coming Total Floats TF activity LF activity F EF activity F day TF activity LF activity I EF activity I day Therefor activity F I TF FF
Hope clarifies
Okay
Yes right Murali free float occur two activity share common successor
Thanks pointing mistake blog post I thank
Dear Fahad You welcome
I happy I could contribute popular website prospective PMPs
Please continue good work PM community
Your explanation every topic wonderful
I practice calculation similar example used calculation I think I able perform calucations difderent example
I glad helped understand concept
I lucky get explanation example easily explained appreciated thanks lot writing wonderful You welcome Vijay
What significance free float
It give extra margin activity
Fahad sb Jazak Allah replying clarifying
I another question regarding total float free float What mean total float owned owner free float owned contractor
I saw comment
Total float may affect project completion date concern client
Regarding free float affect early start next activity client care
It manage
Client rarely interfere manage individual activity
Jazak Allah Now clear
Is AON diagram
Some node hard read
Total float vary
Regards Which diagram talking
thank much
explanation made lot difference
Please let know understanding correct
Free float calculated activity share common successor case F C common successor end formula would ES next activity Early Finish Date current activity subtracting even start start date
It would great could come
Thanks sharing knowledge
As per understanding subtract case well

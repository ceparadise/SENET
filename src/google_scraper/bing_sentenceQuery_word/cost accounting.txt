In past computer used calculator
Modern computer perform number additional task provide analytical information
Most first commercial computer used business
Before computer available company hired people perform manual calculation
For large company cost high
While computer expensive affordable hiring employee worked much faster
Personal computer made computerized accounting far affordable even small business could afford early system
While information still entered manually computer could analyze information almost instantly generate simple report
Most system replaced business still rely system purchased
Computers handle broad array task
system often tied directly accounting software enabling instant update
In addition modern system provide number analytical report useful insight
Increasingly company using platform
These platform allow manager business owner access information anywhere outsource server task remote server
The advantage provided computerized accounting platform make nearly ubiquitous medium large business

In field method based
The accounting method often give intuitive account amortized cost operation either
Note however guarantee analysis immediately obvious often choosing correct parameter accounting method requires much knowledge problem complexity bound one attempting prove two method
The accounting method naturally suited proving bound time
The method explained proving bound
A set elementary operation used chosen cost arbitrarily set
The fact cost operation may differ reality present difficulty principle
What important elementary operation constant cost
Each aggregate operation assigned payment
The payment intended cover cost elementary operation needed complete particular operation payment left placed pool used later
The difficulty problem require amortized analysis general operation require greater constant cost
This mean constant payment enough cover worst case cost operation
With proper selection payment however longer difficulty expensive operation occur sufficient payment pool cover cost
A example help illustrate use accounting method
It often necessary create table known much space needed
One possible strategy double size table full
Here use accounting method show amortized cost insertion operation table
Before looking procedure detail need definition
Let T table E element insert num T number element T size T allocated size We assume existence operation n creates empty table size n assumed free T E insert element E table T already space allocated cost
The following illustrates table insertion procedure Without amortized analysis best bound show n insert operation O n due loop line performs num T elementary insertion
For analysis using accounting method assign payment table insertion
Although reason clear become clear course analysis
Assume initially table empty size T The first insertion therefore require reallocation cost elementary insert
Therefore num T pool
Inserting element requires reallocation table
Creating new table line free
The loop line requires elementary insertion cost Including insertion last line total cost operation
After operation pool therefore
Next add another element table
At point pool
Inserting additional element element seen cost payment
After operation pool
Note amount inserting element
In fact show case number reallocation
It made clear payment insertion
pay first insertion element pay moving element next time table expanded pay moving older element next time table expanded
Intuitively explains element contribution never run regardless many time table expanded since table always doubled newest half always cover cost moving oldest half
We initially assumed creating table free
In reality creating table size n may expensive O n
Let u say cost creating table size n Does new cost present difficulty
Not really turn use method show amortized O bound
All change payment
When new table created old table entry
The new table size
As long entry currently table added enough pool pay creating new table right
We expect first entry help pay new table
Those entry already paid current table
We must rely last entry pay cost
This mean must add payment entry total payment

In previous post addressed full costing overhead applied different way
Now time talk overhead sorted department
Think medium large sized business
They often separated department example sale customer service manufacturing etc
So product cost calculated overhead allocated depending long product spends certain department
Instead department refer different business area cost centre
There two type The main thing incur direct cost
So direct worker worked product using direct material would product cost centre
Manufacturing good example product cost centre
Basically opposite product cost centre direct cost involved
You probably think lot example service cost centre basically part company provides service cost centre example catering provides food manufacturing accounting
There step follow implement full costing departmental basis Also distinction Allocate assign cost particular department
Apportion cost spread across two department
There different criterion might use apportion cost across department There plenty could come
Now let work example
Here overhead Now information department company The first thing u apportion general overhead across department first let look table instead including full figure put proportion department using
For example sq ft floor area total assembly us cutting us maintenance us
The next step apportion overhead earlier based proportion Click bigger view Next maintenance service cost centre need apportion overhead incurs department product cost centre
As maintenance deal machine base value machinery
This quite straightforward calculation We continue use value machinery basis maintenance deal
From table earlier mean assembly count value machinery cutting maintenance
As eliminating maintenance calculation ratio change
Summing assembly cutting figure give total
Therefore assembly count cutting count
Now apply new proportion earlier apportioned maintenance
Now simply case adding figure overhead allocated assembly cutting department earlier The next step work overhead absorption rate department
This really easy like worked absorption rate previous post
Adding figure together brings total overhead cost job assuming spends one hour department
Note This talking full costing general full cost separated department

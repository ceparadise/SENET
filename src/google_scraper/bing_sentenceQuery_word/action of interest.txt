Despite relative youth Computer Science field academic study American society developed continues perpetuate specific image science
This image present set value appeal almost exclusively male
The predominantly us commercial computing technology Palm Pilots gadget reinforces image
Females little exposure field therefore often uninterested becoming involved subject many even develop marked aversion
The influence deter woman even considering Computer Science major categorized three area Despite fact people agree Computer Science field dominated male fact remains men far outnumber woman CS every level academia industry
This alone deter woman studying subject especially since many woman place high priority development abundant varied interpersonal relationship undergraduate year
More importantly however image CS simply male field field overrun male specific type computer geek
The computer geek phenomenon propagated largely medium strong evident root reality
He yes man tinkering computer technology since able read possibly even
These year experience alone given technical vocabulary participate discussion even sound like English outside listener
The geek fascinated computing technology exclusion interest
His study focus computer free time program read latest technology
His love programming gladly forego sleep meal personal hygiene order solve problem
Because obsession computer personal interaction others often limited awkward
This picture extreme every computer science department least several student fit bill
More commonly student portray several characteristic lifetime background tinkering computer intense interest technology obsessive compulsion work problem perfectly solved hour upon hour break necessary
There two major way image computer scientist serf deter woman entering field
First many woman conclude computer science foster culture want enter precisely quality perceive male
They feel often rightly trait would expected well
This problematic several level
First although behavior stereotypical computer male acceptable exhibit behavior female generally looked upon unfavorably
While badge honor man stay night finish program often weird antisocial woman
A man poor social skill assumed brilliant communicate effectively everyone else woman poor social skill imbalanced
In addition even outside attitude toward behavior many woman would still choose display
Women men emphasize aspect college life includes keeping active social extracurricular schedule one impossible maintain addition long nocturnal hour computer
Additionally woman emphasize social aspect college decidedly turned CS social awkwardness many computer science major see
The computer geek stereotype also deters woman entering computer science field emphasizes idea lot experience computer required academic study begin
Because girl interact computer le start later boy girl entering college often feel intimidated computer knowledge male peer
Concluding possibly compete successfully male computer class dismiss idea Computer Science major
In addition disliking image expectation people study Computer Science many woman deterred dislike material way presented university CS department
Far male woman cite lack human focus dry nature Computer Science coursework reason considering major field true engineering many science major CS
Studies show furthermore woman tend think computer tool men think machine mastered
The nature introductory CS course sense far masculine student taught program computer program useful beyond programming lesson teach
Female student often see point spending long hour writing useless program
They also categorize programming soulless task
They view programmer devoting time understanding machine people many woman priority set inexplicable bizarre something would choose spend single term let alone four year lifetime

This section highlight five major challenge repeatedly surfaced across five study component
The order challenge presented indication importance priority important consider effort improve state CS education
Computer science commonly accepted definition teacher student school leader PD provider interpret different way
Some view computer science computer application others consider programming still others describe logic modeling
These different point view contribute lack coherence instructional resource support provided teacher inconsistency instruction information communicated parent policy decision made school administrator
These different point view make challenging set goal metric necessary spread CS teaching learning leading intentionality clarity
Recommendation The CS education community need come agreement worth knowing CS learned student academic career
It invest development robust measure student learning use help describe quality CS teaching learning look like
While effort establish standard CS education widely embraced standard one piece needed
To build foundation CS education community need develop widely agreed upon standard student CS learning way measure
This would guide CS educator toward quality curriculum assessment professional development teaching practice turn enable clearly communicate advocate CS education
Instructional resource refers coherent set curriculum pedagogical resource inform instruction teacher knowledge student progress
CS teacher access range quality instructional resource teacher subject enjoy
Recommendation Support development comprehensive instructional material
Like subject many case even student entering CS course typically bring vastly different background level experience
A variety instructional resource support school teacher making decision best meet need CS student
These instructional material reflect growing knowledge student learn informed knowledge design implementation instructional resource large scale though research needed aspect
In discipline instructional material help student learn also help teacher improve practice
Instructional material support specific teacher professional development provide teacher assessment tool inform teaching daily basis
There little incentive school district include CS course
There requirement college level state requirement basic course material computer expensive purchase maintain
The decision include CS course fall individual school district level
Coupled lack instructional material result vastly different experience student across country
CS course also tend ephemeral leaving school funding reduced CS teacher leave school phenomenon directly tied CS course lack priority
Recommendation Establish policy enable school district prioritize CS coursework student access quality CS education
These policy developed careful consideration student learning requirement student schedule pay careful attention change management issue arise within school result implementation
There pathway become CS teacher
Furthermore little incentive teacher commit teaching CS school district generally prioritize CS coursework
Individuals CS experience many career option teaching
Those interest teaching find resource education leading certification support related subject mathematics
Recommendation In short medium term develop deploy strategy help existing teacher become excellent CS teacher
In long term one expect CS course prioritized accompanied robust standard curriculum teacher professional development CS teaching emerge viable path
These change may increase number teacher entering CS teaching career
CS teacher colleague close share idea information discipline provide instructional support coaching
The lack colleague collaborator source new information CS instruction compounded low prioritization CS school lack instructional material lack criterion quality CS instruction
This make improving instruction difficult affect motivation
Recommendation Dedicate resource build sustain online network CS teaching learning leading including teacher school PD provider
If well designed network potential support improvement across school district state line

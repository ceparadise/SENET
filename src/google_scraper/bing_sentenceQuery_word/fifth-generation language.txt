A based problem solving using constraint given program rather using written programmer
Most language language
While designed build specific program language designed make computer solve given problem without programmer
This way user need worry problem need solved condition need met without worrying implement routine algorithm solve
language used mainly research
example language
These type language also built upon many originating
Then many
In language considered way future predicted would replace language system development exception
Most notably put much research money hoping design massive computer network machine using tool
However larger program built flaw approach became apparent
It turn given set constraint defining particular problem deriving efficient algorithm solve difficult problem
This crucial step yet automated still requires insight human programmer
Vendors known occasion advertise language
Most time actually sell higher level automation
Because hype faded away project eventually dropped awareness also dropped opened door vendor term marketing new tool without causing much controversy among current generation programmer

A fifth generation programming language grouping programming language build premise problem solved application built solve providing constraint program programming rather specifying algorithmically problem solved imperative programming
In essence programming language used denote property logic solution rather reached
Most logic programming language
A common misconception pertains practice vendor denote product essence product evolved enhanced tool
Also known generation language
The leap beyond sought taking different approach computational challenge solving problem
When programmer dictate solution look specifying condition constraint logical manner computer free search suitable solution
Most applicable problem solved approach currently found domain artificial intelligence
Considerable research invested development
As larger program built became apparent approach finding algorithm given problem description logical instruction set constraint hard problem
During wave hype preceded popularization prediction replace programming language gave way sober realization

The Present Beyond FGCS initiative Japan begun create computer using
It result massive research project Japan
It aimed create computer performance provide platform future development
There also unrelated Russian project also named computer see
In Trip report paper Ehud Shapiro focused FGCS project software foundation project captured rationale motivation driving huge project As part Japan effort become leader computer industry Institute New Generation Computer Technology launched revolutionary plan development large computer system applicable knowledge information processing system
These Fifth Generation computer built around concept logic programming
In order refute accusation Japan exploit knowledge abroad without contributing project stimulate original research make result available international research community
The term fifth generation intended convey system leap beyond existing machine
In computer using called first generation second third using fourth
Whereas previous computer generation focused increasing number logic element single CPU fifth generation widely believed time would instead turn massive number CPUs added performance
The project create computer period considered ended investment new sixth generation project would begin
Opinions outcome divided either failure ahead time
In late till early much talk generation computer hardware usually three generation
Omitted taxonomy computer based metal gear mechanical relay Mark I computer based Very Large Scale Integrated circuit
There also parallel set generation software Throughout multiple generation Japan largely follower computing arena building computer following British lead
The MITI decided attempt break pattern started looking small scale future computing
They asked JIPDEC indicate number future direction offered contract carry study along industry academia
It period term computer started used
Prior MITI guidance success improved steel industry creation oil automotive industry consumer electronics computer memory
MITI decided future going
However language written spoken form presented still present major obstacle computer
These hurdle could taken lightly
So MITI held conference invited people around world help
The primary field investigation initial project The project imagined computer performance using massively parallel
The aim build parallel computer artificial intelligence application using concurrent logic programming
The FGCS project vast finding contributed greatly development concurrent logic programming field
The target defined FGCS project develop Knowledge Information Processing system roughly meaning applied
The chosen tool implement goal
Logic programming approach characterized Maarten Van Emden one founder More technically summed two equation The Axioms typically used universal axiom restricted form called
The statement proved computation existential statement
The proof constructive provides value existentially quantified variable value constitute output computation
Logic programming thought something unified various gradient computer science
It seemed logic programming missing link knowledge engineering parallel computer architecture
In visit ICOT invented Concurrent novel concurrent programming language integrated logic programming concurrent programming
Concurrent Prolog logic programming language designed concurrent programming parallel execution
It embodies synchronization basic control mechanism
described language Report marked ICOT Technical Report presented Concurrent Prolog written Prolog
Shapiro work Concurrent Prolog inspired change direction FGCS focusing parallel implementation Prolog focus software foundation project
It also inspired concurrent logic programming language Guarded Horn Clauses GHC Ueda basis programming language finally designed implemented FGCS project core programming language
The project imagined computer running top massive opposed traditional using define access data
They envisioned building prototype machine performance LIPS LIPS At time typical workstation machine capable LIPS
They proposed build machine period year initial R D year building various subsystem final year complete working prototype system
In government decided go ahead project established joint investment various Japanese computer company
So ingrained belief parallel computing future performance gain project generated great deal apprehension computer field
After seen Japanese take field apparently world Japanese reputation invincibility
Soon parallel project set US MCC UK Europe ESPRIT well ECRC collaboration Britain France Germany
Five running PIM eventually produced
The project also produced application run system parallel Kappa automated well application
The FGCS Project meet commercial success reason similar company
The highly parallel computer architecture eventually surpassed speed le specialized hardware example Sun workstation machine
The project produce new generation promising Japanese researcher
But FGCS Project stopped funding computer research project research momentum developed FGCS Project dissipated
However embarked Sixth Generation Project
A primary problem choice concurrent logic programming bridge parallel computer architecture use logic knowledge representation problem solving language AI application
This never happened cleanly number language developed limitation
In particular committed choice feature interfered logical semantics language
Another problem existing CPU performance quickly pushed obvious barrier expert perceived value parallel computing quickly dropped point time used niche situation
Although number increasing capacity designed built project lifespan generally found soon outperformed shelf unit available commercially
The project also suffered wrong side technology curve
During lifespan became mainstream computer enabled locally stored database become distributed even simple research project provided better result data mining
Moreover project found promise largely negated use committed choice
At end period project spent billion US million exchange rate terminated without met goal
The workstation appeal market general purpose system could take job even outrun
This parallel Lisp machine market system could run computer making expensive Lisp machine unnecessary
In spite possibility considering project failure many approach envisioned project logic programming distributed massive current technology
For example OWL employ several layer knowledge representation system
It appears however new technology reinvented rather leveraged approach investigated initiative
In early century many flavor began proliferate including architecture high end
When CPUs began move GHz range problem became important
The ability produce single CPU system linked periodic doubling transistor count began threatened
Ordinary consumer machine began parallel processor like
company like Nvidia AMD began introducing large parallel system like open CL
Again however clear development facilitated significant way project
In summary strong case made project ahead time debatable whether counter justifies claim failure

The plan overhaul computer technology create
During World War II Sperry Band IBM created considered first generation computer
From computer evolved include different language including Fortran formula processing LISP list processing
European developer created another generation PROLOG abbreviated logic programming
To help join technology race Japanese government started fifth generation project
The goal use technology like PROLOG eliminate number issue make computer technology easier operate

A used produce various kind
Programming language generally consist
Programming language used create implement specific
The earliest known programmable machine preceded automatic flute player described century
From early program used direct behavior machine
Thousands different programming language created mainly computer field many still created every year
Many programming language require computation specified form sequence operation perform language use form program specification form
desired result specified achieve
The description programming language usually split two component form meaning
Some language defined specification document example programming language specified Standard language dominant treated
Some language basic language defined standard extension taken dominant implementation common
A programming language notation writing specification computation
Some author restrict term programming language language express possible algorithm
Traits often considered important constitutes programming language include like define usually considered programming language
Programming language may however share syntax markup language computational semantics defined
example XML dialect
Moreover mostly used structuring document also contains Turing complete subset
The term sometimes used interchangeably programming language
However usage term varies among author including exact scope
One usage describes programming language subset computer language
In vein language used computing different goal expressing computer program generically designated computer language
For instance markup language sometimes referred computer language emphasize meant used programming
Another usage regard programming language theoretical construct programming abstract machine computer language subset thereof run physical computer finite hardware resource
emphasizes language much programming language language intended execution
He also argues textual even graphical input format affect behavior computer programming language despite fact commonly remark ignorance programming language concept reason many flaw input format
The earliest computer often programmed without help programming language writing program absolute
The program decimal binary form read toggled switch computer
Absolute machine language later termed
The next step development still closely tied specific computer
These served make program much relieved programmer tedious address calculation
The first written
An early programming language designed computer developed German
However implemented
proposed one first language ever developed
Unlike Short Code statement represented mathematical expression understandable form
However program translated every time ran making process much slower running equivalent
At developed early
A used automatically convert language machine code
The first code compiler developed computer University Manchester considered first programming language
The second autocode developed Mark called Mark Autocode
Brooker also developed autocode conjunction University Manchester
The version devised
Known EDSAC Autocode straight development Mercury Autocode adapted local circumstance noted object code optimisation diagnostics advanced time
A contemporary separate thread development developed University Manchester machine
In invented IBM
It first widely used functional implementation opposed design paper
It still popular language used program benchmark rank world
Another early programming language devised US called
It developed period
Hopper found business data processing customer uncomfortable mathematical notation early team wrote specification programming language implemented prototype
The compiler became publicly available early substantially complete
major influence design since direct descendant actual use time
The increased use language introduced requirement
These language varying degree provide facility assembly language language used perform task require direct access hardware facility still provide control structure
The period late brought development major language paradigm use Each language spawned descendant modern programming language count least one ancestry
The also saw considerable debate merit whether programming language designed support
famous letter published argued statement eliminated higher level programming language
The year relative consolidation
combined system programming
The United States government standardized system programming language derived intended use defense contractor
In Japan elsewhere vast sum spent investigating incorporated logic programming construct
The functional language community moved standardize Lisp
Rather inventing new paradigm movement elaborated upon idea invented previous decade
One important trend language design programming system increased focus use organizational unit code
Ada ML developed notable module system often wedded construct
The rapid growth created opportunity new language
originally Unix scripting tool first released became common dynamic
came used programming bytecode virtual machine became popular commercial setting promise popular time early
These development fundamentally novel rather refinement many existing language paradigm although syntax often based C family programming language
Programming language evolution continues industry research
Current direction include security reliability verification new kind modularity database integration Microsoft
computer programming language aim provide higher level abstraction internal computer hardware detail
programming language based solving problem using constraint given program rather using written programmer
All programming language building block description data process transformation applied like addition two number selection item collection
These primitive defined syntactic semantic rule describe structure meaning respectively
A programming language surface form known
Most programming language purely textual use sequence text including word number punctuation much like written natural language
On hand programming language nature using visual relationship symbol specify program
The syntax language describes possible combination symbol form syntactically correct program
The meaning given combination symbol handled semantics either
Since language textual article discus textual syntax
Programming language syntax usually defined using combination structure structure
Below simple grammar based This grammar specifies following The following example token sequence grammar
Not syntactically correct program semantically correct
Many syntactically correct program nonetheless per language rule may depending language specification soundness implementation result error translation execution
In case program may exhibit
Even program within language may still meaning intended person wrote
Using example may possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may false The following fragment syntactically correct performs operation semantically defined operation meaning value complex type defined value If first line omitted program would trigger error compilation variable p would defined
But program would still syntactically correct since type declaration provide semantic information
The grammar needed specify programming language classified position
The syntax programming language specified using grammar
Some language including Perl Lisp contain construct allow execution parsing phase
Languages construct allow programmer alter behavior parser make syntax analysis generally blur distinction parsing execution
In contrast Perl block may contain general computation C macro merely string replacement require code execution
The term refers meaning language opposed form
The static semantics defines restriction structure valid text hard impossible express standard syntactic formalism
For compiled language static semantics essentially include semantic rule checked compile time
Examples include checking every declared used language require declaration label arm distinct
Many important restriction type like checking identifier used appropriate context
adding integer function name call appropriate number type argument enforced defining rule called
Other form like may also part static semantics
Newer programming language like form data flow analysis part static semantics
Once data specified machine must instructed perform operation data
For example semantics may define expression evaluated value manner conditionally execute
The also known language defines various construct language produce program behavior
There many way defining execution semantics
Natural language often used specify execution semantics language commonly used practice
A significant amount academic research went allow execution semantics specified formal manner
Results field research seen limited application programming language design implementation outside academia
A type system defines programming language classifies value expression manipulate type interact
The goal type system verify usually enforce certain level correctness program written language detecting certain incorrect operation
Any type system involves reject many incorrect program also prohibit correct albeit unusual program
In order bypass downside number language usually unchecked may used programmer explicitly allow normally disallowed operation different type
In typed language type system used program number language usually functional one relieving programmer need write type annotation
The formal design study type system known
A language specification every operation defines type data operation applicable implication applicable type
For example data represented many programming language dividing number string meaning rejected compiler
The invalid operation may detected program compiled static type checking rejected compiler compilation error message may detected program run dynamic type checking resulting
Many language allow function called exception handler written handle exception example always return result
A special case typed language language
These often scripting markup language one data commonly character string used symbolic numeric data
In contrast allows operation performed data generally considered sequence bit various length
language untyped include variety
In practice language considered typed point view verifying rejecting operation modern language offer degree typing
Many production language provide mean bypass subvert type system trading finer control program execution see
In expression type determined prior program executed typically
For example integer expression passed function expects string stored variable defined hold date
Statically typed language either
In first case programmer must explicitly write type certain textual position example variable
In second case compiler type expression declaration based context
Most mainstream statically typed language manifestly typed
Complete type inference traditionally associated le mainstream language
However many manifestly typed language support partial type inference example infer type certain limited case
Additionally programming language allow type automatically converted type example int used program expects float
also called determines operation run time word type associated rather
As language dynamically typed language require programmer write explicit type annotation expression
Among thing may permit single variable refer value different type different point program execution
However type automatically detected piece code actually executed potentially making difficult
example dynamically typed language
allows value one type treated another example treating number
This occasionally useful also allow kind program fault go undetected even
prevents
An attempt perform operation wrong type value raise error
Strongly typed language often termed
An alternative definition weakly typed refers language permit large number implicit type conversion
In JavaScript example expression implicitly convert number conversion succeeds even string letter
Such implicit conversion often useful mask programming error
generally considered orthogonal concept usage literature differs
Some use term mean even confusingly mean simply
Thus called strongly typed weakly statically typed
It may seem odd professional programmer C could weakly statically typed
However notice use generic pointer pointer allow casting pointer pointer without needing explicit cast
This extremely similar somehow casting array byte kind datatype C without using explicit cast
Most programming language associated core sometimes known library especially included part published language standard conventionally made available implementation language
Core library typically include definition commonly used algorithm data structure mechanism input output
The line language core library differs language language
In case language designer may treat library separate entity language
However language core library often treated part language user language specification even require library made available implementation
Indeed language designed meaning certain syntactic construct even described without referring core library
For example string literal defined instance class similarly expression block construct instance library class
Conversely contains multiple coherent subset suffice construct rest language library macro language designer even bother say portion language must implemented language construct must implemented part library
Programming language share property natural language related purpose vehicle communication syntactic form separate semantics showing related language branching one another
But artificial construct also differ fundamental way language evolved usage
A significant difference programming language fully described studied entirety since precise finite definition
By contrast natural language changing meaning given user different community
While also artificial language designed ground specific purpose lack precise complete semantic definition programming language
Many programming language designed scratch altered meet new need combined language
Many eventually fallen disuse
Although attempt design one universal programming language serf purpose failed generally accepted filling role
The need diverse programming language arises diversity context language used One common trend development programming language add ability solve problem using higher level
The earliest programming language tied closely underlying hardware computer
As new programming language developed feature added let programmer express idea remote simple translation underlying hardware instruction
Because programmer le tied complexity computer program computing le effort programmer
This let write functionality per time unit
proposed way eliminate need specialized language programming
However goal remains distant benefit open debate
took position use formal language essential prevent introduction meaningless construct dismissed foolish
similarly dismissive idea
Hybrid approach taken
A language designer user must construct number artifact govern enable practice programming
The important artifact language
The specification programming language artifact language use agree upon whether piece valid language behavior shall
A programming language specification take several form including following An programming language provides way write program language execute one configuration hardware software
There broadly two approach programming language implementation
It generally possible implement language using either technique
The output may executed hardware program called interpreter
In implementation make use interpreter approach distinct boundary compiling interpreting
For instance implementation compile execute source line time
Programs executed directly hardware usually run several order magnitude faster interpreted software
One technique improving performance interpreted program
Here execution translates block going used machine code direct execution hardware
Although commonly used programming language fully open specification implementation many programming language exist proprietary programming language implementation available single vendor may claim proprietary language intellectual property
Proprietary programming language commonly internal single product proprietary language used internally within vendor others available external user
Some programming language exist border proprietary open example asserts proprietary right aspect programming language open implementation part system also CLR closed environment
Many proprietary language widely used spite proprietary nature example include
Some language may make transition closed open example originally Ericsson internal programming language
Thousands different programming language created mainly computing field
Software commonly built programming language
Programming language differ form human expression require greater degree precision completeness
When using natural language communicate people human author speaker ambiguous make small error still expect intent understood
However figuratively speaking computer exactly told understand code programmer intended write
The combination language definition program program input must fully specify external behavior occurs program executed within domain control program
On hand idea algorithm communicated human without precision required execution using interleaf natural language code written programming language
A programming language provides structured mechanism defining piece data operation transformation may carried automatically data
A us present language represent concept involved computation
These concept represented collection simplest element available called
process programmer combine primitive compose new program adapt existing one new us changing environment
Programs computer might without human interaction user might type
In case command simply program whose execution chained together
When language run command interpreter without compiling called
It difficult determine programming language widely used usage mean varies context
One language may occupy greater number programmer hour different one line code third may consume CPU time
Some language popular particular kind application
For example still strong corporate data center often large scientific engineering application aerospace transportation military embedded application embedded application operating system
Other language regularly used write many different kind application
Various method measuring language popularity subject different bias measured proposed Combining averaging information various internet site claim ten popular programming language descending order overall popularity
There overarching classification scheme programming language
A given programming language usually single ancestor language
Languages commonly arise combining element several predecessor language new idea circulation time
Ideas originate one language diffuse throughout family related language leap suddenly across familial gap appear entirely different family
The task complicated fact language classified along multiple ax
For example Java language encourages organization concurrent language contains construct running multiple parallel

In broad stroke programming language divide classification distinguished
Traditionally programming language regarded describing computation term imperative sentence
issuing command
These generally called language
A great deal research programming language aimed blurring distinction program set instruction program assertion desired answer main feature
More refined paradigm include language hybrid paradigm
An much paradigm direct model underlying machine architecture
By purpose programming language might considered general purpose scripting language language language combination
Some general purpose language designed largely educational goal
A programming language may also classified factor unrelated programming paradigm
For instance programming language use keywords
Other language may classified

User Experience Research Training Consulting The Fifth Generation project large Japanese research project aiming producing new kind computer
It originally started much debate necessity significantly usable computer proliferate like air throughout society among thing take care ageing population learning
The MITI people sponsored project must good marketing consultant pick name project name inspired lot interest around world
This conference held report result intermediate phase project final phase integrating together innovation complete computer system
Unfortunately result somewhat disappointing perspective whether something new could done fifth generation computer
Most application presented conference interesting X done logic programming X done better
The hope course final computer fast enough run program infeasible normal computer
We wait see
The project director Kazuhiro Fuchi gave keynote speech compared three project stage hop step jump saying taken step getting ready jump final part project produce massively parallel machine
Fuchi also enthusiastic natural language processing said would link human machine project
Many Japanese scientist engineer I talked outside Fifth Generation project actually quite skeptical direction project hopeful spectacular result
Maybe even project leader feeling since started new laboratory research within project
The purpose laboratory verify whether parallel computer system software built laboratory used next generation expert system
Actually extent biggest result Fifth generation project came even started research since fact Japanese big computer project scared lot European American decision maker half death
Fortunately scared completely death instead decided funding lot new research different computer field
Some project started result European Esprit British Alvey American MCC
Representatives three initiative invited conference report progress fairly substantial
Timothy Walker Information Engineering Directorate told varying British information technology project succeeded getting number key scientist return overseas
Several change made project year including name change changing AI knowledge based system lowered expectation
On hand area interaction receiving emphasis At start Alvey project year ago HCI might seen important much done whereas realized make serious effort ensure usability
Walker said HCI could either done independent field study integrated topic chosen base project mostly latter view
Jörg Siekmann University Kaiserslauten West Germany discussed potential future impact AI computer technology
His main moving towards society research take productive force called something impressive long German word
This analogy industrial revolution agriculture suddenly could done small part population major force became industrial production
Now production also handled small number people number scientist hand growing rapidly
Siekmann reported number book university library double every year
The knowledge explosion already reached level find whether result previous experiment used
New method would needed handle information able use science force provides substantially improved new product even product conceive today
As example traditionally could think bank building computer network nature service changed handful programmer head office
This view large extent true come user interface research
Ideas hypertext represent fundamentally technology least potential give knowledge worker significantly improved productivity creativity scope analysis
One invited lecture given Nobel Prize winner Herb Simon Carnegie Mellon University discussed history future cognitive science
Perhaps heavy focus hardware development fifth generation project mind Simon asked whether hardware speed really bottleneck progress cognitive science field
In area like chess playing clearly general Simon felt hardware real issue came idea pushing forward cognitive science since normally necessary program perform real time
Actually even chess playing Simon stressed best human player quite slow look maybe state making move
A computer may look million position make move probably right way looking problem would remove need fast hardware
In many particular domain program exist surpass human intelligence
In hindsight Simon felt able predict expert system would easier common sense sensory apparatus since system evolutionary much older human expertise
To get knowledge system basically two method learning used get knowledge human programming used get knowledge computer
Currently use programming human maybe would solve many problem AI could shift using learning computer
Simon discussed several research frontier within cognitive science including robotics natural language one interesting issue raised need method representation knowledge diagram picture
Currently use method showing file belong folder showing icon within window
But visual language quite primitive expressive power compared verbal language spite prevalence representation human reasoning
One interesting presentation conference user interface perspective given Keiji Hirata NTT talked played jazz
The goal work produce workstation musician called ICOTone generate jazz music
Hirata encoded music theory tension concept jazz PSI Personal Sequential Inference machine thereby allowing user construct jazz performance interactively specifying different aspect piece
Users could specify different amount jazz information depending level skill expert user get high degree control result novice still get computer play jazz
Hirata finished presentation playing tape performance system fairly good sound jazzy
I going throw away Dizzy Gillespie CDs yet replace system though since jazz workstation nature interesting piece research showing hope future
Besides going conference I also lectured meeting people Dynaware Kyoto Institute Technology Nippon Telegraph Telephone NTT Tokyo Denki University
Dynaware introduced small software company
I visited company fairly late evening dinner home host wonderful green tea even PM Dynaware office crowded
They showed several integrated system advanced graphic editor nicely polished user interface
Unfortunately exception Dynaware design user interface I saw Japan polished visually attractive
This especially strange considering country famous high sense aesthetic even small thing
And blandly looking design blamed poor graphic capability either since everybody seemed big display
My guess emphasis Japanese user interface design accommodating special character set language including heavy emphasis natural language knowledge based system
If system good dealing Japanese something useful sell matter look
So probably important aspect Japanese user interface one I qualified judge
I showed lot menu interface element Kanji report one small point In one system command listed Kanji undo command still listed English
I asked told able come good translation concept perfectly happy one word European character
My experience confirms The original translation undo Danish Macintosh system completely miserable glem many novice user scared use study laboratory
In current release Apple Denmark changed much better fortryd
Except impressive graphic appearance user interface several impressive aspect Japanese work user interface
Advanced hardware one area big Japanese electronics company extremely well I shown impressive advance optical medium also saw nice hypermedia system using videodisk knowledge based interface
Another interesting system translation system would scan page English magazine OCR phase translate text Japanese keep page layout text relation illustration
One bigger user interface project Japan design Hiroshi Tamura colleague hypertext system Japanese translation
Just translation major project one parceled user interface professional several company
The hypertext presentation system built somewhat faster using dBase III engine
Considering least two hypertext system built information base would interesting perform comparative experiment look effectiveness different hypertext approach
If experiment include Japanese system must either done entirely Japan intercontinental collaboration would probably first field
One spectacular user interface idea I shown Japan electronic stationary good project University Tokyo managed Ken Sakamura
The idea externalize desktop metaphor computer screen unit use
pen instead mouse
This course done many system Tron people went several step also included kind desktop item computer peripheral
I especially impressed electronic eraser looked like ordinary eraser used erase pencil mark could used computer tablet delete mark computer screen
It interesting experience use paint program physically changing using pen eraser instead using mouse select soft mode list icon screen panel
Of course weakness new approach may user would confused wide variety tool used modern paint program physical object Their office would end looking like studio graphic artist lot pen knife etc
place
On way Japan I stopped Singapore I visited Institute Systems Science ISS National University Singapore NUS
Probably sponsorship IBM lot IBM RT workstation exactly computer see lot laboratory
But machine good enough nice display designed good user interface using scanned color photograph well standard trapping icon etc
Of course thing I would done differently I also saw one case mixed navigational metaphor I find problem almost half laboratory I visit example many design used icon visual effect
In general user interface I saw Singapore looked good also demonstrated interesting theoretical concept generation hypertext structure knowledge representation
The gracefully invited annual institute party fun event multilingual joke pun English Arabic Tamil Mandarin well Chinese dialect
There doubt Singapore one country future ISS lead way locally well contribute international user interface community
Wherever I went Asia everybody asked whether I seen NeXT machine
And since I embarrassed say I glad finally get chance see machine several year rumor net I stopped US way back Europe
I stopped New Mexico participate ACM Conference Document Processing Systems demonstration session display NeXT computer Adobe exhibit Display Postscript
On purely emotional level seeing NeXT cube struck somewhat like seeing Lisa back fact I later noticed editorial NeXT December heading The feeling computer looked different one I used
It amazing much careful use four level grayscale visual appearance computer screen
Dialog box almost effect input field seem chiseled
Things still thrown away dragging bottom right corner screen instead trash strange icon I could understand
Upon asking I told black hole
Cute cute indeed avoid lawsuit
But black hole kind user interface metaphor average neighborhood grocer likely relate
Of course might say grocer one intended customer computer five year
The poor guy Adobe going use NeXT demo Display Postscript swamped request demonstration NeXT interface rather rendering software
After people much interesting written computer screen pixel get turned black

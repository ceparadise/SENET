In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

In finite
That consists finitely many edge directed one vertex another way start vertex follow sequence edge eventually loop back
Equivalently DAG directed graph sequence vertex every edge directed earlier later sequence
DAGs model many different kind information
A modeled DAG vertex cell edge whenever formula one cell us value another topological ordering DAG used update cell value spreadsheet changed
Similarly topological ordering DAGs used order compilation operation
The us DAGs model milestone activity large human project schedule project use little total time possible
block electronic circuit design operation language involve acyclic network processing element
DAGs also represent collection event influence either probabilistic structure record historical data version history system
DAGs also used sequence data representation collection string representation sequence binary choice
More abstractly relation DAG form partial order may represented DAG using reachability
Important computational problem DAGs include finding topological ordering construction largest smallest DAGs reachability relation respectively goal find subset vertex edge connecting rest graph
Transforming directed graph cycle DAG deleting vertex edge possible problem respectively directed graph made DAG contracting single supervertex
The problem finding solved DAGs contrast arbitrary graph shortest path algorithm slower longest path problem
The corresponding concept undirected graph without cycle
Choosing orientation forest produce special kind directed acyclic graph called
However many kind directed acyclic graph formed orienting edge undirected acyclic graph
Moreover every undirected graph assignment direction edge make directed acyclic graph
To emphasize DAGs thing directed version undirected acyclic graph author call
A formed collection vertex structureless object connected pair edge
In case edge orientation one vertex another vertex
A directed graph described sequence edge property ending vertex edge sequence starting vertex next edge sequence path form cycle starting vertex first edge equal ending vertex last edge
A directed acyclic graph directed graph cycle
A vertex directed graph said another vertex exists path start end
As special case every vertex considered reachable path zero edge
If vertex reach via nontrivial path path one edge path cycle another way define directed acyclic graph graph vertex reach via nontrivial path
A directed graph ordering vertex sequence every edge start vertex edge occurs earlier sequence ending vertex edge
A graph topological ordering cycle edge earliest vertex cycle would oriented wrong way
Therefore every graph topological ordering acyclic
Conversely every directed acyclic graph least one topological ordering
Therefore property used alternative definition directed acyclic graph exactly graph topological ordering
The relationship directed acyclic graph formalized vertex DAG
In partial order two vertex ordered exactly exists directed path DAG reachable
However different DAGs may give rise reachability relation partial order
For example DAG two edge reachability relation graph three edge
Both DAGS produce partial order vertex ordered
If DAG graph edge represents reachability relation
It edge whenever reach
That edge every related pair distinct element reachability relation may therefore thought direct translation reachability relation term
The method translating partial order DAGs work generally every finite partially ordered set graph vertex member edge pair element related automatically transitively closed DAG reachability relation
In way every finite partially ordered set represented reachability relation DAG
The DAG graph fewest edge represents reachability relation
It subgraph formed discarding edge also contains longer path connecting two vertex
Like transitive closure transitive reduction uniquely defined DAGs
In contrast directed graph acyclic one minimal subgraph reachability relation
If DAG reachability relation described partial order transitive reduction subgraph edge every pair
Transitive reduction useful visualizing partial order represent fewer edge graph representing order therefore lead simpler
A partial order drawing transitive reduction orientation edge shown placing starting vertex edge lower position ending vertex
Every directed acyclic graph ordering vertex starting endpoint every edge occurs earlier ordering ending endpoint edge
The existence ordering used characterize DAGs directed graph DAG topological ordering
In general ordering unique DAG unique topological ordering directed path containing vertex case ordering order vertex appear path
The family topological ordering DAG family reachability relation DAG two graph representing partial order set topological order
The problem counting directed acyclic graph studied
The number DAGs labeled vertex without restriction order number appear topological ordering DAG These number may computed conjectured proved number count positive
The proof matrix DAG matrix eigenvalue positive denotes
Because DAG adjacency matrix must zero diagonal adding preserve property matrix coefficient
A directed graph formed orienting edge
Every polytree DAG
In particular true formed directing edge outwards root tree
A also called strongly unambiguous graph mangrove directed graph one directed path either direction two vertex equivalently DAG every vertex subgraph reachable form tree
algorithmic problem finding topological ordering given DAG
It solved
Kahn algorithm topological sorting build vertex ordering directly
It maintains list vertex incoming edge vertex already included partially constructed topological ordering initially list consists vertex incoming edge
Then repeatedly add one vertex list end partially constructed topological ordering check whether neighbor added list
The algorithm terminates vertex processed way
Alternatively topological ordering may constructed reversing numbering graph traversal
It also possible check whether given directed graph DAG linear time either attempting find topological ordering testing edge whether resulting ordering valid alternatively topological sorting algorithm verifying algorithm successfully order vertex without meeting error condition
Any undirected graph may made DAG choosing vertex directing every edge earlier endpoint order later endpoint
The resulting edge called
Different total order may lead acyclic orientation graph fewer acyclic orientation
The number acyclic orientation equal given graph
Any directed graph may made DAG removing set vertex edge respectively touch cycle
However smallest set find
An arbitrary directed graph may also transformed DAG called single supervertex
When graph already acyclic smallest feedback vertex set feedback arc set condensation graph
The transitive closure given DAG vertex edge may constructed time using either test reachability vertex
Alternatively solved time exponent theoretical improvement bound
In transitive closure algorithm possible distinguish pair vertex reachable least one path length two pair connected path
The transitive reduction consists edge form path path connecting endpoint
Therefore transitive reduction constructed asymptotic time bound transitive closure
The take input directed acyclic graph weight vertex seek minimum maximum weight closure set vertex outgoing edge
The problem may formulated directed graph without assumption acyclicity greater generality case equivalent problem condensation graph
It may solved polynomial time using reduction
Some algorithm become simpler used DAGs instead general graph based principle topological ordering
For example possible find given starting vertex DAGs linear time processing vertex topological order calculating path length vertex minimum maximum length obtained via incoming edge
In contrast arbitrary graph shortest path may require slower algorithm longest path arbitrary graph find
Directed acyclic graph representation partial ordering many application system task ordering constraint
An important class problem type concern collection object need updated cell one cell changed piece computer software changed
In context graph vertex object updated edge connecting two object whenever one need updated earlier
A cycle graph called generally allowed would way consistently schedule task involved cycle
Dependency graph without circular dependency form DAGs
For instance one cell change necessary recalculate value cell depend directly indirectly changed cell
For problem task scheduled recalculation value individual cell spreadsheet
Dependencies arise expression one cell us value another cell
In case value used must recalculated earlier expression us
Topologically ordering dependency graph using topological order schedule cell update allows whole spreadsheet updated single evaluation per cell
Similar problem task ordering arise program compilation computer program optimization
A somewhat different formulation scheduling constraint used PERT method management large human project one first application DAGs
In method vertex DAG represent project rather specific task performed
Instead task activity represented edge DAG connecting two milestone mark beginning completion task
Each edge labeled estimate amount time take team worker perform task
The DAG represents project one control total time project
Individual milestone scheduled according length longest path ending vertex
A directed acyclic graph may used represent network processing element
In representation data enters processing element incoming edge leaf element outgoing edge
For instance electronic circuit design static block represented acyclic system computes function input input output function represented individual
In general output block used input unless captured register state element maintains acyclic property
Electronic circuit schematic either paper database form directed acyclic graph using instance component form directed reference lower level component
Electronic circuit necessarily acyclic directed
language describe system operation connection output operation input others
These language convenient describing repetitive data processing task collection operation applied many data item
They executed operation performed parallel process soon another set input becomes available
In straight line code sequence statement without loop conditional branch may represented DAG describing input output arithmetic operation performed within code
This representation allows compiler perform efficiently
At higher level code organization state dependency module component large software system form directed acyclic graph
Graphs vertex represent event occurring definite time edge always point early time vertex late time vertex edge necessarily directed acyclic
The lack cycle follows time associated vertex always increase follow graph never return vertex path
This reflects natural intuition causality mean event affect future never affect past thus
An example type directed acyclic graph encountered though case graph considered
The version history example version software associated unique time typically time version saved committed released
For citation graph document published one time refer older document
Sometimes event associated specific physical time
Provided pair event purely causal relationship edge represent event directed acyclic graph
For instance represents system probabilistic event vertex directed acyclic graph likelihood event may calculated likelihood predecessor DAG
In context DAG undirected graph created adding undirected edge parent vertex sometimes called replacing directed edge undirected edge
Another type graph similar causal structure vertex represent either decision made unknown information edge represent causal influence one vertex another
In instance diagram often used estimate expected value different choice intervention
The converse also true
That application represented directed acyclic graph causal structure either explicit order time example order derived derived graph structure
This follows directed acyclic graph
least one way put vertex order edge point direction along order
may seen directed acyclic graph vertex family member edge relationship
Despite name graph necessarily tree possibility marriage relative child common ancestor mother father side causing
The graph descent mother relationship woman descent father relationship men tree within graph
Because one become ancestor family tree acyclic
For reason version history system generally structure directed acyclic graph vertex revision edge connecting pair revision directly derived
These tree general due merges
In many algorithm maintains representing version history geometric structure course sequence change structure
For instance algorithm triangulation change replacing one triangle three smaller triangle point added flip operation replace pair triangle different pair triangle
The history DAG algorithm vertex triangle constructed part algorithm edge triangle two three triangle replace
This structure allows query answered efficiently find location query point Delaunay triangulation follow path history DAG step moving replacement triangle contains
The final triangle reached path must Delaunay triangle contains
In vertex document single publication date
The edge represent citation bibliography one document necessarily earlier document
The classic example come citation academic paper pointed article Networks Scientific Papers
In case paper corresponding vertex citation network
This important measure
provide another example judge support conclusion one case recalling earlier decision made previous case
A final example provided patent must refer earlier earlier patent relevant current patent claim
By taking special property directed acyclic graph account one analyse graph technique available analysing general graph considered many study
For instance give new insight citation distribution found different application highlighting clear difference mechanism creating citation network different context
Another technique trace citation link suggests significant citation chain given
Directed acyclic graph may also used collection sequence
In type application one find DAG path form given sequence
When many sequence share subsequence shared subsequence represented shared part DAG allowing representation use le space would take list sequence separately
For example computer science formed directed acyclic graph single source edge labeled letter symbol path source sink graph represent set English word
Any set sequence represented path tree forming tree vertex every prefix sequence making parent one vertex represent sequence one fewer element tree formed way set string called
A directed acyclic word graph save space trie allowing path diverge rejoin set word possible suffix represented single tree vertex
The idea using DAG represent family path occurs data structure representing binary function
In binary decision diagram vertex labeled name binary variable sink edge labeled
The function value variable value sink found following path starting single source vertex vertex follows outgoing edge labeled value vertex variable
Just directed acyclic word graph viewed compressed form try binary decision diagram viewed compressed form save space allowing path rejoin agree result remaining decision

A tree hierarchical data structure
Generally tree consists value together pointer tree
For example could see class definition like Here child array pointer also hold value
At point child array empty make tree child base case recursive definition tree
When draw pointer line look like tree hence name
Here root node A
The child list A pointer B C Then child list C contains H I example The child list leaf node empty called leaf node see tree top
As might imagine tree useful representing hierarchy object
They also useful maintaining set number collection number subdivided smaller range hierarchically
A tree abstract data type node consists one element number upper bound tree node one one parent except root parent
The consequence two may equal ie content equivalent ca exactly one path node therefore loop
Since I specify rather arc tree I imply unidirectional flow specify
Really come thing tree defined parent therefore far tree concerned nothing go reverse direction
There formal abstract data type notation define tree general specific tree
These give form set notation lambda calculus formal version
It useful use formal notation eliminate ambiguity provide mean testing implementation ensure terminology consistent work across language
A plain English description good enough though
A different approach start graph collection node node point arbitrary number node arc may circular restrict spanning tree graph one path given point arc unidirectional
It produce different abstract form form start readily generalized
Finding effect two distinct ADTs always easy
In A tree information structure capable apparatus arranging information object taking account key
It valuable sorting different information object regarding various leveled connection think family tree youngster assembled guardian tree
The binary tree essential information structure utilized part software engineering
The binary tree valuable information structure quickly putting away sorted information quickly recovering put away information
A binary tree made guardian hub leaf store information furthermore connection two youngster hub leaf envisioned spatially beneath first hub one set one side one set one side
It relationship leaf connected connecting leaf otherwise called guardian hub make binary tree effective information structure
It leaf left lesser key worth quality used hunt leaf tree leaf right equivalent noteworthy key quality
Thus leaf distant left tree least value though leaf privilege tree best value
All vitally every leaf join two different abandon start another littler binary tree
Because nature conceivable effortlessly get embed information binary tree utilizing look embed work recursively approached progressive take

Alternatively counting number descendant also sink would useful
A probabilistic approach would way represent set descendant every node
The union structure trivial cardinality union estimated number coincidence
However I sure well behaved would propagating DAG intuitively look like error would compound pretty fast
Very related And actually duplicate This question came site professional enthusiast programmer
This course expensive node degree large
Worst case complexity may significantly better unspecified naive algorithm
The issue difficult problem solve
Suppose DAG million node million edge etc
I show portion graph How many descendant

The Tree Relationship Calculator object accepts XML representation tree calculate relationship two member within
This article describes relationship calculated term like second cousin first cousin removed mean
This code includes object calculating relationship written JavaScript well web UI rendering interacting tree
The setup classic ASP page
Trees data structure many application Computer Science
structure represent complex linking component
Specifically tree type graph node one parent zero child node
The topmost node tree called root node node tree root node
The parent node one linked directly current node
Much terminology used describing tree come name use describe family relationship
For example two node parent called sibling
We also use term ancestor descendant child describe relative position node
For reference I including link explain concept terminology discussed
The depth node another important concept use calculating relationship
If start given node move upwards parent would call one step
Moving parent parent would two step
If keep moving tree root node counting step would distance node root
While term like ancestor descendant offer vague reference relative position two node tree genealogist use much precise terminology describe relationship allows explain exact relative position two member
The term third cousin removed one example type relationship program calculate
There two component measure type relationship two people family tree measure distance horizontally vertically family member
The first component describes horizontal distance two family member measured far apart closest common relative
For example first cousin share common grandparent two level
A second cousin someone closest common ancestor great grand parent three level
To figure level cousin take number generation away closest common relative subtract one
A common parent mean second cousin common grand parent mean first cousin
A common parent mean call sibling
The diagram show Cyclops Hemera first cousin share common grandparent
The second component measure vertical distance tree describes far separated generation
This removed part phrase first cousin removed
For instance mother one generation older removed
Your grandmother two generation older twice removed
You direct descendent grandmother mother use removed terminology however principal distant relative
Your second cousin twice removed would generation grandmother
The diagram show Hemera Leto share Chaos closest common ancestor
Chaos two generation away Hemera four Leto
We use closer two determine cousin factor difference two calculate removed factor
This tell u Hemera Leto first cousin twice removed
Using two component calculate relationship member tree
Most immediate family special name relationship follow rule distant second third fourth cousin
For instance zero cousin removed would parent
Your zero cousin zero time removed sibling
The following table show named relationship match convention
Our program calculating relationship take input XML document representing family tree represented root node hold one node turn contains node contain node
Here entire representing example family tree
Our example partial family tree Greek god I created information found worth taking look
Here algorithm follow calculating arbitrary relationship Recursion two important concept Computer Science particularly useful dealing tree
To find position member program call recursive search function navigate node tree record current position go
When match found position saved
The position stored array one element array generation
The integer stored represents order child starting zero
For instance position array Hemera would tracking order child tree Chaos Nyx Hemera
Here recursive search function program
This function accepts XML node check see match either ID looking call child node
The function method initiate recursive search
Once search complete two array describe position member tree
The function called calculate relationship based position array
The function compare two array determines distance closest common ancestor member
This data sent calculate relationship
The function take distance member closest common ancestor calculate removed cousin factor relationship
This sent generates text name relationship
Finally function create text name relationship
For relationship simply need subtract factor get something like equal second cousin removed
For named relationship zero cousin etc
simple lookup match variable predefined name
The gender variable passed know use aunt instead uncle mother instead father
The function described make method object
The entire object found file
To calculate relationship simply instantiate object passing reference XML tree call function
The result string representation relationship
Our code also includes UI render XML visual tree using XHTML CSS

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ

At point helpful introduce terminology
The simply node top tree diagram
In case one containing
Note computer science tree root top branch go
This simply customary way drawing tree
The node one directly connected
In example parent parent parent etc
A node connected directly starting node
Thus child child etc
It simply reverse parent relationship
Nodes parent called
So sibling example
An given node either parent parent parent parent etc
In example ancestor node tree
The counterpart ancestor
For example descendant descendant
The tree sometimes also called node child
In example leaf
Note leaf lowest level tree
The node tree called sometimes
Note node tree considered root subtree consisting node descendant
For example subtree rooted follows A sequence node first parent second second parent third etc
For example tree sequence branch
The length branch number line segment traversed one le number node
The branch length
The tree maximum length branch root leaf
The tree height since longest possible branch root leaf either length
A formal definition tree written follows A consists set node either empty root node attached zero subtrees
Of course subtree must tree
Thus recursive definition
Note left right ordering subtrees
Reversing left right order sibling give different binary tree
For example reversing subtrees rooted give following different binary tree
It happens binary expression tree
The following binary search tree node contains person name
Only first name used order keep example simple
Note name ordered alphabetically DAVE come DAWN DAVID come DAWN DAVE etc
How one create binary search tree first place
One way starting empty binary search tree adding data item one one
The first item becomes root
The next item placed either left child right child node depending ordering
The third item compared root go left right depending result comparison etc
find spot
In case follow path root spot insert new item comparing new item item node encountered along way going left right node maintain ordering prescribed
Note got data back ascending order
This always happen inorder traversal binary search tree
In fact sort done way
One first insert data binary search tree inorder traversal obtain data ascending order
Some people call
Now exactly get list data
Essentially following recursive definition inorder traversal
First traverse left subtree root DAWN
That left subtree one rooted DAVE
How traverse
By using process
We first traverse left subtree one rooted BETH
Of course go three step subtree rooted BETH
We begin traversing left subtree empty visit root BETH
That first data item printed
Then traverse right subtree one rooted CINDI
We use process since subtrees empty simply print root CINDI second item printed
We back left subtree rooted DAVE
We traversed left subtree go print root DAVE traverse right subtree
Since right subtree empty subtrees end printing root DAVID
We continue similar fashion rest binary search tree
First traverse left subtree whole binary tree
This subtree rooted
To apply three step
We traverse left subtree result printing
Then traverse right subtree result printing
Then visit root printing
Next back left whole binary tree
We traversed left subtree traverse right subtree printing
Then visit root printing
Overall end printing expression
A postfix expression deciphered looking left right using fact operator applies two previous value
Note traversal always work like postorder traversal binary expression tree yield postfix form expression
You may familiar postfix expression calculator use
In ordinary mathematics used using infix expression operator come two value apply
For practice try preorder traversal binary expression tree
The result
This expression form binary operator precedes two quantity applies
A preorder traversal binary expression tree always give prefix form expression
The natural conjecture would inorder traversal binary expression tree would produce expression quite true
With expression true
However try infix expression
Here parenthesis used indicate subtraction done multiplication
The binary expression tree look like As verify inorder traversal binary expression tree produce infix form slightly different expression one multiplication done subtraction
The problem get parenthesis back
It possible modify code inorder traversal always parenthesizes thing plain inorder traversal give parenthesis
Another use binary search tree storing data item fast lookup later
In average case pretty fast insert new item binary tree average case data fairly random binary tree reasonably bushy
In tree known height binary tree insertion operation
Similarly lookup item already binary tree follows pattern used inserted
Thus lookup average
For example look GINA binary tree one compare GINA DAWN root
Since GINA larger move right child MIKE
Now compare GINA MIKE
Since GINA smaller move left child GINA
Now compare GINA item node also GINA see match
All lookup like
One start root follows path root matching item leaf match ever found
Each node field hold data item two pointer field pointer left child right child respectively
There constructor class default value two pointer parameter
Note use initialization list copy field field etc
There also function extract data node object
Finally set type name pointer one node object
The file easy follow let move file
It set class shown There two data field private
used keep track many item placed binary search tree
pointer root node binary search tree
As class function private helping function publicly available one
The code file
The operation publicly available one construct empty binary search tree object destructor function return number item binary search tree function tell binary search tree empty function insert new item still binary search tree finished function find item binary search tree
The private helping function include one manufacture new node containing given data item left right pointer function free space used node function clear space used node binary search tree leaving empty function free space used subtree function try find given item subtree
The latter function assist public function job
Now examine code class function
The constructor fill zero
This object represents empty binary search tree
The destructor us helping function wipe node tree
As destructor object field automatically wiped
Note need explicitly reclaim space used outside object handled automatically
The function work calling function subtree rooted overall root
This clear node binary search tree
Then object set properly indicate empty binary search tree
The code function interesting therefore shown detail
Notice handed pointer node binary search tree follows postorder traversal pattern visit node subtree rooted given node
Of course two recursive call
The stopping case recursion whenever pointer
In case nothing done clear subtree rooted subtree empty
Why use postorder traversal one traversal
Postorder used get rid root node gotten rid node subtrees
If got rid root node got rid one descendant would likely lose way reach descendant via pointer
The function us constructor create new node
Then check dynamic memory allocation node worked
This exactly procedure followed implemented linked list
The next several class function simple let jump function
Its code pasted This function us pair pointer point node currently examined point parent
These advanced via loop appropriate comparison item inserted item current node moving left right appropriate
The loop stop point node place new one
A new node containing item manufactured linked parent either left child right child appropriate
Of course special case also
This mean inserting empty tree need field binary search tree object point newly manufactured node
The function us starting root overall binary search tree
written recursive function shown examination The first two case function stopping case recursion
If pointer searching empty tree result item found
This shown returning value
If match return pointer current node
If value looking le one current node search recursively left subtree
Similarly value looking greater one current node search node right subtree
Finally file contains test program one binary search tree object
It simply insert item tree try find value tree etc

A web application program created using scripting
Cloud computing increasingly important internet user
On website script
sometimes referred
The website refers data stored
Different type processing occur side
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
Twitter James Harlow explains difference
These kind script small program run browser
important scripting language widely used dynamic website
The script embedded within stored external file
External script sent client server requested
Scripts also result user something like pressing page button
script often looked user chooses view source code page
JavaScript code widely copied recycled

These kind script run web page loaded
They needed anything requires dynamic data storing user login detail
Some common language include Java
These execute like programming language server
When script processed request sent server result sent back client

A piece access service made available
The server often always another case client access service way
The term applies role program device play
A client computer program part operation relies sending request another may may located another computer
For example client connect retrieve display
retrieve
us variety client vary depending chat protocol used
may run client computer
The term client may also applied computer device run client software user use client software
A client part still used today
Clients server may computer program run machine connect via technique
Combined program may connect service operating possibly remote system
Servers wait potential client initiate connection may accept
The term first applied capable running could interact remote computer via network
These client
In one classification client computer device either
A also known client performs bulk data processing operation necessarily rely
The common example fat client relatively large set feature capability light reliance upon server
For example computer running ultimately share result work network fat client
A minimal sort client
Thin use resource host computer
A thin client generally present processed data provided performs bulk required data processing
A device using thin client
A mixture two client model
Similar fat client process locally relies server storing persistent data
This approach offer feature fat client multimedia support high performance thin client high manageability flexibility
A device running online version example hybrid client

I trying come algorithm dynamically throttle client number outstanding request based response time completed request
Response time unpredictable second
The response time greatly affected total outstanding request server flooded bog time increase long time
My client application several http request need send server actually server load balanced use round robin distribution
Each request flat object containing parameter
The server us parameter several look ups may may trigger look ups calculation server processing time variable
The server return list corresponding result approximately length result
I created rolling average class keep response time last X number response give average point
Then response received I compare response time average
If response time equal le average I increase number allowed outstanding request
If current response time greater average I decrease allowed outstanding request
This approach worked somewhat scaling I case average grew time allowed outstanding request brought everything crawl
I implementation question stackoverflow want detail I code minus rolling average part
I using mocked version server sleep thread returning response
I pick bestWaitSeconds fastest time return MaxRequestsBeforeDegradation determines maximum number request time increase anything return bestWaitSeconds
The degradation formula look like applies currentRequests MaxRequestsBeforeDegradation
secondsToWait currentRequests MaxRequestsBeforeDegradation bestWaitSeconds The random way apply unknown return time stated problem
Times go well second server overloaded
This formula exactly server conveys idea I think
So basically algorithm need get close MaxRequestsBeforeDegradation possible
In real case MaxRequestsBeforeDegradation would change long amount time algorithm also need adapt explore continually know best number outstanding request
Hope help
How I dynamically find optimal number outstanding request allowed given moment get greatest throughput given history response time
Only server accurately determine current load thus much work handle might able handle work future
This load balancing throttling usually handled
A client ca know request failing could overloaded server overloaded network even rat patiently gnawing shielding cable behind wall somewhere sending burst noise line
A fancy adaptive backoff algorithm going dissuade rat make thing work better problem route flapping client server
Clients use simple backoff algorithm request start failing let server network anything else manage load
The HTTP spec say server may send header along response indicate long service expected unavailable
The client use best guess retry request
Of possible way manage server load seems best place start fairly basic problem design pattern area handle type system think probably example right control theory book close question
basically theory involves concept somewhat like way thermostat regulates temperature house
house hot heater shuts cool turn
want something like opposite delay throttling applied greater load however principle
basic solution something like
keep track minimum response time baseline
measure current instantaneous difference minimum response time current response time roughly proportional load
one one load influence current load reading
neither one want large current spike load effect throttling much
immediate idea use load measurement determine throttling metric used lot stock trading algorithm
exponential average tunable continuous parameter basically weight current past value one end past value weighted lighter end current value weighted heavier
suggestion try algorithm different weighting value graph result
notice lot web load problem vary daily rate midday midweek highest load
case changing weight value might optimal
basic strategy figure general trend cycle input load would throttling look daily weekly load
note router automatically something like basic load balancing route already busy connection

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I seen question mainly Stack Overflow lack basic knowledge
The point question provide good information seeking referencing
In context web programming difference programming programming
Which language belong use
We looking long answer provide explanation context
Do give answer explain answer right ideally citation
Answers include explanation may removed
Web development communication
In case communication two party HTTP protocol Each side programming refers code run specific machine server client
programming general name kind program run
Much like programming name program run
Here I talk web programming
programming mostly user interface user interacts
In web development browser user machine run code mainly done etc
This code must run variety browser
The front end programming programming generating dynamic content
It run server
Many server headless
Most web page static search database order show user updated personalized information
This side interacts back end like say database
This programming done lot language This code The person charge server side programming must know Other answer focused programming language mostly used task accomplished etc
This absolutely right I miss bit focus type programming context web programming
Let try address
In programming access full system security concern
The user necessarily trust every piece code downloaded web executed machine main design goal environment browser JavaScript engine provide isolated environment client code execute access anything outside allowed scope
In programming good practice also limit access application underlying system much le enforced since end company control system
This cage design programming tool language accomplished installation setup using dedicated user restricted permission choosing port require require root permission etc
In programming deployment happen outside code using kind tool even deployment usually manual least expected happen way
The system meaning OS deploy usually uniform across number machine heavily customized need
In programming deployment happens code serf client automatically without supervision
The underlying system meaning mainly browser different across much larger number machine
In order make deployment feasible standard kept much stronger trend single language environment
This copying code one machine another take week code usually trivial execute different machine
Disclaimer far subjective point
Probably many wrong aspect argumentation
It interesting hypothesis view
In programming state much bigger concern meaning retrieve update data request user possibility conflict due concurrency
Even complexity offloaded database server code responsibility allow database keep guarantee data integrity using interface correctly
use cache update never seen DB also goal code overload database work keep user waiting response
In programming presenting result user much bigger concern implies secondary effect mostly printing screen
This say state involved
cooky main goal code actually interface user happen without secondary effect
This programming usually requires point looking screen demo check color layout right programming happen almost exclusively environment automated test check logic still supposed
This mean intended accepted answer rather I offer complementary point response question yet mentioned answer thus far namely Source code sits Javascript easily readable capable obfuscated
Source code sits however safely protect proprietary algorithm return result sort
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

THE education site computer science ICT When visit web site usually use browser program Edge Chrome Firefox
The browser sends request web server code make page want view
Since browser making request case
The browser interprets markup language code receives back render page see
Different page use different web technology discus
Rendered page may allow request client
These request validated ensure formatted correctly
You read entry validation
Client side processing mean web page get client computer validation processing rather server
There several common language kind processing code
The one need know JavaScript
We Client side processing also used create interaction help user provide correct information
For example click input box school allows JavaScript run browser see calendar widget appear
The entire calendar widget created piece JavaScript code included page
It tell browser process input make
This client side processing
Click link

Occurring side system
For example script executed client
In contrast script run
applet either depending computer server client executes

In particular interactive information interchange also known dialogue conversation meeting two communicating device computer user see
A session set established certain point time torn later point
An established communication session may involve one message direction
A session typically always meaning least one communicating part need save information session history order able communicate opposed communication communication consists independent request response
An established session basic requirement perform
A session also basic step transmit mode
However unidirectional transmission define session
may implemented part protocol service
In case transport protocol implement formal session layer session application layer generally HTTP session maintained higher level program using method defined data exchanged
For example HTTP exchange browser remote host may include identifies state unique information user preference authorization level
thought allow single request response one Session
Protocol version improved completing CGI making easier maintain Web Session supporting file uploads
Most session maintained transport layer single connection single session
However transaction phase session creates separate connection
Maintaining session continuity phase requires
The embedded within A HREF FORM link passed back CGI
CGI us ensure session continuity transaction phase
One advantage one work well low bandwidth modem connection
TCP session typically implemented software using new process thread created computer establishes join session
HTTP session typically implemented using one thread per session mean database information state session
The advantage multiple process thread relaxed complexity software since thread history encapsulated variable
The disadvantage large overhead term system resource session may interrupted system restarted
When client may connect server cluster server special problem encountered maintaining consistency server must maintain session state
The client must either directed server duration session server must transmit session information via shared file system database
Otherwise client may reconnect different server one started session cause problem new server access stored state old one
session handy efficient become difficult handle conjunction system usable embedded system storage
The problem solved using shared storage applying forced peering client single server cluster although compromise system efficiency load distribution
A method using session system without reserve portion RAM storage session data
This method applicable server limited number client
router access point infrequent disallowed access one client time
session use cooky cryptographic technique maintain state without storing much data server
When presenting dynamic web page server sends current state data client web browser form cookie
The client save cookie memory disk
With successive request client sends cookie back server server us data remember state application specific client generate appropriate response
This mechanism may work well context however data stored client vulnerable tampering user software access client computer
To use session confidentiality integrity required following must guaranteed To accomplish server need encrypt session data sending client modification information party prevented via cryptographic mean
Transmitting state back forth every request practical size cookie small
In essence session trade server disk space extra bandwidth web request require
Moreover web browser limit number size cooky may stored web site
To improve efficiency allow session data server may compress data creating cookie decompressing later cookie returned client
A session token unique identifier generated sent identify current interaction session
The client usually store sends token sends parameter GET POST query
The reason use session token client handle session data stored server usually client direct access linked identifier
Examples name programming language use naming HTTP cookie include JSESSIONID PHPSESSID CGISESSID ASPSESSIONID
In process keeping track user activity across session interaction
Typical session management task include keeping track application open document application opened state restored user log log later
For website session management might involve requiring user session expired certain time limit passed without user activity
It also used store information HTTP request
A desktop session manager program save restore desktop session
A desktop session window currently running current content
Session management system provided
On system session management provided Session Manager Subsystem user session functionality extended application like
Session management particularly useful user save open page setting restore later date
To help recover system application crash page setting also restored next run
example web browser support session management
Session management often managed application
HTTP stateless client computer running web browser must establish new TCP network connection web server new HTTP GET POST request
The web server therefore rely established TCP network connection longer single HTTP GET POST operation
Session management technique used web developer make stateless HTTP protocol support session state
For example user authenticated web server user next HTTP request GET POST cause web server ask user account password
For discussion method used accomplish see In situation multiple web server must share knowledge session state typical environment session information must shared cluster node running web server software
Methods sharing session state node cluster include multicasting session information member node see one example technique sharing session information partner node using sharing session information node using network socket storing session information shared file system storing session information outside cluster
If session information considered transient volatile data required transaction contain data subject compliance auditing example see example two law necessitate compliance auditing method storing session information used
However session information subject audit compliance consideration given method used session storage replication clustering
In Simple Object Access Protocol message constructed Extensible Markup Language message used consumer application cause web server create session
Just HTTP stateless protocol
As SMS became interoperable across rival network text messaging started ascent towards becoming ubiquitous global form communication various enterprise became interested using SMS channel commercial purpose
Initial service require session management since communication example
Today application referred distinct messaging
The development interactive enterprise application required session management SMS stateless protocol defined GSM standard early implementation controlled enter command service identifier manually

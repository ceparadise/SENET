In enables program indirectly access particular value
The reference said datum accessing datum called reference
A reference distinct datum
Typically reference data stored memory given system reference implemented data stored memory storage device
For reason reference often erroneously confused said point data
However reference may also implemented way offset difference datum address fixed base address abstractly
More broadly networking reference may address
The concept reference must confused value uniquely identify data item give access operation
References widely used especially efficiently pas large mutable data share data among various us
In particular reference may point variable record contains reference data
This idea basis many
References cause significant complexity program partially due possibility partially data reference whose analysis quite complicated
References increase flexibility object stored allocated passed area code
As long one access reference data one access data data need moved
They also make sharing data different code area easier keep reference
The mechanism reference varying implementation fundamental programming language feature common nearly modern programming language
Even language support direct use reference internal implicit use
For example calling convention implemented either explicit implicit use reference
primitive
Due intimate relationship underlying hardware one powerful efficient type reference
However also due relationship pointer require strong understanding programmer detail memory architecture
Because pointer store memory location address instead value directly inappropriate use pointer lead program particularly due
act like pointer accessed particular method
A abstract reference may represented various way
A common example FILE data structure used abstract file content
It usually represents file requesting file specific position within file content reading file
In reference may contain address identifier may also include embedded specification network protocol used locate access referenced object way information encoded serialized
Thus example description remote web service viewed form reference includes complete specification locate bind particular
A reference another example complete specification construct small software component called subsequently engage interaction local machine may gain access data replicated exists weakly consistent message stream
In case reference includes full set instruction recipe access data sense serf purpose identifier address memory
More generally reference considered piece data allows unique retrieval another piece data
This includes key
If set key set data object function defines type reference image key referring anything meaningful
An alternative representation function directed graph called
Here datum represented vertex edge datum refers datum
The maximum one
These graph valuable used separate accessible
In many data structure large complex object composed smaller object
These object typically stored one two way Internal storage usually efficient space cost reference metadata time cost associated dereferencing reference allocating memory smaller object
Internal storage also enhances keeping different part large object close together memory
However variety situation external storage preferred Some language support internal storage
In language object uniformly accessed reference
In first language used typical express reference using either raw memory address index table
These work somewhat tricky use address tell nothing value point even large interpret information encoded program logic
The result misinterpretation occur incorrect program causing bewildering error
One earliest opaque reference language simply containing two reference Lisp object including possibly con cell
This simple structure commonly used build singly also used build simple dotted list terminate null reference value
Another early language Fortran explicit representation reference use implicitly calling semantics
The still one popular type reference today
It similar assembly representation raw address except carry static used ensure data refers misinterpreted
However C violated using explicit conversion various pointer type pointer type integer misinterpretation still possible difficult
Its successor tried increase pointer new cast operator smart pointer still retained ability circumvent safety mechanism compatibility
A number popular mainstream language today adopted much opaque type reference usually referred simply
These reference type like C pointer indicating interpret data reference typesafe interpreted raw address unsafe conversion permitted
A reference best thought another object scalar variable row column array
There syntax dereference reference manipulate content referent directly
Fortran reference null
As language reference facilitate processing dynamic structure linked list queue tree
In setting concept data modified often make implicit use reference
In many functional language value persistent modified assignment
Assignable reference cell serve unavoidable purpose mutable reference imperative language make capability modified explicit
Such reference cell hold value given type replaced type value pointed
These mutable reference pointed different object lifetime
For example permit building circular data structure
The reference cell functionally equivalent array length
To preserve safety efficient implementation reference ML pointer arithmetic performed
It important note functional paradigm many structure would represented using pointer language like C represented using facility powerful mechanism
The programmer able enjoy certain property guarantee immutability programming even though compiler often us machine pointer hood
Some language like support string value contain name variable
When value regular reference dereferenced Perl considers symbolic reference give variable name given value
similar feature form syntax
Many object oriented language make extensive use reference
They may use reference access object
References also used call message passing frequently used perform unused object

treated singular plural sequence one symbol given meaning specific act interpretation
datum single unit data requires interpretation become information
To translate data information must several known factor considered
The factor involved determined creator data desired information
The term used reference data data
Metadata may implied specified given
Data relating physical event process also temporal component
In almost case temporal component implied
This case device temperature logger received data temperature
When temperature received assumed data temporal reference
So device record date time temperature together
When data logger communicates temperature must also report date time temperature
data represented using system one zero opposed representation
In modern post computer system data digital
Data within computer case move parallel data
Data moving computer case move serial data
See
Data sourced analog device temperature sensor must pas analog digital converter ADC see convert analog data digital data
Data representing character symbol operation performed optical mechanical recording medium form digital electrical signal
A set data consists series coded software instruction control operation computer machine
Physical element consist address data storage
Digital data often stored like generally represented abstract
Data organized many different type including array
Data structure store data many different including even
Data pas computer via
In alternate usage sometimes called data distinguished
The total amount digital data estimated billion
come three state
At essential single datum value stored specific location
Fundamentally computer follow sequence instruction given form data
A set instruction perform given task task called
In nominal case program computer consist
The element manipulated program actually executed also data
Program instruction data program manipulates stored exactly way
Therefore possible computer program operate computer program manipulating programmatic data
The line program data become blurry
An example program
The input data interpreter program one expressed native
In many case interpreted program manipulated program normally associated data
similarly involves program manipulating program data
Programs like use program data
To store data file
Typically program stored special different used data
contain program file also
However executable file may also contain data built program
In particular executable file nominally contains constant initial value data
For example might first instruct load program one file edit stored another file word processor program
In example document would considered data
If word processor also feature dictionary word list spell checker would also considered data
The used spell checker suggest correction would either data text interpretable
Keys data provide context value
Regardless structure data always component present
Data key data essential giving meaning data value
Without key directly indirectly associated value collection value structure value become meaningless cease data
That say least key component linked value component order considered data
Data represented computer multiple way per following example

I know scalar mean exactly I trying see I thinking correctly
Does scalar relate arbitrariness type data could type system able know data advance
The term scalar come used differentiate single number vector matrix
The meaning computing similar
It distinguishes single value like integer float data structure like array
This distinction prominent Perl sigil resembles used denote scalar variable sigil resembles denotes array
It anything type element
It could number character string object
What matter called scalar
A Scalar simply
For purpose discussion let assume scalar rather collection number
For example result SQL query return value first column first row result set returned query
It typically used retrieve aggregate value COUNT AVERAGE ID new record number record processed query
A supplemental mnemonic Karl Bielefeldt great answer A simple way thinking scale
An integer scale
A integer scale

A real number scale
A character boolean decimal scale
Even string scale use sorting
Hence scalar
A database row scale
A complex number scale
An object representing email message scale
An array vector matrix scale
A scalar simple single numeric value etc
usually integer fixed point float single double opposed array structure object complex vector real plus imaginary magnitude plus angle component higher dimensional vector matrix etc
data type contains one single numeric value
However note large complex data type sort also flattened represented byte computer memory also represented one single binary scalar number
Turing used technique represent entire computer program one scalar number
As case many term computing origin word relates physical property
The term Scalar relatively old computing
Its definition le strict day
When store data computer memory data either fit one address
When called scalar called composite
Mainly CPUs could handle one data byte time
As stated Karl Bielefeldt term indeed taken algebra
We call string string string char
A char scalar string composite
Storing piece data datum multiple address blurred line somewhat
Think like When CPU could process datum one instruction scalar
These day scalar singular value singular value may defined differently amongst different language
integer float char string booleans enums considered scalar day
Arrays list tree object etc

I say byte keep thing clear technically I talking day bit commonly used punch card example later magnetic strip Disclaimer I unable find reference internet I got information school old book amongst I think Mathematical Tables Aids Computation
That said memory used anyone deny answer would nice
The word scalar derives Latin word scalaris adjectival form scala Latin ladder
The English word scale also come scala
A Scalar variable hold individual value
For example Say trying represent name various student set variable
Each individual variable scalar variable follow SQL scalar function return single value based input value

A geodetic datum tool used define shape size earth well reference point various coordinate system used mapping earth
Throughout time hundred different datum used one changing earth view time
True geodetic datum however appeared
Prior earth ellipsoidal shape always taken consideration many still believed flat
Since datum today used measuring showing large portion earth ellipsoidal model essential
Today hundred different datum use either horizontal vertical orientation
The horizontal datum one used measuring specific position earth surface coordinate system latitude longitude
Because different local datum
different reference point position many different geographic coordinate important know datum reference
The vertical datum measure elevation specific point earth
This data gathered via tide sea level measurement geodetic surveying different ellipsoid model used horizontal datum gravity measured geoid
The data depicted map height sea level
For reference geoid mathematical model earth measured gravity corresponds mean ocean surface level water extended land
Because surface highly irregular however different local geoids used get accurate mathematical model possible use measuring vertical distance
As previously mentioned many datum use around world today
Some commonly used datum World Geodetic System North American Datums Ordinance Survey Great Britain European Datum however mean exhaustive list
Within World Geodetic System WGS several different datum use throughout year
These WGS
The WGS currently one use system valid
In addition one widely used datum around world
In United States Department Defense used Geodetic Reference System GRS Doppler satellite image create new accurate world geodetic system
This became known today WGS
In term reference WGS us called zero meridian new measurement shifted meter mile previously used Prime Meridian
Similar WGS North American Datum NAD
This official horizontal datum use North Central American geodetic network
Like WGS based GRS ellipsoid two similar measurement
NAD also developed using satellite remote sensing imagery default datum GPS unit today
Prior NAD NAD horizontal datum constructed based Clarke ellipsoid
Though NAD use many year still appears United States topographic map based series approximation geodetic center based Meades Ranch Kansas
This point chosen near geographic center contiguous United States
Also similar WGS Ordinance Survey Great Britain latitude longitude position point datum
However based Airy ellipsoid show primary user accurately
The European Datum datum used showing much Western Europe developed reliable system mapping border needed
It based International Ellipsoid changed put use
Today latitude similar line become farther apart moving toward Eastern Europe
When working map datum important always aware datum particular map referenced often large difference term distance place place different datum
This datum shift cause problem term navigation trying locate specific place object user wrong datum sometimes hundred meter desired position
Whichever datum used however represent powerful geographic tool important cartography geology navigation surveying sometimes even astronomy
In fact geodesy study measurement Earth representation become subject within field earth science

Data distinct piece information usually formatted special way
All software divided two general category data
Programs collection instruction manipulating data
Data exist variety form number text piece paper bit byte stored electronic memory fact stored person mind
Since people used word data mean computer information transmitted stored
Strictly speaking data plural single piece information
In practice however people use data singular plural form word mass noun like sand
The term data often used distinguish information textual information
For example application make distinction data file file contain binary data text file file contain ASCII data
Also important know data file file store database information whereas file index file data dictionary store administrative information known metadata

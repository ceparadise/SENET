Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
A soft question I high school University I took scientific writing class people told I use passive voice much possible sound objective I entered grad school people told I use passive voice unless I work Chemistry
So Which one I follow
The bottom line advice Use whichever voice best aid understanding
Many people passive voice thinking make sound scientific
In practice common passive voice make sentence harder follow
Therefore rough guideline helpful use following principle use active voice whereever possible
If find writing passive voice check whether sentence would clearer simpler easier understand written active voice
I recommend read style guide clear writing
You find tend warn passive voice active voice often make sentence simpler direct forceful vivid thus concise memorable
good example guideline see
There special case convention norm within field worth following
See
There discussion passive voice CS paper comprehensive publicized insider reference apparently officially published even author except recorded electronically class note leading authority field Knuth teaching cohort
Generally passive nonpassive active imperative form writing used CS major example
They discus use style analysis program also automatically score passive versus imperative sentence construction used guidance different us abstract versus body
Overall come style preference guideline
Overuse either form generally avoided
Donald Knuth Tracy Larrabee Paul Roberts
See page also search passive imperative keywords document
Paul moved final area discussion Style
Rule suggests use avoid passive voice
This use equivalent reader
Paul say even better avoid passive voice use judicial use imperative indicative mood along outlying kind phrase
By posting answer agree

We consider system model whose underlying geometric structure Dirac structure consists energy storing port resistive port external port interconnected power conserving relationship
A system dissipation PHSD formed composition Dirac resistive structure
We show choice new passive output PHSD reflected new Dirac structure
We generate new class passive output PHSD changing Hamiltonian function interconnection damping matrix subsequently compute new underlying Dirac structure
We next consider power conserving interconnection two system extend well known standard feedback interconnection considering interconnection system involve energy storing port resistive port external port
For system dissipation demonstrate interconnection used stabilization CbI method
Finally discus similarity new control interconnection method interconnection damping assignment control method

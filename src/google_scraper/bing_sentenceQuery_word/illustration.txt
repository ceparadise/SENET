There lot overlap two discipline
It common see course title like Graphic Design And Illustration
In term skill involved illustration generally expressive image create subjective mood graphic design deliberate image achieve objective goal
Here example taken clothing site design made illustrator also designer example illustration
It really strong expressive style creates mood bringing mind bike chaotic thing energy without needing look directly
It need attention work look directly try direct attention around eye wanders around freely
example graphic design
It attracts attention strong clear focal image us visual hierarchy pas attention smaller image carry deliberate meaning bike needing fuel
It work attention controlled deliberate way
somewhere two graphic design illustration
It creates whimsical mood even look directly attracts directs attention deliberate set way attention communicates deliberate message pay direct attention
A lot
design work somewhere two like
Illustrations often carry deliberate meaning usually reframing meaning thing illustrates example illustration child book visually show action described text
A good child book illustration add depth enhances simple text without competing
Graphics often designed give abstract impression mood personality usually carefully controlled analysed deliberate way example good corporate logo meet lot specific requirement used function well giving impression abstract company
It fuzzy line two discipline
Adobe Illustrator particular vector based illustration program made Adobe
Illustrator person illustrates
Typically world Graphic Design would person take concept art director editor creates visual via drawing painting
In almost every way I agree I little add except excerpt book I also recommend Illustration long history existence century recognised distinct discipline fairly recently
It often confused discipline notably graphic design fine art perhaps sometimes overlap
However illustration communicating specific contextualised message audience
It rooted objective need fulfil particular task
Illustrators need knowledge understanding insight regarding context within working subject matter work within parameter need target audience
They need utilise breath intellectual practical skill might regarded transferable discipline considered essential illustrator ambition transcend role commissioned
I total noob sure
But I think Illustrator referring vector based graphic program create image based mathematical formula therefore scale well
Adobe Illustrator everything enlarged decreased numerical factor
The alternative program
Adobe Photoshop modify individual pixel therefore good working thing like photograph lot slightly different color
The question easier answer word What mean TO BE illustrator
The question illustrator
This strictly opinion To illustrator create original art hand pencil paint charcoal etc art based computer program accompany enhance idea

As described detail Part One bathtub curve displayed Figure depict failure rate single item
Instead curve describes relative failure rate entire population product time
Some individual unit fail relatively early infant mortality failure others hope last fail relatively long period typically called normal life
The first period characterized decreasing failure rate consists failure caused defect blunder
The second period maintains low relatively constant failure rate consists random failure typically caused stress exceeding strength
The third period exhibit increasing failure rate consists failure caused due fatigue depletion material
Some reliability specialist like point real product exhibit constant failure rate
This quite true mechanical part primary failure mode
And kind part mechanical electronic subject infant mortality failure intrinsic defect
But common situation true random failure potential exists
Soft Error Rate SER fact life system using solid state memory chip
And today includes electronic device personal computer VCR microwave oven digital camera automotive control module
These error caused two factor alpha particle cosmic ray
These error random time transient
A bit flipped one factor corrected new data written memory cell
But cell read new write operation take place data read erroneous
The effect error may minor single pixel display wrong color one screen refresh cycle major crashing PC
In computer system special error correcting code employed prevent SER causing data loss system malfunction
However electronic product malfunction way SER
For SER failure mode normal life failure
There average rate occurrence failure occur random
The failure case cause minor deviation operation
No repair needed fix product subject SER fact fix eliminate SER effect
Only significant design change using error correcting design eliminate SER nothing eliminate SER
There case especially electronic product constant failure rate may appropriate although approximate
This basis method estimate system failure rate consideration type quantity component used
For many electronic component practical failure mode
The time product use significantly shorter time take reach mode
That leaf infant mortality normal life failure mode cause significant failure
As already observed time failure infant mortality defect get spread much appear approximately random time
A combination low level infant mortality failure random failure caused operational stress power line surge result product failure distribution close classical normal life period
This brings question term applies normal life period MTBF
A common term used specifying marketing product MTBF vastly misunderstood often misused term
MTBF historically stand Mean Time Between Failures applies underlying distribution constant failure rate exponential distribution
In case MTBF characteristic life parameter exponential distribution see
However use term MTBF confused fact reliability practitioner used indicate Mean Time Failure case underlying distribution may mode
Further practitioner word implies repairable product implies product
To make matter worse vendor many product use term MTBF without defining mean sometimes concept reliability issue
In fact author actually seen MTBF explained Minimum Time Before Failure completely nonsensical concept
Mean Time Before Failure often termed Mean Time To Failure MTTF describes average time failure product even failure rate increasing time mode
Some unit fail mean life
Thus product specified MTTF hour implies unit actually operate longer hour without failure
Note I use MTTF rather Mean Time Before Failure remainder article
When I write MTBF I mean Mean Time Between Failures applies exponential distribution
In recent year many vendor started using terminology service life describe long product may last use
This good trend
However writing article author found current data sheet indicated service life using MTBF MTBF value excess hour would year operation
The product specified would operate year mode would kill product ten year
The vendor confusing normal life often expressed MTBF value distribution product
How MTBF describe failure rate
It quite simple exponential distribution applies constant failure rate modeled flat bottom bathtub curve MTBF equal inverse failure rate
For example product MTBF million hour used hour per day Note million hour year
Do expect product actually operate year
No
Long year use mode become dominant population product leave normal life period bathtub start curve
But normal life period constant failure rate per year also expressed MTBF million hour
How MTBF fit equation exponential distribution
MTBF scale parameter usually termed eta Note many product low failure rate normal life wear year Mean Time Before Failure MTTF may much le Mean Time Between Failures
Let look graphically
Figure show Weibull probability plot
This plot show expected cumulative failure product time time shown cumulative failure percentage labeled Unreliability shown
This one common way view failure distribution
The solid blue line titled MTBF million hour represents normal life period shown horizontal line bathtub curve
It horizontal plot show cumulative failure whereas bathtub curve show failure rate
The MTBF exponential distribution equal time population unit failed
This level shown plot dashed black line labeled The green line hand represents distribution depicted right side bathtub curve
It constant failure rate distribution failure rate increase time
Note cross cumulative level hour
This distribution MTTF hour
Note beta MTTF close cumulative failure time calculate actual mean life MTTF median life cumulative failure time Weibull distribution
When beta exponential distribution used mean life Mean Time Between Failures
Both distribution blue green line apply population device
These device fail primarily according constant failure rate model solid blue MTBF line blue line intercept green line
This begin significant effect little hour example
By hour half unit failed hour unit failed
None ever reach million hour MTBF time mode dominates hour operation
Note true overall cumulative failure sum two distribution shown plot
However scale sum two distribution close two straight line except around area intercept
As seen logical device MTBF much greater time MTBF projection normal lifetime failure cumulative level
Most device failed due mode long MTBF time
A major problem many people term expressed time really used indicate failure rate normal life period
To confuse issue people use term MTBF indicate case applies mode really relate service life
And I noted people know talking claim service life equal Mean Time Between Failures
Good news recent data sheet vendor particularly making electronic assembly show MTBF heading reliability separate value service life
In case vendor described expected failure rate normal life period bathtub MTBF million hour point time product expected start part bathtub curve service life greater year
Bad news vendor even major technology firm still understand reliability concept least expressed data sheet
When specifying component product want understand long might operate failure rate might normal life sure find vendor mean MTBF
And think mean Minimum Time Before Failure calculated careful
In long run everything wear
For many electronic design occur long reasonable
Inexpensive electronic watch radio television product usually last year people upset finally fail
There usually newer product better feature want buy year
For many mechanical assembly time le desired operational life whole product replacement failed assembly used extend operational life product
With item expected replacement normal routine
For example inkjet cartridge run ink much ink squirted
This normally thought failure
However newly replaced cartridge run ink short period use consider failure
On hand mechanical device last month year use product expected last decade
Relays generator switching device engine part hydraulic component aircraft replaced periodic basis usually fail enable aircraft fly many year safe operation
Tires brake component replaced several time period time automobile use
The period occur one time component
The component determine location time given product
In designing product engineer must assure component last long enough provide useful service life
If component easily replaced tire replacement may expected degrade perception product reliability
If component easily replaced expected fail failure cause customer dissatisfaction
In order ass time component testing may required
In case duty cycle running tire road wear simulator hour day may provide useful lifetime testing month
In case actual product use may hour day way accelerate duty cycle
High level physical stress may need applied shorten test time
This emerging technique reliability assessment termed QALT Quantitative Accelerated Life Testing requires consideration physic engineering material tested
Properly applied QALT provide useful information test much shorter length expected operating time design
However much care must taken assure possible failure mode investigated
Running quantitative accelerated life test without considering possible failure mode accelerating stress type may miss significant failure mode invalidate conclusion
As appropriate mechanic electronics physic chemistry must considered designing QALT
Note MTBF testing using many unit parallel shorten test time popular method life testing
It apply testing
It apply testing normal life failure result testing never extrapolated time longer used test
As demonstrated Parts Two article traditional bathtub curve reasonable qualitative illustration key kind failure mode affect product
Quantitative model Weibull distribution used ass actual design determine observed failure decreasing constant increasing time appropriate action taken
The exponential distribution related Mean Time Between Failures MTBF metric appropriate analyzing data product normal life period characterized constant failure rate
But careful many people imposed constant failure rate model product characterized increasing decreasing failure rate exponential distribution easy model use
Do assume product exhibit constant failure rate
Use life testing field data life distribution analysis determine product behaves expected lifetime
In addition traditional life data analysis model Weibull distribution quantitative accelerated life testing QALT may valuable technique better understand failure distribution highly reliable product reduced testing time manner
Without QALT approach testing way accurately ass reliability product short time
If need understand reliability device test unit one month
It provide information one month use
Projection one year invalid mode occurs example six month
The way find mode test long enough observe without QALT approach
When dealing vendor claim reliability component wish use sure understand determined figure well understand consequence bathtub curve

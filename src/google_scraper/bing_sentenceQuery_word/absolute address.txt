In within object indicating distance displacement beginning object given element point presumably within object
The concept distance valid element object size typically given
For example character containing fourth element containing character offset three start
In programming usually denotes number address location added order get specific
In original meaning offset basic address unit usually used specify offset size
In context offset sometimes called
In instruction offset embedded within certain instruction provided range byte
For example within unconditional branch instruction xxx hexadecimal offset provided byte offset base register branch
An odd offset would cause unless base register also contained odd address since instruction aligned boundary execute without program hardware
The previous example describes indirect way address memory location format segment offset
For example assume want refer memory location
One way accomplished first defining segment beginning address defining offset
Further also allowed shift hexadecimal segment reach final absolute memory address
One thing note reach final absolute address many way

An absolute cell reference cell reference spreadsheet application remains constant even shape size spreadsheet changed reference copied moved another cell sheet
Absolute cell reference important referring constant value spreadsheet
Absolute cell reference may also called absolute reference
Absolute cell reference used particular cell reference need constant
Cell reference often used formula chart function command
In scenario becomes important keep cell reference constant copied different cell
An absolute cell reference always remains matter copied often denoted symbol
So cell spreadsheet B used denote reference always point row column B even reference copied another cell spreadsheet changed way
In many spreadsheet program Excel cell reference made absolute pressing key cell reference typed
The spreadsheet automatically make cell reference absolute
If key pressed continuously spreadsheet program cycle absolute reference possibility
For instance cell reference typed continuous pressing change cell reference A
By pressing key cell reference changed directly left insertion point

In example every unique address

In reference specific location used various level
Memory address sequence conventionally displayed manipulated
Such numerical semantic base upon feature CPU incremental well upon use memory like endorsed various
A memory specifically consists many code CPU device use access
Generally
operating system specialized address physical memory using machine code instructing CPU direct hardware device called use separate execute program command
The memory controller consists number line represented bit
The width bus thus number addressable storage unit number bit unit varies among computer
A us memory address execute store retrieve
In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine
address memory location one memory bus
address location
In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given
It denotes number digit CPU process one time
Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word
However always hold true
Computers memory address larger smaller word size
For instance many processor would limited mere memory addressing
The supported addressing via allowing access rather memory
All Intel processor since include PAE support mapping physical address virtual address
In theory modern computer address byte practice amount memory limited CPU design
number physical memory connector amount memory
Each memory location hold
Its interpretation data instruction use determined retrieve manipulate
Some early programmer combined instruction data word way save memory expensive The space word store little bit data processor ignored small section middle word often exploited extra data storage
program treat sometimes data sometimes instruction
generally nowadays make testing maintenance disproportionally difficult saving byte also give incorrect result compiler processor assumption machine still sometimes used deliberately great care
In modern environment usually space chunk memory following type Some part address space may mapped
A computer program access address given programming usually called sometimes known data type language
But program also use specifies location relation somewhere else
There many
Mapping logical address physical virtual memory also add several level indirection see
Many programmer prefer address memory distinction code space data space cf
well physical virtual memory see word numerically identical pointer refer exactly byte RAM
However many early computer support particular machine force program storage completely separate data storage
Many modern three separate storage area program storage coefficient storage data storage
Some commonly used instruction fetch three area simultaneously fewer storage area even total byte storage would make instruction run slower
Early computer use address based combination two number within segment
Some segment implicitly treated dedicated normal
Although usage different segment different reflecting
In segment segment register generally set zero offset variable

In particular operational analysis form part Combined Operational Effectiveness Investment Appraisals COEIA support British defence capability acquisition
It often considered
The term sometimes used synonym
Employing technique mathematical science operation research arrives optimal solution complex problem
Because emphasis interaction focus practical application operation research overlap discipline notably draw
Operations research often concerned determining profit performance yield minimum loss risk cost objective
Originating military effort World War II technique grown concern problem variety industry
Operational research OR encompasses wide range technique method applied pursuit improved efficiency model
Nearly technique involve construction mathematical model attempt describe system
Because computational statistical nature field OR also strong tie
Operational researcher faced new problem must determine technique appropriate given nature system goal improvement constraint time computing power
The major subdisciplines modern operational research identified journal As discipline operational research originated effort military planner World War I convoy theory
In decade two world war technique widely applied problem business industry society
Since time operational research expanded field widely used industry ranging petrochemical airline finance logistics government moving focus development mathematical model used analyse optimize complex system become area active academic industrial research
Early work operational research carried individual
His research cost transportation sorting mail led England study dynamical behaviour railway vehicle defence broad gauge
brought operational research bear problem physic would later attempt extend social science
Modern operational research originated UK result initiative station superintendent
Rowe conceived idea mean analyse improve working UK system CH
Initially analysed operating radar equipment communication network expanding later include operating personnel behaviour
This revealed unappreciated limitation CH network allowed remedial action taken
Scientists United Kingdom including later Lord Blackett OM PRS later Baron Zuckerman OM KCB FRS United States looked way make better decision area training schedule The modern field operational research arose World War II
In World War II era operational research defined scientific method providing executive department quantitative basis decision regarding operation control
Other name included operational analysis UK Ministry Defence quantitative management
During close men woman Britain engaged operational research
About operational research scientist worked
worked several different organization war
Early war working RAE set team known Circus helped reduce number round needed shoot enemy aircraft average start
In Blackett moved RAE Navy first working early
Blackett team Coastal Command Operational Research Section included two future winner many people went field
They undertook number crucial analysis aided war effort
Britain introduced system reduce shipping loss principle using warship accompany merchant ship generally accepted unclear whether better convoy small large
Convoys travel speed slowest member small convoy travel faster
It also argued small convoy would harder German detect
On hand large convoy could deploy warship attacker
Blackett staff showed loss suffered convoy depended largely number escort vessel present rather size convoy
Their conclusion large convoy defensible many small one
While performing analysis method used hunt destroy submarine one analyst asked colour aircraft
As Bomber Command painted black operation
At suggestion test run see best colour camouflage aircraft daytime operation grey North Atlantic sky
Tests showed aircraft painted white average spotted closer painted black
This change indicated submarine would attacked sunk number sighting
As result finding Coastal Command changed aircraft using white undersurface
Other work indicated average trigger depth DCs changed foot foot kill ratio would go
The reason saw aircraft shortly arrived target foot charge would damage would time descend far foot saw aircraft long way target time alter course water chance within kill zone charge small
It efficient attack submarine close surface target location better known attempt destruction greater depth position could guessed
Before change setting foot foot submerged sunk damaged
After change sunk damaged
If submarine caught surface even attacked shortly submerging number rose sunk damaged
Blackett observed case great operational gain obtained small simple change tactic
Bomber Command Operational Research Section analysed report survey carried
For survey Bomber Command inspected bomber returning bombing raid Germany particular period
All damage inflicted German noted recommendation given armour added heavily damaged area
This recommendation adopted fact aircraft returned area damaged indicated area vital adding armour area damage acceptable negatively affect aircraft performance
Their suggestion remove crew aircraft loss would result fewer personnel loss also rejected RAF command
Blackett team made logical recommendation armour placed area completely untouched damage bomber returned
They reasoned survey biased since included aircraft returned Britain
The untouched area returning aircraft probably vital area hit would result loss aircraft
When Germany organised air defence realised British RAF bomber fly could overwhelm night fighter flew individual cell directed target ground controller
It matter calculating statistical loss collision statistical loss night fighter calculate close bomber fly minimise RAF loss
The exchange rate ratio output input characteristic feature operational research
By comparing number flying hour put Allied aircraft number sighting given area possible redistribute aircraft productive patrol area
Comparison exchange rate established effectiveness ratio useful planning
The ratio laid per ship sunk common several campaign German mine British port British mine German route United States mine Japanese route
Operational research doubled bomb rate bombing Japan increasing training ratio percent flying hour revealed three United States submarine effective number enable member pack engage target discovered individual patrol station revealed glossy enamel paint effective camouflage night fighter traditional dull camouflage paint finish smooth paint finish increased airspeed reducing skin friction
On land operational research section Army Operational Research Group AORG MoS landed followed British force advance across Europe
They analysed among topic effectiveness artillery aerial bombing shooting
With expanded technique growing awareness field close war operational research longer limited operational extended encompass equipment procurement training logistics infrastructure
Operations Research also grew many area military scientist learned apply principle civilian sector
With development development computer next three decade Operations Research solve problem hundred thousand variable constraint
Moreover large volume data required problem stored manipulated efficiently
Operational research also used extensively government used

To successfully control several process core operating system make utilize known interrupt
Interrupt machine used implementing multitasking concept
It signal hardware software point incidence event
When one process running similar time user give additional process interrupt take place
If CPU poll control bit instead receives interrupt device ready next byte data transfer said interrupt driven
A hardware interrupt occurs operation done analysis data computer tape drive
In additional term hardware interrupt used device communicate need awareness operating system
Some familiar example hard disk signaling read sequence data block network device processed buffer containing network packet
Interrupts also worn asynchronous event appearance new data exterior network
Hardware interrupt delivered straight CPU via little network interrupt administration routing device
Hardware interrupt referenced interrupt numeral
These statistic mapped back section hardware produced interrupt
This enables system monitor device formed interrupt occurred
In computer system interrupt handled speedily possible
When interrupt acknowledged recent action blocked interrupt handler executed
The handler anticipate supplementary running program system action entire system generate latency
MRG modifies way interrupt handled array progress performance reduce latency
A software interrupt occurs application program terminates need definite service operating system
Software interrupt generated contained processor executing instruction
Software interrupt frequently used implemented system call implemented subroutine call CPU ring stage modify
The timed interrupt worn convinced event MUST happen specified frequency
An interrupt vector memory address interrupt handler directory group called interrupt vector table dispatch table
Interrupt vector table include memory address interrupt handler
When interrupt generated processor save completing state context switch begin effecting interrupt handler interrupt vector
A Microkernel try run majority service like networking file system etc
All left kernel essential service like memory allocation scheduling messaging Inter Process Communication
IPC Hardware Server Kernel In theory model make kernel additional receptive since large amount functionality resides traceable thread process removing require kernel proper improves constancy kernel reducing quantity code running kernel space
There also supplementary benefit OS carry computer much simpler reentrancy security better correctness asynchronous functionality distributed OS code use service without knowing service contributor running similar computer
A disadvantage sum messaging Context Switching concerned make microkernel conceptually slower monolithic kernel
A modular kernel effort combine excellent point driver moderator driver
In modular kernel part system core situated autonomous file called module additional system run time
Depending substance module aim differ loading driver device fact establish load file system get really requested load code precise scheduling security policy evaluated
The modular kernel approach requires subsystem interrelate suspiciously constructed interface naturally narrow condition functionality showing external module
The layered kernel move toward similar admiration
However layered kernel imposes firm ordering subsystem subsystem subordinate layer allowed appeal operation parallel subsystem
There limitation approach wherein module open invoke including constraint
Context switching occurs single process provisionally discontinues execution additional process resume execution position
Context switching performed scheduler
To give process machine light contribute CPU hardware clock generates interrupt every often
This allows operating system program every process core memory via scheduling algorithm run CPU interval
Every time clock interrupt occurs interrupt handler check much time recent running process used
If used total time segment CPU scheduling algorithm kernel pick dissimilar process run
Each switch CPU one process new called context switch
Actions taken kernel context switch surrounded thread
The thread contribute lot resource peer thread belonging equal process
So context switch along thread similar process effortless
It involves switch register position program counter along stack
It comparatively easy kernel achieve task
Actions taken kernel context switch among Processes
Context switch among process exclusive
Ahead process switched PCB process control block saved operating system
The PCB consists subsequent information The process state program counter principle different register The CPU scheduling information process Memory organization information concerning process Possible accounting information process status information process
When PCB presently executing process saved operating system load PCB subsequently process performing CPU
This important job take lot time
System call function programmer call perform service operating system
Processes run user mode process library cause execution kernel mode
The interface two mode provided system call
These function call cause request made kernel kernel execute behalf request
Commands UNIX System Calls Libraries File Formats Games Device Drivers System Maintenance System call implemented operating system User execute privileged instruction
Users must ask OS execute system call
System call often implemented using trap
OS gain control trap switch supervisor model performs service switch back client mode give control back client
The dual mode operation provides u resource protecting operating system erroneous user
User mode monitor mode two mode
Monitor mode also called superintendent mode system mode privileged mode
Mode bit attached hardware computer point toward present mode
In argument mode bit monitor mode mode bit user mode
An application program interface precise technique set computer operating system application program programmer scripting application program create requirement operating system different application
An application program interface contrasted graphical user interface command interface direct user interface interface operating system program
For example The service provide interface application protocol software
Application Network API Protocol A Protocol B Protocol C In computer system variety memory address space user space kernel space technique system provided communicating data
A data structure distinct kernel space stock data
The data structure nearly mapped application user space application contact data structure via virtual memory address
By directly accessing data structure data transfer address space using system call interrupt reduced
Process scheduling method used limited asset many process competing Multiprogramming try make sure number process running time
This completed utilize CPU much possible
In timesharing system CPU switch regularly job user experience machine mutual many process even several user
Long term scheduler determines program admitted system processing
It control degree multiprogramming
Once admitted job becomes process
Medium term scheduling division exchange utility
This relate process blocked suspended state
They swapped prepared execute
The decision based criterion
Short term scheduler also known dispatcher executes regularly make conclusion process execute subsequently
This scheduler invoked whenever occasion occurs
It may direct interruption one process
The state process distinct fraction present activity process
Each process may one following state New Running Waiting Ready Terminated These state name random differ across operating system
The state correspond establishing operating system however
Certain operating system finely describe process state
Only one process running processor immediate although numerous process may ready waiting

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

I familiar concept vector magnitude direction I also keep coming across reference vector context programming example seems stl library come fairly frequently SO
My intuition context fairly primitive construct often used represent something along line variable length array storing size magnitude I presume would really helpful somebody could provide complete explanation preferably including used practice
From Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Furthermore vector typically hold object make class hold information vehicle store fleet vector
Nice thing vector aside resizing still allow access constant time individual element via index like array
The tradeoff resizing hit current capacity reallocate sometimes copy memory
However capacity increasing algorithm double capacity time hit barrier never hit heap available turn perhaps dozen time worst case throughout program operation
In mathematics vector thought combination direction magnitude
However also thought coordinate
For example vector magnitude angle degree horizontal represents point plane
This point also represented Cartesian coordinate pair
This pair also mathematical vector
In programming name vector originally used describe sequence scalar number
A vector length represents point plane vector length represents point space
A vector length represents point space mathematician trouble thinking thing
In modern programming library name vector come generally mean sized sequence value necessarily number
Changing size length dimensionality mathematical vector something would normally unless kind projection operation
But changing length programming vector contains sequence string might common operation
The mathematical vector used data structure computer science necessarily obey tensor transformation rule
They array expand contract noted earlier
Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Vectors good Since least two answer pasted might also want read rest description I understand confusion name I used confused
It helped idea Vector graphic programming closer mathematical definition
In math Vector thought matrix arbitrary length length number dimension coordinate system
In OO language vector essentially matrix array hence name
They anything coordinate unless programmer decides use task rare I never seen
They also usually mathematical operator matrix multiplication similar operation
So nature similarity end
I leave answer explain feature us OO container already handle
From To model computer memory use new kind data structure called vector
Abstractly vector compound data object whose individual element accessed mean integer index amount time independent index
Vectors programming basically dynamic array storage handled automatically allowing expanded contracted best thing also allow access constant time individual element via index like regular array
lot information need understand surround question
It contrast vector array
Also Stroustrup chapter Most computing involves creating collection
A class main purpose holding object called
The useful container
A sequence element given type
The element stored contiguously memory
So STL vector collection value way like mathematical meaning
Besides data structure vector also term pointer code

interrupt vector point interrupt code invoked
To help remember CS meaning word may helpful refer Latin root vehere mean convey carry
Thus vector carry contains thing generally speaking

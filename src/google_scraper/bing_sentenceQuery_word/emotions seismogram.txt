Philosophers psychologist long debated emotion
Are state soul judgment goal satisfaction perception physiological change
Advances suggest brain generate emotion combination cognitive appraisal bodily perception
Suppose something really good happens today win lottery child get admitted Harvard someone interested asks
Naturally feel happy happiness amount
On traditional dualist view person consist body soul soul experience mental state happiness
This view appealing implication even feel happiness body gone soul continues exist pleasant location heaven
Unfortunately good evidence existence soul immortality dualist view emotion mind general dismissed wishful thinking motivated inference
There currently two main scientific way explaining nature emotion
According cognitive appraisal theory emotion judgment extent current situation meet
Happiness evaluation goal satisfied winning lottery solves financial problem asked hold promise satisfying romantic need
Similarly sadness evaluation goal satisfied judgment aimed whatever blocking accomplishment goal
Alternatively William James others argued emotion perception change body heart rate breathing rate perspiration level
On view happiness kind physiological perception judgment emotion sadness anger mental reaction different kind physiological stage
The problem account bodily state seem nearly finely tuned many different kind emotional state
Yet undoubtedly connection emotion physiological change
brain work show theory emotion cognitive appraisal physiological perception combined unified account emotion
The brain parallel processor many thing
Visual kind perception result input sens interpretation based past knowledge
Similarly brain perform emotion interactively combining judgment goal satisfaction perception bodily change
The judgment performed prefrontal cortex interacts amygdala insula process information physiological state
Hence happiness brain process simultaneously make appraisal perceives body

This wonderful article interesting always get great feeling heart something terrific happens
I would like read something author heart endorphin react good thing happen good people
Thanks article Marilyn Dear Paul view emotion besides two alternative mentioned
For instance Jaak Panksepp book Affective Neuroscience describes innate operational system generate feeling result brain physiological activity
release neuropeptides specific kind affective state interaction rest body environment
This view similar classical Cannon explanation emotion deviation brain homeostasis also partially assumed LeDoux group

Neural affective decision theory Choice brain emotion
Cognitive Systems Research
If chemical brain moving around breathing blood flow whatever bodily function
Why ability chose function
Why man start baseball put one foot front developed language
All emotion imagination
could debate year science chemical proof alone something u created
explain love
attraction
every move make
type computer
made wisdom
gave u POWER
great thing
want say science pointing something else pose question well start
well
truth whatever power control
gave u power
choice
ability scientifically explain
What meant soul What Are Emotions
By Paul Thagard April Hot Thought talk body soul
Thanks
The brain primary role survival nature developed survival every living thing work like The brain creates response situation increase survival rate fear response would get danger survive
love response would procreate ensuring survival love fear pain emotion etc come many form variation increasing survival
The brain responces electrical induced chemical reaction word Drugs ie endorphin adrenaline one know sure brain produce many type order aid primary function survival SO short answer emotion

state evoke predisposed associated various way pertaining individual emotion
Emotions subjective experience experienced individual point view
Emotion often associated
The English word derived French word
This based Latin variant mean mean
The related term motivation also derived
Emotions divided theory emotion theory emotion instinctual emotion cognitive emotion
Some psychologist divide emotion basic complex category base emotion lead complex one
Emotions categorized duration
Some emotion occur period second
surprise others last year
love
No definitive taxonomy exists
A related distinction emotion result emotion principally behaviour emotional expression
People often behave certain way direct result emotional state cry fighting fleeing
Yet one emotion without corresponding behaviour may consider behaviour essential emotion
The posit emotional experience largely due experience bodily change
The functionalist approach emotion hold emotion evolved particular function keep subject safe
There considerable debate concerning emotion classified
Firstly emotion distinctive discrete state vary smoothly along one underlying dimension
The circumplex model James Russell example latter placing emotion along dimension arousal
Another popular option divide emotion basic complex category emotion considered foundational existence others

In respect complex emotion may regarded development upon basic emotion
Such development may occur due cultural conditioning association
Alternatively analogous way combine could blend together form full spectrum human emotional experience
For example interpersonal anger disgust could blend form contempt
proposed circumplex model describes relation among emotion
This model similar color wheel
The vertical dimension represents intensity circle represents degree similarity among emotion
He posited eight primary emotion dimension arranged four pair opposite
Some also argued existence emotion emotion
In general discussion centre around emotion dimension considered foundational
Combined view also available
Another important mean distinguishing emotion concern occurrence time
Some emotion occur period second
surprise others last year
love
The latter could regarded long term emotion regarding certain object rather emotion proper though disputed
A distinction made emotion episode emotional disposition
Dispositions also comparable character trait someone may said generally disposed experience certain emotion though different object
For example irritable person generally disposed feel irritation easily quickly others
Finally theorist
place emotion within general category state
Where affective state also include phenomenon pleasure pain motivational state
hunger curiosity mood disposition trait
Theories emotion stretch back least far Ancient Greek well
We also see sophisticated theory work philosopher
More recent theory emotion tend informed advance empirical research
Often theory mutually exclusive many researcher incorporate multiple perspective work
Somatic theory emotion claim bodily response rather judgement essential emotion
The first modern version theory come William James
The theory lost favour Century regained popularity recently thanks largely theorist able appeal neurological evidence
article Emotion
argued emotional experience largely due experience bodily change
These change might visceral postural facially expressive
Danish psychologist also proposed similar theory around time thus resulting position known
This theory derivates state changed situation lead changed bodily state
As James say perception bodily change occur IS emotion
James claim feel sorry cry angry strike afraid tremble cry strike tremble sorry angry fearful case may
This theory supported experiment manipulating bodily state desired emotion induced
Such experiment also therapeutic implication

The theory often misunderstood seems
Most people believe emotion give rise action
I cry I sad I ran away I scared
The theory conversely asserts react situation running away cry happen emotion interpret action emotional response
In way emotion serve explain organize action u
Based discovery made neural mapping explanation human emotion emotion pleasant unpleasant mental state organized limbic system
If distinguished reactive response emotion would mammalian elaboration general arousal pattern neurochemical brain activity level visible body movement gesture posture
In human being feeling displayed emotion cue
For example human emotion proposed evolved paleocircuits mammalian brain specifically module designed care feeding grooming offspring
Paleocircuits neural platform bodily expression configured million year advent speech
They consist pathway network
They evolved prior earliest mammalian ancestor far back control motor function
Presumably mammalian brain life world automatic preconscious predictable
The motor center react sensory cue vision sound touch chemical gravity motion body movement programmed posture
With arrival circa million year ago smell replaced vision dominant sense different way responding arose sense proposed developed emotion emotional memory
In mammalian brain invested heavily succeed night reptile slept one explanation olfactory lobe mammalian brain proportionally larger reptile
These odor pathway gradually formed neural blueprint later become limbic brain
Emotions thought related activity brain area direct attention motivate behavior determine significance going around u
Pioneering work suggested emotion related group structure center brain called includes structure
More recent research shown directly related emotion others structure found greater emotional relevance
There number theory emotion argue cognitive activity form judgement evaluation thought necessary order emotion occur
This argued necessary capture fact emotion something
Such cognitive activity may conscious unconscious may may take form conceptual processing
An influential theory
A prominent philosophical exponent

The theory proposed appraisal lead action tendency another example
A recent hybrid somatic cognitive theory emotion perceptual theory
This theory arguing bodily response central emotion yet emphasis meaningfulness emotion idea emotion something recognised cognitive theory
The novel claim theory conceptually based cognition unnecessary meaning
Rather bodily change meaningful content emotion result causally triggered certain situation
In respect emotion held analogous faculty vision touch provide information relation subject world various way
A sophisticated defense view found philosopher Jesse Prinz book psychologist James Laird book
Related view also found work
The theory developed Howard Weiss Russell Cropanzano look cause structure consequence emotional experience especially work context
This theory suggests emotion influenced caused event turn influence attitude behavior
This theoretical frame also emphasizes human being experience call emotion episode series emotional state extended time organized around underlying theme Weiss Beal
This theory utilized numerous researcher better understand emotion communicative lens reviewed Howard Weiss Daniel Beal article published
In argued dominance theory regarding physiological cause emotion second edition
Where James argued bodily change often precedes emotion Cannon Bard argued experience emotion bodily reaction response stimulus occur nearly simultaneously
Another cognitive theory
This based experiment purportedly showing subject different emotional reaction despite placed physiological state injection adrenaline
Subjects observed express either anger amusement depending whether another person situation displayed emotion
Hence combination appraisal situation cognitive whether participant received adrenaline placebo together determined response
This experiment criticized Jesse Prinz
Discrete emotion theory assumes seven ten core emotion thousand emotion related word synonym core emotion Beck
Depending theory well known core emotion Izard Malatesta
This theory state specific core emotion biologically determined emotional response whose expression recognition fundamentally individual regardless ethnic
The theory also state certain repetitive emotional experience childhood develop trait bias govern interpersonal relationship adulthood
Some scholar believe emotion evolved u way people regardless communication difference predict people thinking feeling Beck
It way ancestor tell difference friend foe continued serve function today
A recent version cognitive theory come regard emotion broadly synchronization many different bodily cognitive component
Emotions identified overall process whereby low level cognitive appraisal particular processing relevance trigger bodily reaction behavior feeling action
Many different discipline produced work emotion

Perspectives emotion evolution theory initiated late century book
Darwin original thesis emotion evolved via natural selection therefore universal counterpart
Furthermore animal undergo emotion comparable see
Evidence universality human case provided seminal research facial expression
Other research area focus physical display emotion including body language animal human see
The increased potential also allowed investigation evolutionarily ancient part brain
Important neurological advance made perspective example
American evolutionary biologist argues moral emotion based principal
The notion particular relevance
This theory posit different emotion different reciprocal effect
Sympathy prompt person offer first favor particularly someone need help would go furthest
Anger protects person cheater accept favor without reciprocating making want punish ingrate sever relationship
Gratitude impels beneficiary reward helped past
Finally guilt prompt cheater danger found making want repair relationship redressing misdeed
As well guilty feeling encourage cheater caught advertise promise behave better future
We try regulate emotion fit norm situation based many sometimes conflicting demand upon u originate various entity studied sociology micro level social role rule everyday social interaction situation shaped macro level social institution discourse ideology etc
For example modern marriage one hand based emotion love hand emotion worked regulated
The sociology emotion also focus general population
Emotional appeal commonly found advertising health campaign political message
Recent example include health campaign political campaign advertising emphasizing fear terrorism
Depending particular school general emphasis either cognitive component emotion physical energy discharging symbolic movement facial expression component emotion different school approach human emotion differently
While example school propose distressing emotion relieved discharging hence cry laughing sweating shaking trembling
Other cognitively oriented school approach via cognitive component
Yet approach emotion via symbolic movement facial expression component like contemporary
In research computer science engineering psychology neuroscience aimed developing device recognize human display model emotion Fellous Armony LeDoux
In computer science branch study development deal design system device recognize interpret process human emotion

While origin field may traced far back early philosophical enquiry modern branch computer science originated paper affective computing
Detecting emotional information begin passive capture data user physical state behavior without interpreting input
The data gathered analogous cue human use perceive emotion others
Another area within affective computing design computational device proposed exhibit either innate emotional capability capable convincingly simulating emotion
Emotional speech processing recognizes user emotional state analyzing speech pattern
The detection processing facial expression body gesture achieved detector sensor

Young intended prove light consists wave
Today experiment used help people understand way electron act like wave create pattern
For experiment beam light aimed barrier two vertical slit
The light pass slit resulting pattern recorded photographic plate
When one slit covered pattern would expected single line light aligned whichever slit open
Intuitively one would expect slit open pattern light reflect two line light aligned slit
In fact happens photographic plate separate multiple line lightness darkness varying degree
What illustrated result interference taking place wave going slit seemingly two trajectory
Each go slit simultaneously take every possible trajectory en route photographic plate
In order see might possibly occur experiment focused tracking path individual photon
Surprisingly measurement way disrupts photon trajectory somehow result experiment become would predicted classical physic two bright line photographic plate aligned slit barrier

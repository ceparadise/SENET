In refers changing entity one another
There two type conversion implicit explicit
The term implicit type conversion
Explicit type conversion specific way known
Explicit type conversion also achieved separately defined conversion routine overloaded object constructor
Implicit type conversion also known automatic type conversion
Some allow even require compiler provide coercion
In mixed type expression subtype converted subtypes converted supertype maybe none type program run correctly
For example legal program
Although belong different datatypes automatically converted datatype time comparison assignment executed
There several kind explicit conversion
Each rule type converted
In general object fundamental data type
A special programming instruction specifies treat variable intermediate calculation result given expression
Casting ignore extra information never add information type casted
The either unchecked bit pattern
As example fundamental data type float could cast data beyond decimal binary point ignored
Alternatively integer could cast float example function call required floating point type noted information really added would become
Object casting work similar way
A cast parent type extra information make subclass ignored part inherited parent treated
For example triangle class derived shape class could cast shape
There two common casting style outlined
This style casting used Java
It follows form Several cast syntax used although casting supported well
The style follows form This style casting adopted force clarity using casting
For example result intention C style cast may clear cast using casting allows clarity Later evolution following explicit cast added language clarify programmer intent even Static cast convert value
For instance following convert value corresponding integer value
Static cast dangerous Static cast pointer reference verify object new type
A dynamic cast safer static cast scenario compiled compiler call runtime library check made ensure legal cast
This analogous cast Java
Dynamic cast pointer return null pointer cast value type incompatible
Dynamic cast reference throw type exception
A const cast cast away constness object returning reference object
This allows modification object normally would treated compiler The reinterpret cast notorious one
It allows reinterpretation raw bit pattern value cast disregarding type system completely
For example allows casting arbitrary integer pointer object Opinions divided verbose cast introduced language
Detractor argued new syntax claimed since casting activity begin highlighted syntax alert
Another perceived advantage ease verbose cast located using like

The function take floating point number string turn int
For floating point number decimal portion number process call number line
Let u see action The last case show string syntactically legal number otherwise get one pesky runtime error
Modify example deleting rerun program
You see integer
The type converter turn integer float syntactically legal string float
The type converter turn argument string
Remember print string quote removed
However print type see definitely

In different way changing entity one another
An example would conversion value value textual representation vice versa
Type conversion take advantage certain feature
Two important aspect type conversion whether happens whether underlying data representation converted one representation another given representation merely representation another data type
In general converted
Each rule type converted
Languages typically little implicit conversion discourage reinterpretation representation language perform many implicit conversion data type
Weak typing language often allow forcing arbitrarily interpret data item different programming error technical method directly deal underlying hardware
In language word used denote conversion either compilation
For example expression mixing integer floating point number like compiler automatically convert integer representation floating point representation fraction lost
Explicit type conversion either indicated writing additional code
adding type identifier calling coding conversion routine compiler use otherwise would halt type mismatch
In language distinctly different concept
In language refers either implicitly explicitly changing value one data type storage format another
integer integer
The storage need may change result conversion including possible loss precision truncation
The word hand refers explicitly changing representing value one type another
For example contiguous bit may treated array booleans string unsigned integer IEEE single precision floating point value
Because stored bit never changed programmer must know low level detail representation format byte order alignment need meaningfully cast
In C family language word typically refers type conversion opposed implicit conversion causing ambiguity whether real data representation conversion
More important multitude way rule apply data type class located pointer pointer may adjusted compiler case like object class inheritance
Implicit type conversion also known automatic type conversion
Some allow compiler provide coercion others require
In expression data one supertype needed program run correctly
For example following legal code Although belong different data type automatically converted equal data type time comparison assignment executed
This behavior used caution unintended consequence arise
Data lost converting representation integer fractional component value truncated rounded toward zero
Conversely precision lost converting representation integer since type may unable exactly represent integer type
For example might single precision type represent integer exactly integer type
This lead unintuitive behavior demonstrated following code On compiler implement float IEEE single precision ints least bit code give peculiar Note represents equality last line
This odd behavior caused implicit conversion float compared
The conversion cause loss precision make value equal comparison
Important takeaway One special case implicit type conversion type promotion compiler automatically expands binary representation object integer type
Promotions commonly used type smaller native type target platform ALU arithmetic logical operation make operation possible efficient ALU work one type
C perform promotion object boolean character wide character enumeration short integer type promoted int object type float promoted double
Unlike type conversion promotion never lose precision modify value stored object
In Explicit type conversion type conversion explicitly defined within program instead done compiler implicit type conversion
It defined user program
There several kind explicit conversion
In language object also reference base class cast one derived class
In type conversion made safe unsafe manner former called
In similar effect achieved using
In notion type conversion integrated rule type system
The Assignment Rule say assignment valid type source expression case type target entity case
In rule mean type source expression either target
Conformance type defined familiar rule
For example assignment type conforms type class upon based descendant upon based
The action type conversion Eiffel specifically defined A type based class CU type T based class CT T U either Eiffel fully compliant Microsoft
Before development Eiffel already extensive class library
Using type library particularly commonly used type string pose conversion problem
Existing Eiffel software us string class Eiffel library Eiffel software written must use string class many case example calling method expect item type passed argument
So conversion type back forth need seamless possible
In code two string declared one different type Eiffel compliant alias
Because conform assignment valid convert
The Eiffel class conversion procedure object type
Conversion procedure also always designated creation procedure similar constructor
The following excerpt class The presence conversion procedure make assignment semantically equivalent constructed new object type content equivalent
To handle assignment original source target reversed class also contains conversion query produce instance
The assignment becomes equivalent In Eiffel setup type conversion included class code appears happen automatically client code
The includes assignment type attachment well argument parameter substitution
In typecasting misuse type conversion temporarily change data type originally defined
This provides opportunity hacker since type conversion variable typecast become different data type compiler treat hacked variable new data type specific operation

We seen one function already output message
To use function always write name followed parenthesis
The word basically mean input function
Then function action depending argument
When multiple argument function separate comma
For example give multiple argument print order space separating
We demonstrate example
A function may also give back value like output
For example function short give back largest argument must number
The function friend behaves similarly function return smallest argument
Functions combined create complicated expression
You limited using function Python
In lesson learn define new function
If call function enough argument input many argument get error
For example requires least one input It important carefully read error get back code work
Python usually give helpful feedback went wrong
However sometimes need look around little bit diagnose problem example
Python say syntax error mean ca understand trying This exercise using function

Accessibility link Monday January By BST Aug I six year old I found brother book BASIC programming started experimenting house PC machine
A mild booting error missing core system file later followed touch computer anymore old one AMSTRAD CPS marked beginning relationship computer
I grew ultimate goal pursue BSc Computer Science took goal met mistake submitting country required choice study education system document I
I ended enrolled BSc Economics course I particularly interested
My specific situation might generally applicable worldwide audience Internet technical study becoming ubiquitous
Computer Science however stop flying around mind I sure someone might facing dilemma I faced year ago point represent thought advice I believe might useful people The problem I learning thing I liked thing I try
The answer really simple stop thinking studying Computer Science probably study Computer Science
How know actually tried
You play safe
Start short online introductory course programming algorithm
Coursera time start get idea like code
Ruby would good language start simple avoids many complexity language
Watch video program along start getting excited would probably enjoy studying Computer Science
On hand like Computer Science get passionate coding possible area may suited Technical Writing
Writing documentation
This would require bit technical knowledge actually know writing spot error
Either way Computer Science change way think
During BSc I idea I would make possible convert computing
I realised however change line thinking either going back school another BSc rather finding role unrelated personality potential
It old saying picking something like well people pay
I knew I many year steer towards goal many year benefit advantage another degree I wanted take bigger risk find way exact moment
My thinking process fairly simple I experienced A lead believe B B true I take action I experienced studying something I like I change lead hypothesis faster I would graduate quicker I would dive thing I liked proper CS course
I accepted hypothesis true I graduated highest mark BSc I I wanted apply accepted really good BSc CS degree abroad
I time ready spend another year life starting moment I realised I could convert month
There Ivy League MSc Computer Science conversion course widely known
Their entry requirement involve good undergraduate degree strong passion Computer Science exactly I needed
These month course really intensive challenging life changing time
If passionate programming find course interesting logical importantly memorable
The actual studying homework programming assignment medium hard difficulty may seem paced bit fast push achieve great thing
Go designated prerequisite disastrous ignore prerequisite advise tremendously useful follow
Make sure understand code term math programming abstract thinking bug group project programming multiple computer language
A thing I realised converting Computing You WILL make mistake point find early learn identify even earlier next time move take personally
Make sure accept actively seek offer input colleague especially think input needed
New tool platform requirement APIs likely appear month month beauty technology
Just smile face new challenge
Attend hackathons competition coding finding smart solution interest problem coder know create something scratch
Having completed project show great way showcase work ability

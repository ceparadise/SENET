In cataloging structure contains reference possibly directory
On many computer directory known provide relevancy traditional office
Files organized storing related file directory
In one file directory organized manner resembles directory contained inside another directory called
The term often used describe relationship subdirectory directory cataloged latter parent
The directory filesystem parent called directory
Historically even modern file system either support directory flat meaning subdirectory supported group directory containing file
In modern system directory contain mix file subdirectory
A reference location directory system called
In many program associated execute
Typically file name accessed program assumed reside within directory file name specified explicit directory name
Some operating system restrict access project directory thus isolating activity user
In early version Unix root directory home directory modern Unix usually us another directory purpose
In keeping Unix system treat directory type file
The name presenting analogy used office used hierarchical file system design ERMA Mark published well used almost modern desktop environment
Folders often depicted visually resemble physical file folder
There difference concept metaphor used represent
For example us concept help present content computer user fairly consistent way free user deal absolute directory path vary version Windows individual installation
Many operating system also concept smart folder reflect result file system search operation
These folder represent directory file hierarchy
Many allow creation folder organize email
These folder corresponding representation filesystem structure
If one referring term appropriate
The term refers way structured list document file folder stored computer
The distinction due way directory accessed Unix system usually referred directory viewed accessed graphical user may sometimes call folder
Operating system support hierarchical filesystems practically modern one implement form recent lookup
In world usually called DNLC although called
For local filesystems DNLC entry normally expire pressure recent entry
For necessary ensure entry invalidated client

A directory defined
A directory contains bookkeeping information file figuratively speaking beneath hierarchy
You think directory file cabinet contains folder contain file
manual often describe directory file structure term
The file directory level contained directory
To file may need specify directory
You specifying
The topmost directory called
A directory another directory called
A directory subdirectory called
Under DOS Windows root directory back slash
To information information directory must use
You directly edit directory file
For example DIR command read directory file display content
Many use term instead directory
For example Windows Explorer display hierarchical structure file folder drive computer addition showing mapped network drive
The Windows Explorer GUI make easy see folder hierarchy serf primary tool copy move rename search file folder computer

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
What difference context computer science
Most time interchangeable term
Directory classical term used since early time file system folder sort friendly name may sound familiar user
The main difference folder logical concept necessarily map physical directory
A directory file system object
A folder GUI object
Wikipedia explains way The name folder presenting analogy file folder used office used originally Apple Lisa used almost modern operating system desktop environment
Folders often depicted icon visually resemble physical file folder
Strictly speaking difference directory file system concept graphical user interface metaphor used represent folder
For example Microsoft Windows us concept special folder help present content computer user fairly consistent way free user deal absolute directory path vary version Windows individual installation
If one referring container document term folder appropriate
The term directory refers way structured list document file folder stored computer
It comparable telephone directory contains list name number address contain actual document

A location storing file computer
Directories found
In picture right example output show local big directory cdn directory
When looking overview C drive considered nothing beneath ca go back
If using operating system multiple user account directory may also referred
In Microsoft Windows directory referred
However directory folder synonymous
Below example directory would look like
In example C letter current directory Windows directory
Below example directory path may look like Linux Unix variant
In example current directory bin subdirectory usr directory
The beginning root directory
To see directory file current directory use dir command
In Linux view directory file current directory use l command
Both command also switch added view directory directory file
To change directory Linux Unix command line operating system use cd command
To make directory Linux Unix command line operating system use mkdir command
To remove directory use rmdir command
In Linux Unix use rm command
A directory contain type even store directory file
Below listing used creating file directory operating system
When creating directory character used receive error encounter problem

A general form specifies unique location
A path point file system location following directory tree hierarchy expressed path component separated delimiting character represent directory
The delimiting character commonly character colon though may use different
Paths used extensively represent relationship common modern operating system essential construction URLs
Resources represented either
Multics first introduced hierarchical file system directory separated
Around Unix introduced slash character directory separator
In first version Microsoft DOS released
support file directory
Also major portion utility command packaged came IBM command line syntax used slash character prefix
For example run command wide list format option
This use slash still found command interface Windows
By contrast Unix us dash character command line switch prefix
When directory support added version kept switch prefix character backwards compatibility
Microsoft chose backslash character directory separator look similar slash character
An path point location file system regardless current
To must include
By contrast path start given working directory avoiding need provide full absolute path
A considered relative path based current working directory
If working directory file result file addressed name
note also used reference root current user library current working directory respectively
When filesystems filename extension mounted
character changed example
note prefix may number boot volume AppleShare home directory Japanese Korean version Windows may often display character character instead directory separator
In case code backslash drawn character
Very early version replaced backslash glyph display make possible display program understood character square bracket replaced well see
Although even first version Windows supported character set Yen sign modern version Windows support Won sign much software continue display backslashes found ASCII file way preserve backwards compatibility
derivative UNIX us UNIX path internally
However preserve compatibility software familiarity user many portion GUI switch typed user internally switch back displaying filename entered user also changed inverse translation happen
The Microsoft Windows short specifies common syntax describe location network resource shared file directory printer
The UNC syntax Windows system generic form Microsoft often refers
Some Microsoft Windows interface also allow require UNC syntax share access rather URL
The UNC syntax extended optional component denote use SSL port number WebDAV URL becomes When viewed remotely SharedFolder may name different program server see opening
Instead SharedFolder name consists arbitrary name assigned folder defining sharing
Some Microsoft Windows interface also accept Long UNC Microsoft Windows us following type path In version Windows prior Windows XP APIs accept Long UNC could accept character
The allows path name character long
Since UNCs start two backslashes backslash also used string escaping result extreme case escaped string regular expression matching UNC begin backslashes string regular expression require escaping
This simplified using C Python regular expression literal Perl
Most system use similar syntax
allows treating path beginning two slash manner though case system must treat multiple slash single slash
Many application system example use resource definition like service name The following worked example discus behavior would appear terminal terminal application window Attached current working directory cwd One want change current working directory At moment desired represented short absolute path directory Given relative path directory wanted following may typed change current working directory bobapples Two dot point upwards indicate one dot represents current directory
Both component complex relative path alone first component relative path represents
Using refer file current working directory sometimes usefully distinguish resource found default directory mean example view specific version instead one installed system
Contrary popular belief accepts slash thus Unix example work
But many application Windows interpret slash purpose treat invalid character thus require enter backslash notably shell often called terminal typically run terminal window
Note many shell available Windows allow slash
In addition indicate single root instead root current disk
Indicating file disk current one requires prefixing drive letter colon
No ambiguity ensues colon valid character filename thus one file called A current directory
UNC name path starting support slash
The following example show path backslashes used match common syntax This path point file name located directory turn located root directory drive
This path refers file called located parent directory current directory drive
This path denotes file called located directory turn located directory located current directory current drive since example give
This rather simple path point file named located current directory since path lack current drive since drive specification present
This path refers first
This example us path containing slash directory separator
The command redirects content file command
A path containing forward slash often need surrounded double quote disambiguate
CD drive letter Files work root drive letter directory
This appears treat forward slash
For example work Also root folder would treated If relative path directory name specified forward slash get following error For setting environment variable sometimes necessary provide path contain space instance defined C cause script halt encounter space path name
To get name Windows assigns directory substitution environment variable use directory listing command option one level target directory
For instance following get eight character name directory directly root

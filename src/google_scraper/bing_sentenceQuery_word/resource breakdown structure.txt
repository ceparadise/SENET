Want watch later
Let say want open salon spa
Where begin
What need
These type question asked everyday people either want start may already business
Some fledgling business may still unsure need begin operating efficiently
The answer question come form resource breakdown structure
A defined hierarchical model used identify list break resource used facilitating completing project
Let take look RBS help attempting identify resource well estimating base cost project
Have ever gone grocery store pocket idea needed
If done may already realize easy go budget unless plan ahead
The said trying estimate cost project without resource breakdown structure
This remedied effective use functional project manager
Functional project manager important RBS help identify number resource needed complete project task level
Let take look following resource breakdown structure model Although many individual may able determine corporation take knowledge functional project manager able break resource even
If RBS model see people equipment material broken even
This done help functional project manager
When attempting accurately estimate cost project average person may miscalculate unaware
Project team member important regard well
In many instance best idea improve work productivity come actual employee administration CEO
Although administration responsible making important business decision employee project team member perform duty daily basis better understanding work
Project member work together functional project manager identify resource needed
In project management often difficult identify type resource needed
This must done properly adequate resource help ensure project strategically completed
The type resource may used resource breakdown structure model include equipment personnel

Typically people think resource think physical resource
However key thing remember RBS resource may human well physical
Let look back resource breakdown structure model used earlier lesson
You notice one people
This categorized manager could broken even assistant manager supervisor
Both physical human resource needed organization wish accurate cost estimate project
It also important note resource cost organization money included
Therefore money included instance resource RBS
hierarchical model illustrates resource needed complete specific project
Resource breakdown structure important part project management
Managing project right way entail identifying breaking needed resource level order help organization complete project
Functional project manager effective part RBS RBS consists identifying breaking specific resource used facilitating completing project
Only closely involved functional project manager well project team member thorough understanding far resource broken
Resource breakdown structure may include following type resource physical human equipment personnel

This somewhat similar organizational breakdown structure work relationship project management
defined model structured help identify employee responsible specific part project
Let take closer look organizational breakdown structure used conjunction project management
If happen unfamiliar concept summarized approach us knowledge skill ability complete task project beginning end
Project management used several job industry
For example project management used determine building constructed even football team go coaching training player play different position
Another key function work OBS within project management called work breakdown structure
Where OBS help determine employee department responsible task described breaking project smaller part make manageable
The goal break project task assign cost responsible department team see next section
Before take look full example OBS let look three important step must first taken ensure OBS properly performed conjunction project management

A also referred Contract Work Breakdown Structure CWBS breakdown project smaller component
A work breakdown structure key project deliverable organizes team manageable section
The PMBOK defines work breakdown structure A hierarchical decomposition total work carried accomplish project objective create required deliverable
A structure element may combination thereof
A WBS also provides necessary framework detailed cost estimating control along providing guidance development control
WBS hierarchical incremental decomposition project phase deliverable work package
It show subdivision effort required achieve objective example
In project contract WBS developed starting end objective successively subdividing manageable component term size duration responsibility system subsystem component subtasks work package include step necessary achieve objective
The work breakdown structure provides common framework natural development overall planning control contract basis dividing work definable increment developed technical schedule cost labor hour reporting established
A work breakdown structure permit summing subordinate cost task material successively higher level parent task material etc
For element work breakdown structure description task performed generated
This technique sometimes called used define organize total
The WBS organized around primary product project planned outcome instead work needed produce product planned action
Since planned outcome desired end project form relatively stable set category cost planned action needed achieve collected
A WBS make easy assign project activity one one terminal element WBS
In addition function cost accounting WBS also help map requirement one level system specification another example requirement cross reference matrix mapping functional requirement high level low level design document
The WBS may displayed horizontally form vertically tree structure like organization chart
The development WBS normally occurs start project precedes detailed project task planning
The concept work breakdown structure developed PERT DoD
PERT introduced Navy support development missile program
While term work breakdown structure used first implementation PERT organize task category
By June DoD aerospace industry published document system described WBS approach
This guide endorsed Secretary Defense adoption service
In DoD issued Work Breakdown Structures Defense Materiel Items requiring use work breakdown structure across DoD
The document revised several time recently
The current version document found Work Breakdown Structures Defense Materiel Items
It includes WBS definition specific defense materiel commodity system address WBS element common system
Defense Materiel Item category The common element identified Appendix L Integration assembly test checkout Systems engineering Program management System test evaluation Training Data Peculiar support equipment Common support equipment activation Industrial facility Initial spare repair part
The standard also includes additional common element unique Space Systems Launch Vehicle Systems Automated Information Systems
In PMI documented expansion technique across organization
The PMBOK Guide provides overview WBS concept Practice Standard Work Breakdown Structures comparable DoD standard intended general application
An important design principle work breakdown structure called rule
It defined follows In addition rule important overlap scope definition different element work breakdown structure
This ambiguity could result duplicated work miscommunications responsibility authority
Such overlap could also cause confusion regarding project cost accounting
If WBS element name ambiguous WBS dictionary help clarify distinction WBS element
The WBS Dictionary describes component WBS deliverable activity scope sometimes date cost quality
If work breakdown structure designer attempt capture detail WBS designer likely include either many action action
Too many action exceed parent scope fall short parent scope
The best way adhere rule define WBS element term outcome result action
This also ensures WBS overly prescriptive method allowing greater ingenuity creative thinking part project participant
For new product development project common technique ensure WBS use
may use similar technique employ feature breakdown structure
When project provides professional service common technique capture planned deliverable create WBS
Work breakdown structure subdivide work project phase
preliminary design phase critical design phase must ensure phase clearly separated deliverable also used defining entry
approved preliminary critical
One must decide stop dividing work smaller element
This assist determining duration activity necessary produce deliverable defined WBS
There several heuristic rule thumb used determining appropriate duration activity group activity necessary produce specific deliverable defined WBS
A work package activity level task It common work breakdown structure element numbered sequentially reveal hierarchical structure
The purpose numbering provide consistent approach identifying managing WBS across like system regardless vendor service
For example example identifies item Level WBS element since three number separated
A coding scheme also help WBS element recognized written context allows mapping WBS Dictionary
A practical example WBS coding scheme The lowest element terminal element one subdivided
In Work Breakdown Structure element activity also known work package item term linked scheduled
At juncture WBS element organization unit control account work package established performance planned measured recorded controlled
A WBS expressed level interest
Three level minimum recommended additional level item high cost high risk two level detail case system engineering program management standard showing example WBS varying depth software development point going level system level
The higher WBS structure consistent whatever norm template mandate exist within organization domain
For example shipbuilding Navy must respect nautical term hierarchy structure put embedded Naval Architecture matching Navy office procedure built match naval architecture structure significant change WBS element numbering naming hierarchy would unacceptable
The figure left show work breakdown structure construction technique demonstrates rule progressive elaboration technique
At WBS Level show unit work total scope project design build custom bicycle
At WBS Level unit divided seven element
The number unit allocated element work based effort cost estimate task duration
The three largest element WBS Level subdivided Level
The two largest element Level represent total scope project
These larger element could subdivided using technique described
WBS design supported software
allow automatic rolling point value
Estimates effort cost developed discussion among project team member
This collaborative technique build greater insight scope definition underlying assumption consensus regarding level granularity required manage project

Resource Breakdown Structure RBS A hierarchical listing resource necessary complete project
Project resource commonly thought human resource
In word people actually work project task
But necessarily type resource list compiled
In fact RBS include human resource physical resource like computer software program timesheets tool instrument automobile even special clothing
As seen hierarchy entirely project defined
Any leveling applicable project used
Examples might organizational chart tool type physical location even sequencing use
Any useful project breakdown appropriate
Traditionally resource included
Expendable item water gasoline would listed
These would fall category supply rather resource
Example hierarchy resource The example includes human inanimate physical resource like software test instrument
Notice numbering nomenclature
The hierarchical list numbered indented layer adding another level numerical label
Examples
This make resource uniquely identifiable numerical label

The Resource Breakdown Structure RBS hierarchical structure representing enterprise resource enables create project plan detailed resource assignment compare workload detailed resource availability
The RBS also enables resource assignment availability data higher level
One specific reserved Enterprise Resource Outline Code called RBS
RBS represented Enterprise Resource Outline Code design significant effect EPM solution security view report process used project team building resource assignment well report resource commitment
It recommended organize EPM solution security model around RBS defining way reflects hierarchical relationship enterprise resource organization rather organizational structure
Proper definition RBS important success EPM solution deployment
RBS impact way organization manages EPM solution security access project resource view resource assignment EPM solution feature
You use hierarchical relationship defined part RBS simplify data access user user group
Use RBS define five security rule later create security category PWA client
RBS code functionality also used following area EPM solution Resource Substitution Wizard Portfolio Modeler Portfolio Analyzer Build Team Two default security categoriesMy Direct Reports My Resources RBS code hierarchical structure
For executive see information project resource manage must placed appropriately RBS hierarchy
If using organizational RBS make sure place executive people manage
If executive want see resource information project organization make sure place RBS hierarchy anyone work project organization
Without may able see information project
Three primary factor consider define RBS code layout organization follows Your process assigning resource project task Your organizational security design goal The method organization us determine whether particular resource appropriate particular task assignment Proper definition RBS code important
RBS code play largest role resource assignment resource manager make staffing decision
RBS code play lesser role resource assignment done collaborative manner group manager organization
RBS may play relatively small role project manager make resource assignment decision
The next consideration determine organizational goal securing Enterprise Project Management environment
The question able answer following Do want minimize EPM solution administrative burden organization
Does organization generally allow everybody see edit enterprise project resource data organization need limit data access system permission
If limit data access user able view project resource data provided area department organization
If organization want implement secure easily administered EPM solution RBS play integral role security design
If organization project management process generally le defined RBS may play le important role organization security design
Finally review process organization us determine whether resource good fit project Do assign resource project task based departmental organizational structure
When assigning resource project geographic location resource matter
Do perform resource planning scheduling
Which three criterion important
The answer question help determine appropriate RBS structure organization
Most organization use one following An organizational RBS A modified organizational RBS A geographic RBS You define one RBS code organization
You modify RBS code structure time
If decide make significant change RBS code structure aware implementing new RBS code significantly modifying existing RBS code structure using EPM solution month may complex task requiring careful analysis impact RBS change
NOTE Use group name rather individual name define RBS structure entry
Group name change generally le often individual name
This trick help minimize future change RBS hierarchy
You choose three method creating RBS Manually define lookup table hierarchical structure
Define RBS structure part process importing resource using Import Resources Wizard
This method may time consuming prone error omission
Use PDS create RBS structure
An usually appropriate organization
Resources perform role based function department
Figure show example organizational RBS code
The organizational RBS code structure closely mirror structure organization
You build RBS code hierarchy reflects company level division department group resource level
Resources tied particular resource level manager tied workgroup department division company level based level responsibility influence
Most organization find organizational RBS meet overall need best
A generally appropriate manager resource require higher wider level data access position organizational hierarchy might otherwise suggest
For example many IT department organized additional group development network administration technical support
A modified organizational RBS would stop IT department level IT departmental resource would able view access project data related IT department
Another example modified organizational RBS might required strategic resource allocation determined team people various department
Figure show example modified organizational RBS hierarchy
You use code primary concern defining project team resource located
Your EPM solution user also able use RBS code see resource project geographic location
To create geographical RBS code build hierarchy geographical location organization office
You use continent country region city actual office location define RBS code hierarchy
Each resource organization assigned RBS code identifying resource location hierarchical position
Figure show example geographical RBS code
NOTE For additional detail RBS definition design review Chapter Working Resource Breakdown Structure available http
Also review Microsoft knowledge base article Description Resource Breakdown Structure How Use It Microsoft Project Server http
Although article written Project Server information applies Project Server well
The RBS code feature include dynamic security feature based Category security object
You control project resource given group user see access
The Project Server security model us RBS determine enterprise resource hierarchy
This hierarchy used category security setting allow member category view resource manage view project managed resource manage
The managing versus managed relationship based relative position RBS hierarchy
Because hierarchical relationship tends follow organizational structure use company organizational structure starting point developing RBS code structure
You modify RBS structure needed accommodate unique reporting security need
The RBS code structure used determine enterprise resource hierarchy
The standard security setting available initial setup configuration Project Server recommended starting point using five dynamic security rule
To understand effect RBS code structure EPM solution security review two default security category My Resources My Direct Reports
The My Resources category determines people resource manager allowed view
It make sense resource manager able see resource manage
You configure relationship using Allow Users This Category View Information All Resources That They Manage automatic security rule
Project Server us RBS code structure find resource RBS code subordinate RBS code resource manager
A resource manager considered anybody RBS hierarchy least one subordinate position defined
The My Direct Reports category us Allow Users This Category View Information All Resources That They Manage Directly automatic security rule allow resource manager view resource data resource immediately subordinate one level RBS hierarchy
The common element five rule resource manage phrase
Figure show five dynamic security rule enabled Admin module PWA client
RBS important element overall Project Server data security strategy element focus


In hierarchical list resource related function resource type used facilitate planning controlling project work
The Resource Breakdown Structure includes minimum personnel resource needed successful completion project preferably contains resource project fund spent including personnel tool machinery material equipment fee license
Money considered resource RBS resource cost money included
Assignable resource personnel typically defined functional point view work identified based role within project rather department role within parent company
In case geographic division may preferred
Each descending lower level represents increasingly detailed description resource small enough used conjunction WBS allow work planned monitored controlled
In common practice durable good resource listed RBS
Example hierarchy resource Both human physical resource software test instrument listed example
The nomenclature numbered hierarchical list indented layer level add additional digit representing
For example numeric label make resource uniquely identifiable
The RBS also known User Breakdown Structure field Project file specifically coded administrator project usually
Sometimes PM Administrator designated larger project manage Project tool
This field called Enterprise Resource Outline Code fall one two category RBS resource field RBS assignment field
These field require manager know used term organization

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue
The Work Breakdown Structure available

resource breakdown structure RBS project management document provides hierarchical breakdown resource category type
For purpose template resource include human resource equipment supply
The resource breakdown structure present resource relied upon complete project except financial resource
It capture people equipment supply represent cost completing project
In format RBS quite similar work breakdown structure
The template set forth identifying RBS number resource category type quantity needed
This template also provides section note
The project manager person responsible creating resource breakdown structure
Most likely gather input others project team

When create resource breakdown structure estimate resource required activity
With mind gather input activity list schedule management plan resource calendar risk register activity cost estimate enterprise environmental factor organizational process asset
Estimating cost project important planning step
It RBS useful
With WBS plan work need accomplished complete project
With RBS plan resource need perform work
Because RBS list resource represent cost project provides basis establishing project cost
The resource breakdown structure also input estimating activity duration developing project schedule

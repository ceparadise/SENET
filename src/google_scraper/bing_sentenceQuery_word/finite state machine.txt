The computational power distinction mean computational task Turing machine FSM
This FSM limited number state
FSMs studied general field
An example simple mechanism modeled state machine
A turnstile used control access subway amusement park ride gate three rotating arm waist height one across entryway
Initially arm locked blocking entry preventing patron passing
Depositing coin slot turnstile unlocks arm allowing single customer push
After customer pass arm locked another coin inserted
Considered state machine turnstile two possible state
There two possible input affect state putting coin slot pushing arm
In locked state pushing arm effect matter many time input given stay locked state
Putting coin giving machine input shift state
In unlocked state putting additional coin effect giving additional input change state
However customer pushing arm giving input shift state back

In addition use modeling reactive system presented finite state machine significant many different area including
Finite state machine class automaton studied
In computer science finite state machine widely used modeling application behavior design study computation language
Finite state machine subdivided transducer acceptor classifier sequencer
also called produce binary output indicating whether received input accepted
Each state FSM either accepting accepting
Once input received current state accepting state input accepted otherwise rejected

set string whose length prime number
A machine could also described defining language would contain every string accepted machine none rejected one language accepted machine
By definition language accepted FSMs language regular FSM accepts
The problem determining language accepted given finite state acceptor instance generalization graph edge weighted element arbitrary
The start state also accepting state case automaton accepts empty string
An example accepting state appears DFA detects whether input string contains even number
also start state indicates state even number input
S therefore accepting state
This machine finish accept state binary string contains even number including binary string containing
Examples string accepted DFA etc
A generalization finite state machine similar acceptor produce single output termination two terminal state

They produce one sequence seen output sequence acceptor transducer output
A distinction automaton
In deterministic automaton every state exactly one transition possible input
In automaton input lead one one transition given state
The algorithm transform nondeterministic automaton usually complex deterministic automaton identical functionality
A finite state machine one state called combinatorial FSM
It allows action upon transition state
This concept useful case number finite state machine required work together convenient consider purely combinatorial part form FSM suit design tool
There set semantics available represent state machine
For example tool modeling designing logic embedded controller
They combine usually one current state flow graph one language resulting different formalism set semantics
These chart like Harel original state machine support hierarchically nested state state action transition action
In accordance general classification following formal definition found For deterministic FSMs conventional allow
defined every combination
If FSM state next symbol defined announce error
reject input
This useful definition general state machine le useful transforming machine
Some algorithm default form may require total function
A finite state machine computational power restricted head may perform read operation always move left right

The converse transformation le straightforward Mealy machine state may different output label incoming transition edge
Every state need split multiple Moore machine state one every incident output symbol
Optimizing FSM mean finding machine minimum number state performs function
The fastest known algorithm
Other technique include using
Additionally acyclic FSAs minimized linear time

What difference Directed Graph Finite State Machine Computer Engineering
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Directed graph many different application computer science including program analysis visualization
A directed graph pair set node set edge depending application domain interpret node edge way like
For instance finite state machine node interpreted state edge transition
In social network node represent human edge relation
Moreover finite state machine limited directed graph
Finite state machine also include initial state set finite state
Finally transition finite state machine associated associated alphabet necessarily case directed graph general
Directed graph ordered pair addition annotation labeling function node edge
These syntactic construct semantics attributed annotation part label rather interpretation attribute depending context
see also
The definition transducer discussed
It tuple includes node edge input alphabet output alphabet set initial state labeling function edge input letter state Moore edge Mealy output letter
So directed graph essentially data structure fall short representing finite state machine
On contrary directed graph data structure represent finite state machine though algebraically different structure though technicality
Note btw set initial state equivalently described function labeling state initial thus digraph equipped sufficient number labeling function suffices describe finite state machine

I know machine used solve kind problem finding whether word language
Can somebody tell exactly FSM
The answer depends mean FSM
If FSM mean finite automaton lot ca
As others pointed ca remember constant amount information using finite automaton memory must encoded state
This mean ca thing like recognize since need remember many symbol seen possible unless arbitrary amount memory
The pumping lemma regular language especially theorem offer insight kind thing done
If FSM mean automaton formalism limited using finitely many state Turing machine among computationally capable FSM model available
Indeed anything effectively computable computable Turing machine according thesis
However still limitation Turing machine decide problem answer halting problem
Models limited finite number state particularly interesting reason prominent following limited practical importance since construct real computer infinitely many configuration language recognized model mapping string language unique accepting state string language unique state

way designing describes computation term program state statement change program state
In language program describes desired result specify change state directly
A specialized definition state used computer program operate sequentially stream data program
Serial program operate incoming data character packet sequentially one time
In program information previous data character packet received stored variable used affect processing current character packet
This called data carried previous processing cycle called state
In others program information previous data stream start fresh data input called
The output sequential circuit computer program time completely determined current input current state
Since memory element two possible state total number different state circuit assume finite fixed number memory element
If binary memory element digital circuit distinct state
The concept state formalized abstract mathematical called used design sequential digital circuit computer program
An example everyday device state
To change channel TV user usually press channel channel button remote control sends coded message set
In order calculate new channel user desire digital tuner television must stored number

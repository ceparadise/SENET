In act two refers mutually exchanging value variable
Usually done data
For example two variable may defined thus In many swap provided allowing std swap large structure O time
After swap performed contain value contain value exchanged
Of course operation may generalized type value aggregated utilize swap change position data
The simplest probably widely used method swap two variable use third While conceptually simple many case convenient way swap two variable us extra memory
Although problem application size value swapped may huge mean temporary variable may occupy lot memory well swap operation may need performed many time sorting algorithm
In addition swapping two variable language may involve one call temporary variable three call
Some class may allocate memory constructor deallocate destructor thus creating expensive call system
Copy constructor class containing lot data
may even need copy data manually
XOR swap us operation swap two numeric variable
It generally touted faster naive method mentioned however
XOR swap generally used swap data type like
However theory capable swapping two value represented
This method swap two variable adding subtracting value
This rarely used practical application mainly allocate memory using may swapped single operation swapping pointer alone
This usually found programming language supporting pointer like
For example overload swap function exchange container efficiently way
As pointer variable usually fixed size desktop computer pointer long numeric swapped quickly using
Some language like support simplifies notation swapping two variable This shorthand operation involving intermediate data structure Python tuple Ruby array
Other language like javascript support destructuring operator thing Because many application swapping data computer provide ability swap variable directly instruction
processor example include instruction swap two directly without requiring third temporary register used
A instruction compare conditionally swap two register even provided processor architecture
may efficient one may think
For example processor implicitly lock access operand keep operation may efficient swapping memory
Such locking important used implement synchronization
However usually fastest way swap two word residing
may also used swap register efficiently
With advent modern computer facilitating two operation performed
This speed lowly swap algorithm give edge algorithm
For example requires sequential execution three instruction
However using two temporary register two processor executing parallel swap two variable two clock cycle This us fewer instruction temporary register may use four instruction needed instead three
In case practice could implemented separate processor violates Bernstein condition parallel computing
It would infeasible keep processor sufficiently sync one another swap significant advantage traditional version
However used optimize swapping single processor multiple unit

Swapping process page segment memory value another location also manipulates data file larger main memory
It occurs three type To expand address space effectively usable process To expand amount dynamic RAM load process To access data stored hard disk bring RAM used application program Swapping OS method swapping process temporarily backing store whenever need brought back memory temporary execution
The backing store refers fast disk perform fast transaction able store huge file
In procedure use priority based scheduling algorithm lower priority process swapped higher priority process loaded executed
It also defined process removing currently running program memory bringing another program memory
Processes temporarily kept backing store brought back memory execution
For example multiprogramming situation us round robin scheduling quantum expires processor swap process finished execution swap new process execution
The CPU scheduler allocate time slice process quantum expires time processor check process finished execution swap process assign quantum process waiting ready queue
In swapping term roll roll important whenever higher priority process request execution lower priority process suspended higher priority process start execution process called roll roll
Also another important term address binding process swapped gain come back memory put back memory space
A ready queue maintained system process present backing store queued queue execution
The dispatcher used executing process ready queue
It check whether requesting process memory present memory check free space free space dispatcher swap current process bring requesting process start execution
Another important term transfer time transfer time proportional amount memory swapped
For instance let u consider computer main memory OS memory size easy swap process swapped swapping process take time
Hence necessary measure transfer time could reduce swap time
It would useful know time required transfer process
Swapping also constraint followed
Only idle process swapped
If process waiting operation swap process asynchronous process swapped
Example consider process queued swap process swap process use memory belongs
There two main solution problem never swap process execute operation operating system buffer
Swapping process temporarily removing inactive program main memory computer system
There usually set active program memory one executes CPU others perform
Whenever active program becomes inactive OS begin swap system falling short main memory space
This involves writing program data onto secondary storage typically disk
Swapping increase OS overhead due need perform operation
The first UNIX system kernel monitored amount free memory constantly
When became le performed swapping
This activity consisted copying entire address space process disk
Conversely scheduling algorithm selected swapped process whole process swapped disk
This approach abandoned modern UNIX kernel including Linux mainly process switch quite expensive involve swapping process
To compensate burden swapping activity scheduling algorithm must sophisticated must favour RAM process without completely shutting one
In Linux swapping currently performed page level rather process address space level
This finer level granularity reached inclusion hardware paging unit CPU
Each page table entry includes present flag kernel take advantage flag signal hardware page belonging process address space swapped
Besides flag Linux also take advantage remaining bit page table entry store location swapped page disk
When page fault exception occurs corresponding exception handler detect page present RAM involve function swap missing page disk
Much algorithm complexity thus related swapping
Swapping done following type page process anonymous region modified page page present IPC memory
The type page used kernel
In Linux swapping enabled particular device swapon device system device Solaris
The available RAM memory computer never enough meet user need always satisfy memory intensive application
The kernel therefore enables seldom used part memory swapped block device effectively providing main memory
This mechanism done swapping
It implemented transparently kernel application process automatically profit
The process variable called swapping programming
For example consider pseudo code swap two variable value Data x Data Swap x According code swap function exchange value x hence x value value
Swap done three way This simplest commonly used way using
But requires extra memory even though problem many application value large swap performed might come overhead
An example pseudo code follows The standard method swapping requires use temporary variable
But XOR swap algorithm another proficient method swapping
This method us XOR bitwise operation value swap
But value must data type
This algorithm C program given
This algorithm also certain problem X Y present location value location zeroed first instruction
X X XOR Y Y X XOR Y X X XOR Y First C code check whether memory location used distinct swap integer
The rationale behind step algorithm work x refer different integer otherwise set x
In practice swap algorithm temporary register efficient
Other application include following It used processor allows XOR swap program code encoded smaller byte
When hardware register available swap mightpermit register allocator avoid spilling register
Since condition unusual optimizing compiler never produce XOR swap code
Modern compiler identify optimize temporary variable based swap rather high language statement communicate XOR swap
Many time situation translated compiler simply two variable swapping memory address
Often supported architecture compiler use XCHG exchange command perform swap soleprocedure
The best precaution use XCHG swap register memory
Again since XOR swap may zero content location must used high level language aliasing possible
Another method swapping value variable rarely used method several disadvantage This method swap numeric value might burden value huge complex When defined variable fixed size addition subtraction might lead arithmetic overflow Floating point arithmetic non associative therefore method suitable floating point value A Swap area used store page swapped memory swap area must disk file
Numerous swap area may defined limit specified macro
Having various swap area allow system administrator extend swap space many disk hardware act simultaneously also swap space acn increased without need reboot system
There type swap space
The swap space created enabled logical volume called device swap whereas file system swap portion mounted file system allocated enabled paging purpose
When file system swap enabled directory called paging created root file system
Under paging directory file created individual swap chunk used file system file system swap defined enabled dynamically
It may defined use fixed amount file system area Every swap area page slot byte block used include swapped page
The information swap area stored first page slot format specified collected two entity info magic
The magic entity provides string mark space disk swap area consists one field magic contains character magic string
The info structure includes following field This field information regarding swap area used swapping algorithm
Swapping algorithm version
Last page slot effectively usable
Number defective page slot
Padding byte

unsigned int flag Swap area flag Device number swap disk partition Swap area descriptor spin lock struct dentry Density file device file Struct vfsmount Mounted filesystem descriptor file device file unsigned short Pointer array counter one swap area page slot unsigned int First page slot scanned searching free one unsigned int Last page slot scanned searching free one unsigned int Next page slot scanned searching free one Number free page slot allocation restarting beginning int prio Swap area priority int page Number usable page slot unsigned long max Size swap area page int next Pointer next swap area descriptor Each active swap area descriptor memory
The field descriptor shown table
The flag field includes two overlapping subfields swap area active nonactive
field set possible write swap area otherwise since least significant bit field coincides bit used implement swap area written active
The kernel allowed write swap area activated deactivated
The field point assortment counter individual every swap page slot
It two value counter value page stored page slot permanent counter value page slot considered defective thus unusable The PRIO field signed integer describes order swap sub system consider swap area The field spin lock protects descriptor concurrent access SMP system The array includes swap area descriptor The variable store index last array element contains used swap area descriptor The spin lock protects list concurrent access multiprocessor system The MAX field swap area descriptor store size swap area page Finally variable contains number available page slot The Swap Cache crucial avoid race condition among process trying access page swapped
If page owned single process one race condition considered process attempt address page swapped
The swap cache used collect imitated swap area
It exist data structure instead page regular page cache considered swap cache certain field set
The figure illustrates schematically action performed kernel shared page swapped multiple process different time
The number inside swap area inside P represent page slot usage counter page usage counter respectively
Notice usage count includes every process using page slot plus swap cache page included
Four stage shown In P present page table A B In b P swapped A address space In c P swapped address space A B still included swap cache Finally P released buddy system The swap cache implemented page cache data structure procedure page swap cache stored like page page cache
The final route swapping swapping page strategy general mechanism free memory along constraint
Swapping us certain function called cascading function
The function attempt free given page frame either discarding swapping content
The function return value succeeds releasing page otherwise Swap must take place process attempt address page within address space disk
The page fault exception handler trigger operation following condition occur The page including address caused exception valid one belongs memory region current process
The page present memory present flag page table entry cleared The page table entry associated page null mean contains page identifier Swapping two abstract value achieved implementation simply swapping pointer Swapping two item implemented run constant amount time Swapping one efficient regular authentic approach It provides higher degree multiprogramming It provides dynamic relocation It provides great memory utilization It us priority based scheduling Swapping make CPU time utilized greater extent It provide access fast real memory It put burden operating system manage virtual memory Has diminishing benefit point benefit adding swap space little effect performance Attach Files

What difference reference
Also guide tutorial I could get information
Swapping refers copying entire process address space rate data segment swap device back one go typically disk
Whereas paging refers copying one page address space
In particular much finer grain
For example KB page GB RAM address space
Swapping used early day
DEC era Unix ish
For could want know may I recommend The Lions Document
Lions Commentary Unix Ed
Source Code John Lions ISBN
You surely appreciate Chapter Program Swapping begin Unix like system multiprogramming system us program swapping also called share limited resource main physical memory among several process
Paging Unix arrived BSD Berkeley Systems Distribution starting around
Paging also usually associated memory attribute access execute executable various virtual memory management trick like page page forth
swapping performed without memory management HW whatsoever although early machine employed simple memory mapping scheme
base bound simple one level fixed size page mapping table
divide KB data address space page larger physical address space KB MB
In contrast paging requires virtual memory page table entry typically encode physical address page PTE bit valid read write etc
The machine also need automatically transparently application program fetch interpret page table entry necessary map virtual address physical address take page fault exception enable OS make page accessible schedule load physical RAM
Happy hacking
Although term considered distinct say mainstream academic medium fact author use synonym

In scheme computer store retrieves data use
In scheme operating system retrieves data secondary storage called
Paging important part implementation modern operating system using secondary storage let program exceed size available physical memory
For simplicity main memory called RAM acronym secondary storage called disk shorthand concept depend whether term apply literally specific computer system
introduced paging first mass market memory page concept computer architecture regardless whether page moved RAM disk
For example instruction bit comprised memory address selected one word
This zone memory called
This use term rare
In swapping early virtual memory technique
An entire program would RAM disk another one would
A program would current execution would suspended RAM use another program
A program might include multiple occupy memory different time
Overlays method paging RAM disk merely minimizing program use RAM
Subsequent architecture used individual program segment became unit exchanged disk RAM
A segment program entire code segment data segment sometimes large data structure
These segment resident RAM requiring additional computation movement remedy
The invention let processor operate arbitrary page anywhere RAM seemingly contiguous space
These page became unit exchanged disk RAM
When program try reference page currently present RAM processor treat invalid memory reference transfer control program operating system
The operating system must When page frame use operating system must select page frame reuse page program need
If evicted page frame program hold data program modified since read RAM word become dirty must written disk freed
If program later reference evicted page another page fault occurs page must read back RAM
The method operating system us select page frame reuse important efficiency
The operating system predicts page frame least likely needed soon often LRU algorithm algorithm based program
To increase responsiveness paging system may predict page needed soon preemptively loading RAM program reference
After completing initialization program operate small number code data page compared total memory program requires
The page frequently accessed called
When working set small percentage system total number page virtual memory system work efficiently insignificant amount computing spent resolving page fault
As working set grows resolving page fault remains manageable growth reach critical point
Then fault go dramatically time spent resolving overwhelms time spent computing program written
This condition referred
Thrashing occurs program work huge data structure large working set cause continual page fault drastically slow system
Satisfying page fault may require freeing page soon disk
Thrashing also used context virtual memory system example describe issue computing networking
A worst case imagined comparable mainframe
An execute instruction crossing page boundary could point move instruction also cross page boundary set move data source cross page boundary target cross page boundary
This single instruction reference eight page RAM cause page fault
If operating system could allocate eight page program remedying page fault would discard another page instruction need restart instruction would fault
To decrease excessive paging resolve thrashing problem user increase number page available per program either running fewer program concurrently increasing amount RAM computer
In environment many user may execute program written code data separate page
To minimize use RAM user share single copy program
Each process set page address code point single shared copy page address data point different physical page process
The first computer support paging jointly developed
The machine associative memory one entry word page
The Supervisor handled interruption managed transfer page core drum order provide store program
Paging feature since
Windows creates named use swap file
It generally found may appear elsewhere typically WINDOWS directory
Its size depends much swap space system setting selected user Enhanced Virtual Memory
If user move deletes file appear next time Windows started The permanent swap file corrupt
The user prompted choose whether delete file whether exists
use similar file setting located Control Panel System Performance tab Virtual Memory
Windows automatically set size page file start size physical memory expand physical memory necessary
If user run application system low physical memory preferable manually set size value higher default
The file used paging family
The default location page file root directory partition Windows installed
Windows configured use free space available drive pagefiles
It required however boot partition
drive containing Windows directory pagefile system configured write either kernel full memory dump
Windows us paging file temporary storage memory dump
When system rebooted Windows copy memory dump pagefile separate file free space used pagefile
In default configuration Windows pagefile allowed expand beyond initial allocation necessary
If happens gradually become heavily potentially cause performance problem
The common advice given avoid set single locked pagefile size Windows expand
However pagefile expands filled default configuration total amount physical memory
Thus total demand virtual memory must exceed computer physical memory pagefile expand
The fragmentation pagefile occurs expands temporary
As soon expanded region longer use next reboot sooner additional disk space allocation freed pagefile back original state
Locking pagefile size problematic Windows application request memory total size physical memory pagefile leading failed request allocate memory may cause application system process fail
Also pagefile rarely read written sequential order performance advantage completely sequential page file minimal
However large pagefile generally allows use application penalty beside using disk space
While fragmented pagefile may issue fragmentation variable size page file time create number fragmented block drive causing file become fragmented
For reason contiguous pagefile better providing size allocated large enough accommodate need application
The required disk space may easily allocated system recent specification
system GB memory GB pagefile GB disk drive system GB memory GB pagefile TB disk space
In example system using disk space pagefile maximum
page file also occasionally recommended improve performance Windows system chronically using much memory total physical memory
This view ignores fact aside temporary result expansion pagefile become fragmented time
In general performance concern related pagefile access much effectively dealt adding physical memory
system operating system use term swap describe act moving memory page RAM disk region disk page stored
In system common dedicate entire partition hard disk swapping
These partition called
Many system entire hard drive dedicated swapping separate data drive containing swap partition
A hard drive dedicated swapping called swap drive scratch drive
Some system support swapping swap partition others also support swapping file
The Linux kernel support virtually unlimited number swap backends device file supporting time assignment backend priority
When kernel need swap page physical memory us backend available free space
If multiple swap backends assigned priority used fashion somewhat similar storage layout providing improved performance long underlying device efficiently accessed parallel
From perspective swap file version later Linux kernel virtually fast swap partition limitation swap file contiguously allocated underlying file system
To increase performance swap file kernel keep map placed underlying device access directly thus bypassing cache avoiding filesystem overhead
Regardless recommends swap partition used
When residing HDDs rotational magnetic medium device one benefit using swap partition ability place contiguous HDD area provide higher data throughput faster seek time
However administrative flexibility swap file outweigh certain advantage swap partition
For example swap file placed mounted file system set desired size added changed needed
Swap partition flexible enlarged without using partitioning tool introduce various complexity potential downtime
When system memory highly insufficient current task large portion memory activity go slow swap system become practically unable execute task even CPU idle
When every process waiting swap system considered
Swap death happen due incorrectly configured
The original description swapping death problem relates memory X swap every keystroke requires Linux read swap processed system practically unresponsive even actually executing task normally
us multiple swap file
The default installation place root partition though possible place instead separate partition device
introduced new system allocating RAM defragmenting physical memory
It still us flat shared address space defragmented
It based paging memory allows swapping
Paging implemented may lock system physical memory used
Swap memory could activated deactivated moment allowing user choose use physical RAM
The backing store virtual memory operating system typically many order slower
Additionally using mechanical storage device introduces several millisecond hard disk
Therefore desirable reduce eliminate swapping practical
Some operating system offer setting influence kernel decision
Many operating system example allow using multiple storage device swap space parallel increase performance
In older virtual memory operating system space swap backing store reserved program allocate memory runtime data
Operating system vendor typically issue guideline much swap space allocated
Paging one way allowing size address used process process virtual address space logical address space different amount main memory actually installed particular computer physical address space
In system size process virtual address space much larger available main memory
For example A computer true addressing may addressable unit RAM installed
An example processor without PAE
In case processor able address RAM installed
However even case paging used create virtual memory GB
For instance many program may running concurrently
Together may require GB RAM
A paging system make efficient decision memory relegate secondary storage leading best use installed RAM
Although processor example address RAM beyond GB operating system may provide service program envision larger memory file grow beyond limit installed RAM
The operating system let program manipulate data file arbitrarily using paging bring part file RAM necessary
A computer main memory larger virtual address space process machine system using processor
This nullifies significant advantage virtual memory since single process use main memory amount virtual address space
Such system often use paging technique obtain secondary benefit The size cumulative total virtual address space still limited amount secondary storage available

I recently reading review Donald Rumsfeld autobiography
The reviewer cited one famous phrase quoted unknown known
Now memory phrase Rumsfeld used known unknown unknown known got wondering difference meaning two
The T known knowns thing know know
We also know say know thing know
But also unknown unknown one know know
That explains mean As philosopher name extrapolated define term So short big difference
The quote T known knowns thing know know
We also know known unknown say know thing know
But also unknown unknown one know know
Known unknown implies thing know know unknown known could imploy thing know yet realize value
Thus difference meaning
Some people keen mock Rumsfeld word really simple easy grasp
To avoid misunderstanding three combination actually used Rumsfeld defined one succinctly immediately saying
I wo bother repeating known bit
You often hear combination say find one hardest conceptualise
But I suggest particularly good example close home EL U
We know lot principle governing correct usage mother tongue conciously aware
This In Sleep
Here Rumsfeld quote question T known knowns thing know know
We also know known unknown say know thing know
But also unknown unknown one know know
If read carefully explains meaning term within context quote
Known know know Known unknown know Unknown unknown state knowledge nonexistent So
To take example The number troop abroad known known
The number insurgent known unknown
What plan future unknown unknown
A good example end sentence contraction
First know knew
Well
You know allowed say must say You may say Now know know
You also know order adjective
Did know knew
Well
For example know must say You still know must thing know know rule
I would suggest also something know realise relevant specific issue specifically ignore context reason
For example still kid although current world population continue grow current rate ever ignore aspect treating contributor Global Climate Resource problem
Does Documentary define sense thing thought knew knowns wrong realise therefore unknown hence incorrect wrong Its bit convoluted way saying There thing wrong suit context Rumsfeld earlier quote playing known knowns known unknown unknown unknown Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

David Logan Known knowns known unknown unknown unknown propagation scientific enquiry Volume Issue March Pages Download citation file Oxford University Press In February Donald Rumsfeld US Secretary State Defence stated Defence Department briefing There known knowns
There thing know know
There known unknown
That say thing know know
But also unknown unknown
There thing know As result almost universally lampooned since many people initially thought statement nonsense
However careful examination statement reveals make sense indeed concept unknown unknown existed long Donald Rumsfeld gave new audience
Much scientific research based investigating known unknown
In word scientist develop hypothesis tested ideal situation experiment best designed test null hypothesis
At outset researcher know whether result support null hypothesis
However common researcher believe result obtained within range known possibility
Occasionally however result completely unknown unknown
There many known knowns intracellular protein targeting many field research seems number known unknown increase parallel
The key determinant targeting mitochondrion determined least four subclass protein containing different targeting signal directed different site within mitochondrion outer membrane space inner membrane matrix different mechanism
However much remains unknown especially plant
For example number known unknown resulting previously unknown unknown existence protein dually targeted plastid mitochondrion
We know dual targeting plastid mitochondrion occurs result ambiguous signal sequence know signal recognized organelle protein recognized one
The plant mitochondrial import machinery
Mitochondrial precursor protein synthesized cytosol specifically recognized receptor TOM complex translocated general import pore
Proteins targeting signal recognized receptor complex translocated matrix
Oxa sort small number protein imported matrix inner membrane
Carrier protein destined insertion inner membrane interact chaperone complex intermembrane space ferrying TOM complex complex protein inserted membrane

The paper issue excellent example research uncovering unknown unknown
Typically investigation mechanic intracellular protein targeting performed using protein biochemistry investigation typical
If study simply investigating mitochondrial targeting using translation various protein altered targeting signal detected protein electrophoresis immunoblotting result would combination yes construct target mitochondrion construct target mitochondrion
However cell biological approach taken much information garnered power using fluorescent protein fusion
By mean bioinformatics screen identified protein predicted based presence domain targeted secretory pathway
However one protein identified named targeted mitochondrion protein fusion made YFP
putative protein also correctly predicted various bioinformatic tool localized mitochondrion
Further experimentation demonstrated predicted mitochondrial targeting peptide mTP residue sufficient target YFP mitochondrion
In addition first amino acid fused YFP fusion protein cytosolic result occurred using first amino acid consistent requirement positively charged region mTPs towards mTP preceded hydrophobic region
So far predictable
However research entered world unknown unknown team started exploration targeting determinant region
When fused YFP targeting ER mitochondrion demonstrating residue although sufficient targeting mitochondrion overcome targeting ER
Dual targeting mitochondrion ER known known mammalian cell occurs mean splice variant
It known dual targeted
In case major difference dual targeted protein kinase anchoring protein mammal shorter form missing extreme region target mitochondrion
construct used

construct used
A Schematic representation region
B Schematic representation construct used dissect role subdomains mTP
C Schematic representation construct used investigate role distal tryptophan residue
All figure redrawn
The change targeting resulting change mTP interesting I think much interesting finding single distal tryptophan residue affect targeting
fused YFP found targeted solely mitochondrion single mutation redirects protein ER Golgi
The mutation also redirects ER mitochondrion cytosol
The obvious question arise include How tryptophan residue affect targeting
How one mutation lead redistribution protein ER Golgi
Does mutation lead increased interaction protein ER signal recognition particle SRPs
Is competition SRPs mitochondrial import machinery
Once discovery previously unknown unknown show u little know lead propagation family known unknown tackled traditional hypothesis forming testing occasionally another unknown unknown cycle continues

In short question What shortest computer program known whether program halt
Of course depends description language I also following vague question To extent depend description language
Here motivation I sure known I think particularly striking possibility application mathematics Let P n statement natural number exists Turing machine T decide whether P n true false
That Turing machine halt every natural number n printing True P n true False otherwise
Then smallest n P n false low printed program test P P reach n P n false print n
Thus Kolmogorov complexity smallest counterexample P bounded effective constant c
Let L length shortest computer program halting problem known
Then L may prove statement n P n simply executing halting program length le equal running T output
If T output True finitely many number P true
Of course Halting problem place limit power method
Essentially question boil What succinctly stateable open conjecture
EDIT By way amazing implication argument I give prove theorem natural number suffices prove finitely many value low Kolmogorov complexity
However Halting problem impossible know value
If anyone know reference sort thing I would also appreciate
There Turing machine known whether halt
See
You may find blog post relevant
In summary I investigated short sentence Peano arithmetic
We enumerated actually laptop eliminated could recognized decidable
It quickly turned Diophantine equation difficult recognize decidable
Among found two gave professional number theorist something munch quantifier range N b c
b b c b c
b b The shortest unsolved sentence I aware S successor function b c
S S S S c S S It say le infinitely many prime form
What I found surprising mixed quantifier easier straight universal existential statement
It seems symbol spare matrix produce interesting sentence
It quite possible provides answer
Apply function repeatedly
The conjecture process eventually reach number regardless positive integer chosen initially
Not sure many line code would
Probably Haskell
Regarding context explains theorem universally quantified statement P n trivial one value suffices
Namely define follows statement false let smallest counterexample otherwise let
Then statement hold P
The answer depends utterly completely description language
Rogers called description language acceptable pair effective method one convert standard program program language D one convert program D standard program
More precisely description language numbering set partial computable function
Now program whatsoever acceptable description language assigns program index
So program like shortest example pick right acceptable numbering
This kind reason string length universal machine make string Kolmogorov random another universal machine make string Kolmogorov random
Readers might interested know congruential iteration similar Collatz problem discovered wild trying understand behavior various busy beaver candidate machine
Since John Conway shown deciding termination certain class congruential iteration undecidable may boundary undecidability already lie one open busy beaver congruential iteration problem
For much discussion reference see old post Feb halting weak
This qualify shortest favorite example human ca solve halting problem odd number n n perfect halt
This program halt
Of course query n perfect terribly short computed adding one loop
question apparently closely related Wolframs research program determining whether small Cellular Automata CAs Turing Complete
CA proved Turing Complete mapping Turings halting problem exists input termination CA proven
also determining whether CA Turing complete difficult several case
case succeeded complex proof detail dynamic
see also writeup ambitious somewhat recent major attack busy beaver problem superseded many prior result
also related long tradition research finding small state universal TMs probably dating including result Marvin Minsky
Collatz conjecture candidate boundary nearby problem similar see also Ross et al Woods Neary The following based Waring Problem For n floor mod
Kubina tested x x x Assume x int unlimited size
Whereas small Turing machine exhaustively analysed Richard note TM whose halting unknown I seen similar analysis model computation Register Machines LOOP program C program
So I propose C program containing symbol shortest whose halting unknown
In program x contains power contains corresponding power multiplies x

alot people make fun Rumsfeld unknown unknown wondering person like would start try get hand around unknown unknown
With known unknown probably setup strategy explore unknown
My question person deal unknown unknown
This obviously affect decision making subject matter
approach problem
I sure tag question
This question appears
The user voted close gave specific reason Not sure philosopher written subject opposed knowing thing general
Practically Phillip Armour wrote The first level ignorance people normally refer
Rumsfeld referred second level question know answer know question first place
There zillion different unknown unknown

suddenly giant TV set might drop sky
One prepares estimating probability various kind unknown concentrating effort least unlikely
The dropping TV set unlikely point would waste time resource preparing
Unknowns kind almost zero probability almost infinite impact occurs also best disregarded
Multiplying near zero probability near infinite impact occurs get expected impact value really work case
Very small difference number produce different expected value real information probability

Blaise Pascal contemporary Descartes used expected impact value argument apparently prove one better believe specific god
But nature thing zillion principle possible thing
Pascal argument failed possible god considered
For computer belief management dealing unknown involves representing probability support
For example chance raining tomorrow support mean half case turn rain
But support mean anything prediction possible probability must ignored
At least one theory attempt correctly evidence combination suffers combinatorial explosion
impractical
Apparently one practice get completely correct picture world
Happily rough approximation work well practice
But mean case end Wrong Thing infinite memory processing capacity would enough info Right Thing hence expression hindsight

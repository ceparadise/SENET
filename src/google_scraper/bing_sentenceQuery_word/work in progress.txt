Arkansas partnered past two year bring computer science every student state
The process easy still long way go snapshot worked Arkansas far
Early Arkansas studied suggestion state implementation infused suggestion strategic plan
call suggestion state make computer science fundamental
My office made goal lead state become first meet unique way nine
It noteworthy Arkansas also state meet ten priority listed recently released
Our greatest success initiative directly linked following policy recommendation Gov
Hutchinson support Arkansas General Assembly specifically provide rigorous relevant computer science teacher professional development course support
Through beginning August
Arkansas educator industry representative worked facilitation Arkansas Department Education Arkansas Department Career Education Arkansas identified As state worked meet policy recommendation see State State priority foundational element capstone ongoing work
We realize still long way go state however Arkansas remains committed success ARKidsCanCode initiative nationwide success CSforAll
Our state recognizes computer science becoming increasingly vital state national economy safety security
As Arkansas continues push forward focus building teacher capacity increasing student enrollment
We working computer science enrollment demographic closely align state general population demographic
To accomplish looked several short promotion strategy including Earlier March provides two year tuition fee publicly funded Arkansas community technical college student enrolls field study STEM field computer science welding
We excited grant incentivize higher education student following computer science pathway throughout state
Arkansas immediate focus increasing expanding access equally important ongoing commitment increasing implementing new
We appreciate agree Pat Yongpradit statement regarding Arkansas Computer Science Initiative lthough lot work still done Arkansas comprehensive plan place beginning long term commitment increasing quantity student taking computer science quality Or often stated le formal term sprint If state already running marathon u challenge become second state meet policy recommendation still starting line please join u
The CSforAll initiative national individual state level become stronger combined collaborative effort
By clapping le signal u story really stand
Anthony serf Arkansas State Director Computer Science leading development implementation Gov
Hutchinson computer science initiative
A blog published dedicated expanding access computer science

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Presenting something order obtain early feedback help crystallize idea
Unfortunately many graduate student need help getting hurdle presenting early research even research group
I giving talk presenting graduate student I like get input sort advice I give help willing share work
I concerned work stolen presentation occur locally
I like know get student present work best
Here
I grateful input see useful
It sound question use word one deterrent unwillingness student present
Since research group I assuming scooped something need worry
So real reason feel afraid seeming clueless knowing answer someone else find minute start presenting people deeming idea uninteresting
In word
One important transition grad student go point realize actually play research world make contribution
This often come first paper get published also happen first time talk senior researcher realize know person topic interest even first time prove brand new result
One advice might give talk show sausage made show initial idea might
That give model work
At least give example winding path research project take
A second advice give remember likely one know much problem
They may internalize yet repeated reminder might help When actually give talk Sylvain advice good however I think rule applies since research group probably outside expert probably generic audience
But I mention line I heard yesterday context journalism applies well talk inexperienced people Do overestimate audience knowledge underestimate intelligence
In word provide background need
But prove teeny little lemma scratch
I would advised follows Of course risk getting idea stolen risk keep sharing losing large part enjoyment scientific endeavour
In following student The WWH What
Why
How
approach always good structure presentation work progress
My opinion best first describe precise problem dealing
To contrary giving first broad context risk lose audience quickly
If start something focused people listens saying
The next step ass interest problem
Not interest work done solve important address issue
It time present YOUR work technique tool idea work
It also time ask help need help
Also keep mind third rule talk everybody people broad area last third expert put technicality
Presenting idea clear indeed difficult even faculty I think
In past used proceed step student
As second step formal talk according structured WWH rule called doctoral seminar
In seminar student presented almost finished work progress
For first step informal lunch talk student early stage idea
Typically consists bunch people eating pizza sitting front whiteboard projector screen listening student wanted formalized idea
I asked PhD talk prepare slide formal thing written next natural language sentence explaining thoroughly formal thing
The whiteboard used rewriting thing together student faculty
Each speaker limited time idea first talk try make thing precise come back next round week etc
We stopped sometimes people approach lead trouble think issue instance
By posting answer agree

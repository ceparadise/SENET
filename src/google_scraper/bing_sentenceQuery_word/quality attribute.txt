In specification defines property element file
It may also refer set specific given instance
For clarity attribute correctly considered
An attribute frequently generally property property
However actual usage term attribute often treated equivalent depending technology discussed
An attribute object usually consists name value element type class name file name extension
For example computer graphic line object attribute thickness real value color descriptive value brown green value defined certain color model RGB dashing attribute etc
A circle object defined similar attribute plus origin radius
In attribute attached field block code like equivalent
Attributes accessible compiler programmatically
Users language see many example attribute used address concern mechanistic platform us
This creates false impression sole intended purpose
With attribute possible extend attribute
Their specific use metadata left developer cover wide range type information given application class member
The decision expose given attribute property also left developer decision use part larger application framework
Attributes implemented class derived
They often used service like interoperability queried runtime
The example show attribute defined C Positional parameter like first parameter type string parameter attribute constructor
Name parameter like Boolean parameter example property attribute constant value
Attributes contrasted XML documentation also defines metadata included compiled assembly therefore accessed programmatically
Display checked attribute property checkbox change
On many database system relative SQL table file row item column attribute
Both database code attribute synonymous property variable although attribute defined contain value subvalues
The first database
Two current platform include
In markup construct consisting pair exists within
Markup language use attribute describe data formatting data
A good example process XML assigning value property element
Note element value found separate end tag element
The element may number attribute set
If element question could considered property another entity let say element zero attribute property

Attribute Definition A property characteristic
For example attribute person would name age height etc Search Attribute UK US Search Attribute rest Computing Students

Before delve attribute computer programming sense word let u first define word
A simple explanation term describes something
In computer programming element field file data type manipulated referenced way attribute
Let consider portrait How would describe person image
Brunette attractive couple characteristic come mind
These characteristic also considered attribute
Now let consider image sandwich Besides attribute might assign image
So exactly portrait photo sandwich relate computer programming
In computer programming element entity field file specific characteristic
For example web programming element assigned unique attribute
Computer programming attribute describe characteristic data whether file paragraph field
Let take closer look
The language used render webpage HTML HyperText Markup Language comprised various element paragraph unordered list image
These element represent item displayed web page
The paragraph element includes specific group characteristic attribute assigned
In former version language one specific attribute paragraph element align attribute
This attribute could set left right center justify
If attribute set right paragraph would aligned right rendered page
Get FREE access day create account
In separate programming language CSS Cascading Stylesheet attribute may also referenced
In either example attribute alignment seen communicated code
In database world attribute may refer single field table even table
An attribute field could preferred data type
For example attribute social security number field could limit nine character
Let look back attribute example provided original photo brunette attractive
The woman portrait described brunette
When hear term automatically connect color hair
Keeping mind must acknowledge attribute apply data type
We would apply hair color attribute sandwich would
It important note attribute may reserved specific data type
For example computer world paragraph would attribute last modified date
Last modified date attribute file
The available attribute may vary depending data type referenced
With various type data available many way described
Data whether file text table field manipulated referenced way
Each data type specific set attribute addressed

Within realized used evaluate performance system
These sometimes named ilities many word share
They usually require architect attention
Notable quality attribute include Many quality attribute also applied

learn share knowledge build career
These seem mean thing
But term appropriate context
Please clarify specific problem add additional detail highlight exactly need
As currently written hard tell exactly asking
See page help clarifying question
In general term normal English usage term mean thing
In specific context HTML Javascript term get confused HTML representation DOM element term used XML pair contained within tag represented JavaScript object attribute appear object
To confuse thing change property typically update attribute
For example changing update element reflected call
However subsequently property normalised absolute URL even though might relative URL
These word existed way Computer Science came around
Attribute quality object someone something
For example scepter attribute power statehood
Property quality
For example clay adhesive quality one property metal electrical conductivity
Properties demonstrate though physical phenomenon without need attribute someone something
By token saying someone masculine attribute
In effect could say property owned someone something
To fair though Computer Science two word least part used interchangeably programmer usually hold degree English Literature write care much grammar book
Often used describe mechanism thing
A used describe model
For instance document sitting desk may attribute draft
The class model document property indicate whether draft
In case property capture state
The precise meaning term going depend lot talking
In attribute part tag equal sign value property mean anything example
So need information domain discussing
An attribute actual thing use within HTML tag like In instance type checked attribute
The property though value attribute browser save inside DOM element
Often value attribute property equal make confusing
In example DOM element property value property value notice value differs value inside HTML attribute
Using Firebug observe behaviour property clicking element selecting DOM view
In Python A property single name wrap collection setter getter deleter function
An attribute usually single object within another object
Having said however Python give method like allow extend definition attribute
Bottom Line almost synonymous
Python make technical distinction implemented
would one way look
In C In HTML seems attribute specific DOM tree property used describe characteristic DOM element Delphi used property found way architect
In Delphi often used combination runtime type information integrated property editor used set property designtime
Properties always related field
They function possible side effect course bad design
In Java language using depends usage Property used value change often usually used startup environment variable Attributes value object child Element object change time persistent What difference Attribute Property
What difference Feature Function
What difference Characteristic Character
What difference Act Behavior
Its change context
Object Product Personality Person A Person Acts Behavior
A Personality Characteristics given Character
A Product Feature derive Functionality
An Object Attributes give Properties

In process modifying software system make aspect work use fewer resource
In general may optimized executes rapidly capable operating le resource draw le power
Although word optimization share root optimal rare process optimization produce truly optimal system
The optimized system typically optimal one application one audience
One might reduce amount time program take perform task price making consume memory
In application memory space premium one might deliberately choose slower order use le memory
Often one size fit design work well case make optimize attribute greatest interest
Additionally effort required make piece software completely optimal incapable improvement almost always reasonable benefit would accrued process optimization may halted completely optimal solution reached
Fortunately often case greatest improvement come early process
Optimization occur number level
Typically higher level greater impact harder change later project requiring significant change complete rewrite need changed
Thus optimization typically proceed via refinement higher lower initial gain larger achieved le work later gain smaller requiring work
However case overall performance depends performance portion program small change late stage early consideration detail outsized impact
Typically consideration given efficiency throughout project though varies significantly major optimization often considered refinement done late ever
On project typically cycle optimization improving one area reveals limitation another typically curtailed performance acceptable gain become small costly
As performance part specification program program unusably slow fit purpose video game Hz acceptable unacceptably choppy performance consideration start ensure system able deliver sufficient performance early prototype need roughly acceptable performance confidence final system optimization achieve acceptable performance
This sometimes omitted belief optimization always done later resulting prototype system far slow often order magnitude factor system ultimately failure architecturally achieve performance goal one take year work achieve acceptable performance Java achieved acceptable performance
The degree performance change prototype production system amenable optimization significant source uncertainty risk
At highest level design may optimized make best use available resource given goal constraint expected
The architectural design system overwhelmingly affect performance
For example system network network latency main constraint overall performance would optimized minimize network trip ideally making single request request rather multiple roundtrips
Choice design depends goal designing fast compilation key priority faster assuming work speed output code goal slower compiler fulfills goal better even though take longer
Choice platform programming language occur level changing frequently requires complete rewrite though modular system may allow rewrite component example Python program may rewrite section In distributed system choice architecture etc
occurs design level may difficult change particularly component replaced sync old client
Given overall design good choice efficient implementation algorithm data structure come next
After design choice data structure affect efficiency aspect program
Generally data structure difficult change algorithm data structure assumption performance assumption used throughout program though minimized use abstract data type function definition keeping concrete data structure definition restricted place
For algorithm primarily consists ensuring algorithm constant O logarithmic O log linear O case O log input space time
Algorithms quadratic complexity O fail scale even linear algorithm cause problem repeatedly called typically replaced constant logarithmic possible
Beyond asymptotic order growth constant factor matter asymptotically slower algorithm may faster smaller simpler asymptotically faster algorithm faced small input may case occurs reality
Often provide best performance due tradeoff changing size
A general technique improve performance avoid work
A good example use common case improving performance avoiding unnecessary work
For example using simple text layout algorithm Latin text switching complex layout algorithm complex script
Another important technique caching particularly avoids redundant computation
Because importance caching often many level caching system cause problem memory use correctness issue stale cache
Beyond general algorithm implementation abstract machine concrete source code level choice make significant difference
For example early C compiler slower unconditional loop evaluated conditional jump tested true unconditional jump
Some optimization one nowadays performed
This depends source language target machine language compiler difficult understand predict change time key place understanding compiler machine code improve performance
example optimization reduce need auxiliary variable even result faster performance avoiding optimization
Between source compile level used tune performance option source code compiler respectively using defines disable unneeded software feature optimizing specific processor model hardware capability predicting branching instance
software distribution system take advantage form optimization
Use tends ensure optimized least much compiler predict
At lowest level writing code using designed particular hardware platform produce efficient compact code programmer take advantage full repertoire
Many used traditionally written assembler code reason
Programs small program seldom written start finish assembly due time cost involved
Most compiled high level language assembly hand optimized
When efficiency size le important large part may written language
With modern greater complexity recent harder write efficient code compiler generates project need ultimate optimization step
Much code written today intended run many machine possible
As consequence programmer compiler always take advantage efficient instruction provided newer CPUs quirk older model
Additionally assembly code tuned particular processor without using instruction might still suboptimal different processor expecting different tuning code
Typically today rather writing assembly language programmer use analyze output compiler change source code compiled efficiently understand inefficient
compiler produce customized machine code based data cost compilation overhead
This technique date earliest engine become widespread Java HotSpot JavaScript
In case may able perform optimization exceeding capability static compiler dynamically adjusting parameter according actual input factor
AOT compilation optimization technique based runtime profile similar static average case analog dynamic technique adaptive optimization
alter response run time condition order optimize code common assembly language program
Some perform optimization runtime
Some example include
Compilers help program take advantage CPU feature example
Code optimization also broadly categorized technique
While latter one effective platform technique use specific property one platform rely parameter depending single platform even single processor
Writing producing different version code different processor might therefore needed
For instance case optimization technique generic technique reduction function call memory efficient routine reduction condition etc
impact CPU architecture similar way
Generally serve reduce total required complete program reduce total memory usage process
On hand technique involve instruction scheduling parallelism parallelism cache optimization technique parameter differ among various platform optimal instruction scheduling might different even different processor architecture
Computational task performed several different way varying efficiency
A efficient version equivalent functionality known
For example consider following code snippet whose intention obtain sum integer N This code assuming rewritten using mathematical formula like The optimization sometimes performed automatically optimizing compiler select method computationally efficient retaining functionality
See discussion technique
However significant improvement performance often achieved removing extraneous functionality
Optimization always obvious intuitive process
In example optimized version might actually slower original version N sufficiently small particular hardware happens much faster performing addition operation multiplication division
In case however optimization relies using elaborate algorithm making use special case special trick performing complex
A fully optimized program might difficult comprehend hence may contain unoptimized version
Beyond eliminating obvious antipatterns code level optimization decrease maintainability
Optimization generally focus improving one two aspect performance execution time memory usage disk space bandwidth power consumption resource
This usually require one factor optimized expense others
For example increasing size improves runtime performance also increase memory consumption
Other common include code clarity conciseness
There instance programmer performing optimization must decide make software better operation cost making operation le efficient
These may sometimes nature competitor published result must beaten order improve commercial success come perhaps burden making normal usage software le efficient
Such change sometimes jokingly referred
Optimization may include finding system component limiting factor performance
In term code often critical part code primary consumer needed resource though another factor latency network bandwidth
In computer science resource consumption often follows form distribution applied resource optimization observing resource typically used operation
In software engineering often better approximation execution time computer program spent executing code known law context
More complex algorithm data structure perform well many item simple algorithm suitable small amount data setup initialization time constant factor complex algorithm outweigh benefit thus may faster single algorithm
A performance profiler used narrow decision functionality fit condition
In case adding help make program run faster
For example filtering program commonly read line filter output line immediately
This us enough memory one line performance typically poor due latency disk read
Performance greatly improved reading entire file writing filtered result though us much memory
Caching result similarly effective though also requiring larger memory use
Optimization reduce add code used improve
This may complicate program system making harder maintain debug
As result optimization performance tuning often performed end
made following two statement optimization We forget small efficiency say time premature optimization root evil
Yet pas opportunity critical In established engineering discipline improvement easily obtained never considered marginal I believe viewpoint prevail software engineering Premature optimization phrase used describe situation programmer let performance consideration affect design piece code
This result design clean could code incorrect code complicated optimization programmer distracted optimizing
When deciding whether optimize specific part program always considered impact overall program depends much much time actually spent specific part always clear looking code without
A better approach therefore design first code design resulting code see part optimized
A simple elegant design often easier optimize stage profiling may reveal unexpected performance problem would addressed premature optimization
In practice often necessary keep performance goal mind first designing software programmer balance goal design optimization
Modern compiler operating system efficient intended performance increase often fail materialize
As example caching data application level cached operating system level yield improvement execution
Even rare case programmer remove failed optimization production code
It also true advance hardware often obviate potential improvement yet obscuring code persist future long purpose negated
Optimization code development using take different form different language
In procedural language macro implemented using token substitution
Nowadays used alternative many case
In case inlined function body undergo optimization compiler including may move computation compile time
In many language macro implemented using substitution parse syntax tree claimed make safer use
Since many case interpretation used one way ensure computation performed sometimes way
originated style macro macro often called macro
A similar effect achieved using
In case work moved
The difference macro one side macro side latter tool allow performing arbitrary computation expansion macro perform computation relies optimizer ability perform
Additionally macro directly support
As optimization however often difficult predict tool impact project complete
Optimization automated compiler performed programmer
Gains usually limited local optimization larger global optimization
Usually powerful optimization find superior
Optimizing whole system usually undertaken programmer complex automated optimizers
In situation programmer system administrator explicitly change code overall system performs better
Although produce better efficiency far expensive automated optimization
Use find section program taking resource
Programmers sometimes believe clear idea bottleneck intuition frequently wrong
Optimizing unimportant piece code typically little help overall performance
When bottleneck localized optimization usually start rethinking algorithm used program
More often particular algorithm specifically tailored particular problem yielding better performance generic algorithm
For example task sorting huge list item usually done routine one efficient generic algorithm
But characteristic item exploitable example already arranged particular order different method used even sort routine
After programmer reasonably sure best algorithm selected code optimization start
Loops unrolled lower loop overhead although often lead speed overload data type small possible used integer arithmetic used instead
See article technique
Performance bottleneck due language limitation rather algorithm data structure used program
Sometimes critical part program different give direct access underlying machine
For example common language like module written greater speed
Programs already written C module written
Programs written use
Rewriting section pay circumstance general known state time spent code time remaining code
So putting intellectual effort optimizing small part program huge effect overall speed correct part located
Manual optimization sometimes side effect undermining readability
Thus code optimization carefully documented preferably using comment effect future development evaluated
The program performs automated optimization called
Most optimizers embedded compiler operate compilation
Optimizers often tailor generated code specific processor
Today automated optimization almost exclusively limited
However compiler optimization usually limited fixed set rather general optimization considerable demand optimizers accept description problem optimization allowing engineer specify custom optimization
Tools accept description optimization called system beginning applied real software system
Some language optimize program using
aim optimize whole system moving task computer high usage computer idle time
Sometimes time taken undertake optimization therein may issue
Optimizing existing code usually add new feature worse might add new previously working code change might
Because manually optimized code might sometimes le readability unoptimized code optimization might impact maintainability well
Optimization come price important sure investment worthwhile
An automatic optimizer program performs code optimization may optimized either improve efficiency target program else speed operation
A compilation performed optimization turned usually take longer although usually problem program quite large
In particular performance compile component executing together target code key improving overall execution speed

A transforms computer code written one source language another programming language target language
Compilers type support digital device primarily computer
The name primarily used program translate create program
However many different type compiler
If compiled program run computer whose different one compiler run compiler
A written language compiled
A program translates higher level one
A program translates language usually called transpiler
A language usually program translates form expression without change language
The term refers tool used create parser perform syntax analysis
A compiler likely perform many following operation conversion input program
Compilers implement operation phase promote efficient design correct transformation source input target output
Program fault caused incorrect compiler behavior difficult track work around therefore compiler implementers invest significant effort ensure
Compilers translator used transform source program
An computer software transforms executes indicated operation
The translation process influence design computer language lead preference compilation interpretation
In practice interpreter implemented compiled language compiler implemented interpreted language
Theoretical computing concept developed scientist mathematician engineer formed basis digital computing development World War II
Primitive binary language evolved digital device understand one zero circuit pattern underlying machine architecture
In late forty assembly language created offer workable abstraction computer architecture
Limited capacity early computer led substantial technical challenge first compiler designed
Therefore compilation process needed divided several small program
The front end program produce analysis product used back end program generate target code
As computer technology provided resource compiler design could align better compilation process
The human mind design better solution language move machine higher level
So development language follows naturally capability offered digital computer
language strictly defined syntax semantics form language architecture
Elements formal language include The sentence language may defined set rule called grammar
BNF describes syntax sentence language used syntax Algol
The idea derive concept linguist
BNF extension become standard tool describing syntax programming notation many case part compiler generated automatically BNF description
In designed algorithmic programming language called Plan Calculus
While actual implementation occurred presented concept later seen designed Ken Iverson late
APL language mathematical computation
language design formative year digital computing provided useful programming tool variety application Compiler technology evolved need strictly defined transformation source program target target program digital computer
The compiler could viewed front end deal analysis source code back end synthesize analysis target code
Optimization front end back end could produce efficient target code
Some early milestone development compiler technology Early operating system system software written assembly language
In early language system programming still controversial due resource limitation
Still several research industry effort began shift toward system programming language example
Basic Combined Programming Language designed University Cambridge originally developed compiler writing tool
Several compiler implemented Richards book provides insight language compiler
BCPL influential system programming language still used research also provided basis design B C language
Basic Language Implementation System Software developed Digital Equipment Corporation DEC computer
Wulf Carnegie Mellon University CMU research team
The CMU team went develop compiler one year later
Multiplexed Information Computing Service operating system project involved later led MIT
Multics written language developed IBM IBM User Group
IBM goal satisfy business scientific system programming requirement
There language could considered offered complete solution even though implemented
For first year Mulitics project subset language could compiled assembly language Early EPL compiler Doug McIlory Bob Morris Bell Labs
EPL supported project compiler full could developed
Bell Labs left Multics project Over time hope replaced frustration group effort initially failed produce economically useful system
Continued participation would drive project support cost
So researcher turned development effort
A system programming language based BCPL concept written
Ritchie created compiler B wrote Uniplexed Information Computing Service operating system Unics eventually became spelled Unix
Bell Labs started development expansion based B BCPL
The BCPL compiler transported Multics Bell Labs BCPL preferred language Bell Labs

Early Windows design offered simple batch programming capability
The conventional transformation language used interpreter
While widely used Bash Batch compiler written
More recently sophisticated interpreted language became part developer tool kit
Modern scripting language include PHP Python Ruby Lua
Lua widely used game development
All interpreter compiler support
When field compiling began late focus limited translation language program machine code
The compiler field increasingly intertwined discipline including computer architecture programming language formal method software engineering computer security
The Compiler Research The Next Years article noted importance language Java
Security parallel computing cited among future research target
A compiler implement formal transformation source program target program
Compiler design define end end solution tackle defined subset interface compilation tool
preprocessors assembler linkers
Design requirement include rigorously defined interface internally compiler component externally supporting toolsets
In early day approach taken compiler design directly affected complexity computer language processed experience person designing resource available
Resource limitation led need pas source code
A compiler relatively simple language written one person might single monolithic piece software
However source language grows complexity design may split number interdependent phase
Separate phase provide design improvement focus development function compilation process
Classifying compiler number pass background hardware resource limitation computer
Compiling involves performing lot work early computer enough memory contain one program work
So compiler split smaller program made pas source representation performing required analysis translation
The ability compile classically seen benefit simplifies job writing compiler compiler generally perform compilation faster
Thus partly driven resource limitation early system many early language specifically designed could compiled single pas
In case design language feature may require compiler perform one pas source
For instance consider declaration appearing line source affect translation statement appearing line
In case first pas need gather information declaration appearing statement affect actual translation happening subsequent pas
The disadvantage compiling single pas possible perform many sophisticated needed generate high quality code
It difficult count exactly many pass optimizing compiler make
For instance different phase optimization may analyse one expression many time analyse another expression
Splitting compiler small program technique used researcher interested producing provably correct compiler
Proving correctness set small program often requires le effort proving correctness larger single equivalent program
Regardless exact number phase compiler design phase assigned one three stage
The stage include front end middle end back end
This approach make possible combine front end different language back end different sharing optimization middle end
Practical example approach multiple shared optimization multiple
The front end analyzes source code build internal representation program called IR
It also manages data structure mapping symbol source code associated information location type scope
While frontend single monolithic function program commonly implemented analyzed several phase may execute sequentially concurrently
This method favored due modularity
Most commonly today frontend broken three phase also known lexing also known scanning parsing
Lexing parsing comprise syntactic analysis word syntax phrase syntax respectively simple case module lexer parser automatically generated grammar language though complex case require manual modification
The lexical grammar phrase grammar usually simplifies analysis significantly handled semantic analysis phase
The semantic analysis phase generally complex written hand partially fully automated using
These phase broken lexing scanning evaluating parsing building CST parse tree transforming AST syntax tree
In case additional phase used notably rare
The main phase front end include following The middle end performs optimization intermediate representation order improve performance quality produced machine code
The middle end contains optimization independent CPU architecture targeted
The main phase middle end include following Compiler analysis prerequisite compiler optimization tightly work together
For example crucial
The scope compiler analysis optimization vary greatly small level even whole program
Obviously compiler potentially better job using broader view
But broad view free large scope analysis optimization costly term compilation time memory space especially true interprocedural analysis optimization
Interprocedural analysis optimization common modern commercial compiler
The open source criticized long time lacking powerful interprocedural optimization changing respect
Another open source compiler full analysis optimization infrastructure used many organization research commercial purpose
Due extra time space needed compiler analysis optimization compiler skip default
Users use compilation option explicitly tell compiler optimization enabled
The back end responsible CPU architecture specific optimization The main phase back end include following branch software engineering deal trying show compiler behaves according
Techniques include developing compiler using using rigorous testing often called compiler validation existing compiler
programming language usually appear type mind either designed
However practice rarely anything language exclusively compiled exclusively interpreted although possible design language rely run time
The categorization usually reflects popular widespread implementation language instance sometimes called interpreted language C compiled one despite existence BASIC compiler C interpreter
Interpretation replace compilation completely
It hide user make gradual
Even though interpreter interpreted directly executed program needed somewhere bottom stack see
Further compiler contain interpreter optimization reason
For example expression executed compilation result inserted output program prevents recalculated time program run greatly speed final program
Modern trend toward time blur traditional categorization compiler interpreter even
Some language specification spell implementation include compilation facility example
However nothing inherent definition Common Lisp stop interpreted
Other language feature easy implement interpreter make writing compiler much harder example many scripting language allow program construct arbitrary source code runtime regular string operation execute code passing special
To implement feature compiled language program must usually shipped includes version compiler
One classification compiler generated code executes
This known A compiler one output intended directly run type computer operating system compiler run
The output designed run different platform
Cross compiler often used developing software intended support software development environment
The output compiler produce code VM may may executed platform compiler produced
For reason compiler usually classified native cross compiler
The lower level language target compiler may
C often viewed sort portable assembler also target language compiler

original compiler used C target language
The C created compiler usually intended read maintained human
So pretty C intermediate code irrelevant
Some feature C turn good target language

C code directive generated support original source
While common compiler type output machine code many type Compiler construction taught university school part curriculum

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
In specifically lecture professor say CFGs give answer type
whether given string token valid
He add also desirable know particular string token language purpose introduces parse tree
Why part important
It might useful pedantic start surprising fact compiler use context free grammar contrary told
Instead use something closely related subtly different might termed please let know official name
They relate context free grammar finite state machine
The reason CFGs used CFGs give answer
That enough subsequent stage compiler
Instead subsequent stage need good representation input program work
This representation abstract syntax tree AST
Something similar happens lexical analysis contrary compiler course tell lexer use finite state machine regular expression nail lexical structure language regular expression finite state machine also give answer
We want output lexical stage consumption parser
Mealy machine deliver token list
If case compiler course usually use regular expression finite state machine lexical analysis CFGs parsing
Do compiler teacher lie u
No want help u understand The concept really similar
Mealy machine finite state machine every transition carry input action finite state machine also corresponding output action
Likewise context free transducer CFGs every production also associated output
Teachers want overly formal expect student bridge gap finite state machine lexer CFG parser
In practise student almost always
With pedantic caveat come original question parse tree used
The parse tree contains string CFG
The parse tree used construct AST representation program used later phase compiler particular type checker statically typed language code generator
The advantage ASTs program representation string ASTs make access immediate program easy
program three immediate namely C P Q
The AST program three pointer Both involve recursive invocation immediate plus
Hence ASTs provide exactly information needed efficient code generation
The relationship parse tree ASTs simple
The parse tree contains exact information string CFG
Every production applied consuming input string noted order used
This information natural tree shape whence name parse tree
An AST redundant information removed
An example redundant information properly balanced bracket
Another example node labelling give aforementioned information production used derive string
Such information important checking input string precisely syntactically valid acertained information longer needed compilation hence discarded
Let u look example
Consider arithmetic expression obvious grammar arithmetic expression E E E E E E Let ignore ambiguity grammar
Here plausible parse tree Note parse tree usually constructed explicitly implicity structure recursion throughout parsing process
The corresponding AST simpler still contains relevant information including precedence addition multiplication pointer structure compiler construct ASTs good representation program future compiler stage parse tree tell program CFG
The parse tree also give meaning program
For example mapped precedence rule complicated nested statement determined map
In abstract world derivation grammar corresponds compiler people call parse syntax tree
These tree capture word sense
However compiler utilise
Compiler generator like allow specify action execute upon reduction parse tree remains implicit
However often tie structure word
For programming language seems obvious arithmetic expression intent purpose tree variable visibility scope organised along tree structure
It therefore useful make syntax tree explicit reduced form
Once tree finally easy express semantics fit exactly
used
A tool focus AST rewriting even specify tree grammar AST manipulation
Note grammar ambiguous
mean unambiguous
Therefore CFG give u answer possible given string symbol language one way two different par possible using CFG confirm string valid syntax
To know parse used need abstract syntax tree
Or object information representing detailed trace parsing step
Of course need syntax tree purpose also first thing give u syntax interpreted symbol group together subordinate
If string parse tree tell u whether interpretation
Before interpret meaning must interpret syntax
However interpret syntax interpreting meaning
Compilers interpretation meaning already parsed guide parsing decision yet come
Note two related different idea
A parse tree concerned raw syntax includes punctuation token
Parse tree relatively uninteresting compiler programming language useful compiler parser output parse tree debugging low level action parser right thing semicolon comma parenthesis
What want abstract syntax tree
In fact syntax even disappear tokenization instance comment may disappear serve divide two token like C language producing two token
So parse tree chock full irrelevant detail though irrelevant detail
The abstract syntax tree identifies meaningful symbol utterance relation feature sentence major constitutent subordinate
For instance abstract syntax tree tell u multiplicative expression root node operator child subtree consisting node child
The semantic action parser know part phrase carry meaning punctuation mark pull meaningful piece syntax build tree
In abstract syntax tree furthermore used raw token syntax may replaced richly typed object
In given language token whose lexeme look like may become integer object tree token look like may turn symbol object string forth

It hard look meaning symbol know called context written
That symbol sequence notation
That
In mathematics statistic science prime generally used generate variable name thing similar without resorting subscript x generally mean something related derived x
Draw character
Detexify tell command generates character look like drew
Shapecatcher tell character look like drew
Mathematical notation tend easier find via Detexify
In first attempt I got correct answer second choice choice obviously right
Although Unicode PRIME character come among many similar character look like diagonal line
Once name look
standard meaning field particular calculus mean derivative general way generate symbol name something name something else usually relationship surrounding text explain relationship
Here sequence produced output algorithm
It related two contain element different order
permutation
The idea sequence rearrangement order
For example original sequence new primed sequence would
The prime fixed meaning particular case author could well used completely new letter new sequence say
One common use prime analysis designates derivative respect understood variable
Another common usage linear algebra sometimes used denote transpose one several common notation transpose including
As well prime well covered answer symbol often pronounced dash dashed x ed x ed x x respectively
I idea since symbol completely unrelated punctuation mark known dash
As Mowji already mentioned mean one thing derived another
Think come prime used mathematics kind function named function f x x f x another example f x sin x f x co x

What symbol mean Load Symbol List
Or example MSDN let begin conditional directive testing symbol symbol see evaluate true
Where symbol defined declared
For Load Symbol List symbol defined element syntax programming language
A local variable name symbol
A class type identifier symbol
PDB file contain symbol information debugger know thing reside name original source code
For symbol mean preprocessor conditionally defined C symbol
C preprocessor phase term little confusing
You define conditional symbol using define You test whether symbol defined using Preprocessor symbol typeless generally intersect type identifier actually part program code
The preprocessor sits source code
Preprocessor symbol exist compiled output take memory space runtime
Logically speaking compiler never see preprocessor syntax removed text reach compiler proper
Symbol fairly broad term computer science
Wikipedia article
However case looking preprocessor precompiler directive affect result compiling
In case symbol variable one symbol used like The Debug symbol evaluate code compiled Debug mode case code within block sent compiler
You also use creates symbol le set value
So undefined symbol evaluates whereas defined symbol evaluates You also add symbol use code remove built symbol
If use Visual Studio Properties project build tab
If use Visual Studio I would suspect symbol added command line compile program

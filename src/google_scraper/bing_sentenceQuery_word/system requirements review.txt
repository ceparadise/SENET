These day almost TOO many choice degree
Which degree choose
What difference Computer Information Systems v Computer Science major
IS really difference
If one best career path
If trouble choosing IT degree path start asking following three career question interest The question find drawn clue type online degree prefer come Computer Information Systems v Computer Science
Many online IT degree offered today related Computer Science Information Technology Computer Information Systems
Each major share much common also tends focus answering slightly different question
These approach translate turn different career path
Computer Science focus teaching programming computing
It meant give professional foundational skill applied towards career coding
It also provides overview computer operating system work
Computer Science primarily sharpening programming ability
You learn write code lesson plan many online IT degree also learn code work computer way
A Computer Science major often focus programming underlying algorithm make code work
As fair amount math involved ex
Calculus Discrete Mathematics etc
This degree major especially math heavy undergraduate level
Some see math plus many
Also due programming focus subject may interest ex
security networking etc
often touched upon lightly pure Computer Science degree program

Also check latest ranking
Focuses practical application computer work environment Computer Science
Computer Science developing new type technology Information Technology course learning take computer technology put use commercial environment
This major requires significantly le math compared Comp Science degree
It still cover basic programming yet give insight facet IT
You specialize many applied tech area networking security database management want spend time writing code
IT degree usually cover far topic Computer Science degree could limit exposure programming fundamental
You may learn write one type programming may difficult change learn another type later

Information Systems major tricky
This area often known Information Systems IS Computer Information Systems CIS Business Information Systems BIS Management Information Systems MIS
These online degree cover topic IT degree focus
Instead learning technology work IS student also learn ask type technology used solve business problem
Where Computer Science go deep programming IS degree go broad cover big picture
Since people part many system degree often include business course like project management managerial communication
The fact cover many different area downside
Information degree give coding experience CS degree
Computer Information Systems degree offered technical college business college across country one IS program may like
In school Information Systems taught business school like
In others like IS taught Computer Science degree

All international applicant interviewed telephone person ass English fluency
Here criterion used assessment If international student yet level English proficiency described encouraged obtain intensive English training Americans native instructor home country applying
It important select school teacher good reputation improving spoken English skill
For need English improvement additional help available class several day week additional charge per month
Most program Curricular Practical Training internship company admission criterion depend part current software industry demand
In view industry current requirement highly qualified IT professional accept student successful obtaining internship position
Therefore acceptance usually dependent applicant least month OOP professional paid work experience
Other programming also considered acceptance OOP preferred language model
If GPA lower B applicant may asked work experience may also asked take GRE
Beginning April entry highly qualified applicant little relevant work experience may considered following criterion met Strong GPA graduation bachelor degree computer science closely related field top quality university excellent English skill excellent faculty recommendation
GRE required applicant unless year paid professional programming work experience GPA B average
All applicant must complete GRE
To eligible acceptance MS Computer Science program applicant must minimum ile quantitative section
For applicant country strong encourage take required
A high GRE score may decrease initial amount international student asked pay upon enrollment
Also taking GRE increase likelihood international obtaining student visa program
A GRE score good way indicate overall strength even required asset application

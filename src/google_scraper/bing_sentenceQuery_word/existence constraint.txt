In wherein stated form
Constraints differ common language specify step sequence step execute rather property solution found
This make constraint programming form
The constraint used constraint programming various kind used
A B true
others
Constraints usually embedded within programming language provided via separate
Constraint programming expressed form embeds constraint
This variant logic programming due Jaffar Lassez extended specific class constraint introduced
The first implementation constraint logic programming
Instead logic programming constraint mixed
Programming language support constraint include functional programming imperative programming
Mostly constraint implemented imperative language via separate library existing imperative language
Constraint programming embedding constraint host language
The first host language used language field initially called
The two paradigm share many important feature like logical variable
Today implementation include one library constraint logic programming
The difference two largely style approach modeling world
Some problem natural thus simpler write logic program natural write constraint program
The constraint programming approach search state world large number constraint satisfied time
A problem typically stated state world containing number unknown variable
The constraint program search value variable
Temporal concurrent constraint programming TCC temporal concurrent constraint programming MJV variant constraint programming deal time
Languages programming follow one two approach typical example refinement model typical example perturbation model
The refinement model general restrict variable single value lead several solution problem
However perturbation model intuitive programmer using mixed imperative constraint language
The constraint used constraint programming typically specific domain
Some popular domain constraint programming Finite domain one successful domain constraint programming
In area like constraint programming often identified constraint programming finite domain
All example commonly solved SMT solver
Finite domain solver useful solving often based one approximation
The syntax expressing constraint finite domain depends host language
The following program solves classical puzzle constraint logic programming The interpreter creates variable letter puzzle
The operator used specify domain variable range set value
The constraint mean two variable take value zero
When interpreter evaluates constraint reduces domain two variable removing value
Then constraint considered reduce domain simply stored
The last constraint specifies digit assigned letter must hold letter replaced corresponding digit
From constraint solver infers
All stored constraint involving variable M awakened case constraint remove value domain remaining variable
Constraint propagation may solve problem reducing domain single value may prove problem solution reducing domain empty set may also terminate without proving satisfiability unsatisfiability
The literal used actually perform search solution
Constraint programming often realized imperative programming via separate library
Some popular library constraint programming

I sql apparently database use constraint different name
How I check constraint name
try When I originally answered question I thinking Foreign Key original question asked finding
Since many people commented finding constraint query alternate method If need even constraint information look inside system stored procedure see get certain information
To view source code using SQL Server Management Studio get Object Explorer
From expand Master database expand Programmability Stored Procedures System Stored Procedures
You find right click select modify
Just careful save change
Also use system stored procedure table using like
Easiest way check existence constraint something drop exists use function used without second parameter check constraint may also work constraint name match name object database may get unexpected result
also used constraint Foreign Key constraint Primary Key constraint etc
For best result always include appropriate object type second parameter function Also note schema often required
The schema constraint generally take schema parent table
Failure put constraint whatever checking bracket using method may also cause false negative object us unusual character
bracket required
If looking type constraint
default use different query From answered
Use find default constraint name
I put together different Exists check post Are looking something like tested SQL Server Just something watch
In SQL Server SSMS Script Constraint DROP And CREATE To command produce like Out box script NOT drop constraint SELECT return row
see post
The name default constraint wrong I gather also something function changing name fix problem
To fix I removed usage used default constraint name instead
I use following query check existing constraint I create
This query constraint name targeting given table name
Hope help
friend
It kind view show kind schema information
Check system view
You find three view dealing constraint one
I use check remote constraint column
It everything need
You use one one caveat IF EXISTS SELECT FROM WHERE name BEGIN ALTER TABLE TableName DROP CONSTRAINT CONSTRAINTNAME END Need use Constraint name since table may multiple foreign key still foreign key checked By posting answer agree

This question already answer I following I want able check constraint existing I drop
I use code type table
How could I modify code change xxxx make check existence constraint
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
else try Try something like something like asked viewed active site design logo Stack Exchange Inc user contribution licensed

One situation might prefer use unary constraint rather restricted domain want control tightly relation allowed used constraint
For example want investigate computational complexity CSP particular class constraint language
On hand investigation often assume unary relation included constraint language equivalent fixing global domain allowing domain variable subset
This known conservative case certain algebraic property constraint langauges
Even though domain may considered another type constraint exist good reason keep separated may easier think pure mathematical standpoint
Domains sense seen definition variable term Type

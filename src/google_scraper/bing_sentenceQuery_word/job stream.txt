In data element made available time
A stream thought item processed one time rather large batch
Streams processed differently normal function operate stream whole potentially unlimited data formally stream potentially unlimited data finite
Functions operate stream producing another stream known connected analogously
Filters may operate one item stream time may base item output multiple item input
The term stream used number similar way Streams used underlying data type
The term stream also applied multiple set data associated single filename
Most often one main stream make normal file data additional stream contain
Here stream used indicate variable size data opposed fixed size metadata differs stream used otherwise meaning data available time potentially infinite

There people reached without science degree
Las Vegas Nevada Most computer industry run people degree Bill Gates Steve Jobs Mark Zuckerberg Larry Ellison Michael Dell
New York New York Which mean get one
Massachusetts degree quit form company
For people definitely STEM people degree still default proposition
If get point school getting way new venture feel free bold drop
As OP I think CS degree hold back management tech company
It probably even good idea start way know company actually work

In statistic class visited Do grad make grad
question
The answer throw outlier
In word cherry pick
Once include Bill Gates Richard Bransons Mark Zuckerbergs whole argument fall apart
Most statistic way
Massachusetts If include shift average high budge median
The key statistic know measure relevant
We plan person middle either extreme making life choice
Put another way someone asks Should I go college
answer almost always yes
If person instead asks Should I go college even I purchase order meeting VC

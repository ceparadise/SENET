Database structure generally divided two respect namely flat database relational database
Relational database easier understand flat database
Because relational database simple design easy data operation
Database also relational structure found table store data
On table consists column row column define type information saved
Basically database useful time retain information categorized logically
For example want save information data database enterprise school group matter business become table
In database relationship relationship one one many many one many The key set column used identify access particular row row
Identified key explanatory table index constraint reference
The column part one key
A unique key key constrained two value
Unique key column contain NULL
For example column number employee defined unique key value column identifies one employee
No two employee number worker
The mechanism used enforce uniqueness index unique key
Unique index table column collection ordered column identifies value specify function unique row
A unique index contain NULL
The key one unique key defined table selected first important key
There one primary key table
A primary index automatically created primary key
The main index used database manager efficient access table row allows database manager enforce uniqueness primary key
You also specify index key column efficiently access data processing query
If table natural unique key order arrival method used distinguish unique row use time stamp part key help
Weld Line Automation Weld Line Programming If column table contains duplicate determine key one column
A key one column composite key
The combination column value define unique entity
If composite key easily defined also considered create new column unique
A foreign key field table corresponding relationship candidate key table
Foreign key used table
For example suppose two table customer includes customer data order table includes customer order
Intention order must associated client customer table
To place foreign key order table relates key customer table
Identifying foreign key column set column table refers column set column another table
Column table must reference key pillar super key referenced table
Value reference column line must occur single row referenced table
Thus row reference table contain value exist referenced table except potentially null
In way reference made link information together important part database normalization
Various row table reference may refer row referenced table
Most time reflects parent table reference table many child table referencing table relationship
Below example relationship Company also schedule Contact
Tables company parent link
In child contact schedule Field CompanyID table show contact contacted company owned
Diversification foreign key defines many record child table link record master table
In example child diversity since company number contact
Primary Key Foreign Key Relationship It Primary Foreign Key figure relationship two key

One One One Many Many Many
This indicated Key field equivalent schedule
show field identifies unique record
For example product Order value normally produced field
intrinsic meaning integer automatically generated one one
This indicated field table
In case field also created key example attitude Schedule Key Primary Key Table composite key consisting two field
The Primary Key table Primary Key table
common real world easy read Parents child
In figure show One Product attributed Many
The line product continuous line small dotted line
This mean field Primary Key Table
A dotted line show existence Foreign Key
Relationship important real world able see around u every day
For example many customer may order product
Many product ordered customer
This called Relationship
It implemented directly Database Table relationship
The solution create intermediate table record combination exist Customer Product
For example customer ordered three product three record customer intermediate table
Low key combination parent table primary key intermediate table
We also need allow comment like stronger
If get right database structure easy extend
Explain main characteristic advantage following term
Relational Database b Object Oriented Database c Object Relational Database Can connected database collection data item strongly recommended set name Minister Finance official explained Any data easily accessible
A database created using model relation relationship
The software used database relation database management system called Relations
A relationship database preferred choice storing data compared model hierarchical database model network model
The first database commenced namely Edgar Codd
data update easy without change information different file
info always date chance remaining old data forgotten file
typo avoid problem data type Excel dreaded syndrome
avoid unwanted conversion like November November validated data data entry filter impossible data existing information
With database combine different data easily
No force data different format
Do away intermediate Excel spreadsheet often generated manipulating data
And often dare delete case contain important information
Data manipulation done using query
This mean Structured Query Language SQL merge update manage data user need know SQL perform complex task
In Microsoft Access example Visual Query Builder provides simple intuitive interface make query
A database adjusted reveal new area investigation present large quantity data intuitive form
Often pattern become apparent data
With special database possible new way data many different source brought together displayed quickly fast
Ends Excel file subtlety different
Never sure correct file delete case
With relational database dilemma past
Your data set analysis created using query stored database
No copy made data instead link query directly statistic
The main goal development guarantee system enjoy longer life maintenance cost much le
This process system contained behavior reused included recent behavior
The ultimate goal new development Objects operational system prone model real world complete fashion traditional method
Objects organized class object behavior
Based object rather data processing system far reliable traditional system especially new behavior built existing object
Because object dynamically called accessible new object created time
New object inherit data attribute one many object
Behavior inherited novel behavior added without performing function existing system
Database Object capability expanded additional tie new data type access method function available object oriented programming
add character string data type
Complex data type combine feature data type already exist database
able determine data type text containing desired time number byte used create user defined data type opaque
also add virtual processor
By using encapsulation database object want contact form table
For example Table includes name address phone number email address contact
Through class encapsulating Contacts combine information table one
So query database information generate report style designed include information

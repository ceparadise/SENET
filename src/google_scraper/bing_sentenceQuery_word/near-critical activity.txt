The set project activity
It commonly used conjunction
The critical path method CPM project modeling technique developed late Morgan Walker James Kelley
Kelley Walker related memory development CPM
Kelley attributed term critical path developer developed time
The precursor came known Critical Path developed put practice DuPont contributed success
CPM commonly used form project including construction aerospace defense software development research project product development engineering plant maintenance among others
Any project interdependent activity apply method mathematical analysis
The first time CPM used major skyscraper development constructing former World Trade Center Twin Towers NYC
Although original CPM program approach longer used term generally applied approach used analyze project network logic diagram
The essential technique using CPM construct model project includes following Using value CPM calculates planned activity logical end point end project earliest latest activity start finish without making project longer
This process determines activity critical longest path total float delayed without making project longer
In project management critical path sequence project network activity add longest overall duration regardless longest duration float
This determines shortest time possible complete project
There float unused time within critical path
For example project testing solar panel requires could scheduling constraint testing activity would start scheduled time sunrise
This might insert dead time total float schedule activity path prior sunrise due needing wait event
This path total float would actually make path longer total float part shortest possible duration overall project
In word individual task critical path prior constraint might able delayed without elongating critical path float task
However time added project duration constraint actually amount project duration extended critical path activity constraint
A project several parallel near critical path task could float float
An additional parallel path network total duration shorter critical path called path
Activities path drag extending project duration
CPM analysis tool allow user select logical end point project quickly identify longest series dependent activity longest path
These tool display critical path near critical path activity desired cascading waterfall flow project start current status date selected logical end point
Although diagram still used place generally superseded diagram activity shown box node arrow represent logical relationship going predecessor successor shown diagram
In diagram Activities A B C D E comprise critical longest path Activities F G H critical path float day day day respectively
Whereas activity critical path float therefore delaying completion project critical path usually critical path drag delay project completion
The drag critical path activity computed using following formula These result including drag computation allow manager prioritize activity effective management project completion shorten planned critical path project pruning critical path activity fast tracking performing activity parallel crashing critical path shortening duration critical path activity adding
Critical path drag analysis also used optimize schedule process outside strict context increase manufacturing throughput using technique metric identify alleviate delaying factor thus reduce assembly lead time
term referring shortest possible time activity scheduled
It achieved shifting resource towards completion activity resulting decreased time spent often reduced quality work premium set speed
Crash duration typically modeled linear relationship cost activity duration however many case convex function step function applicable
Originally critical path method considered logical terminal element
Since expanded allow inclusion resource related activity process called resource assignment
A schedule may include delay due resource bottleneck unavailability resource required time may cause previously shorter path become longest resource critical path
A related concept called attempt protect activity project duration unforeseen delay due resource constraint
Since project schedule change regular basis CPM allows continuous monitoring schedule allows track critical activity alert project manager possibility activity may delayed beyond total float thus creating new critical path delaying project completion
In addition method easily incorporate concept stochastic prediction using PERT
Currently several software solution available industry use CPM method scheduling see
The method currently used project management software based manual calculation approach developed Fondahl Stanford University
A schedule generated using critical path technique often realized precisely used calculate time one mistake made result analysis may change
This could cause upset implementation project estimate blindly believed change addressed promptly
However structure critical path analysis variance original schedule caused change measured impact either adjusted
Indeed important element project postmortem analysis ABCP analyzes specific cause impact change planned schedule eventual schedule actually implemented

In describes system subject constraint example
program must guarantee response within specified time constraint often referred deadline
The correctness type system depends temporal aspect well functional aspect
response often understood order millisecond sometimes microsecond
A system specified operating real time usually response within timeframe although response time may given
A system described one control environment receiving data processing returning result sufficiently quickly affect environment time
The term also used mean simulation clock run speed real clock mean without significant delay
software may use one following network provide essential framework build software application
Systems used many application must control aircraft vehicle must produce maximum deceleration intermittently stop braking prevent skidding
processing completed within specified deadline relative event deadline must always met regardless
The term derives use early process simulated rate matched real process called avoid ambiguity
often capable simulating much faster pace situation could dangerous slow simulation also recognized accounted
Minicomputers particularly onwards built dedicated DOG scanner increased need response important interaction incoming data operating system RTOS well date era
scheduling allowed low priority task CPU time foreground task needed execute gave absolute priority within foreground highest priority
operating system would also used multiuser duty
For example could run foreground background RDOG would introduce additional element scheduling algorithm make appropriate people interacting via
Once used later used popular anybody could use home computer system
The possibility deactivate interrupt allowed loop defined timing low allowed implementation operating system giving user interface disk drive lower priority thread
Compared Intel CPUs generates large latency Windows operating system neither operating system allow program take CPU completely use without using native machine language thus surpassing interrupting Windows code
However several coding library exist offer real time capability high level language variety operating system example
The subsequent family member etc
also became popular manufacturer industrial control system
This application area one control offer genuine advantage term process performance safety
A system said total correctness operation depends upon logical correctness also upon time performed
system well deadline classified consequence missing deadline Thus goal ensure deadline met goal becomes meeting certain subset deadline order optimize criterion
The particular criterion optimized depend application typical example include maximizing number deadline met minimizing lateness task maximizing number high priority task meeting deadline
Hard system used imperative event reacted within strict deadline
Such strong guarantee required system reacting certain interval time would cause great loss manner especially damaging surroundings physically threatening human life although strict definition simply missing deadline constitutes failure system
For example control system hard system delayed signal may cause engine failure damage
Other example hard embedded system include medical system heart industrial process controller
Hard system typically found interacting low level physical hardware
Early video game system vector graphic hard requirement nature graphic timing hardware
In context system normally priority driven scheduler
Other scheduling algorithm include ignoring overhead sufficient system load le
New overlay scheduling system assist managing large system mixture hard non application
Soft system typically used solve issue concurrent access need keep number connected system changing situation
An example software maintains update flight plan commercial flight plan must kept reasonably current operate latency second
Live system also usually soft violation constraint result degraded quality system continue operate also recover future using workload prediction reconfiguration methodology
In DSP process analyzed input generated output sample processed generated continuously time take input output set sample processing delay
It mean processing delay must bounded even processing continues unlimited time
That mean processing time per sample including greater sampling period reciprocal
This criterion whether sample grouped together large segment processed block processed individually whether long short
Consider example process requires second process second sound
However take second made DSP process
A common life analog standing line waiting checkout grocery store
If line asymptotically grows longer longer without bound checkout process
If length line bounded customer processed output rapidly average inputted process
The grocer might go business must least lose business make checkout process thus fundamentally important process
A signal processing algorithm keep flow input data output falling farther farther behind input
But delay output relative input bounded regarding process operates unlimited time signal processing algorithm even throughput delay may long
signal processing necessary sufficient live signal processing required
Live audio digital signal processing requires operation sufficient limit throughput delay tolerable performer using noticeable audience also directly watching performer
Tolerable limit latency live processing subject investigation debate estimated millisecond
bidirectional le m round trip twice unidirectional delay considered acceptable avoid undesired conversation
computing sometimes misunderstood accurate classification
For example massive executing scientific simulation may offer impressive performance yet executing computation
Conversely hardware software braking system designed meet required deadline performance gain obligatory
Furthermore network server highly loaded network traffic response time may slower case still succeed time hit deadline
Hence network server would considered system temporal failure delay etc
typically small compartmentalized limited effect catastrophic failure
In system beyond limit would often considered catastrophic application context
Therefore important requirement system predictability performance
Some kind software many fall either category
For instance chess program designed play tournament clock need decide move certain deadline lose game therefore computation chess program allowed run indefinitely moving
In case however high performance desirable work tournament chess program allotted time better move faster unconstrained chess program run sooner able move
This example also illustrates essential difference computation computation tournament chess program make decision next move allotted time loses fails scenario meeting deadline assumed necessary
indicative amount processing performed given amount time ability get done processing yield useful output available time
The term NRT refers time introduced automated transmission occurrence event use processed data display control purpose
For example display depicts event situation existed current time minus processing time nearly time live event
The distinction term near real time real time somewhat nebulous must defined situation hand
The term implies significant delay
In many case processing described would accurately described near
Near also refers delayed transmission voice video
It allows playing video image approximately without wait entire large video file download
Incompatible database common flat file database scheduled basis common data near
The distinction near varies delay dependent type speed transmission
The delay near typically order several second several minute
Several method exist aid design system example old successful method represents structure system
Other example UML

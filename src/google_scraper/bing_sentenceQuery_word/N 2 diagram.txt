A symbolic according technique
Diagrams used since ancient time became prevalent
Sometimes technique us visualization onto surface
The word sometimes used diagram
The term diagram commonly used sense general specific meaning In science term used way
For example Anderson stated generally diagram pictorial yet abstract representation information example diagram whereas photograph video
On hand Lowe defined diagram specifically abstract graphic portrayal subject matter represent
In specific sense diagram chart contrast technical illustration map showing abstract rather representation information
The essence diagram seen Or Hall word diagram simplified figure caricature way intended convey essential meaning
These simplified figure often based set rule
The basic shape according White characterized term elegance clarity ease pattern simplicity validity
Elegance basically determined whether diagram simplest fitting solution problem
There least following type diagram type diagram Many type diagram commonly generated using diagramming software
Thousands diagram technique exist
Some example follow
Diagrams may also classified according use purpose example explanatory diagram

I want find characteristic set point S contains n point Voronoi Diagram V S
This diagram exactly vertex
I tried use Euler formula planar graph say n e I information V S vertex
You made small mistake thinking Voronoi diagram planar graph
Remember ray go infinity
make planar graph Voronoi diagram adding new vertex making ray incident apex
Plugging Euler formula yield e n A planar graph edge triangulation al obtained via Euler formula set
As consequence dual graph Voronoi diagram Delaunay tessellation triangulation
Or phrased differently every vertex Voronoi diagram three ray

Graphs mathematical concept found many us computer science
Graphs come many different flavor many found us computer program
Some flavor Most graph defined slight alteration following rule
If u v edge set say sometimes write
For example graph drawn Has following part
The adjacency relation symetric undirected graph also case
Has following part
Note B D D B Edge set arc B D arrow direction
Here following part
Edge labeled graph usually drawn label drawn adjacent arc specifying edge
Here following part
Here following part
Here following part
Vertices like called sink
Vertices like called source
Here following part
Graphs often used represent physical entity network road relationship people etc inside computer
There numerous mechansims used

Possible operation include
Not program need operation program efficent representation compute operation needed others suffice
represented function
We could represent Dgraph follows In rest note assume Vertices type Vertices set finite range type
Thus graph represented follows There many many algorithm graph
In note look
They include

You wo able vote comment
submitted So I need settle friend killing The situation One put Liquid bottle let sit
The bottle insulation nothing leaf bottle
Will bottle room temperature something like K
I say room temperature cant find convincing link whatever convinces people
Halp appreciated Post comment
Room temperature obvious reason
At thermal equilibrium achieved wait long enough everything temperature
However wo keep liquid nitrogen bottle
Initially temperature wo rise assuming start atm pressure boil nitrogen go gas phase pressure temperature rise eventually go gas phase go supercritical sure
Edit This I lied sorry
That phase diagram
That phase diagramm
Try edit You also easily see according phase diagram liquid phase normal pressure
Whups thanks correction
Your phase diagram correct It would super critical high P room T I believe liquid nitrogen boil quickly pressure bottle reach gas pressure room temperature
From room temperature liquid bottle space used gaseous gas pressure room temperature
What mean However wo keep liquid nitrogen bottle
Initially temperature wo rise assuming start atm pressure boil nitrogen go gas phase pressure temperature rise eventually go gas phase go supercritical sure
A liquid resist increase temperature boil
It reason water put fire stay around degree Celsius boiling remove energy provided fire much hotter
As liquid boil pressure vessel increase since phase depends pressure temperature could either vapour liquid supercritical fluid
The pressure depend much liquid nitrogen compared size container
let say container filled liquid I likely although diagram scenario extreme pressure
roomtemperature Yes follow diagram room temperature pressure point marked STP
When look phase diagram liquid phase pressure room temperature
Depending size bottle versus fill end gaseous supercritical
Nitrogen exist liquid
If container hold pressure supercritical fluid phase property liquid gas
end day pump liquid nitrogen closed pressure vessel end room temperature may whatever state want
eventually yes
Liquid nitrogen magical heat black hole perpetually absorbs heat stay forever cold
thought
But bring someone think stay cold forever
make liquid nitrogen different cold substance
Ice melt eventually glass tea reach room temperature
If liquid nitrogen magical heat absorbing black hole think air conditioning refrigerator would exist people would keep liquid nitrogen around cool house foodstuff
exactly point well fall deaf ear though
The issue IMO whenever people see liquid nitrogen OPEN container keeping cold way keep
They assume always magically cold liquid It cold liquid boiling away eventually none left
Imagine pot water stove
It boiling
Eventually pot run dry
Now imagine put pot water oven
The water boil cold gone
If put solid lid water would stay liquid pressure would go psi
An example could pressurized container
The contain supercritical AND RT
When open get cold due adiabatic dilation might even get liquid depending dilate air
This basically get liquid cold air
c Linde It depends temperature mass heat capacity conductivity time matter outside bottle
Assuming everyday air SATP infinite time nitrogen absorb heat temperature air
The bottle either explode strong enough contain nitrogen resisting pressure caused increase heat
assuming vessel holding pressure seeing Use site constitutes acceptance

In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

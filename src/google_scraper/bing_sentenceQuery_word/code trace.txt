Students able use trace table check code error
A trace table technique used test algorithm order make sure logical error occur whilst algorithm processed
The table usually take form table With column showing variable row showing number input algorithm subsequent value variable
Trace table typically used school college teaching student program
They essential tool teaching student certain algorithm work systematic process occurring algorithm executed
They also useful debugging application helping programmer easily detect error occurring may occurring
Large algorithm may difficult understand first glance
However often broken smaller simpler component easier comprehend
A trace table used track process occur throughout algorithm
It used see value variable througout execution program
During process completing trace table purpose algorithm may revealed
This chapter discus create trace table given algorithm

Java us stack keep track sequence method call within program
This approach used trace recursive method hand
The technique actually work sequence method call though usually worthwhile recursive method
PDF Thank much
I reference website often
This first time I understood trace recursive method properly
I finally get
Thank much I definitely recommending site teacher
Makes thing much easier
Thanks technique

In program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
Most commonly profiling information serf aid program
Profiling achieved either program binary executable form using tool called
Profilers may use number different technique statistical instrumented simulation method
Profilers use wide variety technique collect data including operating system
Profilers used process
Program analysis tool extremely important understanding program behavior
Computer architect need tool evaluate well program perform new
Software writer need tool analyze program identify critical section code
writer often use tool find well algorithm performing
The output profiler may tool existed platform early usually based timer interrupt recorded PSW set detect hot spot executing code
This early example see
In early permitted full trace feature
program analysis Unix date back Unix system included basic tool listed function much program execution time used
In extended concept complete analysis
In Amitabh Srivastava published paper describing ATOM Analysis Tools OM
The ATOM platform convert program profiler insert code program analyzed
That inserted code output analysis data
This technique modifying program analyze known
In ATOM paper appeared list influential paper period ending
Flat profilers compute average call time call break call time based callee context
profilers show call time frequency function also involved based callee
In tool full context preserved
profilers add dimension flat profilers relating performance measure feature input workload input size input value
They generate chart characterize application performance scale function input
Profilers also program analyze target program collecting information execution
Based data granularity profilers collect information classified event based statistical profilers
Since profilers interrupt program execution collect information finite resolution time measurement taken grain salt
The programming language listed profilers Some profilers operate
A sampling profiler probe target program regular interval using
Sampling profile typically le numerically accurate specific allow target program run near full speed
The resulting data exact statistical approximation
The actual amount error usually one sampling period
In fact value n time sampling period expected error n sampling period
In practice sampling profilers often provide accurate picture target program execution approach intrusive target program thus many side effect memory cache instruction decoding pipeline
Also since affect execution speed much detect issue would otherwise hidden
They also relatively immune cost small frequently called routine loop
They show relative amount time spent user mode versus interruptible kernel mode processing
Still kernel code handle interrupt entail minor loss CPU cycle diverted cache usage unable distinguish various task occurring uninterruptible kernel code activity
Dedicated hardware go beyond ARM recent MIPS processor JTAG interface PCSAMPLE register sample truly undetectable manner allowing collection flat profile
Some commonly used statistical profilers OSX Linux Parallel Amplifier part
This technique effectively add instruction target program collect required information
Note program cause performance change may case lead inaccurate result
The effect depend information collected level detail required
For example adding code count every call probably le effect counting many time statement obeyed
A computer special hardware collect information case impact program minimal
Instrumentation key determining level control amount time resolution available profilers

Hi name XXXXX XXXXX I helping today
To write trace table simply write variable j D N step various loop
Give minute I show looking ok thank
I really confused data go table many line etc I need So I know code trace might slightly different regard XXXXX XXXXX class I come J D N need line still dont understand This list value variable course loop
You notice loop done D set I think need however quite short
Likely professor trying use trace table point
anything J D etc
people class said line You might different setup class however I know like http Which basically say variable change put item list
might need ok I guess stuff really confuses I dont understand I try figuring gave
J D N Sorry typo
J D N Yea code trace supposed allow see variable various point application
So first line see J D N come number yes got Then N N incremented giving Then get Then J get decremented D get incremented get since n incremented add
know stop So total end J D N You know stop becase It tell loop section first N secondly N finally N ok total line answer give end I think document class describes code trace
I want make sure match need I mistaken professor asking something little bit different assuming assigment http copy paste example gave help yes assignment How Perform Code Trace Code tracing form algorithm analysis analyst simulate computer operation
You determining efficiency given algorithm evaluating logic
You step line code determining execution line cause happen
When I teach student perform code trace I prescriptive
Of course familiar another approach work may feel free follow approach
Here however sure fire way perform code trace process
So something specific talk use following code snippet X Y Z A While Z A X X Y Y Print YIPPEE
Z Z ENDWHILE Step One Label every line code Line Number Line Code X Y Z A While Z A X X Y Y Print YIPPEE
Z Z ENDWHILE Step Two Create table column every variable referenced code PLUS one
In case x z column
Plan many row line code
If code includes branching might need fewer row code includes looping might need row
The table provided code snippet would look follows Line Var X Var Y Var Z Var A System Impact Step Three Step code one line time
Enter chart whatever executing line cause happen
Line Var X Var Y Var Z Var A System Impact Note


Note Note Note Note Note Note Note Note Note Note As result executing first line code X value stored variable location X set
You know anything variable location system impact
Line Var X Var Y Var Z Var A System Impact Note


Note

Note Note Note Note Note Note Note Note Note As result executing line value Y set
X remains unchanged know nothing variable system impact
Let speed thing bit Line Var X Var Y Var Z Var A System Impact Note


Note

Note
Note Note Note Note Note Note Note Note Z set Note A set Now something little interesting begin happen
We hit conditional line
Remember conditional expression evaluated Boolean ie True False We evaluate conditional listing evaluation System Impact column
Line Var X Var Y Var Z Var A System Impact Note


Note

Note
Note Note Z A
TRUE Goto line instead line Note Note Note YIPPEE
print Note Note Note Conditional evaluated
Currently evaluation
Of course proceed line
The driving variable conditional case Z often referred sentinel value
The name come observation variable stand like sentry guard front code block loop
If conditional evaluates true allowed pas inside loop
If conditional evaluates false must bypass block proceed next executeable line code
The magic fairy spit line code looking signal reached end block
In case look keyword ENDWHILE start next line executable code follows
In case code
Note X multiplied
So Note added Y
So Note The text string YIPPEE
without quotation mark course
Note subtracted Z Another interesting moment
Line contains keyword ENDWHILE
It mark end WHILE coding block
The magic fairy taken know go back conditional Line test see still true Line Var X Var Y Var Z Var A System Impact Note


Note

Note
Note Note Z A
TRUE Goto line instead line Note Note Note YIPPEE
print Note Note Block end GoTo Line Note Designates end While block sends execution flow back Line conditional
Line Var X Var Y Var Z Var A System Impact Note


Note

Note
Note Note Z A
TRUE Goto line instead line Note Note Note YIPPEE
print Note Note Block end GoTo Line Note Z A
TRUE Goto line Note Note Note YIPPEE
print Note Note End While Block goto line Note Z A
TRUE Goto line Note Note Note YIPPEE
print Note Note End While Block goto line Note Z A
FALSE Goto line Note We Done
Note Conditional still true execution go back Note X Note Y Note YIPPEE
print Note Note Endwhile return reevaluate conditional Note Conditional still true proceed line Note X Note Y Note YIPPEE
print Note Z Note Endwhile return line reevaluate conditional Note Conditional FALSE look ENDWHILE Note After finding keyword ENDWHILE flow go next executable line Some time life every respectable nerd ie graduating student
performed code trace
When code trace appear exam typical question What ending value Y
What printed screen anything many time
What would happen instead decreasing Z line increased Z
The code snippet rarely long cuz want grade
J And good follow process outlined answer code snippet question All Day Long
Hope help
I understand confused
I think professor going little overboard
That said I fix I wrote yea never explains thing well u isnt available questioning assignment due
I really appreciate help
Yea problem
Here I got Arg
The formatting got messed
I put something wikisend Does help
http yes thanks much Now I think part might
I think rest right I ok
The way listed helped understand lot better explanation
Ok I meant btw http Good hear
If anything else I help please let know
ok thank
I think assignment others throughout semester I back Ok best luck

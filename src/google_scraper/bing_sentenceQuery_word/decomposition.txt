Before computer solve problem problem way resolved must understood
Decomposition help breaking complex problem manageable part
Decomposition one four cornerstone Computer Science
It
The smaller part examined solved designed individually simpler work
If problem decomposed much harder solve
Dealing many different stage much difficult breaking problem number smaller problem solving one one time
Breaking problem smaller part mean smaller problem examined detail
Similarly trying understand complex system work easier using decomposition
For example understanding bicycle work straightforward whole bike separated smaller part part examined see work detail

also known breaking complex problem system part easier conceive understand program maintain
There different type decomposition defined computer science More generally computer science technique mastering complexity function model
A system thereby replaced series functional model subsystem
A decomposition paradigm computer programming strategy organizing program number part usually implies specific way organize program text
Usually aim using decomposition paradigm optimize metric related program complexity example modularity program maintainability
Most decomposition paradigm suggest breaking program part minimize static dependency among part maximize part
Some popular decomposition paradigm procedural module abstract data type one
The concept decomposition paradigm entirely independent different two often confused often case computation confused procedural decomposition computation confused decomposition
Decomposition Structure Negative Context Static Dynamic Requirements Models Systems Partition Functions Use Scenarios Mapping Requirements Goals A decomposition diagram show function process organization data subject area type object broken lower level detailed component
For example decomposition diagram may represent organizational structure functional decomposition process
Decomposition diagram provide logical hierarchical decomposition system

When solve computer programming problem need make choice order
Sometimes problem big complex know start
Decomposition break problem smaller part make easier tackle

Computer programmer decompose code small part
If programming computer game might write code control character movement write code control sound effect
Computer programmer exactly thing
When writing program often break code small chunk
They call approach decomposing breaking large problem smaller problem
Decomposition save lot time code complex program could run many line code
If mistake made would take long time find
Another benefit decomposition allows programmer easily copy reuse useful chunk code program
Decomposition useful strategy
It help write complex computer program plan holiday make model plane
Think mobile phone
Mobile phone made lot different part
Companies make phone might make list everything need decompose manufacturing process one factory making screen another make battery another make phone case
Making computer game quite complex problem
You could solve breaking smaller task

well almost problem solving though may realise
The When solution smaller problem put together solution larger problem achieved
Decomposition technique introduced detail throughout younger year definition certainly given student
However To understand fit curriculum look image represents Guess Who board In game Guess Who aim try find character player picked asking series question try narrow possibility one
Let play round using character named Christian I decided Christian character player try work I chosen
The first question could chosen male character answer would yes
This immediately narrowed remaining choice board Having narrowed option next question asked could character got black hair answer would
The board look like Next could find whether character hair Now let find whether character blonde hair And finally wear glass
As see asking series targeted question able establish chosen character must Christian nobody else board met criterion
Before decomposition problem faced quite daunting task work opponent chosen group people
However breaking problem series smaller problem able find solution relative ease
In key concept decomposition revisited however much stronger link mathematics computer science whilst learning take place
A fantastic example decomposition activity would look mathematical function break individual component
Take following There lot step involved solving equation best way calculate answer decompose
Before start decomposition let quick reminder rule involved solving math equation
Brackets Other Indices Division Multiplication Addition Subtraction tell u order need solve operation
The first step solving math equation solve bracket
Therefore let complete addition bracket see equation look like The next step solve index power however since present let move straight multiplication division
It matter order multiplication division
Since top left equation multiplication let first Next let u complete division
Tinally let complete addition subtraction
We subtract get final answer equation solved
What seemed daunting equation calculate decomposed series smaller simpler sum allowing u work final answer general ease making larger equation much easier solve
Please note following guideline taught primary year guidance may representative way computing taught child school
Students learn problem solving break problem set easier achieve task
This closely tied learning element mathematics
Students introduced concept decomposition direct link computer science
activity given focus individual problem solving skill student may required solve problem using Scratch
Students start decompose complex problem direct link mathematics equation decomposition
Students continue learning decomposition student given complex task design write code

What decomposition
The process breaking problem smaller manageable part known decomposition
Decomposition help u solve complex problem manage large project
This approach many advantage
It make process manageable achievable one large problem daunting set smaller related task much easier take
It also mean task tackled team working together bringing insight experience skill task
The problem making breakfast decomposed number task Decomposition particularly

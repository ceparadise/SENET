In called interrupted middle execution safely called previous invocation complete execution
The interruption could caused internal action jump call external action
Once reentered invocation completes previous invocation resume correct execution
This definition originates programming environment flow control could interrupted transferred ISR
Any subroutine used ISR could potentially executing interrupt triggered reentrant
Often subroutine accessible via operating system reentrant
Hence interrupt service routine limited action perform instance usually restricted accessing file system sometimes even allocating memory
A subroutine directly indirectly recursive reentrant
This policy partially enforced
However subroutine fail reentrant relies global variable remain unchanged variable modified subroutine recursively invoked
This definition reentrancy differs environment
A reentrant subroutine achieve reentrant alone might sufficient situation
Conversely code necessarily reentrant see example
Other term used reentrant program include pure procedure sharable code
Reentrancy subroutine operates resource data depends respective operation
For example subroutine modifies global variable machine operation may split two operation thus subroutine interrupted executing called interrupt handler global variable may state bit updated
The programming language might provide atomicity guarantee interruption caused internal action jump call
Then function f expression like global f order evaluation subexpressions might arbitrary programming language would see global variable either set previous value intermediate state part updated
The latter happen expression
The operating system might provide atomicity guarantee system call interrupted signal partial effect
The processor hardware might provide atomicity guarantee interrupted processor instruction partial effect
This example function fails reentrant well failing
As used interrupt service routine In previous example made making
It still fails reentrant continue cause problem called context thread already executing
The following somewhat contrived modification swap function careful leave global data consistent state time exit perfectly reentrant however since ensure global data consistent state execution An implementation allocates instead reentrant
Reentrancy thing function may called yet generate exactly output called
Generally speaking function produce output data based input data though optional general
Shared data could accessed anybody time
If data changed anybody nobody keep track change guarantee share datum whether datum time
Data characteristic called describes program data may used
Data scope either outside function indefinite created time function called destroyed upon exit
Local data shared routine therefore affect
Global data defined outside function accessed one function either form data shared function data shared function name
In global data defined scope class private making accessible function class
There also concept class variable bound class instance
For reason programming distinction usually reserved data accessible outside class public data independent class instance static
Reentrancy distinct closely related
A function still reentrant
For example function could wrapped around avoids problem multithreading environment function used interrupt service routine could starve waiting first execution release mutex
The key avoiding confusion reentrant refers thread executing
It concept time multitasking operating system existed
A reentrant interrupt handler interrupt early interrupt handler
This may reduce
In general programming interrupt service routine recommended interrupt soon possible interrupt handler
This practice help avoid losing interrupt
In following piece code neither function reentrant
In depends thus two thread execute access concurrently result
The value therefore return value predicted confidence vary depending timing execution
Hence reentrant
Neither call reentrant
These slightly altered version reentrant In following piece code function reentrant
In called different thread without problem
But function used reentrant interrupt handler second interrupt arises inside function second routine hang forever
As interrupt servicing disable interrupt whole system could suffer

This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
Wikipedia quite nice article
Function called interrupted middle execution safely called previous invocation complete execution What make one function
Check article roughly Do use static global variable function since may changed time function resume Function must modify code
low level graphic routine may habit generate Do call function comply two rule When use function
Here example Functions executed interrupt context must
Functions called multiple must
A function one interrupted typically thread another thread without
Functions rely local variable considered due fact variable safely encapsulated thread
Consider case function us global variable
Thread A function X incrementing global variable
Thread B interrupt Thread A enters function X also increment global variable
Thread A behaviour state changed likely incorrectly another thread therefore function considered
Put simplest simple cn make function one One typical situation interrupt may middle function interrupt occurs interrupt service routine call function part workload
Another recursion function call either directly indirectly
function follow certain guideline use static variable C lest different instance trample
A function function called safely threaded interruptible environment
usually mean reliance variable properly us mutexes prevent accessing data object time
So issue
If call function set variable
call function first call complete another thread interrupt new call destroy variable setup
When interrupting thread finish original function resume different data
Thus fails
In nutshell function protect type problem Reentrancy applicable concurrent programming
A reentrant function guarantee functionality even function invoked reentered concurrent multiple thread

A function said reentrant provision interrupt function course execution service interrupt service routine resume earlier going function without hampering earlier course action
Reentrant function used application like hardware interrupt handling recursion etc
The function satisfy certain condition called reentrant
It may use global static data
Though restriction generally advised
interrupt may change certain global value resuming course action reentrant function new data may give undesired result

It modify code
This important course action function remain throughout code
But may allowed case interrupt routine us local copy reentrant function every time us different value interrupt

Should call another function
Reentrancy distinct closely related
A function still reentrant
For example function could wrapped around mutex avoids problem multithreading environment function used interrupt service routine could starve waiting first execution release mutex
The key avoiding confusion reentrant refers one thread executing
It concept time multitasking operating system existed
Source Example Functions In code reentrant function
If interrupt pause execution shift control
After completes control transferred reenters execution phase

I need handle Unix signal application following goal I common primitive spinlocks semaphore etc
But seem enough data structure even simple list
My initial idea following The main problem list data structure thread safe
If I lock I ca store second signal anywhere
I ca wait previous handler exit second signal essentially suspended critical section
Simply I idea handle following scenario After thinking lot I impression maybe problem unsolvable
Am I right
How operating system handle similar problem example possibily bursting interrupt hardware
Finally I found solution handle whole problem
It relatively easy
They key solution
Important remember although problem also race condition eliminiation solution differs significantly lock everything use task release everything solution
It
The common solution would lead deadlock parent example handler surely suspended whole execution handler
So disadvantage advantage well
We wo anything run
We ca simply lock thing also need
So blocking lock closed nonblocking lock left
What I invented following C code As see beautiful separated reentrant stack list data structure
The main problem understood I also learned day thinking constructing reentrant algorithm harder contrust multithread important thing reentrant algos variable interact eachother operation atomic

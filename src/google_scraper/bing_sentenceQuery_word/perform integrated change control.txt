One topic cause confusion particularly PMP exam question Integration Knowledge area
In short article I want compare contrast two process Monitor Control Project Work Perform
Let start The main objective process check work performed create project deliverable method used plus progress remains line baseline plan
Whenever progress line plan project manager need take form corrective action
The key understanding integrated change control compare actual work result plan make adjustment required order ensure plan actual result harmony
These action take place within integrated change control
In summary Monitor Control Project Work Is managing way project scope executed
As example suppose need change number resource used future work could issue change request modify use future resource
The main input integrated change control performance report provide evidence change necessary allow determine necessary take corrective action
Included performance report forecast future project performance help determine appropriate preventative action problem arise first place
Project Managers need proactive
The two major output integrated change control change request mentioned main output update incorporate change within project management plan
Every single change requested otherwise processed Perform Integrated Change Control process
Integrated change control impact change assessed project reason called integrated change occur one part project need assessed across whole project
The main difference integrated change control Monitor Control Project Work whereas Perform Integrated Change Control focus managing change project scope Monitor Control Project Work focus managing way scope executed
For example new application requested added IT solution project change request would need via Perform Integrated Change Control process ensure impact rest system known understood change approved otherwise
The main input situation would change request main used change control board used make decision
The main output change request status update decision next
Changes either approved rejected
In case former fed back Direct Manage Project Execution process within Executing process group

Introduction Process Perform Integrated Change Control one important project management process
Remember cost implementing change project go project get along
Therefore best prevent change possible possible make change soon possible project
If avoid making change need go process analyzing impact project

Inputs Tools Techniques Outputs Here chart summarizing input tool technique output
Here thing note Change request input two different process
If need change obvious noticed project work executed change request may output Direct Manage Project Work
On hand need change noticed result monitoring project measuring earned value various point along way example change request may output Monitor Control Project Work
In either case change request analyzed part process set Change Management Plan
The tool technique change management expert judgment meeting tool used facilitate two technique
The APPROVED change input back Direct Manage Project Work although change request entered Change Log whether approved

Most time I receive lot query Sequence Change Request several aspirant preparing certification blog step towards addressing query related Integrated Change Control Sequence Change Request
Irrespective reason intensity size change formal change request required take forward change part project activity project change request need documented managed monitored controlled project defined Change Management Plan
Let u begin answering Change Request
As per The reason change request Now come next segment It common perception follow many formal step small change project may even impact project baseline project plan
It important understand impact change assumed
The formal change control process required analyze impact change respective planning done advance
Let exemplify Ray project manager website development project
His client sent scope change website requested Ray implement change project deliverable due day
As per client change small sent due deliverable
Ray team conducted meeting discus change decided implement change without following formal change control process
As assumed change quite small need many formal step
They implemented change project deliverable without even impact analysis
The deliverable accepted customer new scope added working desired
This failure new scope added ended several defect customer
Ray realized defect repair take day need review schedule baseline add new scope scope baseline well
The mistake Ray team added scope without impact analysis
Since impact analysis done scope baseline contain information regarding new scope added recently
The quality control team inspection deliverable missed inspect new functionality added since part requirement scope baseline checking deliverable
So see small change scope product cascaded large amount rework afterwards
If Ray followed formal change control process scope change received customer irrespective client saying without assumption change impacted would updated
And time quality control deliverable requirement must captured deliverable sent customer acceptance
Now must understood Integrated Change Control impact entire performance Project project team
Thus presence change control process needed project followed project consistently
Change control process prevents unnecessary risk objective success project

Does go Control Quality Quality Assurance flow Control quality Validate Scope
The Approved change request implemented Direct Manage project work
However result validated Control Quality
Approved change request input Control Quality also
Approved change result Perform Integrated Change Control process require validation ensure change appropriately implemented

Recall discussion salient point First thing understand entire change control process responsibility project manager
Although stakeholder raise change request even verbally project manager must document first
She estimate impact project cost schedule constraint document well
This information used change control meeting
Change Control Board CCB formed address change request
The structure board role responsibility determined planning stage accepted stakeholder
CCB consists different stakeholder team well outside team including customer
The aim board ensure involved party understand suggested change ass impact well taking decision either accept reject even delay suggested change
Now mandatory requirement form Change control board CCB
In project power accept reject change request given project manager sponsor customer
The decision form CCB result organizational practice nature project certain case insistence customer
Since change request may result change cost schedule scope baseline may impact risk even delivery date
Hence prudent committee stakeholder formally go change request make informed decision accepting rejecting delaying change request implementation
Project manager must convey decision stakeholder using predefined communication channel
The project management activity manages change project essentially involves reviewing change request approving change managing change deliverable organizational process asset project document project management plan
This project management activity conducted throughout life project
As project manager need ensure assessed impact change request prioritized CCB look
You need also follow CCB member regularly show change control meeting
Meetings held amongst CCB member discus change request arrive decision approving using change control tool help storing accessing information impact communicating decision stakeholder
ot change request submitted change control board approved
If impact project objective unacceptable CCB reject change request
Change log list change occurring project
This project manager update impact change request project constraint possibly project objective
This circulated stakeholder decision action information
Approved change request may result change schedule costing plan quality process sequence planned activity
They may increase decrease risk change already planned
Hence output project management activity well schedule cost scope may updated
Moreover risk register stakeholder list issue log activity list milestone list may also updated The figure show change request initiated implemented
Figure show change request initiated approved implemented Every change request impact constraint need run Change Control Board CCB
It analyze impact decide whether approve reject change request
In case change request impact constraint cost schedule quality resource etc
project manager take call implement without taking CCB
Managing change project crucial order deal deviation plan project execution
This exercise project effective change control meeting held regularly
It also important project manager update subsidiary plan baseline soon change approved

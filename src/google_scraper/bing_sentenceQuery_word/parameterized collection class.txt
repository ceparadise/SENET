link state following The instantiation generic type actual type argument called parameterized type
Example parameterized type So parameterized type
They parameterized type type take type parameter
The fact different type two side expression irrelevant polymorphic behavior
subtype
Parameterized type generally class deal object without interesting type
The type may defined using symbolic name passed instance class created
For example In example wrap object type executes method using fact method always exists
Here class used Please pay attention say fact object created parameter dictate type constructor argument
Coming back example mean collection string
This mean add object type collection
It seems generic type parameterized type synonymous
But seems right call example generic type since sense word generic anymore
So probably A generic type declaration formal type generic type A parameterized type declaration actual type parameterized type A raw type declaration generic type actual type
raw type Both us collection parameterized type type used
ParameterizedType represents parameterized type Collection
A parameterized type created first time needed reflective method specified package
When parameterized type p created generic type declaration p instantiates resolved type argument p created recursively
See TypeVariable detail creation process type variable
Repeated creation parameterized type effect
Instances class implement interface must implement equal method equates two instance share generic type declaration equal type parameter

style written term needed specific type provided
This approach pioneered permit writing common differ set type operate used thus reducing
Such software entity known
They known Haskell community also us term generic related somewhat different concept influential book
The author note technique especially combined powerful however Dynamic highly parameterized software harder understand static software
The term originally coined specific sense describe programming paradigm whereby fundamental requirement type abstracted across concrete example algorithm data structure formalised implemented term concept typically using language genericity mechanism described
Generic programming defined follows Generic programming center around idea abstracting concrete efficient algorithm obtain generic algorithm combined different data representation produce wide variety useful software
Generic programming paradigm approach software decomposition whereby fundamental requirement type abstracted across concrete example algorithm data structure formalised analogously abstraction algebraic theory
Early example programming approach implemented Scheme Ada although best known example STL developed theory used decouple sequence data structure algorithm operating
For example given sequence data structure
singly linked list vector algorithm operate
direct approach would implement algorithm specifically data structure giving combination implement
However generic programming approach data structure return model iterator concept simple value type dereferenced retrieve current value changed point another value sequence algorithm instead written generically argument iterators
pair iterators pointing beginning end subsequence process
Thus data combination need implemented
Several iterator concept specified STL refinement restrictive concept
forward iterators provide movement next value sequence
suitable singly linked list stream input data whereas iterator also provides direct access element sequence
suitable vector
An important point data structure return model general concept implemented requirement explicitly part concept definition
This limit data structure given algorithm applied complexity requirement major determinant data structure choice
Generic programming similarly applied domain
graph algorithm
Note although approach often utilizes language feature fact independent particular detail
Generic programming pioneer Alexander Stepanov wrote Generic programming abstracting classifying algorithm data structure
It get inspiration Knuth type theory
Its goal incremental construction systematic catalog useful efficient abstract algorithm data structure
Such undertaking still dream
I believe iterator theory central Computer Science theory central Mathematics
noted Following Stepanov define generic programming without mentioning language feature Lift algorithm data structure concrete example general abstract form
Other programming paradigm described generic programming include described Generic Programming Introduction
The approach lightweight generic programming approach Haskell
In article distinguish programming language used implement see
For discussion comparison generic programming paradigm see
Genericity facility existed language since least language subsequently adopted many language including defunct language
Genericity implemented supported differently various programming language term generic also used differently various programming context
For example execute code compiling one create new new implementation word fly
It expose compiler behaviour therefore naturally offer capacity however referred Forth text
Similarly dynamically typed language especially interpreted one usually offer default passing value function value assignment behavior often utilized abstraction code terseness however typically labeled direct consequence dynamic typing system employed language
The term used specifically language use type always parametric actual code type generic
These usage still serve similar purpose rendering abstraction
viewed predefined generic type
Every usage array struct type instantiates new concrete type reuses previous instantiated type
Array element type struct element type parameterized type used instantiate corresponding generic type
All usually syntax differs generic construct
Some try unify user defined generic type
A broad survey genericity mechanism programming language follows
For specific survey comparing suitability mechanism generic programming see
When creating container class statically typed language inconvenient write specific implementation datatype contained especially code datatype virtually identical
For example duplication code circumvented defining class template Above placeholder whatever type specified list created
These commonly called allow class reused different datatypes long certain contract kept
This genericity mechanism confused usage exchangeable instance list object type containing object type
Templates also used function example The construct used widely cited genericity construct popularized notion among programmer language designer support many generic programming idiom
The D programming language also offer fully template based precedent simplified syntax
The Java programming language provided genericity facility syntactically based since introduction
also known Chrome construct take advantage support generic present since version generic since first designed
The standard library us generic provide many service
Ada add comprehensive generic container library standard library inspired
A package subprogram take one
A value variable constant type subprogram even instance another designated generic unit
For generic formal type syntax distinguishes discrete access pointer type etc
Some formal parameter default value
To generic unit programmer pass parameter formal
The generic instance behaves like unit
It possible instantiate generic unit example inside loop
The specification generic package Instantiating generic package Using instance generic package The language syntax allows precise specification constraint generic formal parameter
For example possible specify generic formal type accept modular type actual
It also possible express constraint generic formal parameter example In example constrained
When instantiating unit programmer must pas actual array type satisfies constraint
The disadvantage control complicated syntax generic formal parameter completely defined specification instantiate generic without looking body generic
Unlike Ada allow specialised generic instance requires generic instantiated explicitly
These rule several consequence us template enable generic programming technique
The Standard Library includes STL provides framework template common data structure algorithm
Templates may also used way code rather
Using template specialization Templates considered
There two kind template function template class template
A pattern creating ordinary function based upon parameterizing type supplied instantiated
For example Standard Template Library contains function template creates function return either whichever larger
could defined like function template instantiation specific type called like ordinary function The compiler examines argument used call determines call
It instantiates version function parameterizing type making equivalent following function This work whether argument integer string type expression sensible specifically type defined
Common inheritance needed set type used similar
A program defining custom data type use operator overloading define meaning type thus allowing use function template
While may seem minor benefit isolated example context comprehensive library like STL allows programmer get extensive functionality new data type defining operator
Merely defining allows type used standard algorithm put inside data structure heap associative array
template completely compile time
As demonstration standard type define operator strict order
Therefore fail compile error value
Likewise template rely applied data unless comparison form functor function provided

A used key unless comparison provided
Unfortunately compiler historically generate somewhat esoteric long unhelpful error message sort error
Ensuring certain object adheres alleviate issue
Languages use instead also use value key
The second kind template extends concept class
A class template specialization class
Class template often used make generic container
For example STL container
To make linked list integer one writes
A list string denoted
A set standard function associated work compatible parameterizing type
A powerful feature template
This allows alternative implementation provided based certain characteristic parameterized type instantiated
Template specialization two purpose allow certain form optimization reduce code bloat
For example consider template function
One primary activity function swap exchange value two container position
If value large term number byte take store often quicker first build separate list pointer object sort pointer build final sorted sequence
If value quite small however usually fastest swap value needed
Furthermore parameterized type already need build separate pointer array
Template specialization allows template creator write different implementation specify characteristic parameterized type must implementation used
Unlike function template class template
That mean alternate version class template code provided template parameter known leaving template parameter generic
This used example create default implementation assumes copying parameterizing type expensive create partial specialization type cheap copy thus increasing overall efficiency
Clients class template use specialization without needing know whether compiler used primary specialization partial specialization case
Class template also mean alternate implementation provided parameterizing type known
Some us template function previously filled legacy
For example possible macro Macros expanded compilation proper template expanded compile time
Macros always expanded inline template also expanded inline function compiler deems appropriate
Thus macro function template overhead
However template generally considered improvement macro purpose
Templates
Templates avoid common error found code make heavy use macro evaluating parameter side effect twice
Perhaps importantly template designed applicable much larger problem macro
There three primary drawback use template compiler support poor error message
Many compiler historically poor support template thus use template make code somewhat le portable
Support may also poor compiler used attempting use template across boundary
Most modern compiler however fairly robust standard template support new standard address issue
Almost compiler produce confusing long sometimes unhelpful error message error detected code us template
This make template difficult develop
Finally use template requires compiler generate separate templated class function every type parameter used
This necessary type size size data field important class work
So indiscriminate use template lead resulting excessively large executables
However judicious use template specialization derivation dramatically reduce code bloat case So derivation used reduce problem code replicated template used
This would involve deriving template ordinary class
This technique proved successful curbing code bloat real use
People use technique like found replicated code cost megabyte code space even moderate size program
In simple case template transformed generic causing code bloat creating class getting parameter derived type compile time wrapping template around class
It nice approach creating generic container
The extra instantiation generated template also cause debugger difficulty working gracefully template
For example setting debug breakpoint within template source file may either miss setting breakpoint actual instantiation desired may set breakpoint every place template instantiated
Also compiler need perform expansion template generate different instance compile time implementation source code templated class function must available
included header code using
Templated class function including much Standard Template Library STL included header file compiled
This contrast code may compiled binary providing declaration header file code using
This may disadvantage exposing implementing code remove abstraction could restrict use project
The support template based design
Most template idiom carry D without alteration D add additional functionality Templates D use different syntax whereas template parameter wrapped angular bracket D us exclamation sign parenthesis
This avoids due ambiguity comparison operator
If one parameter parenthesis omitted
Conventionally D combine feature provide using generic programming
For example input defined type satisfies check performed defined follows A function accepts input range use template template constraint In addition template metaprogramming D also provides several feature enable code generation Combining allows generating code based existing declaration
For example D serialization framework enumerate type member generate specialized function serialized type perform serialization deserialization
attribute could indicate serialization rule
The expression function execution also allow efficiently implementing
For example given function take string containing HTML template return equivalent D source code possible use following way Generic class part since original method language design
The foundation publication Eiffel use term describe creation use generic class
Generic class declared class name list one
In following code class one formal generic parameter The formal generic parameter placeholder arbitrary class name supplied declaration generic class made shown two class name
considered provide real class name substitute actual use
Within Eiffel type system although class considered class considered type
However generic derivation considered type
For list class shown actual generic parameter substituting available class
To constrain set class valid actual generic parameter chosen specified
In declaration class generic constraint dictate valid actual generic parameter class inherits class
The generic constraint ensures element fact sorted
Support added part
In Java generic checked compile time type correctness
The generic type information removed via process called maintain compatibility old JVM implementation making unavailable runtime
For example converted raw type
The compiler insert convert element type retrieved list reducing performance compared implementation template
Generics added part November based research prototype Microsoft Research started
Although similar generic Java generic apply implement generic first class mechanism runtime using
This design choice provides additional functionality allowing preservation generic type well alleviating limitation erasure unable create generic array
This also mean performance hit runtime normally expensive
When primitive value type used generic argument get specialized implementation allowing efficient generic method
As Java nested generic type Dictionary string List int valid type however advised member signature code analysis design rule
allows six variety generic type constraint using keyword including restricting generic type value type class constructor implement interface
Below example interface constraint The method allows operation array element generic type
The method type constraint indicates method applicable type implement generic interface
This ensures error method called type support comparison
The interface provides generic method
The method could also written without generic type simply using type
However since array casting would compiler may miss error would otherwise caught making use generic type
In addition method would need access array item object instead would require compare two element
For value type like type requires conversion although worked around using class done standard collection class
A notable behavior static member generic class static member instantiation per type see example
Object Pascal dialect acquired generic Delphi release initially discontinued compiler added native code one Delphi release
The semantics capability Delphi generic largely modelled generic though implementation necessity quite different
Here le direct translation first C example shown As C method well whole type one type parameter
In example TArray generic type defined language MakeAtLeast generic method
The available constraint similar available constraint C value type class specific class interface class parameterless constructor
Multiple constraint act additive union
implemented generic Delphi different syntax semantics
However work underway implement Delphi generic alongside native FPC one see
This allows Free Pascal programmer use generic whatever style prefer
Delphi Free Pascal example The mechanism support generic programming
Six predefined type class Haskell including type compared equality type whose value rendered string special property supporting This mean programmer defining new type state type instance one special type class without providing implementation class method usually necessary declaring class instance
All necessary method derived constructed automatically based structure type
For instance following declaration type state instance class This result equality function string representation function automatically defined type form provided support operation
The support derived instance make method generic qualitatively different way parametrically polymorphic function function accurately family function applied value various type although behave differently every argument type little work needed add support new type
Ralf Hinze shown similar effect achieved type class certain programming technique
Other researcher proposed approach kind genericity context Haskell extension Haskell discussed
PolyP first generic programming language extension
In PolyP generic function called
The language introduces special construct polytypic function defined via structural induction structure pattern functor regular datatype
Regular datatypes PolyP subset Haskell datatypes
A regular datatype must formal type argument definition recursive call must form
These restriction rule datatypes well nested datatypes recursive call different form
The flatten function PolyP provided example Generic Haskell another extension developed
The extension provides The resulting value specialised type
As example equality function Generic Haskell offer generic programming based PolyP generic Haskell supported GHC
It parametrizes kind offer overloading
The family programming language support generic programming generic called Both provide functors similar class template Ada generic package
syntactic abstraction also connection genericity fact superset templating à la

In special kind used refer one piece data provided input subroutine
These piece data called
An ordered list parameter usually included time subroutine called argument call assigned corresponding parameter
Just standard mathematical usage thus actual input passed function procedure routine whereas variable inside implementation subroutine
For example one defines subroutine parameter called argument
Note variable calling context argument subroutine called argument
See section information
In common case parameter act within subroutine variable initialized value argument isolated copy argument argument variable case
argument supplied caller affected action within called subroutine discussed
In call value one thus think argument value properly think argument argument general argument simply value
The semantics parameter declared argument passed parameter subroutine defined language detail represented particular computer system depend system
The following program defines function named one parameter named price
The type price double
number
The function return type also double
After function defined invoked follows In example function invoked
When happens assigned price function begin calculating result
The step producing result specified enclosed
indicates first thing multiply value price give mean function produce result
Therefore final result ignoring possible error one encounter representing decimal fraction format
The term sometimes used interchangeably context used distinguish meaning
The term sometimes called often used refer variable found function definition sometimes called refers actual input passed
For example one defines function parameter called argument
A parameter unbound variable argument thought value variable depending calling convention
In case call value one think argument value properly argument example equivalent call call reference one think argument variable calling context
Parameters appear procedure definition argument appear procedure call
In function definition variable parameter function call value argument function
Loosely parameter type argument instance
A parameter intrinsic property procedure included definition
For example many language procedure add two supplied integer together calculate sum would need two parameter one integer
In general procedure may defined number parameter parameter
If procedure parameter part definition specifies parameter called
By contrast argument value supplied procedure called
Unlike parameter form unchanging part procedure definition argument may vary call call
Each time procedure called part procedure call specifies argument called
Although parameter also commonly referred argument argument properly thought actual value reference assigned parameter variable subroutine called
When discussing code calling subroutine value reference passed subroutine argument place code value reference given
When discussing code inside subroutine definition variable subroutine parameter list parameter value parameter runtime argument
For example C dealing thread common pas argument type cast expected type To better understand difference consider following function written The function two parameter named
It add value passed parameter return result subroutine caller using technique automatically supplied C compiler
The code call function might look like The variable initialized value
argument function context
At runtime value assigned variable passed function argument
In function parameter evaluated yielding argument respectively
The value argument added result returned caller assigned variable
Because difference parameter argument possible supply inappropriate argument procedure
The call may supply many argument one argument may wrong type argument may supplied wrong order
Any situation cause mismatch parameter argument list procedure often return unintended answer generate
Within software development method language term distinct us established convention
The term used exclusively reference routine input term used exclusively type parameterization
Consider following routine definition The routine take two argument called routine
A call specifies shown
Parameters also thought either
used definition generic class
In example class declared generic class two formal generic parameter representing data interest representing hash key data When class becomes client formal generic parameter substituted
In following attribute declaration used character string based
As data key formal generic parameter substituted actual generic parameter type
In parameter must specified procedure declaration
Languages using attempt discover type automatically function body usage
Dynamically typed programming language defer type resolution
Weakly typed language perform little type resolution relying instead programmer correctness
Some language use special keyword
indicate subroutine parameter formal function take empty parameter list whose type rather
The exact mechanism assigning argument parameter called depends upon used parameter typically call value may specified using keywords
Some programming language allow explicitly implicitly given subroutine declaration
This allows caller omit argument calling subroutine
If default argument explicitly given value used provided caller
If default argument implicit sometimes using keyword language provides value zero empty string etc
value provided caller
PowerShell example Default argument seen special case argument list
Some language allow subroutine defined accept
For language subroutine must iterate list argument
PowerShell example Some programming subroutine
This allows calling code
It also provides flexibility caller often allowing order argument changed argument omitted needed
PowerShell example In function exactly one parameter
What thought function multiple parameter usually represented lambda calculus function take first argument return function take rest argument transformation known
Some programming language like follow scheme
In language every function exactly one parameter may look like definition function multiple parameter actually definition function return function etc
Function application language well lambda calculus look like application function multiple argument correctly evaluated function applied first argument resulting function applied second argument etc
An also known parameter used output rather usual use input
Using parameter call value parameter value reference output parameter idiom language notably C language support output parameter
Languages support output parameter include see since see various procedural extension see scripting language see
More precisely one may distinguish three type parameter often denoted
An input argument argument input parameter must value initialized variable literal must redefined assigned output argument must assignable variable need initialized existing value accessible must assigned value argument must initialized assignable variable optionally assigned value
The exact requirement enforcement vary language example output parameter assigned read even assignment removed remove need auxiliary accumulator variable
These analogous notion expression value assigned value assigned respectively though term specialized meaning In case input distinguished output considered specific use case input output supported
The default mode varies language Fortran default C SQL extension input default TScript parameter explicitly specified input output
Syntactically parameter mode generally indicated keyword function declaration C
Conventionally output parameter often put end parameter list clearly distinguish though always followed
TScript us different approach function declaration input parameter listed output parameter separated colon return type function function computes size text fragment Parameter mode form stating programmer intent allowing compiler catch error apply optimization necessarily imply parameter passing actually occurs
Notably input parameter implemented call value output parameter call reference straightforward way implement mode language without support always implemented
This distinction discussed detail emphasizes parameter mode abstracted parameter passing mechanism reference copy actually implemented
For instance C input parameter default keyword passed value output parameter passed reference input parameter passed reference output parameter default passed value result copied back passed reference using compiler hint
A syntactically similar construction output parameter assign variable name function
This found Pascal example This semantically different called function simply evaluated passed variable calling scope store output
The primary use output parameter return multiple value function use parameter modify state using parameter passing rather shared environment global variable
An important use returning multiple value solve returning value error status see
For example return two variable function C one may write input parameter output parameter passed reference
A common use case C related language function place return value output variable return boolean corresponding whether function succeeded
An archetypal example method especially C par string integer returning success failure
This following signature may used follows Similar consideration apply returning value one several possible type return value specify type value stored one several output variable
Another use avoid assigning local variable function needing copy returning
This done output parameter implemented
For example instead usual one might instead write function need assign space object copy returning
Output parameter often discouraged modern programming essentially awkward confusing commonplace return value considerably easier understand work
Notably output parameter involve function side effect modifying output parameter semantically similar reference confusing pure function value distinction output parameter parameter subtle
Further since common programming style parameter simply input parameter output parameter parameter unusual hence susceptible misunderstanding
Output parameter prevent function composition since output stored variable rather value expression
Thus one must initially declare variable step chain function must separate statement
For example following function composition written output parameter instead becomes output parameter parameter In special case function single output parameter return value function composition possible output parameter address also returned function case becomes There various alternative use case output parameter
For returning multiple value function alternative return
Syntactically clearer automatic sequence unpacking used Python For returning value one several type used instead common case return value null indicate failure
For exception handling one return nullable type raise exception
For example Python one might either idiomatically The requiring local variable copying return using output variable also applied conventional function return value sufficiently sophisticated compiler
The usual alternative output parameter C related language return single data structure containing return value
For example given structure encapsulating width height one write In language instead using parameter one often use passing reference object mutating object though changing object variable refers

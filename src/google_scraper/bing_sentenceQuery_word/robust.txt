In ability computer system cope error execution cope erroneous input
Robustness encompass many area computer science
Formal technique essential showing robustness since type testing involves invalid unexpected input
Alternatively used test robustness
Various commercial product perform robustness testing software analysis
In general building robust system encompass every point possible failure difficult vast quantity possible input input combination
Since input input combination would require much time test developer run case exhaustively
Instead developer try generalize case
For example imagine inputting
Some selected input might consist negative number zero positive number
When using number test software way developer generalizes set real three number
This efficient manageable method prone failure
Generalizing test case example one technique deal failure due invalid user input
Systems generally may also fail due reason well disconnecting network
Regardless complex system still handle error encountered gracefully
There many example successful system
Some robust system evolvable easily adapted new situation
Programs software tool focused specific task thus generalized flexible
However observation system demonstrate adaptation environment
One way biological system adapt environment use redundancy
Many organ redundant human
The one example
generally need one kidney second kidney allows room failure
This principle may taken apply software challenge
When applying principle redundancy computer science blindly adding code suggested
Blindly adding code introduces error make system complex render harder understand
Code provide reinforcement already existing code unwanted
The new code must instead posse equivalent function broken another providing function replace
To new code must know accommodate failure point
This mean need added system
But system add logic increase size becomes complex
Thus making redundant system system also becomes complex developer must consider balancing redundancy complexity
Currently computer science practice focus building robust system
Rather tend focus
One main reason focus robustness today hard general way
Robust programming style programming focus handling unexpected termination unexpected action
It requires code handle termination action gracefully displaying accurate unambiguous
These error message allow user easily debug program
When building software programmer assumes user break code
The programmer also assumes written code may fail work incorrectly
The programmer assumes user try incorrect bogus malformed input
As consequence programmer return user unambiguous intuitive error message require looking error code
The error message try accurate possible without misleading user problem fixed ease
Users gain access data structure
This information hidden user user accidentally modify introduce bug code
When correctly built user use without finding loophole modify interface
The interface already correctly implemented user need make modification
The user therefore focus solely code
Very often code modified may introduce possibility impossible case occurs
Impossible case therefore assumed highly unlikely instead
The developer think handle case highly unlikely implement handling accordingly
Robust machine learning typically refers robustness machine learning algorithm
For machine learning algorithm considered robust either testing error consistent training error performance stable adding noise dataset
Robust network design study network design face variable uncertain demand
In sense robustness network design broad like robustness software design vast possibility change input

The purpose find general definition robustness analysis web design system development process
Research currently robustness measure analysis definition used large software development operating system
Then considers one currently definition might appropriate robustness web design Failure Modes Effects Analysis identify measure robustness web system based Jacobson analysis method model component web design system
Keywords Robustness Jacobson analysis web design Failure Modes Effects Analysis FMEA
Introduction Along information technology especially rapid development computer technology tremendous change network era brought website emerged
Meanwhile many reason may lead web site work
Systemically make difficult check problem
However web site designed use measure analysis variety problem may lead crash web site important
Not improve robustness web site also ability cope unexpected situation order make web site stable robust
In computer science clear definition robustness easy given especially noted reliability
But ability deal error execution system
It regarded measurement criterion apart basic property safety stability functionality robustness overall web site also important
In process web design robustness measure discussed order enhance overall web site word still could keep stable execution component web site work unexpected circumstance

Main Part What robustness
There explanation robustness need discussed first
When word used computer science advert computer application show usual condition also uncommon condition emphasis expectation designer
Productions made computer web site typically buggy
include error fragile therefore robust
It difficult programmer find fix error
Second one elegant way distinguish reliability robustness way look type error
From perspective web design reliability problem often caused internal error website component
Robustness problem often caused external error unexpected input
After making clear two concept feature error robustness developed corresponding measure
Definitions measure robustness The success criterion case system crash hang robust
Fuzz testing Fuzz testing simple technology effect quality code
In fuzz testing generates bad data randomly attack application programmer observes break
The technique fuzz testing illogical automatic test speculate data lead damaged like manual testing
Instead test clutter application data deeply much possible
The result maybe lead programmer shock logical thinking person would think kind error
It simple announce important bug application
How work
Realization fuzz testing simple process

Prepare correct file insert program

Generate random data replace part file

Observe break
Disadvantages First generally fuzz testing find simple error
Second bug found severe sometimes fuzz testing popular world real attacker use tool develop destructive program
Third randomly input catch boundary value condition difficult
Ballista Ballista approach make operating system crash get exceptional parameter parameter used system call make software get irregular termination instead denoting error gracefully
It box testing
The goal Ballista test robustness existing component
The result apply class wide range software component
But generally best situation work module take input parameter list
How work
Ballista approach start bombard application module combination exceptional unexceptional input value
The response system measured operating system failure task task
OS failure generally form machine reboot detected watchdog timer detected inspecting irregular termination child process
Ballista us list test case run large number input
Disadvantage Ballista successful testing approach often used operating system web design
It also need specific drive workload call kernel function
Therefore easy expanded
Another disadvantage Ballista difficult generate test case valid invalid test data must generated input generator
JCrasher JCrasher approach test robustness Java program
It inspects type java class construct code fragment create instance different type test public method random test data
It used examine bug caused program program crash throw undeclared runtime exception
It require regulation except offline testing case caused crash
Disadvantage The rewrite class could exist separate compile phase instead load time
It disadvantage JCrasher support dynamic loading
FMEA Failure mode effect analysis Failure mode effect analysis FMEA procedure analysis potential failure mode within system classification severity likelihood failure
It developed three main phase severity occurrence detection
They determined grade robustness system
Before starting use EMEA important work need done first confirms robustness included analysis
Advantages
Analysis improves safety reliability robustness product

Reduces potential robustness concern

Detects identifies eliminates potential problem early
New idea web design Robustness concern unexpected domain
To improve robustness measure taken either enlarge scope specification make sure stability system unexpected situation
FMEA might appropriate measuring robustness web design
Because used robustness analysis specification web design result outlined therefore designer clearly understand problem find corresponding solution
On hand fuzz testing JCrasher widely used large software development programming language web design JSP Java service page JCrasher used measuring robustness java part web developing
Ballista normally strongly used operating system
The robustness web site important
Because web system assessed HTTP protocol difficult control input user
The web system must tolerance unexpected error user input
Preparatory work Before applying FMEA two essential work needed
First model robustness component web design
Second design worksheet
Model robustness component One best case diagram method Jacobson analysis
To design robust web model process web system develop code important
Here used analysis formed web product diagram robustness diagram design
The diagram combined class diagram activity diagram
The part gap robustness diagram
There several feature
It used help developer ensure correctness use case
It used ensure use case contain necessary branch process thereby providing correctness check
It used reduce gap analysis design ultimately complete preliminary design
The Jacobson use case diagram us three stereotype element
Entity object usually real world class domain model

Boundary object used interactive user system
Normally contains frame diagonal menu typically screen web page

Control object used connect boundary object boundary object
Boundary object entity object noun object controller verb action
And four interactive rule three stereotype element design robustness diagram

Nouns connect verb vice versa
Nouns connect noun

Verbs connect verb
According rule component web design designed robustness diagram
For example component web design web login system developer draw diagram analysis working processing existing component system
Generally hard find page login page boundary object according analysis text use case
And system provides input checking branch process thus controller object
System display error message therefore another controller object
System search database find information form user information form information entity object user information controller object
Finally robustness case shown
Once developer finished robustness analysis need Preliminary Design Review
The session Preliminary Design Review help developer ensure robustness diagram domain model use case text match
After robustness analysis developer could continue next step detailed design writing code
Design worksheet When robustness diagram analysis developer could create worksheet continue analysis measure worksheet contains important information system
All item function worksheet listed logical manner
The purpose FMEA explore possible failure mode control object model external operating environment
user input likelihood detection possibility severity impact robustness requirement web system
It also used control object
Results usually introduced specially designed worksheet
Example FMEA Worksheet login part Control object Failure mode System Effect S Severity rating Possible Cause O occurrence rating D detection rating CRIT critical characteristic RPN risk priority number Recommended action Login control No response produced Fail respond user interaction
Prevent use system
Error user database contains data N Control user input prevent serious error object
Understand parameter table
Severity rating crash effect stand risk stand critical
occurrence rating similarly range based web design specification detection rating value mean ability detect failure
risk priority Numbers calculated formula RPN S x O x The highest severity failure mode might necessarily treated firstly rather highest RPN treated
RPN regarded metric robustness system robustness improved developer solve highest RPN
There several goal achieved
Classify robustness critical element part application logic easy failure crash external error abnormal situation

Rank priority possible reason cause failure robustness

Establish prevention measure either eliminate possible cause reduce effect web robustness

Conclusion Seldom method analysis measure robustness web design
FMEA could establish requirement minimize possibility failure order improve robustness web system
And measure component web system might fail failure affect system function
But cost much time analysis web product component web product need analysis
But ensures potential error affect whole web system
Although method based basis practical application often apply real development process
The mathematical evaluation system robustness could make result clear
FMEA used process web design formed web product
For large web product development FMEA might appropriate measure analysis product

Matt Bishop Department Computer Science University California Davis Davis CA Robust programming also called style programming prevents abnormal termination unexpected action
Basically requires code handle bad invalid absurd input reasonable way
If internal error occurs program library terminates gracefully provides enough information programmer debug program routine
This handout discus principle coding give detailed example right
Our example library managing queue FIFO list number
This allows example consider parameter global variable
The principle apply program also specifically input parameter equivalent environment like global variable
A robust program differs program adherence following four principle
Do trust anything generate
Whenever someone us program library routine assume try break
When call another function check succeeds
Most importantly assume code problem program defensively problem detected quickly possible

Assume caller user idiot read manual page documentation
Program code write handle incorrect bogus malformed input parameter reasonable fashion reasonable defined environment
For example print error message message require user look error code manual
If return error code caller example library routine make error code unambiguous detailed
Also soon detect problem take corrective action stop
This keep error propagating
Part problem week likely forgotten detail program may call incorrectly give bogus input
This programming style also form defensive programming

A dangerous implement anything routine expect remain consistent across call
For example standard library content FILE structure allocated file expected remain fixed across call standard library
That make dangerous implement
Do let user gain access
They might accidentally deliberately modify data data structure causing library function fail badly
Never return pointer index array always hide true address index using something called token
Hiding data structure also make program library modular
For example queue manager us array represent queue
This give maximum size
You might decide linked list would suitable want rewrite routine
If properly designed interface hidden much information data possible calling program need changed however neglected style information hiding information abstraction program correctly function current representation might break changed representation caller assumed queue element sequential integer location example
As old saw go never say
Impossible case rarely often merely highly unlikely
Think case handled implement type handling
In worst case check think impossible print error message occurs
After modify code repeatedly likely one modification affect part code cause inconsistent effect may lead impossible case occurring

Relate informal description principle robust programming formal principle good programming style cohesion coupling information abstraction information hiding good documentation
The point exercise show robust program arise writing code good style learn school useful
Robust programming defensive defensive nature protects program use routine also
Programming mathematics error occur
Good programming assumes take step detect report error internal well external
Beware everything even code
This library implement queue straightforward way
It typical many C programmer would write
It also fragile code
We analyze detail support statement
The library handle number queue queue created pointer returned caller
Three entry point provided creating deleting queue adding element queue deleting element queue
All file calling routine must include header file defines queue structure
Reviewing structure library function illuminate problem fragile code show usual C coding style fragile
The file defines queue structure maximum number element queue
Because program calling queue function must pas pointer queue structure must visible calling procedure need know structure define queue pointer type QUEUE
Hence file must included program call queue library function
The header file contains As indicated queue management function This organization provides first evidence fragility
The caller use pointer QUEUE structure layout structure location known caller bypass queue library obtain data queue directly alter information queue information library us manage queue
For example one wanted change number element queue without calling queue management function one say pointer relevant queue expression new value assigned queue counter
So problem including header file caller file The first function control creation deletion stack Glancing see us logical cohesion parameter indicates two distinct logically separate operation performed
The operation could written separate function
That routine poor cohesion speak well robustness
Consider parameter list calling sequence
The parameter integer indicates whether queue created deleted zero
The parameter give maximum number integer allowed queue
Suppose caller interchanged two The routine would detect error allocate queue room element rather
This ease confusion parameter first problem one checked easily
Next consider argument
When mean create queue mean delete queue
For function intention mean create mean delete coding style changed allow value mean create
But little connection create delete
So psychologically programmer may remember number use cause queue destroyed created
Using would help library compiled program library simply loaded help element translated integer type checking done
The first parameter pointer pointer necessary value returned parameter list C function argument passed value
Passing pointer provides call reference mechanism
However call reference usually us singly indirect pointer doubly indirect pointer used programmer make mistake specifically pas singly indirect pointer
In general better avoid call reference necessary use multiple level indirection unless absolutely necessary
The third set problem arises failure check parameter
First look queue creation
Suppose invalid pointer
Then line containing cause segmentation fault
Also suppose
What happens queue allocated second
If return pointer universal
If negative result implementation dependent may cause segmentation violation
In either case result unpredictable
Now look queue deletion
The parameter irrelevant suppose
Then result undefined may result segmentation fault
Worse imagine parameter instead meaningless address
This almost impossible catch call cause segmentation violation lucky odd behavior afterwards
The calling sequence checked either
Suppose one deletes queue creating This would either cause segmentation violation called releasing unallocated memory latter case program probably crash later little indication
Again problem qmanage check qptr refers valid queue
However subtle variation problem Now queue deleted twice
Attempting space already deallocated cause undefined action usually segmentation violation
Consider body routine
What happens either fails return
The subsequent reference fault reference pointer
Hence One subtle problem arises overflow
Consider expression first call
Suppose size integer byte common value
Then expression evaluates
On bit machine overflow likely produce value
Such flaw likely cause problem call cause program produce segmentation fault seemingly unrelated place later
Overflow underflow floating point calculation pernicious nasty problem watch

The obvious way test overflow multiply absolute value see result smaller overflow occurred
Does always work
What problem introduce
think architecture allowing arithmetic overflow cause trap
Suggest alternate method without problem
This function add element queue
It add index head element current count modulo queue size place new element location increment count Two basic problem arise
First qptr parameter checked ensure refers valid queue may refer queue deleted random memory may
Any cause problem caller lucky problem arise routine caller unlucky symptom appear later program indication caused
As offshoot suppose valid
Then routine work correctly Second suppose queue full equal
If function called overwrite head queue
There check overflowing queue doubtless author assumed would never happen
A sophisticated problem placing trust value queue structure
The integrity queue structure depends consistency field
If increase call routine think queue allocated space actually leading segmentation fault
If decrease call element might lost

Write program demonstrates decreasing call cause element previously added queue become inaccessible
Describe problem arise value changed across call
Given accessibility queue structure element caller element may change accidentally deliberately
Taking element queue begin getting element index
Then count decremented incremented modulo The parameter problem described previous section exist may invalid point invalid queue
Moreover may also invalid integer pointer
So Here
danger underflow overflow
Suppose element queue
The value returned garbage set bogus value
Hence The problem variable consistency across call occurs routine also

What problem might invalid pointer cause
Specifically suppose call The library content presented section fragile code
Among flaw All flaw make library susceptible failure
In section study alternate implementation library
This version however robust performs sanity checking attempt anticipate problem handle gracefully
If library recover return error code caller indicating problem
This code complex write caller rely make debugging calling application much simpler
The queue structure unavailable caller need define two item structure interface
We deal interface first
The object caller us represent queue called
If make token pointer structure user able manipulate data structure directly
Hence need mechanism indexing array obvious solution
However use simple index user refer queue high degree certainty getting valid queue
So instead use function index range function
Thus represent queue entry array queue token invertible mathematical function index
In addition must prevent dangling reference problem program reference queue A queue deleted
Suppose programmer us library create queue Queue A subsequently deleted queue B created queue B happens occupy slot array queue queue A
A subsequent reference queue A token get queue B
To avoid problem associate queue unique integer called merge token
In example queue might nonce queue B might nonce
The token queue A token queue B
As value differ reference queue A detected rejected
We choose function following usual C operator
We emphasize however function invertible either argument acceptable
In usual C operator
This simplifies interface considerably cost assuming quantity greater
Fortunately system datatype supporting integer length
So header file put With token defined calling routine need know nothing internal structure
The second issue error handle
We print error message take action possibly even terminating return error result allow caller handle error set special error handler language support typically written trap exception handler
Unfortunately C provide exception handler error
The method returning error code caller allows much greater flexibility handling error routine equally simple perform
The complication set error code must indicate error could occur
So proceed library shall track error define error code
We make decision library function purpose
The return value indicate whether error occurred function return error code expository message buffer
If return flag indicating error
So define error code negative Like UNIX system variable set error cleared success
The buffer contain additional information routine error occurred relevant number
The following macro aid process These defined format message placed function call library use
We also redefine function interface eliminate low cohesion routine This eliminates use flag variable manage creation deletion
In file place definition queue structure related variable We made one change queue definition queue fixed size
This simplicity see exercise
Also globals declared accessible function outside library file
We distinguish queue queue
The former field set queue exists contains element latter relevant element set queue exist

The macro use format error message
What problem function guard
Why ignore problem library

What problem static allocation space queue content queue introduce
What advantage
One function internal library creates token index another take token validates return appropriate index
These separate routine need able change token representation library ported system without quantity store token
Or may prefer modify mathematical function involved
In either case increase cohesion decrease coupling laudable goal software engineering maintenance
perspective
In follows offset added index element initial nonce
Both defined Here function generate token The function declared function library may access
Rather return value parameter list compute token return function value
This allows u return error code well since token always positive error code always negative
The single parameter index token computed
The next statement check value parameter case must valid array index inclusive
As parameter unsigned upper bound need checked
This may seem excessive function called within library ca ensure parameter always expected range
The principle ca happen applies
We indeed assure index always lie within range suppose someone else one day modifies code make error
That error could cause library fail
So best program defensively
If error occurs identified precisely
Two technique combined
The first error message giving name routine exact description problem
It available caller
The second return value indicating error specifically internal inconsistency The calling routine must detect error act accordingly
The error code indicates internal inconsistency error indicates another library routine calling incorrectly
An error message code simply indicating error occurred would le helpful would know error occurred depending error message
The next statement add offset index
As upper half number must fit bit signed number
The code check requirement met
Again met detailed error message given

Explain check work detail

The code us mask comparison instead using
Why mask bit instead

The check similar us mask
Explain need use
The routine break token component part check queue similar The argument function token representing queue purpose function validate token return corresponding index
The first section derives index number token check first index legal index queue index
If either fails appropriate error message given
Notice error code simply indicates problem parameter although message distinguishes two
As caller library supplied token bogus token internal error
So use another error code indicate problem Next check queue index token queue token refers
This dangling reference problem mentioned earlier
The current queue token stored queue structure simply ensure current token queue token
If handle error appropriately
The last section code check internal consistency
The goal detect problem internal queue library
The consistency check When detected routine report error
An alternate approach favored expert make code conditionally compilable omit production version
They either use surround code use macro
This save space library provided production make tracking problem difficult occur production software le information provided development environment
The macro described manual Its argument expression expression evaluated
If expression false macro writes message standard error abort program force core dump debugging purpose
For example internal consistency checking code could replaced If middle expression false error message would If constant defined macro empty effect deleted program

The macro abort program condition fails
It applies theory library internally inconsistent entire set queue trusted
The method allow caller attempt recover
Which better
When
The routine creates queue The parameter list routine empty information returned function value
An alternate approach would pas QTICKET back parameter list declaration return value error code
But lead confusion
Some library routine require pointer argument others
Programmers may become confused suffer memory lapse routine require pointer
The routine guard potential problem
Making parameter pointer suitable
First pointer difficult check validity one check pointer one portably determine pointer contains address process address space address properly aligned quantity stored system notably RISC system cause alignment fault terminate program
Using style programming akin functional programming language avoids problem
This routine check room another queue determines index queue report error return error code
The error code returned calling routine part library In error message supply helpful information namely maximum number queue allowed
This enables programmer know routine failed tailor code accordingly
The next part allocates space queue
Again routine check failure report happen
Again special error code used
This special importance since failure usually due system call failure print informative message caller may desire
The queue library error indicator The routine obtains token new queue checking failure
If token obtained new queue deleted error returned
No error message provided token generator provides
Finally quantity queue structure set default value indicating empty queue token returned
This way need worry initialization later library might harder determine initialization needed

If token ca generated error message come indication routine called
Write macro append error message
Remember check bound problem append content
This routine deletes queue
This routine take parameter token queue deleted
It determines token valid return error code
Thus queue created one already deleted report error
The queue freed
The entry array reset indicate element array available reassignment

The statement protected check see whether
Is bug
If need make check

What prevents caller deleting queue twice
Adding element queue requires placed tail The variable parameter list pointer passed value
As validity token first checked build error message code token valid error simply returned
Adding element queue requires checking queue full
The first part statement
The error message give maximum number element queue hold
If queue full appropriate error code generated We remove element head queue Here must distinguish return value error code return value come queue
The solution check error buffer
Before function called first byte array set NUL byte
If return error buffer contains string length greater error occurred returned value error code otherwise error occurred
So calling sequence This way need pas pointer parameter list
The disadvantage method complexity calling function however seems small price pay avoid possible segmentation fault within library
The standard library function us similar technique distinguish failure success case

Rewrite use second parameter return value removed queue parameter
Use error code defined report invalid pointer
The function value error code
Compare contrast approach one used version
When would use

How use distinguish failure success
The rest routine similar
We check parameter validate queue
We next check empty queue report error queue empty If empty return element head queue
The index incremented move next element queue becomes element head queue
The routine give several example difference robust fragile coding
The routine robust crashed poor incorrect call inconsistency caller
They form module informational cohesion stamp coupling latter share data common variable specifically
While coding version routine take time fragile routine take much le debug require le debugging time application using routine

Rewrite library allocate space queue dynamically
Specifically change take parameter maximum number element allowed queue
Allocate space queue array dynamically

Rewrite library use linked list structure queue
What advantage disadvantage
Many security problem arise fragile coding
The UNIX operating system C standard library encourage
They provide library call cause severe problem example check buffer overflow
Avoid routine

Why following function avoided writing robust code
How would modify make acceptable

When member family function avoided writing robust code
What use instead
Chip Elliott Dartmouth College later BBN Communications provided inspiration
His handout Writing Code Dartmouth COSC Introduction Software Engineering class succinctly described many principle technique I extended
Thanks Kim Knowles constructive suggestion document
Also student ECS ECS UC Davis helped refine exposition asking question indicating difficult understand
I hope document clear certainly clearer earlier version

Robustness property strong healthy constitution
When transposed system refers ability tolerating perturbation might affect system functional body
In line defined ability resist change without adapting initial stable configuration
Robustness small refers situation wherein perturbation small magnitude considers small magnitude hypothesis difficult verify small large depends specific problem
Conversely Robustness large problem refers situation wherein assumption made magnitude perturbation either small large
It discussed robustness two dimension resistance avoidance
In different context robustness may refer

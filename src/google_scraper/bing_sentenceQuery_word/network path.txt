A general form specifies unique location
A path point file system location following directory tree hierarchy expressed path component separated delimiting character represent directory
The delimiting character commonly character colon though may use different
Paths used extensively represent relationship common modern operating system essential construction URLs
Resources represented either
Multics first introduced hierarchical file system directory separated
Around Unix introduced slash character directory separator
In first version Microsoft DOS released
support file directory
Also major portion utility command packaged came IBM command line syntax used slash character prefix
For example run command wide list format option
This use slash still found command interface Windows
By contrast Unix us dash character command line switch prefix
When directory support added version kept switch prefix character backwards compatibility
Microsoft chose backslash character directory separator look similar slash character
An path point location file system regardless current
To must include
By contrast path start given working directory avoiding need provide full absolute path
A considered relative path based current working directory
If working directory file result file addressed name
note also used reference root current user library current working directory respectively
When filesystems filename extension mounted
character changed example
note prefix may number boot volume AppleShare home directory Japanese Korean version Windows may often display character character instead directory separator
In case code backslash drawn character
Very early version replaced backslash glyph display make possible display program understood character square bracket replaced well see
Although even first version Windows supported character set Yen sign modern version Windows support Won sign much software continue display backslashes found ASCII file way preserve backwards compatibility
derivative UNIX us UNIX path internally
However preserve compatibility software familiarity user many portion GUI switch typed user internally switch back displaying filename entered user also changed inverse translation happen
The Microsoft Windows short specifies common syntax describe location network resource shared file directory printer
The UNC syntax Windows system generic form Microsoft often refers
Some Microsoft Windows interface also allow require UNC syntax share access rather URL
The UNC syntax extended optional component denote use SSL port number WebDAV URL becomes When viewed remotely SharedFolder may name different program server see opening
Instead SharedFolder name consists arbitrary name assigned folder defining sharing
Some Microsoft Windows interface also accept Long UNC Microsoft Windows us following type path In version Windows prior Windows XP APIs accept Long UNC could accept character
The allows path name character long
Since UNCs start two backslashes backslash also used string escaping result extreme case escaped string regular expression matching UNC begin backslashes string regular expression require escaping
This simplified using C Python regular expression literal Perl
Most system use similar syntax
allows treating path beginning two slash manner though case system must treat multiple slash single slash
Many application system example use resource definition like service name The following worked example discus behavior would appear terminal terminal application window Attached current working directory cwd One want change current working directory At moment desired represented short absolute path directory Given relative path directory wanted following may typed change current working directory bobapples Two dot point upwards indicate one dot represents current directory
Both component complex relative path alone first component relative path represents
Using refer file current working directory sometimes usefully distinguish resource found default directory mean example view specific version instead one installed system
Contrary popular belief accepts slash thus Unix example work
But many application Windows interpret slash purpose treat invalid character thus require enter backslash notably shell often called terminal typically run terminal window
Note many shell available Windows allow slash
In addition indicate single root instead root current disk
Indicating file disk current one requires prefixing drive letter colon
No ambiguity ensues colon valid character filename thus one file called A current directory
UNC name path starting support slash
The following example show path backslashes used match common syntax This path point file name located directory turn located root directory drive
This path refers file called located parent directory current directory drive
This path denotes file called located directory turn located directory located current directory current drive since example give
This rather simple path point file named located current directory since path lack current drive since drive specification present
This path refers first
This example us path containing slash directory separator
The command redirects content file command
A path containing forward slash often need surrounded double quote disambiguate
CD drive letter Files work root drive letter directory
This appears treat forward slash
For example work Also root folder would treated If relative path directory name specified forward slash get following error For setting environment variable sometimes necessary provide path contain space instance defined C cause script halt encounter space path name
To get name Windows assigns directory substitution environment variable use directory listing command option one level target directory
For instance following get eight character name directory directly root

Often network certain attribute calculated analyze property characteristic network
These network property often define used analyze certain model contrast
Many definition term used network science found
The size network refer number node le commonly number edge range tree complete graph
The density network defined ratio number edge number possible edge network node given giving Another possible equation whereas tie unidirectional Wasserman Faust
This give better overview network density unidirectional relationship measured
The density network intersection edge defined ratio number edge number possible edge network node given graph intersecting edge giving The degree node number edge connected
Closely related density network average degree
In ER random graph model compute probability two node connected
Average path length calculated finding shortest path pair node adding dividing total number pair

As another mean measuring network graph define diameter network longest calculated shortest path network
It shortest distance two distant node network
In word shortest path length every node node calculated diameter longest calculated path length
The diameter representative linear size network
The clustering coefficient measure property
This sometimes described friend friend friend
More precisely clustering coefficient node ratio existing link connecting node neighbor maximum possible number link
The clustering coefficient entire network average clustering coefficient node
A high clustering coefficient network another indication
The clustering coefficient node number neighbour node number connection neighbour
The maximum possible number connection neighbor The way network connected play large part network analyzed interpreted
Networks classified four different category Centrality index produce ranking seek identify important node network model
Different centrality index encode different context word importance
The example considers node highly important form bridge many node
The contrast considers node highly important many highly important node link
Hundreds measure proposed literature
Centrality index accurate identifying central node
The measure seldom ever meaningful remainder network node
Also indication accurate within assumed context importance tend get wrong context
For example imagine two separate community whose link edge junior member community
Since transfer one community must go link two junior member high betweenness centrality
But since junior presumably connection important node community meaning eigenvalue centrality would quite low
The concept centrality context static network extended based empirical theoretical research dynamic centrality context temporal network
Limitations centrality measure led development general measure
Two example us diversity random walk measure accessible rest network given start node derived expected value generated node
Both measure meaningfully computed structure network alone
Network model serve foundation understanding interaction within empirical complex network
Various generation model produce network structure may used comparison complex network
The named used generating edge set node equal probability
It used prove existence graph satisfying various property provide rigorous definition mean property hold almost graph
To generate model two parameter must specified number node graph generated probability link formed two node
A constant may derived two component formula expected number edge
The model several interesting characteristic comparison graph
Because model generated without bias particular node degree distribution binomial nature regard formula Also result characteristic clustering coefficient tends
The model tends form giant component situation process called
The average path length relatively short model tends
The random graph generation model produce graph
An initial lattice structure used generate model
Each node network initially linked closest neighbor
Another parameter specified rewiring probability
Each edge probability rewired graph random edge
The expected number rewired link model
As model begin lattice structure high clustering coefficient along high average path length
Each rewire likely create shortcut highly connected cluster
As rewiring probability increase clustering coefficient decrease slower average path length
In effect allows average path length network decrease significantly slightly decrease clustering coefficient
Higher value p force rewired edge effect make model random network
The random network model used demonstrate preferential attachment effect
In model edge likely attach node higher degree
The network begin initial network node
degree node initial network least otherwise always remain disconnected rest network
In BA model new node added network one time
Each new node connected existing node probability proportional number link existing node already
Formally probability new node connected node degree node
Heavily linked node hub tend quickly accumulate even link node link unlikely chosen destination new link
The new node preference attach already heavily linked node
The degree distribution resulting BA model scale free particular power law form Hubs exhibit high betweenness centrality allows short path exist node
As result BA model tends short average path length
The clustering coefficient model also tends
While diameter D many model including Erdős Rényi random graph model several small world network proportional log N BA model exhibit ultrasmall world
Note average path length scale N diameter
In new node coming edge pick existing connected node random connects one neighbor chosen also random
The probability node existing node picked The factor inverse harmonic mean IHM degree neighbor node
Extensive numerical investigation suggest approximately mean IHM value large limit becomes constant mean
It implies higher link degree node higher chance gaining link since reached larger number way mediator essentially embodies intuitive idea rich get richer mechanism preferential attachment rule model
Therefore MDA network seen follow PA rule disguise
However describes winner take mechanism find almost total node degree one one degree
As value increase disparity super rich poor decrease find transition rich get super richer rich get richer mechanism
Another model key ingredient nature vertex introduced Caldarelli et al
Here link created two vertex probability given linking function vertex involved
The degree vertex given If invertible increasing function probability distribution given As result fitness distributed power law also node degree
Less intuitively fast decaying probability distribution together linking function kind constant Heavyside function also obtain network
Such model successfully applied describe trade nation using GDP fitness various node linking function kind examines structure relationship social entity
These entity often person may also
Since empirical study network played central role social science many tool used studying network first developed
Amongst many application social network analysis used understand news rumor
Similarly used examine spread
It also applied used examine role trust social mechanism setting price
Similarly used study recruitment social organization
It also used conceptualize scientific disagreement well academic prestige
More recently network analysis close cousin gained significant use military intelligence uncovering insurgent network hierarchical nature

Dynamic Network Analysis focus composed multiple type node entity
These entity highly varied
Examples include people organization topic resource task event location belief
Dynamic network technique particularly useful assessing trend change network time identification emergent leader examining people idea
With recent explosion publicly available high throughput biological data analysis molecular network gained significant interest
The type analysis content closely related social network analysis often focusing local pattern network
For example small subgraphs network
similar pattern attribute node edge network represented given network structure

These random jump find website might found normal search methodology
In improvement aforementioned formula determining PageRank includes adding random jump component
Without random jump page would receive PageRank would good
The first probability random jump occur
Contrasting damping factor
Another way looking Information relative importance node edge graph obtained measure widely used discipline like
Centrality measure essential network analysis answer question Which node network targeted ensure message information spread node network
conversely Which node targeted curtail spread disease
Formally established measure centrality
The objective network analysis generally determines type centrality measure used
Content spread via two major method conserved spread spread
In conserved spread total amount content enters complex network remains constant pass
The model conserved spread best represented pitcher containing fixed amount water poured series funnel connected tube
Here pitcher represents original source water content spread
The funnel connecting tubing represent node connection node respectively
As water pass one funnel another water disappears instantly funnel previously exposed water
In spread amount content change enters pass complex network
The model spread best represented continuously running faucet running series funnel connected tube
Here amount water original source infinite Also funnel exposed water continue experience water even pass successive funnel
The model suitable explaining transmission
In Kermack McKendrick created model considered fixed population three compartment susceptible infected recovered
The compartment used model consist three class The flow model may considered follows Using fixed population Kermack McKendrick derived following equation Several assumption made formulation equation First individual population must considered equal probability every individual contracting disease rate considered contact infection rate disease
Therefore infected individual make contact able transmit disease others per unit time fraction contact infected susceptible
The number new infection unit time per infective giving rate new infection leaving susceptible category Brauer
For second third equation consider population leaving susceptible class equal number entering infected class
However number equal fraction represents mean recovery rate mean infective period infectives leaving class per unit time enter removed class
These process occur simultaneously referred widely accepted idea rate contact two group population proportional size group concerned Daley Gani
Finally assumed rate infection recovery much faster time scale birth death therefore factor ignored model

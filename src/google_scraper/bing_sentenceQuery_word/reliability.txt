In everyday language use word reliable mean something dependable give behave predictably every time
We might talk football player reliable meaning give good performance game game
In science idea similar definition much narrower
Reliability property measure tool test sometimes whole experiment
It estimation much random error might score around true score
For example might try weigh bowl flour kitchen scale
A reliable scale show reading matter many time weigh bowl
There may slight error may notice reading differ fraction gram overall scale reliable
If scale gave reading kg minute later gave reading kg error become large instrument reliability seriously undermined
When talk instrument necessarily mean physical instrument strip
An educational test assigning quantitative score behavior also instrument
Another way looking reliability considering way maximize inherent repeatability Reliability determined statistically calculating correlation coefficient
If test reliable show high positive correlation repeat score
If use three replicate sample one generates completely different result others likely something wrong
For experiment natural phenomenon result follow always chance sample group produce result one extreme
Using multiple sample group smooth extreme generate accurate spread result
But result continue wildly different likely something wrong
In case entire experiment unreliable
Good experimental design allow plenty replicate sample researcher
But researcher also able perform exactly experiment similar equipment similar condition achieve exactly result
If externally unreliable
A good example failure apply definition reliability correctly provided cold fusion case
Fleischmann Pons announced world managed generate heat normal temperature instead huge expensive torus used research nuclear fusion
This announcement shook world researcher many institution failed experiment
It unclear whether researcher lied genuinely made mistake impossible accept result since unreliable
If ever completed long questionnaire might noticed question seem subtle variation one another
A personality test may I like plan activity ahead time I spontaneous I like go flow three separate item seem quite similar
The reason test increase internal reliability
Internal reliability consistency across separate item within measure
A test internally consistent item contributes equally overall construct measured
If physicist chemist repeat experiment give exactly almost exactly result time time
The behavior phosphorous atom DNA molecule natural force like gravity unlikely change
Ecologists social scientist hand understand achieving identical result repeat experiment practically impossible
Complex system human behavior biological organism subject far random error variation
While experimental design must attempt eliminate natural variation always disparity discipline
The key make sure result reliable possible anybody repeat experiment able compare result scientist make solid estimate
often confused term describe two completely different concept
Very simply This difference best described example A researcher devise new test measure IQ quickly standard IQ test Reliability essential component sufficient measure validity
A test reliable valid whereas test valid yet unreliable
A test extremely unreliable essentially valid either
A bathroom scale measure weight one day kg next day kg unreliable merely measuring meant
There several method ass
In social science psychology testing internal reliability essentially matter comparing
How could determine whether item inventory contributing final score equally
One technique method cut test two piece compare piece
The test split way either first second half item example
method done test measuring one construct example extroversion subscale personality test
Psychometrics use method identify item test correlate strongly others remove improve item
The compare two different instrument ensure ultimately measure thing
For example imagine examining board want test new mathematics exam reliable selects group test student
For section exam calculus geometry algebra trigonometry actually ask two question designed measure aptitude student particular area
If high internal consistency
result two set question similar version test likely reliable
The involves two separate administration instrument internal consistency measure two different version time
Researchers may use internal consistency develop two equivalent test later administer group
A statistical formula called test reliability compare various pair question
Luckily modern computer program take care detail saving researcher calculation
There two common way establish external reliability method
The simplest method testing external reliability involves testing subject later date measuring correlation result
A test retaken month example yield result original reliable test
One difficulty method lie time test
This method assumes nothing changed meantime
If test administered close together participant easily remember material score higher second round
But administered far apart variable enter picture participant may change enough make score second batch truly comparable first
To prevent learning recency effect researcher may administer second test different equivalent first
Anyone watched American Idol cooking competition understand principle reliability
Here measured performance panel judge role An example clinical psychology role play examination student rated performance mock session
Another example grading portfolio photographic work essay competition
Processes rely expert rating performance skill subject kind error however
reliability measure agreement concordance two raters respective appraisal
degree consensus among judge
The principle simple several expert raters agree performance rating rating show high reliability
If however judge wildly different assessment performance assessment show low reliability
Importantly reliability characteristic rating performance rated
As seen understanding extremely important scientist social scientist biologist psychologist crucial foundation
In psychometry example construct measured first need isolated measured
Thus building inventory test done without constant assessment construct validity reliability
For reason extensive research program always involve comprehensive ensuring instrument used consistent valid
Those physical science also perform instrumental ensuring measuring equipment calibrated established standard

In everyday language use word reliable mean something dependable give behave predictably every time
We might talk football player reliable meaning give good performance game game
In science idea similar definition much narrower
Reliability property measure tool test sometimes whole experiment
It estimation much random error might score around true score
For example might try weigh bowl flour kitchen scale
A reliable scale show reading matter many time weigh bowl
There may slight error may notice reading differ fraction gram overall scale reliable
If scale gave reading kg minute later gave reading kg error become large instrument reliability seriously undermined
When talk instrument necessarily mean physical instrument strip
An educational test assigning quantitative score behavior also instrument
Another way looking reliability considering way maximize inherent repeatability experiment
To maintain reliability researcher use many repeat sample group possible reduce chance abnormal sample group skewing result
This little like weighing bowl several time using average reading
Reliability determined statistically calculating correlation coefficient
If test reliable show high positive correlation repeat score
If use three replicate sample one generates completely different result others likely something wrong
For experiment natural phenomenon result follow always chance sample group produce result one extreme
Using multiple sample group smooth extreme generate accurate spread result
But result continue wildly different likely something wrong
In case entire experiment unreliable
Good experimental design allow plenty replicate sample researcher
But researcher also able perform exactly experiment similar equipment similar condition achieve exactly result
If externally unreliable
A good example failure apply definition reliability correctly provided cold fusion case
Fleischmann Pons announced world managed generate heat normal temperature instead huge expensive torus used research nuclear fusion
This announcement shook world researcher many institution failed experiment
It unclear whether researcher lied genuinely made mistake impossible accept result since unreliable
If ever completed long questionnaire might noticed question seem subtle variation one another
A personality test may I like plan activity ahead time I spontaneous I like go flow three separate item seem quite similar
The reason test increase internal reliability
Internal reliability consistency across separate item within measure
A test internally consistent item contributes equally overall construct measured
If physicist chemist repeat experiment give exactly almost exactly result time time
The behavior phosphorous atom DNA molecule natural force like gravity unlikely change
Ecologists social scientist hand understand achieving identical result repeat experiment practically impossible
Complex system human behavior biological organism subject far random error variation
While experimental design must attempt eliminate natural variation always disparity discipline
The key make sure result reliable possible anybody repeat experiment able compare result scientist make solid estimate
often confused term describe two completely different concept
Very simply This difference best described example A researcher devise new test measure IQ quickly standard IQ test Reliability essential component sufficient measure validity
A test reliable valid whereas test valid yet unreliable
A test extremely unreliable essentially valid either
A bathroom scale measure weight one day kg next day kg unreliable merely measuring meant
There several method ass
In social science psychology testing internal reliability essentially matter comparing
How could determine whether item inventory contributing final score equally
One technique method cut test two piece compare piece
The test split way either first second half item example
method done test measuring one construct example extroversion subscale personality test
Psychometrics use method identify item test correlate strongly others remove improve item
The compare two different instrument ensure ultimately measure thing
For example imagine examining board want test new mathematics exam reliable selects group test student
For section exam calculus geometry algebra trigonometry actually ask two question designed measure aptitude student particular area
If high internal consistency
result two set question similar version test likely reliable
The involves two separate administration instrument internal consistency measure two different version time
Researchers may use internal consistency develop two equivalent test later administer group
A statistical formula called test reliability compare various pair question
Luckily modern computer program take care detail saving researcher calculation
There two common way establish external reliability method
The simplest method testing external reliability involves testing subject later date measuring correlation result
A test retaken month example yield result original reliable test
One difficulty method lie time test
This method assumes nothing changed meantime
If test administered close together participant easily remember material score higher second round
But administered far apart variable enter picture participant may change enough make score second batch truly comparable first
To prevent learning recency effect researcher may administer second test different equivalent first
Anyone watched American Idol cooking competition understand principle reliability
Here measured performance panel judge role An example clinical psychology role play examination student rated performance mock session
Another example grading portfolio photographic work essay competition
Processes rely expert rating performance skill subject kind error however
reliability measure agreement concordance two raters respective appraisal
degree consensus among judge
The principle simple several expert raters agree performance rating rating show high reliability
If however judge wildly different assessment performance assessment show low reliability
Importantly reliability characteristic rating performance rated
As seen understanding extremely important scientist social scientist biologist psychologist crucial foundation
In psychometry example construct measured first need isolated measured
Thus building inventory test done without constant assessment construct validity reliability
For reason extensive research program always involve comprehensive ensuring instrument used consistent valid
Those physical science also perform instrumental ensuring measuring equipment calibrated established standard

The principle reliability fundamental cornerstone scientific method
By following basic principle stand rigorous questioning skepticism
The idea behind must finding inherently
Other researcher must able perform exactly condition generate result
This reinforce finding ensure wider scientific community accept
Without replication fulfilled requirement
This prerequisite essential hypothesis establishing accepted scientific truth
For example performing time critical experiment using type stopwatch
Generally reasonable assume keep true accurate time
However diligent scientist take many time minimize chance malfunction maintain validity reliability
At extreme experiment us human judgment always going come question
For example observer rate certain aspect like reliability test compromised
Human judgment vary wildly individual may rate thing differently depending upon time day current mood
This mean experiment difficult repeat inherently le reliable
Reliability necessary ingredient determining overall scientific experiment enhancing strength result
Debate social pure scientist concerning reliability robust ongoing
Validity encompasses entire experimental concept establishes whether result obtained meet requirement scientific research method
For example must appropriate care diligence shown allocation
dictate experimental design structured encompasses
Even result great sloppy inconsistent compromise integrity eye scientific community
reliability core experimental design
process examining result questioning whether possible relationship
randomization lessen external validity problem method completely successful
This statistical proof called absolute truth
Any scientific put forward possible cause studied effect
There always chance another contributed result finding
This extraneous causal relationship may become apparent technique refined honed
If constructed experiment contain scientific community likely accept finding
Eliminating potential causal relationship using control duplicate sample best way ensure result stand rigorous questioning

In take form make impossible true conclusion nevertheless false
It required valid argument premise actually true premise true would guarantee truth argument conclusion
A valid true every argument form schema valid every argument valid
An valid truth premise truth conclusion step logical operation argument valid
Under condition would affirm premise deny conclusion
The valid argument negation corresponding conditional
The conclusion premise
An argument valid said invalid
An example valid argument given following What make valid argument true premise true conclusion logical necessity conclusion given two premise
The argument would valid premise conclusion false
The following argument false premise false conclusion equally valid No matter universe might constructed could never case argument turn simultaneously true premise false conclusion
The argument may contrasted following invalid one In case conclusion contradicts deductive logic preceding premise rather deriving
Therefore argument logically even though conclusion could considered general term
The premise men immortal would likewise deemed false outside framework classical logic
However within system essentially function like mathematical state binary philosophical concept normally associated term
A standard view whether argument valid matter argument
Many technique employed logician represent argument logical form
A simple example applied two illustration following Let letter stand respectively set men set mortal Socrates
Using symbol first argument may abbreviated Similarly third argument becomes An argument termed formally valid structural
operand premise true derived conclusion always also true
In third example initial premise logically result conclusion therefore categorized invalid argument
A formula valid formula true every possible language
In propositional logic
A statement called valid
logical truth true interpretation
Validity deduction affected truth premise truth conclusion
The following deduction perfectly valid The problem argument
In order deductive argument sound deduction must valid premise true
analyzes formula respect particular class interpretation suitable mathematical structure
On reading formula valid interpretation make true
An inference valid interpretation validate premise validate conclusion
This known
In validity interpretation variable assigned produce truth value
In validity interpretation variable assigned truth value produce truth value

I keep coming across use word I never understand use meaning conveyed
Phrases like add semantics read semantics semantic web semantically correctly way confuse I referring web
Is word another way say grammar syntax
Thanks
Semantics meaning various element program whatever
For example let look code Both variable integer
From compiler point view exactly
However judging name one width something count thing
Syntactically okay since assign integer
However semantically totally wrong since width number child probably relationship
In case say semantically incorrect even compiler permit
Syntax structure
Semantics meaning
Each different context give different shade meaning term
HTML example new tag meant provide meaning data wrapped tag
The tag conveys data contained within information around
See meaning markup
Take look
Contrast older familiar HTML tag like
Each one affect appearance HTML content rendered browser ca tell u
They contain information meaning
It mean meaning got left already accounted syntax grammar
For example defined grammar valid statement say nothing
Increment one semantics
semantics description supposed put page
Semantic web generally web link search meaning word
The semantically correct way something mean right thing
The word adjective simply mean related word level computer science
For instance Semantic data model data model semantic meaningful understood anyone regardless background expertise
le semantic Java Java us meaningful word class method field
semantics refer tag describe
Check wiki page Very good description
It Computer Science terminology ask What behind Computer Science lingo
I afraid get recursive loop like
In HTML world semantic used talk meaning tag rather considering output look
For example common italicize foreign word also common italicize emphasized word
You could simply wrap foreign emphasized word tag describes look describe look way
A better tag use emphasized word conveys semantics emphasis
The browser stylesheet render italic consumer page know word emphasized
For example could properly read emphasized word
From view almost like looking syntax grammatical way
I ca speak semantics broad term When people talk semantics web normally referring idea stripped away cs javascript etc left bare bone html would make sense read
It also take account using correct tag correct markup
This stem old layout table used tabular data using list present content
You would use something le important
That would make sense

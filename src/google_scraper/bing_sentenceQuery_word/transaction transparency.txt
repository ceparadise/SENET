Can someone provide straightforward simpler possible explanation transaction applied computing even copied Wikipedia
A transaction unit work want treat whole
It either happen full
A classical example transferring money one bank account another
To first withdraw amount source account deposit destination account
The operation succeed full
If stop halfway money lost Very Bad
In modern database transaction also thing like ensure ca access data another person written halfway
But basic idea transaction ensure
They guarantee NOT situation money withdrawn one account deposited another
A transaction way representing state change
Transactions ideally four property commonly known ACID See Wikipedia entry detail
Although typically applied database
In particular see
A series data manipulation statement must either fully complete fully fail leaving database consistent state Here simple explanation
You need transfer buck account A account B
You either If something go wrong first second operation pair problem either buck disappeared appeared nowhere
A transaction mechanism allows mark group operation execute way either execute commit system state started execute rollback
either transfer buck leave account initial state
A transaction sequence one SQL operation treated unit
Specifically transaction appears run isolation furthermore system fails transaction either executed entirety
The concept transaction motivated two completely independent concern
One concurrent access database multiple client system resilient system failure
Transaction support known ACID property Properties Transactions Transactions following four standard property usually referred acronym ACID Transaction Control There following command used control transaction ACID tomicity onsistency solation urability When wish multiple transactional resource involved single transaction need use something like solution
quite widely supported
I would suggest definition processing would useful cover transaction concept computer science
From wikipedia In computer science transaction processing information processing divided individual indivisible operation called transaction
Each transaction must succeed fail complete unit remain intermediate state
In addition response noted least theory restriction whatsoever kind resource involved transaction
Most time database multiple distinct database also conceivable printer take part transaction cause transaction fail say event paper jam
I think transaction atomic action term DBMS
mean seperated
yes transction may several instruction system execute
binded together finished single basic task
example
need walk bridge let treat transction say need step
overall step seperated
done half two choice continue finish go back start point
like result transaction success committed fail rollback Transaction indivisible unit data processing transaction must ACID property ie Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durable Transaction nothing intermidiate mean transfer money one account another account one account lose much one gain amount transfer money one account another account still empty transaction Transaction defined collection task considered minimum processing unit
Each minimum processing unit divided
The main operation transaction read write
All transaction must contain four property commonly known ACID property purpose ensuring accuracy completeness data integrity

A DDBMS may support distribution transparency following three level
Having specify data location undesirable complicated data moved one location another
As discussed earlier transaction processor TP determine location data accessing distributed data catalog DDC
When data moved change database description recorded DDC therefore TP user involved location change
Many DDBMS support location transparency obviously full fragmentation transparency desired goal
To solve problem used ensure distributed transaction atomicity whilst still preserving durability property
The commit protocol requires
The protocol make use change applied database DO operation even final commit point reached
However change recorded transaction log applied database event failure necessitates transaction rollback UNDO operation transaction rollforward REDO operation
The write ahead protocol force log record written permanent storage change take place database
Centralised transaction use one DP whereas distributed transaction may make use many DP
The DP processing transaction coordinator sends message DP involved transaction subordinate asking commit portion transaction
The subordinate DP make sure commit write information log using protocol database changed point
A response returned
If response received coordinator issue abort action DP
If DP return response coordinator sends message
The DP involved apply change data store DO operation inform coordinator change committed
If committed response received coordinator issue abort action requiring DP UNDO change
Therefore commit protocol ensures DP complete component transaction issued
Once entire transaction committed durability preserved
A DDBMS provides system performs single centralised system without significant decline database performance
Optimal database performance minimal associated cost goal
A query one main function database used transform data database information
Most current database require user specify required query acquire
A typical query may require data multiple table contain nested subqueries use aggregate operator
Even centralised database system query executed number way produce required result DBMS must consider possible access strategy
The DBMS selects efficient execution strategy includes operation better performance well minimising overhead cost disk access memory use etc
This process referred In distributed database system query optimisation becomes complicated
Data may fragmented fragment may replicated optimising query DDBMS must also consider fragment copy fragment access part execution strategy
The DDBMS must also consider additional processing communication cost associated distribution data
Therefore part DDBMS query optimisation process may also include cost estimate
For example emphasis reduce communication cost volume data transferred query result may estimated determine strategy requires least amount data transferral

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
Transparency business governance context honesty openness
Transparency generally considered two main pillar good
The implication transparency organization action scrupulous enough bear public scrutiny
Increasingly nature communication mean even action intended secret may brought public awareness despite organization best effort keep hidden
The significant number recent year raised public concern much data collected whether shared
That concern also increasingly focused government since Edward Snowden leaked secret National Security Agency document showing agency collected massive volume data United States citizen

An said referentially transparent corresponding value without changing program behavior
As result referentially transparent function give argument
Such function called
An expression referentially transparent called referentially opaque
In function application referentially definition constitutes
However always case programming term used avoid misleading connotation
In referentially transparent function considered
Some provide mean guarantee referential transparency
Some functional programming language enforce referential transparency function
The importance referential transparency allows reason program behavior
This help proving simplifying assisting modifying code without breaking code mean
As referential transparency requires result given set input point time referentially transparent expression therefore
The concept although term seems originated
It adopted A mode containment φ referentially transparent whenever occurrence singular term purely referential term sentence ψ purely referential also containing term sentence φ ψ
The term appeared contemporary usage discussion seminal set lecture note
The lecture note referenced Quine bibliography
If function involved expression expression referentially transparent
Also impure function included expression value discarded insignificant
Consider function return input source
In pseudocode call function might might identify particular disk file etc
Even identical value successive return value different
Therefore function neither deterministic referentially transparent
A subtle example function depends input explicitly passed parameter
This resolved according rule variable current execution environment variable static binding
Since variable altered without changing value passed parameter result subsequent call function may differ even parameter identical
However pure allowed thus free variable value function still referentially transparent neither variable value change due static binding immutability respectively
Arithmetic operation referentially transparent replaced instance
In fact function mathematical sense referentially transparent transparent since always give result particular
Assignments transparent
For instance expression change value assigned variable
Assuming initially value two consecutive evaluation expression yield respectively
Clearly replacing either give program different meaning expression referentially transparent
However calling function transparent implicitly change input x thus
transparent evaluate replace value say Jan get result run tomorrow
This depends state date
In language like substitute equal equal every value x
This hold language
If substitution expression value valid certain point execution program expression referentially transparent
The definition ordering theoretical foundation part semantics imperative programming language
However referentially transparent expression evaluated time necessary define sequence point guarantee order evaluation
Programming done without consideration called
One advantage writing code referentially transparent style given intelligent compiler easier better possible automatically
For example programming C performance penalty including call expensive function inside loop even function call could moved outside loop without changing result program
The programmer would forced perform manual call possibly expense source code readability
However compiler able determine function call referentially transparent perform transformation automatically
The primary disadvantage language enforce referential transparency make expression operation naturally fit imperative programming style awkward le concise
Such language often incorporate mechanism make task easier retaining purely functional quality language
As example let use two function one referentially opaque referentially transparent The function referentially transparent mean
For instance
However ca say thing us global variable modifies
The referential opacity make reasoning program difficult
For example say wish reason following statement One may tempted simplify statement However work occurrence evaluates different value
Remember return value based global value passed get modified call
This mean mathematical identity longer hold
Such mathematical identity hold referentially transparent function
However sophisticated analysis used simplify statement This take step requires degree insight code infeasible compiler optimization
Therefore referential transparency allows u reason code lead robust program possibility finding bug could hope find testing possibility seeing opportunity

Within college UALR Information Science IFSC program student primarily concerned learning structure representation management storage retrieval transfer information
Computer Science student focus deeply fundamental principle computing student develop skill data structure algorithmic reasoning hardware design need integrated software application design
We prepare student apply principle creatively responsibly
If unsure area interest suggest try introductory programming course
A common misconception among student attracted discipline learn skilled web page developer graphic specialist applicative user processing spreadsheet graphical design CAD application
If interest learning tool creation computer art art major minor CS Information Science would beneficial
If interest creating efficient software application including internetworking software application World Wide Web CS degree appropriate minor would best option
Please set visit talk u career interest design analysis development software system
Also common expectation interest among student interested discipline learn become expert game programmer
While good software design development skill key successful game programmer game programming involves deep knowledge several discipline including mathematics psychology art
Our Graphics Animation Multimedia Entertainment GAME option provide necessary basic computing skill learned development game based assignment project
It appropriately blend student learning computing skill required interface development mathematics artistic skill help begin career quest game programmer
For almost choice job future whether engineering natural social science economics finance government one familiar essential fundamental computing understand leverage technology search scientific breakthrough development new product service way work done society
A Computer Science degree involves well developed communication leadership management skill coupled creative technical savvy
Daniel Reed Professor Director Institute Renaissance Computing University North Carolina Chapel Hill current director CRA Computing Research Association say Computing become third pillar science along theory experiment
The introductory course Computer Science use operating system environment tool teach basic computer science concept
Many subsequent course computer science assume know another computer programming language well expect learn language necessitated specific problem class
Owning computer obviously advantageous term ease convenience work assignment given time
However UALR require computer
In addition wireless access across campus many open computer lab use equipped necessary software class
While computer lab devoted computer science exclusively others general student population UALR
Thus lab may specialized software installed available every lab
The rapid growth job industry created need technologically skilled professional
Virtually every industry applies Computer Science professional variety way computerized control hazardous remote environment payroll processing traditional industry
Industry government business seeking graduate wide variety area including software system design internet computing networking regularly recruit graduate
Thus career opportunity Computer Science graduate limitless

To support student aspiration lifelong learning meet employer need addition helping develop technical depth field help student develop critical thinking teamwork effective communication skill
Most stable job require adeptness algorithmic reasoning
Studying mathematics develops analytical ability prepares think precisely thereby preparing creative trait essential successful computer scientist
Calculus example engineering student since build ability think rank impact relationship among different item
The foundation provided studying mathematics give ability grasp essential problem understand various abstraction predict pattern change induced changing certain parameter
Such ability essential intellectually productive professional life discipline
Note difference mathematical performance student result hard work
Increasingly vast technologically glued world experience need stand theory hold quantitative analysis
Hence ability mathematics definitely helpful
However knowledge mathematics rather familiarity comfort algorithmic reasoning correlate success computing discipline
Most successful Computer Science student demonstrated ability flexible adaptable
MORPH well
Specifically MORPH trait include Mature Clarity thought focused career vision
ii Organized Able manage time balance personal work habit
iii Responsible Ability take lead handle responsibility
iv Persistence Ability tenacious deliberative problem solving

For example many good student class one could finish assignment class first attempt one made learned mistake dogged persistence sheer hard work
One key attribute successful major ability think logically Computer Science parlance algorithmically
This mean developing ability break problem series small step solved logical sequence action
To succeed discipline aspiring student must seek obtain strong high school background math science build skill develop strong oral written communication skill develop ability work team environment
As creative discipline curious imaginative mind abundance successful essential
Here appropriate link curriculum page
The chapter called Admissions Financial Aid describes transfer policy general term
Your transfer work evaluated required document received
All transfer student initially admitted University College
Please check transfer articulation agreement
If want Computer Science major question specific coursework covered transfer articulation please request department chairperson
Generally student coming high school gain advanced placement AP credit English math course
If advanced placement credit take next English math course one advanced placement credit given
Don skip ahead unless feel comfortable best solid footing every step way curriculum
UALR participates State Minimum Core Curriculum allows student transfer hour general education core course among Arkansas institution
Students transferring UALR another publicly supported Arkansas college university check advisor assure proper transfer core course
Students entering University associate art degree regionally accredited college university meet UALR core curriculum requirement
It good take part calculus sequence either UALR current institution
If able take calculus take trigonometry course
That way transfer UALR would ready take calculus first semester continue complete mathematics requirement major
You always solid footing mathematics since mathematics sequence course depend upon complement corresponding Computer Science class
If weak deficient area mathematics coming high school definitely take corresponding mathematics course wherever attending college
If wish major Computer Science probably interested taking Computer Science course enter college
It good take course aware computer course count toward Computer Science major UALR part degree requirement
As example course computer peripheral word processing spreadsheet good course develop vocational skill part degree requirement course transfer general elective credit
The first two Computer Science course program constitute serious introduction programming program design
Usually course use either Java programming language
Regardless language used basic principle structured object oriented program design use data structure linked list queue tree etc
covered
At UALR used language first two course
Thus question arises What happens I take first two course JAVA want transfer UALR In first place course transfer CPSC CPSC first two Computer Science course UALR without problem
A student transfer UALR situation generally either pick language elect take CPSC order learn feel comfortable subsequent course even though taking CPSC strictly required
Generally take time necessary remain solid footing time progressing Computer Science course like math
Some course take another college count general elective credit UALR fulfill specific degree requirement
You must fulfill degree requirement using course take UALR course transfer another college advanced placement credit high school
UALR evaluate transcript another college decide credit transfer specific course degree program
As general recommendation attending college take general education course mathematics course needed fulfill requirement UALR
You take computer course also remember transfer course required within computer science major UALR
UALR accepts work transfer regionally accredited institution
If particular institution appear guide mean UALR accept course work institution
For particular case check sure course equivalency exists current institution
If please discus UALR academic advisor answer question student transfer credit aspect student academic program study

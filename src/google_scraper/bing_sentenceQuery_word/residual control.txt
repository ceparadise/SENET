two different definition application
The first definition le common application residual income money left monthly debt paid
This calculation particularly important person seeking financing loan based income available money cover additional debt
In scenario residual income calculated formula This calculation take account person pay subtracts debt expense amount
The remaining amount residual pay
The remaining money used expense
The second way residual income defined money earned continual basis often based one original activity
Often type residual income referred
Earning residual income critical aspect compensation many salesperson artist musician
Some perfect example residual income include The first form residual income leftover cash bill expense paid important person growing saving account seeking loan financing
When getting loan must adequate amount residual income available ensure person money make loan payment month
If adequate residual income financing loan likely approved
The second form residual income passive income often vital part wealth creation
There many hour day person trade hour dollar maximum amount income person earn
For instance person earns specific amount hour limit many hour available work
Once reach maximum amount time earn money
Get FREE access day create account
However passive income direct connection time involved
Once original work completed income continues come long demand product service exists
Each time song downloaded musician receives money passive income
They record song additional work download yet paid original work
Here another example
If person owns apartment rented profit earn money month without working specific number hour
If owner earns net income apartment determining factor many apartment many hour work
Therefore may apartment make net income month could apartment make per apartment month
That income considered residual income long apartment rented rent collected income earned without additional effort
The effort came property purchased tenant found
Each month money automatically paid without buying apartment finding tenant month
The first application remaining money debt paid month relevant analyzing person financial status ability qualify financing
The second application widely recognized meaning residual income money received basis work completed
This form income allows recipient generate revenue based time limit
Residual income foundation wealth offer flexibility earning maximizing income
It also allows income generated long work done

What difference Neural Net Neural Net
As I understand deep network implement connection across multiple layer order preserve context depth increase
Layers residual neural net input layer optional le processed data layer higher
This prevents early deep layer due converging loss
network contain directed cycle computed time
Layers recurrent neural network input layer optional extra input
This provides situational context thing like natural language processing
Therefor recurrent neural network used generate basic residual network input remains respect time
Is correct

My Sony E series laptop month old seems residual charge problem
My laptop fully charged working fine night I tried switch next morning wo turn
I called Sony service center told take battery power cord hold power button sec put battery back try switch
I turned
I tried explore reason problem came know residual charge motherboard
I problem though every time I switch
Can someone tell permanent solution problem To sound like may battery yes month old battery fail
Call Sony back tell still happening frequently
Once normal happening frequently problem
If happening often enough try leaving battery longer would normally take problem show use AC power
If problem happen battery I definitely call Sony look getting battery replaced hopefully still warranty

The analysis residual play important role validating regression model
If term regression model satisfies four assumption noted earlier model considered valid
Since statistical test significance also based assumption conclusion resulting significance test called question assumption regarding ε satisfied
The th residual difference observed value dependent variable value predicted estimated regression
These residual computed available data treated estimate model error ε
As used statistician validate assumption concerning ε
Good judgment experience play key role residual analysis
Graphical plot statistical test concerning residual examined carefully statistician judgment made based examination
The common residual plot show horizontal axis residual vertical axis
If assumption regarding error term ε satisfied residual plot consist horizontal band point
If residual analysis indicate model assumption satisfied often suggests way model modified obtain better result
In regression analysis model building process developing probabilistic model best describes relationship dependent independent variable
The major issue finding proper form linear curvilinear relationship selecting independent variable include
In building model often desirable use qualitative well quantitative variable
As noted quantitative variable measure much many represent type category
For instance suppose interest predict sale iced tea available either bottle can
Clearly independent variable container type could influence dependent variable Container type qualitative variable however must assigned numerical value used regression study
dummy variable used represent qualitative variable regression analysis
For example dummy variable could used represent container type setting iced tea packaged bottle iced tea
If beverage could placed glass bottle plastic bottle can would require two dummy variable properly represent qualitative variable container type
In general dummy variable needed model effect qualitative variable may assume value
The general linear model β β β


β ε used model wide variety curvilinear relationship dependent independent variable
For instance independent variable could nonlinear variable
Also statistician sometimes find necessary transform dependent variable order build satisfactory model
A logarithmic transformation one common type
Correlation regression analysis related sense deal relationship among variable
The correlation coefficient measure linear association two variable
Values correlation coefficient always
A correlation coefficient indicates two variable perfectly related positive linear sense correlation coefficient indicates two variable perfectly related negative linear sense correlation coefficient indicates linear relationship two variable
For sample correlation coefficient sign correlation coefficient sign coefficient estimated regression equation
Neither regression correlation analysis interpreted establishing relationship
They indicate extent variable associated
The correlation coefficient measure degree linear association two variable
Any conclusion relationship must based judgment analyst
A time series data collected successive point time successive period time
A sequence monthly data new housing start sequence weekly data product sale example time series
Usually data time series collected equally spaced period time hour day week month year
A primary concern time series analysis development forecast future value series
For instance federal government develops forecast many economic time series export
Most company develop forecast product sale
While practice qualitative method utilized statistical approach forecasting employ quantitative method
The two widely used method forecasting autoregressive integrated moving average ARIMA econometric model
ARIMA method based assumption model generates time series data
Future value time series assumed related past value well past error
A time series must stationary one mean autocorrelation function order ARIMA model applicable
For nonstationary series sometimes difference successive value taken used stationary series ARIMA model applied
develop forecast time series using one related time series possibly past value time series
This approach involves developing regression model time series forecast dependent variable related time series well past value time series independent predictor variable
The statistical method discussed generally focus population probability distribution referred parametric method
Nonparametric method statistical method require fewer assumption population applicable wider range situation
For statistical method classified nonparametric method must satisfy one following condition method used qualitative data method used quantitative data assumption made population probability distribution
In case parametric nonparametric method applicable statistician usually recommend using parametric method tend provide better precision
Nonparametric method useful however situation assumption required parametric method appear questionable
A commonly used nonparametric method described
Assume individual sample asked state preference one two similar competing product
A plus sign recorded individual prefers one product minus sign individual prefers product
With qualitative data form nonparametric sign test used statistically determine whether difference preference two product exists population
The sign test also used test value population median
The Wilcoxon test used test hypothesis two population
In collecting data test element experimental unit sample must generate two paired matched data value one population one population
Differences paired matched data value used test difference two population
The Wilcoxon test applicable assumption made form probability distribution population
Another nonparametric test detecting difference two population test
This method based data two independent random sample one population another population
There matching pairing required Wilcoxon test
Nonparametric method correlation analysis also available
The Spearman rank correlation coefficient measure relationship two variable data form rank order available
For instance Spearman rank correlation coefficient could used determine degree agreement men woman concerning preference ranking different television show
A Spearman rank correlation coefficient would indicate complete agreement coefficient would indicate complete disagreement coefficient would indicate ranking unrelated
Statistical quality control refers use statistical method monitoring maintaining quality
One method referred acceptance used decision must made accept reject part item based quality found sample
A second method referred statistical process control us graphical display known control chart determine whether process continued adjusted achieve desired quality
Assume consumer receives shipment part called lot producer
A sample part taken number defective item counted
If number defective item low entire lot accepted
If number defective item high entire lot rejected
Correct decision correspond accepting lot rejecting lot
Because sampling used probability decision need considered
The error rejecting lot creates problem producer probability error called producer risk
On hand error accepting lot creates problem purchaser consumer probability error called consumer risk
The design acceptance sampling plan consists determining sample size acceptance maximum number defective item found sample lot still accepted
The key understanding producer risk consumer risk assume lot known percentage defective item compute probability accepting lot given sampling plan
By varying assumed percentage defective item lot several different sampling plan evaluated sampling plan selected producer consumer risk reasonably low
Statistical process control us sampling statistical method monitor quality ongoing process production operation
A graphical display referred control chart provides basis deciding whether variation output process due common cause randomly occurring variation assignable cause
Whenever assignable cause identified decision made adjust process order bring output back acceptable quality level
Control chart classified type data contain
For instance employed situation used measure quality output
Quantitative data length weight monitored
Process variability monitored using range
In case quality output measured term number defectives proportion defectives sample used
All control chart constructed similar fashion
For example centre corresponds mean process process control producing output acceptable quality
The vertical axis control chart identifies scale measurement variable interest
The upper horizontal line control chart referred upper control limit lower horizontal line referred lower control limit chosen process control high probability value sample mean fall two control limit
Standard practice set control limit three standard deviation process mean
The process sampled periodically
As sample selected value sample mean plotted control chart
If value sample mean within control limit process continued assumption quality standard maintained
If value sample mean outside control limit conclusion point need corrective action order return process acceptable quality level

In order individual imperative evaluated
The emphasis explicit control flow distinguishes language language
Within imperative statement execution result choice made two path follow
For functional language function language construct exist achieve result usually termed control flow statement
A set statement turn generally structured addition grouping also defines
mechanism alter flow control way similar subroutine usually occur response external stimulus event occur rather execution control flow statement
At level control flow instruction usually work altering
For CPUs control flow instruction available conditional unconditional instruction also termed jump
The kind control flow statement supported different language vary categorized effect A explicit name number assigned fixed position within may referenced control flow statement appearing elsewhere source code
A label mark position within source code effect
alternative named label used language placed start line text source code
Languages use often impose constraint line number must increase value following line may require consecutive
For example BASIC In language label usually appearing start line immediately followed colon
For example C The language allowed whole number identifier label linked colon following statement variant allowed whole number
The statement combination English word pronounced accordingly basic form unconditional transfer control
Although may either upper lower case depending language usually written The effect goto statement cause next statement executed statement appearing immediately indicated label
Goto statement many computer scientist notably
The terminology varies may alternatively known routine procedure function especially return result method especially belong
In computer memory small current standard subroutine used mainly reduce program size
A piece code written used many time various place program
Today subroutine often used help make program structured isolating algorithm hiding data access method
If many programmer working one program subroutine one kind help divide work
In structured programming ordered sequencing successive command considered one basic control structure used building block program alongside iteration recursion choice
In May Böhm Jacopini published article showed program could transformed form involving choice IF THEN ELSE loop WHILE condition DO xxx possibly duplicated code addition Boolean variable flag
Later author showed choice replaced loop yet Boolean variable
That minimalism possible mean necessarily desirable computer theoretically need subtract one number another branch result negative practical computer dozen even hundred machine instruction
What Böhm Jacopini article showed program could
Other research showed control structure one entry one exit much easier understand form mainly could used anywhere statement without disrupting control flow
In word
Later development recently composable continued strategy making component program even freely composable
Some academic took purist approach result argued even instruction like middle loop bad practice needed proof thus advocated loop single exit point
This purist approach embodied language designed preferred tool teaching introductory programming academia
The direct application theorem may result additional local variable introduced structured chart may also result
The latter issue called context
Pascal affected problem according empirical study cited student programmer difficulty formulating correct solution Pascal several simple problem including writing function searching element array
A study Henry Shapiro cited Roberts found using control structure correct solution given subject subject wrote incorrect code problem allowed write return middle loop
Most programming language control structure initial keyword indicates type control structure involved
Languages divide whether control structure final keyword
Conditional expression conditional construct feature perform different computation action depending whether evaluates true false
Less common variation include compare given value specified constant take action according first constant match
There usually provision default action else otherwise taken match succeeds
Switch statement allow compiler optimization
In case may limited constant expression might extend example right implement default case matching string
Case logic also implemented functional form statement
A loop sequence statement specified may carried several time succession
The code inside loop loop shown obeyed specified number time collection item condition met
In language loop expressed using rather explicit looping construct
special case recursion easily transformed iteration
Most programming language construction repeating loop certain number time
In case counting go downwards instead upwards step size used
In example N body loop may execute I value depending programming language
In many programming language integer reliably used loop
number represented imprecisely due hardware constraint loop might repeated time depending rounding error hardware compiler version
Furthermore increment X occurs repeated addition accumulated rounding error may mean value X iteration differ quite significantly expected sequence
Most programming language construction repeating loop condition change
Some variation test condition start loop others test end
If test start body may skipped completely end body always executed least
A value change detection method used within ordinary loop trigger processing group value
Values monitored within loop change diverts program flow handling group event associated
Several programming language later special construct allow implicit looping element array member set collection
generalise loop also support us
comprehension together provide similar function Scala
General iteration construct C statement form used express sort loop others looping number collection parallel
Where specific looping construct used usually preferred general iteration construct since often make purpose expression clearer
used assure program segment loop forever exceptional condition arises error
For instance program loop forever handling event occur stopping process terminated operator
Infinite loop implemented using control flow construct
Most commonly unstructured programming jump back goto structured programming indefinite loop loop set never end either omitting condition explicitly setting true
Some language special construct infinite loop typically omitting condition indefinite loop
Examples include Ada Fortran Go Ruby
Often infinite loop unintentionally created programming error loop wherein loop condition us variable never change within loop
Sometimes within body loop desire skip remainder loop body continue next iteration loop
Some language provide statement language Perl Ruby
The effect prematurely terminate innermost loop body resume normal next iteration
If iteration last one loop effect terminate entire loop early
Some language like Perl Ruby statement restarts current iteration start
Ruby statement restarts entire loop initial iteration
When using loop search table might desirable stop searching soon required item found
Some programming language provide statement language Perl effect terminate current loop immediately transfer control statement immediately loop
The following example done support
Both feature similar comparing code snippet show difference must combined statement construct
support conditional execution code depending whether loop exited early statement using loop
For example The clause example linked statement inner statement
Both Python loop support else clause executed early exit loop occurred
Some language support breaking nested loop theory circle called break
One common use example searching table
This done either via multilevel break break level bash PHP via labeled break break continue given label Java Perl
Alternatives multilevel break include single break together state variable tested break another level exception caught level broken placing nested loop function using return effect termination entire nested loop using label goto statement
C include multilevel break usual alternative use goto implement labeled break
Python multilevel break continue proposed rejected basis added complexity worth rare legitimate use
The notion break interest give rise today called
In refined proving possible avoid adding additional variable structured programming long break loop allowed
Furthermore Kosaraju proved strict hierarchy program exists every integer exists program containing break depth rewritten program break depth le without introducing added variable
One also subroutine executing looped statement breaking nested loop subroutine
There multiple break generally implemented exception instead
In textbook us Tennent notion explain similarity break return statement
Watt note class sequencer known defined sequencer terminates execution textually enclosing command procedure encompasses break loop including break return statement
As commonly implemented however return sequencer may also carry return value whereas break sequencer implemented contemporary language usually
used express correctness loop
In practical term loop variant integer expression initial value
The variant value must decrease loop iteration must never become negative correct execution loop
Loop variant used guarantee loop terminate
A loop invariant assertion must true first loop iteration remain true iteration
This implies loop terminates correctly exit condition loop invariant satisfied
Loop invariant used monitor specific property loop successive iteration
Some programming language contain native support loop variant invariant
In case support specification
Some dialect provide extensive sublanguage describing Loops
An early example found Conversional Lisp
provides Loop macro implement sublanguage
Many programming language especially favoring dynamic style programming offer construct
These cause flow execution jump given context resume predeclared point
three common sort control construct exotic one also exist keyword
standard condition ZERODIVIDE SUBSCRIPTRANGE ENDFILE raised intercepted ON action Programmers also define use named condition
Like one statement specified many case GOTO needed decide flow control resume
Unfortunately implementation substantial overhead space time especially SUBSCRIPTRANGE many programmer tried avoid using condition
Common Syntax example Modern language specialized structured construct exception handling rely use break return
For example one write Any number variety clause used
If matching particular control percolate back subroutine call nested block matching found end main program reached point program forcibly stopped suitable error message
Via influence keyword reserved declaring exception handler language popular today like Java C
Some language like Ada use keyword introduce exception handler may even employ different keyword Ada pattern matching
A language like incorporate placeholder exception handler syntax automatically extract several piece information exception occurs
This approach exemplified construct AppleScript David Watt textbook also analyzes exception handling framework sequencer introduced article section early exit loop
Watt note abnormal situation generally exemplified arithmetic overflow failure like file found kind error detected program unit handler naturally located program unit
For example program might contain several call read file action perform file found depends meaning purpose file question program thus handling routine abnormal situation located system code
Watts note introducing status flag testing caller structured programming even return sequencer would entail result situation application code tends get cluttered test status flag programmer might forgetfully lazily omit test status flag
In fact abnormal situation represented status flag default ignored
Watt note contrast status flag testing exception opposite causing program terminate unless programmer explicitly deal exception way possibly adding explicit code ignore
Based argument Watt concludes jump sequencer escape sequencer suitable dedicated exception sequencer semantics discussed
In Object Pascal D Java C Python clause added construct
No matter control leaf code inside clause guaranteed execute
This useful writing code must relinquish expensive resource opened file database connection finished processing Since pattern fairly common C special syntax Upon leaving compiler guarantee object released effectively variable file stream abstracting side effect initializing releasing file
Python statement Ruby block argument used similar effect
All language mentioned define standard exception circumstance thrown
Users throw exception fact allows user throw catch almost type including basic type like whereas language like Java permissive
C introduced async keyword supporting direct style
also known semicoroutines allow control yielded consumer method temporarily typically using keyword
Like async keyword support programming direct style
function yield control form without thread
Coroutines implemented library programming language provides either continuation generator distinction coroutines generator practice technical detail
In spoof article Lawrence Clark suggested GOTO statement could replaced statement provides entertaining example
COMEFROM implemented one named
article Structured Programming go Statements identifies two situation covered control structure listed gave example control structure could handle situation
Despite utility construct yet found way mainstream programming language
The following proposed If omitted get loop test top
If omitted get loop test bottom
If omitted get infinite loop
Hence single construction replace several construction programming language
A possible variant allow one test within loop use see next section appears cover case better
Languages lacking construct generally emulate using equivalent idiom In loop construct represented using standard infinite loop clause middle confused statement following section
Naming loop like example optional permit leaving outer loop several nested loop
This proposed
A modified version presented
used specify event may occur within occurrence indicated using name event statement
When event occur relevant action carried control pass
This construction provides clear separation determining situation applies action taken situation
conceptually similar exception similar construct used purpose many language
The following simple example involves searching table particular item
One way attack piece software redirect flow execution program
A variety technique including shadow stack pointer verification used defend attack

A rule high priest leader sacred rite arrangement item object name value category etc
item represented level one another
A hierarchy link entity either directly indirectly either vertically diagonally
The direct link hierarchy insofar hierarchical one immediate superior one one subordinate although system largely hierarchical also incorporate alternative hierarchy
Indirect hierarchical link extend vertically upwards downwards via multiple link direction following
All part hierarchy linked vertically one another nevertheless horizontally linked path traveling hierarchy find common direct indirect superior
This akin two report common superior relative amount authority
Organizational form exist alternative complementary hierarchy
one form
Hierarchies special vocabulary
These term easiest understand hierarchy diagrammed see
In organizational context following term often used related hierarchy In mathematical context used different
Most hierarchy use specific vocabulary pertaining subject idea behind
For example object known superior called subordinate called
In business setting superior peer
refers number direct child object graph theory equivalent number connected via outgoing arc directed graph node
Hierarchies categorized based maximum degree highest degree present system whole
Categorization way yield two broad class
In maximum degree
In word object visualized lineup object excluding top bottom one exactly one direct subordinate one direct superior
Note referring every hierarchy property respect level normally level infinite number object
An example linear hierarchy
In one object degree therefore minimum degree higher
For many people word hierarchy automatically evokes image branching hierarchy
Branching hierarchy present within numerous system including
The broad category branching hierarchy subdivided based degree
A branching hierarchy maximum degree approach infinity wide span
Most often system intuitively regarded hierarchical moderate span
Therefore flat hierarchy often viewed hierarchy
For example flat hierarchy numerous atom decomposed subatomic particle
An branching hierarchy least one object two parent object
For example two student report directly equally level authority within hierarchy status
Possibly first use English word hierarchy cited used reference three order three angel depicted century
used related word reference
The Greek term ἱεραρχία mean rule priest ἱεράρχης meaning president sacred rite ἱερεύς priest ἀρχή amongst others first place power rule Dionysius credited first use abstract noun
Since hierarchical church see church table organization hierarchical modern sense word traditionally pinnacle head hierarchy term came refer similar organizational method setting
A hierarchy typically depicted height level represents level status width level represents quantity item level relative whole
For example company could could thousand people subordinate
These pyramid typically diagrammed note diagram hierarchical example serve emphasize size difference level
An example triangle diagram appears right
An diagram hierarchy within depicted tree form
More recently computer allowed storage navigation ever larger data set various method developed represent hierarchy manner make efficient use available space computer screen
Examples include fractal map
In design field mainly graphic design successful layout formatting content document heavily dependent rule
Visual hierarchy also important proper organization file computer
An example visually representing hierarchy Nested cluster
The Nested cluster represents hierarchical relationship using layer information
The child element within parent element
This structure representing hierarchy effective representing simple relationship
For example directing someone open file computer desktop one may first direct towards main folder subfolders within main folder
They keep opening file within folder designated file located
For complicated hierarchy stair structure represents hierarchical relationship use visual stacking
Visually imagine top downward staircase beginning left descending right
The child element towards bottom stair parent element top
This structure effective representing complicated hierarchy step placed obvious sequence
Further step concealed unless step revealed sequence
In computer desktop example file sought found another file opened
The link desired file within another document
All step must completed final destination reached
In plain English hierarchy thought The first requirement also interpreted mean hierarchy association two object always
The second requirement asserts hierarchy must leader common object
Mathematically general form hierarchy
The case entire poset constituted element
Within system element share particular unambiguous property
Objects property value grouped together resulting referred
Hierarchy particularly used refer poset class organized term increasing complexity
Operations addition subtraction multiplication division often performed certain sequence order
Usually addition subtraction performed multiplication division already applied problem
The use parenthesis also representation hierarchy show operation done prior following one
For example
In problem typically one would multiply first based rule mathematical hierarchy
But parenthesis placed one know operation within parenthesis first continuing problem
These rule largely dominant algebraic problem one include several step order solve
The use hierarchy mathematics beneficial order quickly efficiently solve problem without go process slowly dissecting problem
Most rule known proper way solving certain equation
A nested hierarchy hierarchical ordering
The concept nesting exemplified Russian
Each doll encompassed another doll way outer doll
The outer doll hold inner doll next outer doll hold remaining inner doll
Matryoshkas represent nested hierarchy level contains one object one size doll generalized nested hierarchy allows multiple object within level object one parent level
The general concept demonstrated mathematically formulated following example A square always also referred quadrilateral polygon shape
In way hierarchy
However consider set polygon using classification
A square quadrilateral never etc
Nested hierarchy organizational scheme behind systematic classification
For example using original version laid edition human formulated Taxonomies may change frequently seen underlying concept nested hierarchy always
In many programming taxonomy syntax model well fractal mathematics nested hierarchy including Russian doll also used illustrate property
Recursion included subset hierarchical programming recursive thinking synonymous form hierarchical thinking logic
A containment hierarchy direct extrapolation concept
All ordered set still nested every set must two set identical
The shape example modified demonstrate The notation mean subset equal
A general example containment hierarchy demonstrated
Two type containment hierarchy containment hierarchy containment hierarchy
A subsumptive hierarchy child compositional hierarchy child
A hierarchy also subsumptive compositional
A containment hierarchy classification object class general specific
Other name type hierarchy taxonomic hierarchy hierarchy
The last term describes relationship object member higher class
The taxonomical structure outlined subsumptive containment hierarchy
Using example Linnaean taxonomy seen object part level member level specifically human primate primate mammal
A subsumptive hierarchy also defined abstractly hierarchy
For example Linnaean hierarchy outlined entity name like way group specie fit animal
A containment hierarchy ordering part make system composed part
Most engineered structure whether natural artificial broken manner
The compositional hierarchy every person encounter every moment
Every person reduced composed composed composed composed composed
In fact last two level apply least
Moreover level inherit property
In particular example also seen lower level property scalar quality molecule bigger atom cell bigger molecule etc
Both concept commonly exist compositional hierarchy required general property
These characterized
involves entity causing property higher level entity child entity may interact yield parent entity parent composed least partly child
refers effect incorporation entity entity property interaction
Furthermore entity found level
Almost every system organization applied world arranged hierarchically
By common definition every government every government hierarchical
Socioeconomic system stratified social hierarchy society hierarchical
Most regardless internal governance structure operate hierarchy
Many leadership
Families viewed hierarchical structure term first cousin removed second cousin etc
depicted
All requisite life organized using
must often follow hierarchical learn one must first learn learn calculus one must first learn
Even hierarchy numerous scheme attempt document
Hierarchies infused daily life viewed trivial
While example often clearly depicted hierarchical form classic example hierarchy exist numerous system branching structure immediately apparent
For example system hierarchical
Using example top level binding concept consists object letter
The next level zone object digit
This example object parent
The hierarchy continues downward generate theory unique code format second third letter position allow object
Most system also hierarchical
The regarded infinitely hierarchical finite bound number digit used decimal point
structured
In organizational hierarchy single person group subsequent level represents lesser authority
Most organization structured manner including
The unit person within organization depicted hierarchically
In conceptual authority turned apex bottom base top
This mode represents idea member higher ranking responsible member lower ranking
Empirically observe nature large proportion complex biological system exhibit hierarchic structure
On theoretical ground could expect complex system hierarchy world complexity evolve simplicity
hierarchy analysis performed laid empirical foundation would
The theoretical foundation summarized Thermodynamics
When modeled general abstraction exhibit behavior relation characterized hierarchy
Within use hierarchy
On upper left arm parent lower left arm parent
This used almost everything built model
Many grammatical theory involve hierarchy
distinguish subject object different subject object marker via hierarchy person
In system three four person placed hierarchy
To distinguish subject object used object outranks subject
The structure musical composition often understood hierarchically example see composer linguist Ray
The sum note piece understood surface reduced successively sparse fundamental type motion
The level structure operate Schenker theory foreground seen detail musical score middle ground roughly summary essential contrapuntal progression background one basic counterpoint structure shared gamut tonal music literature
The music organized hierarchically pitch deriving importance relationship secondary theme key brought back tonic recapitulation primary theme
connects specifically feminist hierarchy gender see book even pointing primary theme often previously called masculine secondary theme feminine
In various enumerated sometimes organized hierarchically according certain brand
In random example asymmetry significance level structure small part whole hierarchical array depend meaning membership larger hierarchy activity human life productive activity serf guided moral life moral life guided practical reason practical reason used moral political life serf contemplative reason whereby contemplate God
Practical reason set aside time resource contemplative reason
In work diverse theorist important critique hierarchical advanced
James famously asserts work Radical Empiricism clear distinction type category constant unwritten goal scientific reasoning discovered success declared
But aspect world organized differently involving inherent intractable ambiguity scientific question often considered unresolved
Hierarchy ethic emerged Western Europe West Asia North Africa around
In aspect term hierarchy refers distinguishable real unreal
others multiple interpretation criticize hierarchy commonly found within human society especially social relationship
Hierarchies present part society business school family etc
These relationship often viewed necessary
Entities stand hierarchical arrangement animal human plant etc
In culture God also addition hierarchy
However feminist Marxists critical theorist others analyze hierarchy term value power arbitrarily assigns one group another
Hierarchical ethic offer way logical reasoning compatible religious commitment
In culture hierarchy within humanity The man family woman child social class might hierarchy follows king civic official craftsman unskilled worker

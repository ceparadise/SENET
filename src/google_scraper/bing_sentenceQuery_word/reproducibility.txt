A related concept replicability meaning ability independently achieve similar conclusion difference sampling research procedure data analysis method may exist
Reproducibility replicability together among main principle
The value obtained distinct experimental trial said obtained according reproducible experimental description procedure
The basic idea seen dictum scientific knowledge word used Greek connotation wholly isolated occurrence
Thus knowledge science necessarily involves formation general concept invocation corresponding symbol language cf
Turner
conception knowledge individual considered unscientific due lack field time could appeal statistical averaging individual
A particular experimentally obtained value said reproducible high degree agreement observation conducted specimen different location different experimental value found high
However science well reproduced result one confirmed using many experimental setup possible many line evidence possible
The first stress importance reproducibility science Irish chemist England century
Boyle designed generate study time controversial concept
Indeed distinguished philosopher denied possibility vacuum existence

book describe debate Boyle Hobbes ostensibly nature vacuum fundamentally argument useful knowledge gained
Boyle pioneer maintained foundation knowledge constituted experimentally produced fact made believable scientific community reproducibility
By repeating experiment Boyle argued certainty fact emerge
The air pump century complicated expensive apparatus build also led one first documented dispute reproducibility particular scientific phenomenon
In Dutch scientist built air pump first one outside direct management Boyle assistant time
Huygens reported effect termed anomalous suspension water appeared levitate glass jar inside air pump fact suspended air bubble Boyle Hooke could replicate phenomenon pump
As Shapin Schaffer describe became clear unless phenomenon could produced England one two pump available one England would accept claim Huygens made competence working pump
Huygens finally invited England personal guidance Hooke able replicate anomalous suspension water
Following Huygens elected Foreign Member
However Shapin Schaffer also note accomplishment replication dependent contingent act judgment
One write formula saying replication achieved
The noted briefly famous book single occurrence significance science
The wrote book set foundation modern scientific practice may say phenomenon experimentally demonstrable know conduct experiment rarely fail give u statistically significant result
Such assertion express common modern science reproducibility necessary condition although necessarily establishing scientific fact practice establishing scientific authority field knowledge
However noted Shapin Schaffer dogma quantitatively statistical significance instance therefore explicitly established many time must fact replicated considered reproducible
Reproducibility one component precision measurement test method
The component degree agreement test measurement replicate specimen observer laboratory
Both repeatability reproducibility usually reported
A reproducibility limit value difference two test result obtained reproducibility condition may expected occur probability approximately
Reproducibility determined controlled interlaboratory test program
Although often confused important distinction replicates independent repetition experiment
Replicates performed within experiment
They provide independent evidence reproducibility
Rather serve internal check experiment shown part experimental result within scientific publication
It independent repetition experiment serf underpin reproducibility The term refers idea ultimate product paper along laboratory notebook full computational environment used produce result paper code data etc
used reproduce result create new work based research
Psychology seen renewal internal concern irreproducible result
Researchers showed study author publication American Psychology Association APA empirical article respond data period
In follow study published found contacted author paper APA journal share data upon request
In paper suggested researcher publish data along work dataset released alongside demonstration suggested article published may sufficient whole analysis context disclosed
In Psychology became first discipline conduct publish open registered empirical study reproducibility called
researcher around world collaborated replicate empirical study three top Psychology journal
Fewer half attempted replication successful
There initiative improve reporting hence reproducibility medical literature many year began initiative part wider initiative
This group recently turned attention better reporting might reduce waste research especially biomedical research
Reproducible research key new discovery
A Phase I discovery followed Phase II reproduction drug develops towards commercial production
In recent decade Phase II success fallen
A study found medical study inconsistent completely reproducible
In study Begley Ellis published reviewed decade research
That study found medical research paper focused cancer research irreproducible
The irreproducible study number feature common including study performed investigator blinded experimental versus control arm failure repeat experiment lack positive negative control failure show data inappropriate use statistical test use reagent appropriately validated
writes While currently unilateral emphasis discovery much emphasis replication discovery
The study reproduced journal confirmed majority cancer researcher surveyed unable reproduce result
In conducted survey researcher took brief online questionnaire reproducibility research
According survey researcher tried failed reproduce another scientist experiment half failed reproduce experiment
Although surveyed agree significant reproducibility le think failure reproduce published result mean result probably wrong say still trust published literature
became famous correctly identifying bacterial agent also claimed could culture agent laboratory
Nobody else able produce latter result
In March chemist Stanley Pons Martin Fleischmann reported production excess heat could explained nuclear process
The report astounding given simplicity equipment essentially cell containing rapidly absorbed produced electrolysis
The news medium reported experiment widely item many newspaper around world see
Over next several month others tried replicate experiment unsuccessful
claimed early used high frequency current light lamp mile km away
In built demonstrate mean send receive power without connecting wire
The facility never fully operational completed due economic problem attempt reproduce first result ever carried
Other example contrary evidence refuted original claim The reproducibility requirement applied individual sample phenomenon partially totally nature
However still applies probabilistic description phenomenon error tolerance given probability theory

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
As PhD researcher computer science scientific result often take form algorithm turn come implementation
I convinced releasing implementation model various benefit especially scientific code one reproducibility result
I also believe Release Often Release Early applies science open possibility feedback ultimately lead better software better research
However advisor concerned danger plagiarism case code released respective paper published therefore disagrees philosophy
To seems like theoretical threat since I never heard comparable case plagiarism
However got paper rejected one major criticism reviewer impossible reproduce result since code available
My advisor think unfair criticism conference explicitly asked release source code
What think
Is sensible keep implementation secret paper actually requirement reproducible computer science
Computer science particularly friendly environment releasing material advance publication
In fact number method provide clear archival work including university technical report arXiv big repository site like github bitbucket
Moreover unlike many discipline almost never impairs ability build conference journal publication top released material
In fact typically release code also draft paper mechanism
If essentially immune plagiarism anybody pirate result look like fool marking guilt see
It may stop trying mean nobody care including reviewer take attempt seriously
The likely problem run reviewing
If major concern use one mechanism suggested question I see likely downside computer science publication
On side note however code available mean reproducible anybody spent significant time open source project attest
I wish paper rejected reason grant funding agency required release publishing venue well
That case reality live
A paper least good enough intrepid reviewer could follow description implementation work reproduce result
I certainly seen done one paper code ever published another author compared later algorithm reimplementing method
In fact I asked part review process using code problem since two approach similar
It made much better paper
I believe case simply rerunning someone code input tell u much paper
If believe someone implementation say essentially accusing fabricating result
If concern reviewer say
The result paper unbelievably good
I worked implication algorithm see implementation real computer could achieve level performance
The author provide least reviewer editor code input instruction sufficient reproduce result Table
Now may tell editor go pound sand peer review process addressed
Additionally reason keep code secret
The author may stage patenting software
I think software patent fact matter US law allows federal grant awardees pursue patent thing invent federal grant license use back government
In circumstance author may wish pursue patent implementation describing methodology mathematics open literature
This tricky
Having made career open source software I two comment I never case someone scooped
My code often available form open software repository month year paper finally ready nobody ever scooped
On hand fair share collaborator thought code I produced good requisite knowledge work asked collaborate
All positive
I probably written paper source code available open source well documented code
In almost case paper reviewer thought positive helped paper getting accepted

Reproducibility common standard scientific data
If experimental descriptive data reproduced generally discarded
Reproducibility mentioned several respondent mechanism scientific data becomes viewed le tentative
Reproducibility also assumed aspect science defined part testable empirical world US legal system consistently holding repeated test generally viewed necessary component
This facet science however become weapon many attack
Many opponent science claim past event inherently unrepeatable reliably addressed science
Using sort argument attempt cast doubt field geology evolutionary biology
You see creationist organization suggests two type science Operational science involves discovering thing operate today observable phenomenon present
This science Newton
However origin science deal origin thing unrepeatable unobservable event
They also make clear evolution clearly part origin science stating In contrast evolution speculation unobservable unrepeatable past
Do scientist really view study past nothing speculation irreproducible event
To get sense I asked following answer
Return
The importance reproducibility questioned response tending mirror one developmental biologist noted It go without saying reproducibility cornerstone research
Most also agreed difference controlled laboratory experiment philosopher science termed natural experiment defined large variety event happens watching initiated controlled human
There hold event inherently irreproducable others argue event counted reproducible long reason event could happen matter improbable would
Intriguingly scientist focused issue reproducibility even controlled laboratory experiment
Our source thing philosophical noted Those philosopher interested experiment another take reproducibility focus inevitable difference equipment setup etc
occur group attempt reproduce experiment result
This concern technical challenge reproducibility echoed number scientist
A biochemist noted biochemical system complex sensitive environmental condition
As reproducing given experimental result depend something trivial choosing correct cell type use experiment
Another biologist noted experimental reagent may exist finite amount limiting number time given experiment repeated
Someone working genomics however also noted increased emphasis technique may generating increasing number experimental approach inherently reproducible
A second area concern regarding experimental approach come analysis complex system simply may possible eliminate variation experimental system
This mundane evolutionary biologist noted In experimental work two animal never behave exactly
This concern echoed neurobiologist indicated reproducing another lab experiment often requires putting animal identical training regimen prior performing experiment time cost often prohibitive
In many case large sampling size statistical analysis may used reduce effect experimental noise
A physicist pointed anything appears contradict existing theory often subjected evaluation determine whether might statistical anomaly neurobiologist discussed various way generate result termed statistical power
Statistical power also consideration research moved controlled experimental environment data
An oceanographer noted Reproducibility huge concern u
Most concerned analysis event statistical manner
More observation get added statistical pile
If observation show process happening differently previous observation negate previous observation indicates current system one state enough observation performed achieve statistical mean
Other field dealt data different way
Ultimately limitation reproducibility natural phenomenon
As geologist suggested You get whatever earth offer ca repeat
As many field rely study multiple similar event
A researcher astronomy noted although individual event could reproduced The universe big chance object one kind exceedingly small
Further observation typically reveal example similar nature
In contrast number question case reproducibility engineer far stringent scientist
One material scientist noted In applied end live die reproducibility
There simple reason one engineer indicated I determine million dollar decision reproducibility much critical
More one engineer noted reproducibility field may still statistical component percent confidence level generating usable product deemed sufficient context
Another noted wire size modern electronics ratcheting noise engineer deal
Reproducibility generally computer science quality code consistently result one input resulting output
One researcher noted tolerance exception much higher commercial software virtually nil industry aerospace
One area reproducibility considered challenge translation theoretical CS implementation actual algorithm
In case different implementation may lead different efficiency code even though output may still maintained
Things became bit le focused social field
An anthropologist noted field As interpretative science reproducibility primary methodological criterion
In contrast someone working described field centered reproducibility The foundation folklore study repetition one folklore study goal discern human behavior repeat end
An organizational psychologist listed large number caveat typically apply field come reproducibility
One interesting aspect pointed degree human social behavior could act filter underlying phenomenon noted specific measure use big impact
Two measure may target underlying construct capture slightly different facet sometimes leading significant difference result
One aspect reproducibility emerged scientist social scientist issue generalizability
In many case lack reproducible result may act limit situation model may apply rather indicating similar result related system reproducible
This echoed emphasis recognizing limit theory model revealed earlier installment series
Overall general view reproducibility tightly linked issue tentativeness
As noted analysis much scientific data viewed tentative remain reproduced
Failure reproduce data identical condition typically result evaluation technical challenge involved recreating identical condition
Continued failure however ultimately lead initial result discarded
Even identical condition however many experiment yield result
In case statistical analysis data becomes critical generating confidence existence typical result
Much science however relies reproducing result condition
This essential part process generalized application model tested
But also key component many field rely study singular event must test collection similar event
In area collection similar event provide evidence substitute reproducibility
Based seems creationists focus historical operational science miss mark scientific experiment extent historic reproducibility always dependent upon precisely recapitulating inital experimental condition
Given often unlikely seeing identical earthquake happpen twice science suffers limitation reproducibility
Science recognize distinction natural controlled experiment may seem similar distinction creationists trying make
Attempting discredit science based natural experiment however would discard much current astronomy geology short would severely limit subject scientific analysis
In end appears reproducibility link tentativeness make subject lack understanding public typically expects scientific result concrete absolute
As topic apparent remedy better education science

The first stress importance reproducibility science Irish chemist Robert Boyle England century
Boyle air pump designed generate study vacuum time controversial concept

Historians science
Steven Shapin Simon Schaffer book describe debate Boyle Hobbes ostensibly nature vacuum fundamentally argument useful knowledge gained
Boyle pioneer experimental method maintained foundation knowledge constituted experimentally produced fact made believable scientific community reproducibility

The air pump century complicated expensive apparatus build also led one first documented dispute reproducibility particular scientific phenomenon
In Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens built air pump Amsterdam first one outside direct management Boyle assistant time Robert Hooke

As Shapin Schaffer describe became clear unless phenomenon could produced England one two pump available one England would accept claim Huygens made competence working pump
Huygens finally invited England personal guidance Hooke able replicate anomalous suspension water
Following Huygens elected Foreign Member Royal Society
However Shapin Schaffer also note accomplishment replication dependent contingent act judgment
One write formula saying replication achieved
The philosopher science Karl Popper noted briefly famous book single occurrence significance science
The Statistician Ronald Fisher wrote book set foundation modern scientific practice hypothesis testing statistical significance may say phenomenon experimentally demonstrable know conduct experiment rarely fail give u statistically significant result
Such assertion express common dogma modern science reproducibility necessary condition although necessarily sufficient establishing scientific fact practice establishing scientific authority field knowledge
However noted Shapin Schaffer dogma quantitatively statistical significance instance therefore explicitly established many time must fact replicated considered reproducible
Reproducibility one component precision measurement test method
The component repeatability degree agreement test measurement replicate specimen observer laboratory
Both repeatability reproducibility usually reported standard deviation
A reproducibility limit value difference two test result obtained reproducibility condition may expected occur probability approximately
Although often confused important distinction replicates independent repetition experiment
Replicates performed within experiment
They provide independent evidence reproducibility
Rather serve internal check experiment shown part experimental result within scientific publication
It independent repetition experiment serf underpin reproducibility The term refers idea ultimate product academic research paper along laboratory notebook full computational environment used produce result paper code data etc
used reproduce result create new work based research
Psychology seen renewal internal concern irreproducible result
Researchers showed study author publication American Psychology Association APA empirical article respond data period
In follow study published found contacted author paper APA journal share data upon request
In paper suggested researcher publish data along work dataset released alongside demonstration
In Psychology became first discipline conduct publish open registered empirical study reproducibility called Reproducibility Project
researcher around world collaborated replicate empirical study three top Psychology journal
Fewer half attempted replication successful
There initiative improve reporting hence reproducibility medical literature many year began CONSORT initiative part wider initiative EQUATOR network
This group recently turned attention better reporting might reduce waste research especially biomedical research
Reproducible research key new discovery pharmacology
A Phase I discovery followed Phase II reproduction drug develops towards commercial production
In recent decade Phase II success fallen
A study found medical study inconsistent completely reproducible
In study Begley Ellis published reviewed decade research
That study found medical research paper focused cancer research irreproducible
The irreproducible study number feature common including study performed investigator blinded experimental versus control arm failure repeat experiment lack positive negative control failure show data inappropriate use statistical test use reagent appropriately validated
John Ioannidis writes While currently unilateral emphasis discovery much emphasis replication discovery
The study reproduced journal PLOS ONE confirmed majority cancer researcher surveyed unable reproduce result
In conducted survey researcher took brief online questionnaire reproducibility research
According survey researcher tried failed reproduce another scientist experiment half failed reproduce experiment
Although surveyed agree significant reproducibility le think failure reproduce published result mean result probably wrong say still trust published literature
irreproducible Hideyo Noguchi became famous correctly identifying bacterial agent syphilis also claimed could culture agent laboratory
Nobody else able produce latter result
In March University Utah chemist Stanley Pons Martin Fleischmann reported production excess heat could explained nuclear process cold fusion
The report astounding given simplicity equipment essentially electrolysis cell containing heavy water palladium cathode rapidly absorbed deuterium produced electrolysis
The news medium reported experiment widely item many newspaper around world see science press conference
Over next several month others tried replicate experiment unsuccessful
Nikola Tesla claimed early used high frequency current light lamp away without using wire
In built Wardenclyffe Tower Long Island demonstrate mean send receive power without connecting wire
The facility never fully operational completed due economic problem attempt reproduce first result ever carried
Other example contrary evidence refuted original claim acquisition pluripotency revealed result fraud bacterium could purportedly incorporate arsenic DNA place phosphorus MMR vaccine controversy study The Lancet claiming MMR vaccine caused autism revealed fraudulent Schön scandal semiconductor breakthrough revealed fraudulent The reproducibility requirement applied individual sample phenomenon partially totally nature
However still applies probabilistic description phenomenon error tolerance given probability theory

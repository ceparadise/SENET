Computer science also strong connection discipline
Many problem science engineering health care business area solved effectively computer finding solution requires computer science expertise knowledge particular application domain
Thus computer scientist often become proficient subject
Finally computer science wide range specialty
These include computer architecture software system graphic artifical intelligence computational science software engineering
Drawing common core computer science knowledge specialty area focus particular challenge
Finally importantly computer scientist computer scientist fun
Not mention lucrative career opportunity
Computer Science The Profession Computer science discipline involves understanding design computer computational process
In general form concerned understanding information transfer transformation
Particular interest placed making process efficient endowing form intelligence
The discipline range theoretical study algorithm practical problem implementation term computational hardware software
A central focus process handling manipulating information
Thus discipline span advancing fundamental understanding algorithm information process general well practical design efficient reliable software hardware meet given specification
Computer science young discipline evolving rapidly beginning
As includes theoretical study experimental method engineering design one discipline
This differs radically physical science separate understanding advancement science application science field engineering design implementation
In computer science inherent intermingling theoretical concept computability algorithmic efficiency modern practical advancement electronics continue stimulate advance discipline
It close interaction theoretical design aspect field bind together single discipline
Because rapid evolution difficult provide complete list computer science area
Yet clear crucial area theory algorithm data structure programming methodology language computer element architecture

There significant overlap software engineering computer science degree program
Professionals two field often compete position
There distinction education however future may distinction role allowed perform
focusing subject crucial understanding emerging system
program
Software engineering engineering discipline
A licensing examination development stakeholder believe within two year number state licensing software developer whose work impact safety public welfare
Moreover many people field believe software development approached engineering discipline even direct bearing public safety
In Steve McConnell argues software development follow principle engineering
Scientists research extend scientific knowledge test theory work edge unknown
Engineers start knowledge already proven reliable
Their job create design work
Engineers need breadth broad scope education scientist need depth narrow branch knowledge
McConnell suggests better degree computer science work software development without related degree
Still traditional computer science degree focus theoretical aspect profession always provide best education
Realize term software engineering sometimes
Some company choose use title software engineer even particular position require engineering
Also program titled software engineering accredited Accreditation Board Engineering Technology ABET
For reason confusion among future software developer distinction program
Some school offer separate track computer science software engineering
The two track generally include common course different overall architecture
Both computer science software engineering program accredited ABET
Computer science fall banner Computing Accreditation Commission though computer engineering responsibility Engineering Accreditation Commission
There significant difference requirement
Software engineering program include design project project future software engineer display ability apply engineering principle real world
The senior project may applicable software engineer future work
Students graduate computer science software engineering program cite variety difference
Courses computer science often place greater emphasis theoretical
They emphasize algorithm
Traditionally considered good preparation graduate level research
According BLS also prove useful system software engineering
Some graduate report computer science course include mathematics
This always case however
At Auburn University Calculus III listed requirement software engineering degree school year computer science one
Both program include computer elective allow candidate tailor program meet individual goal
The line two track blurred bit computer science program borrowed newer software engineering field
You may well find engineering course computer science curriculum
If envision working field like embedded software likely want engineering degree sort
If intending work arena may allow interest belief well program reputation dictate choice
Do share McDonnell belief developer engineer

However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

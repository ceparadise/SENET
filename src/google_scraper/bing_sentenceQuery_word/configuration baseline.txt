A configuration baseline fixed reference development cycle specification product point time
It serf documented basis defining incremental change encompasses many different aspect product
It center effective configuration management program whose purpose give definite basis change control project controlling various configuration item like work feature product performance measurable configuration
Basically clearly defined specification considered baseline change follow
A configuration baseline also known simply baseline
There different type configuration baseline depending context software hardware others
The technical baseline one includes user requirement program product information related documentation configuration item
It consists following baseline Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

In baseline agreed description attribute product point time serf basis defining change
A change movement baseline next state
The identification significant change baseline state central purpose identification
Typically significant state receive formal approval status either explicitly implicitly
An approval status may marked individually prior definition status established project leader signified association position established baseline
Nevertheless approval status usually recognized publicly
Thus baseline may also mark approved configuration item
signed execution
In similar manner associating multiple configuration item baseline indicates item approved
Generally baseline may single work product set work product used logical basis comparison
A baseline may also established basis subsequent select activity work product meet certain criterion
Such activity may attributed formal approval
Conversely configuration project often includes one baseline status configuration metric collected
The current configuration refers current status current audit current metric
Similarly le frequently baseline may refer item associated specific project
This may include revision item latest revision item project depending upon context
A baseline may specific type baseline body item particular certifying
Some example include While marking approval status cover majority us baseline baseline may also established signify progress work passage time
In case baseline visible measure endured collective effort
developmental baseline
Baselines may also mark
Baselines valued use identify notable state work product also provide historical view work product element proceeded together time
When historical baseline retrieved state work product subset share significance history change allows project leader compare relative progress single part project project whole allows project leader identify individual item lag lead progress toward better functionality performance
For reason baseline identification monitoring retrieval critical success configuration management
Once retrieved baseline may compared particular configuration another baseline
Most baseline established fixed point time serve continue reference point identification state
However baseline established carry forward reference item regardless change item
These latter baseline evolve progression work effort continue identify notable work product project
In process performing configuration management configuration item work product may assigned baseline establish certain status
In sense baseline work product may require certain change work product ensure conforms characteristic associated baseline referenced
This varies upon context many case requires work product reset initial possibly inherently approved state work may proceed
In many environment baseline controlled certain subsequent activity work product baseline either prohibited permitted
These activity selected controlled depending upon configuration management system also monitored
Consequently baseline ordinarily subjected configuration management audit
may include examination specific action performed baseline identification individual involved action evaluation change within baseline certification approval accounting metric collection comparison another baseline
Though common software system label existence baseline found several domain
Baselines found modeling system business rule management system among others
In addition field hardware software engineering baseline found medicine
monitoring health progress politics
statistic physic chemistry
observation change finance
others

Before create solution need fully understand problem
In technical architecture known model
In word work client determine system currently work build model using Architecture Design Language diagram create document establishing baseline create solution
With input client create model Inisope company directory service using Archimate

Fast Startup Windows supposed help boot Windows much faster
In complete shutdown scenario Windows log user close application
Fast start similar complete shutdown mix hibernation
In Fast Startup Windows log user shuts application point Windows stage similar first boot Windows hibernates window kernel loaded driver help reduce startup time
In environment found machine many profile actually slows thing use lot disk space
Most teaching machine SSD space limited
Its worth pointing also cause problem It look like Windows Fast Startup mode seems help machine disabling across enterprise seems kill colleague said experience staff machine limited number user large hard disk seem benefit
I sure fan site may realized I big fan Configuration Items Configuration baseline

Yes thanks rush today
I updated post always nice get feedback either way
Also use Win
Thanks I also found one computer fastboot shut black screen back login screen Any way great post thanks
Do still manage lock shutdown setting GPO defining configuration baseline enough user change
That setting requires admin privilege issue env
You could enforce using GPO compliance baseline keep writing change
A colleague mine describes GPO like using hammer CB like using scalpel Great guide
Another thing could mentioned Wake LAN also work fast startup enabled

realization application execution idea
In implementation realization algorithm
Many implementation may exist given specification standard
For example contain implementation specification software development tool contain implementation
A special case occurs implement case concrete class interface includes method specified interface
In implementation refers process guiding client purchase use software hardware purchased
This includes requirement analysis scope analysis customizations system integration user policy user training delivery
These step often overseen project manager using methodology
Software Implementations involve several professional relatively new knowledge based economy project manager
To implement system successfully large number task need carried appropriate sequence
Utilising implementation methodology enlisting professional advice help often number task poor planning inadequate resourcing cause problem implementation project rather task particularly difficult
Similarly cultural issue often lack adequate consultation communication inhibits achievement desired result
In implementation refers carrying
pas law carried working
This process consists
Factors impacting implementation include legislative intent administrative capacity implementing bureaucracy interest group activity opposition presidential executive support
In international relation implementation refers stage international
It represents stage international provision enacted domestically legislation regulation
The implementation stage different ratification international treaty
Implementation defined specified set activity designed put practice activity program known dimension
According definition implementation process purposeful described sufficient detail independent observer detect presence strength specific set activity related implementation
In addition activity program implemented described sufficient detail independent observer detect presence strength
In water natural resource implementation refers actualization best management practice ultimate goal conserving natural resource improving quality water body
System implementation generally benefit high level user involvement management support
User participation design operation information system several positive result
First user heavily involved system design move opportunity mold system according priority business requirement opportunity control outcome
Second likely react positively change process
Incorporating user knowledge expertise lead better solution
The relationship user information system specialist traditionally problem area information system implementation effort
Users information system specialist tend different background interest priority
This referred communication gap
These difference lead divergent organizational loyalty approach problem solving vocabulary
Examples difference concern

In computing standard needed build program software work different system
Standards de jure de facto
They also open proprietary
In computing agreed way thing
Standards make easier people build program work different system different country
Standards affect many area computing eg software file format hardware
Some common standard include There advantage using standard creating program product
For instance program product popular widely compatible
Also easier work people work standard

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I reading author include basic operation Choice operator P Q mean either P Q executed
On page Applied introduction available author say coice operator necessary implemented P Q new x x But convince
For example taking new x x may reduce new x new x may also reduce new x deadlock without ever sending
My question mistake
Is reasoning wrong
Is implementation choice operator wrong
Is required backtrack find path reduction
I really sorry question make sense I little formal training subject mostly curiosity I implement simulator
The issue manipulating rule besides definition telling reduction
The whole point paragraph present definition multiple notion choice encodable
Many process calculus explicit choice summation operator nondeterminism allowing example behave either P Q imprecise fact several different operator possible
In case form choice encodable calculus example purely internal choice encoded given Section expression question case result proved

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Is citation style within computer science field
By citation style I referring three general method Browsing show roughly split option occasional
So I really two question The answer may I imagine something like Everyone us even though clearly easier read
Regarding Both ACM IEEE use citation style safe say reader academic article CS familiar style
Therefore use style paper look similar conference journal article CS
Regarding experience citation style Smith effective reader
This opinion shaped department Computational Social Science I read mix paper CS Statistics Social Science Economics others
My reason favoring make easier read paper line
Having read many paper given field I familiar cited seminal work
If I see Padgett Powell I immediately know reference I guess
But I see tell nothing
I go look reference list memorize stand Padgett Powell every time I see
But nature discipline nature paper lead difference role citation serve text
In Social Sciences general citation structural discourse field
Citations often mark school thought line argument research lens
In contrast Computer Science citation much utilitarian function point paper provide theoretical foundation attempted approach problem solved
In way intellectual bill material research behind CS paper
The numbered reference sufficient giving anyone pointer bill material need
Another justification citation style shorten page count paper
In opinion le le justified era people read paper electronically print
A computer science paper go either IEEE ACM use one standard citation style feel like computer science paper many reader
Author guideline including found

Courses Probabilistic Model Checking Probability Computing Numerical Solution Differential Equations Prerequisites Some familiarity stochastic process working knowledge MATLAB C Contextuality fundamental feature quantum physical theory one distinguishes classical mechanic
In recent paper Abramsky Brandenburger categorical notion sheaf used formalize contextuality
This resulted generalizing extending contextuality theory share structural property quantum mechanic
A consequence type modeling succinct logical axiomatization property correlation result classical go theorem Bell
Like quantum mechanic natural language contextual feature subject much study distributional model meaning originated work Firth later advanced Schutze
These model based vector space semiring positive real inner product operation
The vector represent meaning word based context often appear inner product measure degree word synonymy
Despite success modeling word meaning vector space suffer two major shortcoming firstly immediately scale sentence secondly least intuitive way provide semantics logical word
Recent work group developed compositional distributional model meaning natural language lift vector space meaning phrase sentence
This already led promising experimental result

Its declarative approach library machine learning graph processing high performance enabled wide adoption industry
Although Spark transform collection arbitrary type exhibit severe performance problem processing nested data format JSON XML
In particular distributed processing datasets nested collection skewed cardinality one extremely large others small nested collection lead uneven distribution work among machine
In case developer typically undergo painful process manual query avoid load imbalance large inner collection workload
This project aim extend Spark API new functionality would automatically transform user query avoid data skews
This project great opportunity student understand Apache Spark work hood contribute project

In method executing program directly long term storage rather copying
It extension using reduce total amount memory required
Its general effect program text consumes writable memory saving dynamic data instance program run single copy
For work several criterion met The storage requirement usually met using NOR addressed individual word read operation although bit slower normal system RAM setup
Typically first stage boot loader XIP program linked run address flash chip mapped contains minimal program set system RAM depends component used individual board generalized enough proper sequence could embedded processor hardware load second stage bootloader OS RAM
During initialization writable memory may available computation performed within processor register
For reason first stage boot loader tend written assembler language minimum provide normal execution environment next program
Some processor either embed small amount SRAM chip allow using onboard cache memory RAM make first stage boot loader easier write using language
For kernel bootloader generally assigned internally order use XIP sufficient instruct linker place unmodifiable modifiable data different address range provide mechanism modifiable data copied writable memory code run assumes data accessed normally
This done part previous stage within small code segment beginning program
If address space assigned externally application program run system provide compiler need access modifiable data adding offset pointer private copy data area
In case external loader responsible setting instance specific memory area
XIP place requirement file system often difficult meet
In system without entire file must stored within consecutive byte must fragmented flash based file system often aim distribute data sector flash chip least erase cycle chip prolonging lifetime
All complication speed tradeoff mean XIP generally used first stage bootloaders memory extremely short supply
A relatively new file system Linux called aim overcome shortcoming associated XIP especially regard execution application
It make instance possible split executable binary file XIP region thus avoiding restriction fragmentation mentioned

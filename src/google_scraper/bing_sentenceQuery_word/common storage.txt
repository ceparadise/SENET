In unit information also used measure random variable contained message
The commonly used unit data storage capacity capacity system two state equivalent eight bit
Multiples unit formed prefix newer IEC prefix
Information capacity considered
In observed fundamental storage principle formalized information stored system proportional possible state system denoted
Changing base logarithm different number effect multiplying value logarithm fixed constant namely
Therefore choice base determines unit used measure information
In particular integer unit amount information stored system possible state
When unit equal information content one bit portmanteau binary digit

Other unit named include The trit ban nat rarely used measure storage capacity nat particular often used information theory natural logarithm mathematically convenient logarithm base
Several conventional name used collection group bit
Historically number bit used encode text computer depended computer hardware architecture today almost always mean eight bit
A byte represent distinct value integer
The specifies B upper case symbol byte
Bytes multiple thereof almost always used specify size computer file capacity storage unit
Most modern computer peripheral device designed manipulate data whole byte group byte rather individual bit
A group four bit half byte sometimes called nybble
This unit often used context number representation since nibble amount information one hexadecimal digit
Computers usually manipulate bit group fixed size conventionally called
The number bit word usually defined size computer number data bit fetched single operation
In architecture commonly known word bit past current architecture use word bit others
Some use two word double word dword four word quad word quad
Computer usually operate memory consist several consecutive word
These unit customarily called
system partition computer even larger unit traditionally called
Terms large quantity bit formed using standard range SI prefix power kbit Mbit Gbit
These prefix often used multiple byte kB bit MB GB
However technical reason capacity computer memory storage unit often multiple large power two byte
To avoid unwieldy number people often misused SI prefix mean nearest power two using prefix
For example chip capacity byte would referred chip
The table illustrates difference
In past uppercase used instead lowercase indicate instead
However usage never consistently applied
On hand external storage system SI prefix commonly used decimal value power
There many attempt resolve confusion providing alternative notation multiple
In IEC issued standard purpose namely series use instead main radix The however define uppercase K M G binary power reflect common usage
Several unit information storage named Some name obsolete used restricted context

Core memory remained dominant advance technology allowed become economically competitive
This led modern RAM
It light quite expensive time
The particular type RAM used primary storage also
lose information powered
As shown diagram traditionally two primary storage besides main RAM Main memory directly indirectly connected central processing unit via
It actually two bus diagram
The CPU firstly sends number address bus number called indicates desired location data
Then read writes data using data bus
Additionally MMU small device CPU RAM recalculating actual memory address example provide abstraction task
As RAM type used primary storage volatile uninitialized start computer containing storage would source read instruction order start computer

By contrast time taken access given byte information stored memory measured billionth second nanosecond
This illustrates significant difference distinguishes memory rotating magnetic storage device hard disk typically million time slower memory
Rotating device drive even longer access time
With disk drive disk head reach proper placement data interest rotates subsequent data track fast access
To reduce seek time rotational latency data transferred disk large contiguous block
When data reside disk accessing large block hide latency offer opportunity design efficient
Sequential block access disk order magnitude faster random access many sophisticated paradigm developed design efficient algorithm based upon sequential block access
Another way reduce bottleneck use multiple disk parallel order increase bandwidth primary secondary memory

strategy knowledge ordering used variety field including software humanistic scientific theory see management organization
In practice seen style thinking teaching leadership
A approach also known case used synonym essentially breaking system gain insight compositional reverse engineering fashion
In approach overview system formulated specifying detailing subsystem
Each subsystem refined yet greater detail sometimes many additional subsystem level entire specification reduced base element
A model often specified assistance black box make easier manipulate
However black box may fail clarify elementary mechanism detailed enough realistically validate model
Top approach start big picture
It break smaller segment
A approach piecing together system give rise complex system thus making original system emergent system
processing type based incoming data environment form
From cognitive psychology perspective information enters eye one direction sensory input bottom turned image brain interpreted recognized perception output built processing final cognition
In approach individual base element system first specified great detail
These element linked together form larger subsystem turn linked sometimes many level complete system formed
This strategy often resembles seed model beginning small eventually grow complexity completeness
However organic strategy may result tangle element subsystem developed isolation subject local optimization opposed meeting global purpose
During design development new product designer engineer rely approach
The approach utilized existing component selected integrated product
An example would include selecting particular fastener bolt designing receiving component fastener fit properly
In approach custom fastener would designed would fit properly receiving component
For perspective product restrictive requirement weight geometry safety environment etc
approach taken almost everything custom designed
However important minimize cost increase component availability manufacturing equipment approach would taken many component bolt gear bearing etc
would selected possible
In latter case receiving housing would designed around selected component
In approach play key role
approach emphasize planning complete understanding system
It inherent coding begin sufficient level detail reached design least part system
approach implemented attaching stub place module
This however delay testing ultimate functional unit system significant design complete
emphasizes coding early testing begin soon first module specified
This approach however run risk module may coded without clear idea link part system linking may easy first thought
one main benefit approach
design promoted researcher
Mills developed concept practical use tested project automate morgue index
The engineering management success project led spread approach IBM rest computer industry
Among achievement Niklaus Wirth developer wrote influential paper
Since Niklaus Wirth went develop language one could define module knowing entire program specification one infer programming strictly promoted
method favored late assisted demonstrating idea aspect programming could utilized
Modern software design approach usually combine approach
Although understanding complete system usually considered necessary good design leading theoretically approach software project attempt make use existing code degree
module give design flavor
Some design approach also use approach partially functional system designed coded completion system expanded fulfill requirement project programming style mainstay traditional procedural language design begin specifying complex piece dividing successively smaller piece
The technique writing program using method write main procedure name major function need
Later programming team look requirement function process repeated
These compartmentalized eventually perform action simple easily concisely coded
When various coded program ready testing
By defining application come together high level lower level work
By defining lower level abstraction expected integrate higher level one interface become clearly defined
In approach individual base element system first specified great detail
These element linked together form larger subsystem turn linked sometimes many level complete system formed
This strategy often resembles seed model beginning small eventually grow complexity completeness
programming OOP paradigm us object design application computer program
In mechanical engineering software program Solidworks Autodesk Inventor user design product piece part whole later add piece together form assembly like building LEGO
Engineers call piece part design
In approach good intuition necessary decide functionality provided module
If system built existing system approach suitable start existing module
process analyzing input sequence read file keyboard order determine grammatical structure
This method used analysis
parsing strategy analyzing unknown data relationship attempt identify fundamental unit first infer structure
parser hand hypothesize general structure consider whether known fundamental structure compatible hypothesis

Such approach broadly speaking able produce device parallel much cheaper method could potentially overwhelmed size complexity desired assembly increase
These term also employed discus flow information processing
Typically input considered information source considered
A process characterized absence higher level direction sensory processing whereas process characterized high level direction sensory processing cognition goal target Beiderman
According college teaching note written Charles Ramskov Rock Neiser Gregory claim approach involves perception active constructive process
Additionally approach directly given stimulus input result stimulus internal hypothesis expectation interaction
According Theoretical Synthesis stimulus presented short clarity uncertain give vague stimulus perception becomes approach
Conversely psychology defines processing approach wherein progression individual element whole
According Ramskov one proponent approach Gibson claim process includes visual perception need information available proximal stimulus produced distal stimulus
Theoretical Synthesis also claim processing occurs stimulus presented long clearly enough
Cognitively speaking certain cognitive process fast reaction quick visual identification considered process rely primarily sensory information whereas process control considered goal directed
Neurologically speaking area brain area mostly connection
Other area input higher brain area considered influence
The study provides example
If attention drawn flower field may color shape flower visually salient
The information caused attend flower came attention contingent upon knowledge flower outside stimulus sufficient
Contrast situation one looking flower
You representation looking
When see object looking salient
This example use information
In cognitive term two thinking approach distinguished
big chunk stereotypically visionary person see larger picture overview
Such people focus big picture derive detail support
small chunk cognition akin focusing detail primarily rather landscape
The expression seeing wood tree reference two style cognition
In field management organization term used describe decision made change implemented
A approach executive decision maker top person make decision something done
This approach disseminated authority lower level hierarchy greater lesser extent bound
For example wanting make improvement hospital hospital administrator might decide major change implementing new program needed leader us planned approach drive change frontline staff Stewart Manges Ward
A approach change one work large number people working together causing decision arise joint involvement
A decision number activist student victim incident take action decision
A approach thought incremental change approach represents emergent process cultivated upheld primarily frontline worker Stewart Manges Ward
Positive aspect approach include efficiency superb overview higher level
Also external effect internalized
On negative side reform perceived imposed difficult lower level accept
Maravall Przeworski
Evidence suggests true regardless content reform
Dubois
A approach allows experimentation better feeling needed bottom
Other evidence suggests third combination approach change see Stewart Manges Ward
Both approach found organization state involving political decision
In organized organization
ministry subordinate entity decision prepared expert field define expertise policy deem necessary
If agree even compromise problem next higher hierarchy level decision would sought
Finally highest common principal might take decision
Information debt inferior superior mean inferior owes information superior
In effect soon inferior agree head organization provides decision inferior agreed upon
Among several country German political system provides one purest form approach
The German Federal Act Public Service provides inferior consult support superior follow general guideline superior would fully responsible act office would follow specific formal complaint procedure doubt legality order
Frequently German politician leave office allegation took wrong decision resistance inferior expert opinion commonly called beratungsresistent resistant consultation German
The historical foundation approach lie fact century many politician used nobleman without appropriate education became forced rely consultation educated expert particular Prussian reform Stein Hardenberg enjoyed status financially personally independent indismissable neutral expert public servant public law
The experience two dictatorship country end regime emerging call legal responsibility aidees aidees regime also furnished call principle personal responsibility expert decision made leading strengthening approach requires maximum responsibility superior
A similar approach found British police law entitlement police constable vested constable person police administrative agency leading single constable fully responsible act office particular legality
In opposite French administration based approach regular public servant enjoy task simply execute decision made superior
As superior also require consultation consultation provided member distinctive regular ministry staff term staff organization
Those member member entitled make suggestion take decision political dimension
The advantage approach level expertise provided combined motivating experience member administration responsible finally independent engine progress field personal responsibility
A disadvantage lack democratic control transparency leading democratic viewpoint deferment actual power faceless even known public servant
Even fact certain politician might provide face actual decision inferior might mitigate effect rather strong parliamentary right control influence legislative procedure exist example Germany
The advantage principle political administrative responsibility clearly distinguished responsibility political failure clearly identified relevant office holder
Disadvantages system trigger demotivation inferior know idea innovative approach might welcome position make use full range expertise inferior collected
Administrations traditionally work according strict approach
As civil servant level political leadership discouraged making suggestion use suffer lack expertise could provided inferior regularly lead breakdown system decade
Modern form example therefore prefer define framework permissible even encouraged criticism inferior would affect major state doctrine allows use professional knowledge use person office
Both approach exist
There many example program often run government large IGOs many control
Examples program include many small NGOs set improve local access healthcare
However lot program seek combine approach instance international program currently run involved training many local volunteer boosting capacity international program hygiene sanitation access primary
Often school design said primarily promoted design taught architectural design begin basic plan drawing overall project
By contrast focused design
This method manifested study translating organizational system larger architectural scale woodpanel carving furniture design
In control refers top predator control structure population dynamic
The classic example ecosystem
In ecosystem predator
They prey turn eat
When otter removed urchin population grow reduce kelp forest creating
In word ecosystem controlled productivity kelp rather top predator
Bottom control ecosystem refers ecosystem nutrient supply productivity type primary producer plant phytoplankton control ecosystem structure
An example would plankton population controlled availability nutrient
Plankton population tend higher complex area upwelling brings nutrient surface
There many different example concept
It common population influenced type control

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Is fundamental difference Dynamic programming
Meaning problem solved
Or approach unwinding recurrence approach
This question came site people studying math level professional related field
To use bottom method need able efficiently determine bottom usually mean need heavily constrained problem space
If know lowest level calculation going dependency order going upward make sense iteratively proper order store result
Factorials naive Fibonacci Euler recurrence relation partition good example problem suited approach
Some problem easily determined bottom dependency order calculation
Chess position evaluation example usefully memoized position evaluation score stored need recalculated
Positions recur multiple level search tree due move transposition repetition saving evaluation result worthwhile
But way know position lowest level tree going without recursively descending taking account intermediate pruning top really feasible approach
approach This direct recursive formulation problem
If solution problem formulated recursively using solution overlapping one easily memoize store solution table
Whenever attempt solve new first check table see already solved
If solution recorded use directly otherwise solve add solution table
approach Once formulate solution problem recursively term try reformulating problem fashion try solving first use solution arrive solution bigger
This also usually done tabular form iteratively generating solution bigger bigger using solution small
For example already know value directly calculate value

Now tool need let focus structure program
Recall command function building block program
Commands go inside function function make program
So effectively build program using function
When defined function said function used break problem little bit make program readable
Tucking away list command inside named function make program much easier read
Note code must function command may perfectly acceptable put start function
Here guideline put group command function
This lead u next discussion mean specific task smaller problem
Each program goal solving problem
Most time problem rather large complex least broken several part
When write program first want consider big picture overall goal
Then want break problem smaller chunk
What first step
The second step
Once step break step even
Keep breaking subproblem defined definite task need accomplished
These task need small accomplished single command small enough could describe short single sentence
As analogy think making movie
The biggest problem need solved want feature length movie biggest name Hollywood awesome special effect entertain everyone see
You see large problem
So let break shown picture
The big problem shown top
Then broken subproblems
We need entertain everyone need good script
We want biggest name Hollywood need solve cast crew problem
Then want awesome sound effect need edit movie
We actually need footage need film movie
Then see one problem need broken managable problem
Here show Film Movie get broken filming scene
You see little problem combined solution little problem make solution overall problem
Now say problem want Karel go street jump hurdle
The beginning world would look like And ending world look like Let think solve
What big goal
We want Karel go street jump every hurdle stop end
What next smaller goal
What task accomplished function
See function reusable
We need use first function time second function time
Finally outline code need write
For sake space function fully implemented
However notice use function make program goal obvious
You read start function like telling story
Each function accomplishes specific small part problem
Let brief recap information learned
Programs made function made command
We need build program using function make code readable break problem
The program problem goal broken single sentence goal
Each small goal get function

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

processing form perception starting larger object concept idea working way toward detailed information
In word processing happens work general big picture tiny detail
In processing abstract impression influence information gather
processing also known processing since perception influenced expectation existing belief understanding
In case aware influence instance process occurs without conscious awareness
For example imagine driving unfamiliar street see sign convenience store
The sign several missing letter still able read
Why
Because use processing rely existing knowledge make educated guess sign say
In world surrounded virtually limitless sensory experience information processing help u quickly make sense environment
This type processing useful looking pattern environment also hinder ability perceive thing new different way
Our bias toward viewing object certain way based experience belief expectation known
A number thing influence processing including context
The context circumstance event object perceived influence expect find particular situation
If reading article food nutrition example might interpret word familiar something related food
Motivation also make likely interpret something particular way
For example shown series ambiguous image might motivated perceive hungry
One classic example processing action phenomenon known Stroop effect
In task color word printed color
So example word Red might printed blue word Pink might printed white
Participants asked say color word actual word
When reaction time measured people much slower saying correct color color word
processing explains task difficult
People automatically recognize word think color making easier read word aloud rather say color word

Enrollment undergraduate computer science course college nationwide
But trend hailed tech industry dark side disproportionate number student taking course caught cheating
More student caught cheating introductory computer science course course campus thanks automated tool professor use detect unauthorized code reuse excessive collaboration forbidden way completing homework assignment
Computer science professor say student dishonest student field likely get caught software available check plagiarism
Half academic dishonesty case University Washington involve computer science student
The truth every campus large proportion reported case academic dishonesty come introductory computer science course reason totally obvious use automated tool detect plagiarism explains Professor Ed Lazowska chair computer science engineering University Washington
We compare student submission compare previous student submission code may Web
These tool flag suspicious case manually examined
Stanford University disclosed February honor code violation involved computer science student although student represent student body
Of honor code violation investigated last year Stanford Judicial Panel involved computer science student
The tool employ make easy catch student cheating say Professor Mehran Sahami associate professor computer science Stanford University
I would say computer science student violate honor code often dishonest
Sahami say computer science student mistakenly believe writing software code similar solving mathematical proof one correct answer exists
What student realize software code akin writing essay significant amount creativity involved
One thing happens computer science contributes cheating rate student unaware dissimilar program task really look Sahami say
They tend think OK copy portion someone else program
But tool discover
As college student study computer science number cheating incident rise
At University Washington total enrollment two introductory computer science course highest ever approaching student last four quarter compared student year ago
In two course assignment identified involving academic dishonesty Lazowska say
The top computer science school country experiencing trend
We see cheating
It something working hard stop number mean say Professor Lenny Pitt director undergraduate program Department Computer Science University Illinois
Cheating gone across many field easier find tool today
Cheating introductory computer science class typically involves homework assignment rather exam
Students get frustrated code wo run tempted borrow solution someone else
Because computer science assignment complicated need debugging professor assign homework several year row
That mean student find code written someone already taken course
There lot infrastructure need built lot effort go creating homework problem
There disincentive professor change problem every semester
So tend reassign similar problem cause cheating past solution available Pitt say adding University Illinois check homework repository past solution
The common form cheating involves excessive
Many student like collaborate point copying
Pitt asks
The course policy need really clear
Some course allow work pair triple
If follow policy would call cheating
At Stanford student allowed discus strategy solving homework problem need write code
You looking someone else program sharing computer science student Sahami say
Sahami say introductory computer science course require student code program course allow teamwork
We want learn mechanic first open world collaboration add
Students often resort cheating feel excessive pressure peer family excel professor say
Anecdotally see larger incidence cheating among foreign student domestic student I think part extreme pressure well succeed Pitt say
That pressure contributes idea need well possible even mean taking shortcut
Computer science professor say much copying excess collaboration go college course
Does anyone right mind think cheating happening large introductory course field
If smoking something Lazowska say
There several case faculty discipline adapted tool detect plagiarism term paper found plagiarism rate far greater typically encountered computer science course
As college recruiter traipse across country seeking best computer science graduate Class need aware rising incident cheating computer science course
Ethics huge issue IT industry copyright licensing privacy say David Foote CEO Foote Partners research firm tracking IT workforce management
Foote sits advisory council Hiram College Center Study Ethics Values
We need looking idea breed people concerned naturally issue ethic morality
For CIOs issue whether copying code homework assignment could lead prospective employee ethical lapse job
Businesses want hire worker wo get trouble software licensing patent infringement intellectual property problem
There enough program American university looking ethic cheating Foote say
Do pick computer science people
Pick fact university enough general calling attention cheating
Foote point incident excess collaboration qualify cheating college campus would encouraged industry want employee reuse software improve efficiency cut cost
In real world people write code team given piece project work Foote say
The academic world mapping onto real handing assignment people coding
To encourage collaboration Georgia Tech changed approach cheating introductory computer science course
Instead trying catch punish student excessive collaboration Georgia Tech requires student disclose name student helped complete homework
Students sign collaboration agreement explains Cedric Stallworth assistant dean Undergraduate Enrollment Georgia Tech College Computing
We realize computing one subject best learned group
If student using somebody else code learning right
To ensure student mastering material Georgia Tech requires give oral demonstration software work one teaching assistant
We worry le catching cheater
We worry properly assessing student skill set Stallworth say
Less percentage grade homework percentage assessment assessment designed truly measure skill
Then cheat homework going help assessment count bulk grade
Computer science professor think cheating result student unprepared take course
They seeing rise failure rate drop grade
Instead say student qualified ever
We seen increase failure rate Stanford Sahami say adding le student typically fail introductory computer class
This student body accepts failure
For pas class important thing
Lazowska say rising enrollment computer science course important trend resulting increase plagiarism case
An range student recognizing even major something else preparation computational thinking essential Lazowska say
There reason believe computer science student anything better ever

Glasgow Interactive Systems Group GIST Department Computer Science Glasgow University Glasgow
Tel Fax EMail This paper argues expanding scope science make difficult sustain traditional scientific engineering model research
In particular recent work formal method abandoned traditional empirical method
Similarly research requirement engineering human computer interaction challenged proponent formal method
These tension stem fact Science misnoma
Topics currently considered part discipline computing science technology rather theory driven
This creates problem academic department impose scientific criterion assessment PhDs
It therefore important people ask Research Computing Science starting higher degree
This paper intended high level introduction first year research student student advanced MSc course
It read conjunction research skill computing science
Good research practice suggests begin defining term
The Oxford Concise dictionary defines research However many reason approach unsatisfactory model research
The main objection carry high risk
For example artefact may fail long learn anything conclusion seeking support
Indeed often case approach ignores formation clear hypothesis conclusion artefact built
This may lead artefact become important researcher idea intended establish
The lack clear hypothesis need barrier might seem
The proof demonstration approach much common current engineering practice
Iterative refinement used move implementation gradually towards desired solution
The evidence elicited previous failed attempt used better define goal research work progress
The key problem iterative development artefact turn requires method structure
Engineers need carefully plan way fault found one iteration fed back subsequent development
This typically done testing technique based upon model scientific argument
This close relationship engineering scientific method surprising There many problem standard approach scientific empiricism applied computing science
The principle objection many aspect computing defy use probabilistic measure analysing result empirical test
For example many statistical measure rely upon independence test hypothesis
Such technique clearly used attempting measure performance system attempt optimise performance time rule load balancing algorithm etc
Secondly difficult impose standard experimental condition upon product computer science
For example program behaves one way one set operating condition guarantee behave way another set condition
These condition might go level alpha particle hitting memory chip
Thirdly difficult generalise result tightly controlled empirical experiment
For example user find system easy use evaluation guarantee another user able use product amidst distraction everyday working environment
Finally difficult determine sufficient number trial conducted support many hypothesis
For example attempt prove program always satisfies property almost certainly doomed failure using standard experimental technique The number potential execution path even simple code make impossible test property every possible execution path
The field mathematical reasoning research area right
It however possible identify two different approach use formal proof research technique computing science The first incredible care need made interpretation result mathematical proof
Formal method nothing system argumentation mistake expected
Problems arise mistake difficult detect given complex nature mathematics often used
Recall central feature empirical approach open peer review used check method correct
The second problem formal reasoning scope limited
Interactive time critical system pose specially challenge application mathematics
These issue addressed many problem remain
The third problem relates cost applying formal technique
It take long time acquire necessary skill
Similarly take several month conduct relatively simple proof medium large scale application
Finally argued inadequate discussion failure formal method
Again important recall failure prove hypothesis valuable result empirical technique
Exaggerated claim made formal reasoning typically researcher many claim falsified
As result error application mathematical reasoning seen source shame rather learning opportunity one colleague peer

Imagine trapped deserted island
You traveling cruise ship Pacific Ocean ship must hit something
All remember violently thrown ship
The next memory covered sand beach island
You quickly learn nine people
They cruise ship
Over following week survivor divvy task
Everything running smoothly suddenly one survivor get idea
This idea lead disagreement
The disagreement start try make land fertile fire
He start brush fire fire died plant seed scorched earth
Most group strongly disagree practice worry fire may get hand especially island densely forested
Nonetheless renegade keep convinces two people join side island
In previous life worked Wall Street episode eerily reminds Financial crisis
An individual look yet process risk bringing whole island civilization
think
risk similar systemic risk financial market
In lesson describe systemic risk discus type risk played large part financial crisis continues mind investor regulator day
risk collapse entire financial system market
This contrast risk collapse individual entity group component system
The key collapse link entity
It like disease
Often best way stop spread quarantine
If infected party mingle others ensue
This one failure interconnected system trigger failure part
Traffic good example systemic risk cascading failure
If one accident busy turnpike large ensue
Drivers know accident may decide get use local road enough driver think way local road get packed well
One accident spread entire transportation system rendered temporarily useless
Get FREE access day create account
An example systemic risk financial market occurred recently Financial Crisis
As read happened focus interlinks
Many believe crisis started subprime mortgage
These mortgage household poor credit
Throughout subprime mortgage bundled together specific tranche layer varying degree risk sold institutional investor
Eventually homeowner could afford mortgage started defaulting
The security bundle subprime mortgage started lose value
Many investment bank held security book
As started mark investment new lower value financial position became tenuous
And investment bank dependent loan finance operation
Soon creditor got nervous
Eventually Lehman Brothers major investment bank defaulted filed bankruptcy
As bank reeled bad investment shrank credit lent
This caused ripple effect throughout economy
Certain company individual needed credit could find
In short subprime mortgage market caught infected bank
Once bank got sick rest economy
In lesson learned risk collapse entire financial system market
You learned one event lead one failure interconnected system lead another failure trip another another

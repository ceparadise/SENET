Fully appeared second half century
The first digitally operated programmable robot installed lift hot piece metal stack
Commercial widespread today used perform job cheaply accurately reliably human
They also employed job dirty dangerous dull suitable human
Robots widely used assembly packing packaging mining transport earth surgery weaponry safety
There many type robot used many different environment many different us although diverse application form share three basic similarity come construction As robot designed specific task method classification becomes relevant
For example many robot designed assembly work may readily adaptable application
They termed assembly robot
For seam welding supplier provide complete welding system robot
welding equipment along material handling facility like turntable etc
integrated unit
Such integrated robotic system called welding robot even though discrete manipulator unit could adapted variety task
Some robot specifically designed heavy load manipulation labelled heavy duty robot
Current potential application include At present mostly used power source
Many different type battery used power source robot
They range battery safe relatively long shelf life rather heavy compared battery much smaller volume currently much expensive
Designing robot need take account factor safety cycle lifetime
Generators often type also used
However design often mechanically complex need fuel require heat dissipation relatively heavy
A tether connecting robot power supply would remove power supply robot entirely
This advantage saving weight space moving power generation storage component elsewhere
However design come drawback constantly cable connected robot difficult manage
Potential power source could Actuators robot part convert movement
By far popular actuator electric motor rotate wheel gear linear actuator control industrial robot factory
There recent advance alternative type actuator powered electricity chemical compressed air
The vast majority robot use electric motor often brushed brushless DC motor portable robot AC motor industrial robot machine
These motor often preferred system lighter load predominant form motion rotational
Various type linear actuator move instead spinning often quicker direction change particularly large force needed industrial robotics
They typically powered compressed oxidized air oil
A flexure designed part motor actuator improve safety provide robust force control energy efficiency shock absorption mechanical filtering reducing excessive wear transmission mechanical component
The resultant lower reflected inertia improve safety robot interacting human collision
It used various robot particularly advanced manufacturing robot walking robot
Pneumatic artificial muscle also known air muscle special tube expand typically air forced inside
They used robot application
Muscle wire also known shape memory alloy wire material contract electricity applied
They used small robot application
EAPs EPAMs new plastic material contract substantially activation strain electricity used facial muscle arm humanoid robot enable new robot float fly swim walk
Recent alternative DC motor
These work fundamentally different principle whereby tiny element vibrating many thousand time per second cause linear rotary motion
There different mechanism operation one type us vibration piezo element step motor circle straight line
Another type us piezo element cause nut vibrate drive screw
The advantage motor resolution speed available force size
These motor already available commercially used robot
Elastic nanotube promising artificial muscle technology experimental development
The absence defect enables filament deform elastically several percent energy storage level perhaps metal nanotube
Human biceps could replaced mm diameter wire material
Such compact muscle might allow future robot outrun outjump human
Sensors allow robot receive information certain measurement environment internal component
This essential robot perform task act upon change environment calculate appropriate response
They used various form measurement give robot warning safety malfunction provide information task performing

Recent research developed tactile sensor array mimic mechanical property touch receptor human fingertip
The sensor array constructed rigid core surrounded conductive fluid contained elastomeric skin
Electrodes mounted surface rigid core connected device within core
When artificial skin touch object fluid path around electrode deformed producing impedance change map force received object
The researcher expect important function artificial fingertip adjusting robotic grip held object
Scientists several developed hand called SmartHand function like real patient write type play piano perform fine movement
The prosthesis sensor enable patient sense real feeling fingertip
science technology machine see
As scientific discipline computer vision concerned theory behind artificial system extract information image
The image data take many form video sequence view camera
In practical computer vision application computer solve particular task method based learning becoming increasingly common
Computer vision system rely image sensor detect electromagnetic radiation typically form either
The sensor designed using
The process light propagates reflects surface explained using
Sophisticated image sensor even require provide complete understanding image formation process
Robots also equipped multiple vision sensor better able compute sense depth environment
Like human eye robot eye must also able focus particular area interest also adjust variation light intensity
There subfield within computer vision artificial system designed mimic processing behavior different level complexity
Also method developed within computer vision background biology
Other common form sensing robotics use
Robots need manipulate object pick modify destroy otherwise effect
Thus hand robot often referred arm referred
Most robot arm replaceable effector allowing perform small range task
Some fixed manipulator replaced one general purpose manipulator example humanoid hand
Learning manipulate robot often requires close feedback human robot although several method remote manipulation robot
One common effector gripper
In simplest manifestation consists two finger open close pick let go range small object
Fingers example made chain metal wire run
Hands resemble work like human hand include hand
Hands complexity include hand
Mechanical grippers come various type including friction encompassing jaw
Friction jaw use force gripper hold object place using friction
Encompassing jaw cradle object place using le friction
Vacuum grippers simple astrictive device hold large load provided surface smooth enough ensure suction
Pick place robot electronic component large object like car windscreen often use simple vacuum grippers
Some advanced robot beginning use fully humanoid hand like Shadow Hand MANUS hand
These highly dexterous manipulator many hundred tactile sensor
For simplicity mobile robot four number
Some researcher tried create complex wheeled robot one two wheel
These certain advantage greater efficiency reduced part well allowing robot navigate confined place robot would able
Balancing robot generally use detect much robot falling drive wheel proportionally direction counterbalance fall hundred time per second based dynamic
Many different balancing robot designed
While commonly thought robot thought component robot used Segway refer RMP Robotic Mobility Platform
An example use mounted Segway
A balancing robot extension balancing robot move direction using round ball wheel
Several balancing robot designed recently approximate height width person BallIP
Because long thin shape ability maneuver tight space potential function better robot environment people
Several attempt made robot completely inside spherical ball either spinning weight inside ball rotating outer shell sphere
These also referred ball bot
Using six wheel instead four wheel give better traction grip outdoor terrain rocky dirt grass
Tank track provide even traction robot
Tracked wheel behave made hundred wheel therefore common outdoor military robot robot must drive rough terrain
However difficult use indoors carpet smooth floor
Examples include NASA Urban Robot Urbie
Walking difficult dynamic problem solve
Several robot made walk reliably two leg however none yet made robust human
There much study human inspired walking AMBER lab established Mechanical Engineering Department Texas A M University
Many robot built walk two leg due robot significantly easier construct
Walking robot used uneven terrain would provide better mobility energy efficiency locomotion method
Hybrids proposed movie walk two leg switch four going sprint
Typically robot two leg walk well flat floor occasionally walk
None walk rocky uneven terrain
Some method tried The zero moment point ZMP algorithm used robot
The robot onboard computer try keep total combination deceleration walking exactly opposed floor force floor pushing back robot foot
In way two force cancel leaving force causing robot rotate fall
However exactly human walk difference obvious human observer pointed ASIMO walk need
ASIMO walking algorithm static dynamic balancing used see
However still requires smooth surface walk
Several robot built Leg Laboratory successfully demonstrated dynamic walking
Initially robot one leg small foot could stay upright simply
The movement person
As robot fall one side would jump slightly direction order catch
Soon algorithm generalised two four leg
A bipedal robot demonstrated running even performing
A also demonstrated could run bound
For full list robot see MIT Leg Lab Robots page
A advanced way robot walk using dynamic balancing algorithm potentially robust Zero Moment Point technique constantly monitor robot motion place foot order maintain stability
This technique recently demonstrated Dexter Robot stable even jump
Another example
Perhaps promising approach utilizes swinging limb used greater
It shown totally unpowered humanoid mechanism walk gentle slope using propel
Using technique robot need supply small amount motor power walk along flat surface little walk
This technique promise make walking robot least ten time efficient ZMP walker like ASIMO
A modern essentially robot two human manage
The control plane stage journey including takeoff normal flight even landing
Other flying robot uninhabited known UAVs
They smaller lighter without human pilot board fly dangerous territory military surveillance mission
Some even fire target command
UAVs also developed fire target automatically without need command human
Other flying robot include Entomopter
Robots Air Penguin Air Ray Air Jelly body propelled paddle guided sonar
Several robot successfully developed
Mimicking way real snake move robot navigate confined space meaning may one day used search people trapped collapsed building
The Japanese snake robot even navigate land water
A small number robot developed one walking skating device
It four leg unpowered wheel either step roll
Another robot Plen use miniature skateboard skate across desktop
Several different approach used develop robot ability climb vertical surface
One approach mimic movement human wall protrusion adjusting moving limb turn gain leverage
An example Capuchin built Ruixiang Zhang Stanford University California
Another approach us specialized toe pad method run smooth surface vertical glass
Examples approach include Wallbot Stickybot
China reported November Li Hiu Yeung research group New Concept Aircraft successfully developed bionic gecko robot named
According Li gecko robot could rapidly climb variety building wall navigate ground wall fissure walk ceiling
It also able adapt surface smooth glass rough sticky dusty wall well various type metallic material
It could also identify circumvent obstacle automatically
Its flexibility speed comparable natural gecko
A third approach mimic motion snake climbing pole

It calculated fish achieve efficiency greater
Furthermore accelerate maneuver far better produce le noise water disturbance
Therefore many researcher studying underwater robot would like copy type locomotion
Notable example Robotic Fish Robot Tuna built Institute Field Robotics analyze mathematically model
The Aqua Penguin designed built Festo Germany copy streamlined shape propulsion front flipper
Festo also built Aqua Ray Aqua Jelly emulate locomotion manta ray jellyfish respectively
In developed PhD student Richard James Clapham Huosheng Hu Essex University
It first robotic fish capable outperforming real carangiform fish term average maximum velocity measured body second endurance duration top speed maintained
This build attained swimming speed

The first build first robotic platform apply length swimming motion found increase swimming speed traditional approach posterior confined waveform
Sailboat robot also developed order make measurement surface ocean
A typical sailboat robot built IFREMER
Since propulsion sailboat robot us wind energy battery used computer communication actuator tune rudder sail
If robot equipped solar panel robot could theoretically navigate forever
The two main competition sailboat robot take place every year Europe
Though significant percentage robot commission today either human controlled operate static environment increasing interest robot operate autonomously dynamic environment
These robot require combination order traverse environment
In particular unforeseen event
people obstacle stationary cause problem collision
Some highly advanced robot particularly good robot navigation hardware software
Also entry capable sensing environment well subsequently making navigational decision based information
Most robot employ navigation device waypoints along sometimes combined sensory data better navigation waypoints
The state art sensory intelligence robot progress several order magnitude want robot working home go beyond floor
If robot work effectively home environment way instructed perform job especially told stop critical importance
The people interact may little training robotics interface need extremely intuitive
Science fiction author also typically assume robot eventually capable communicating human rather
Although speech would natural way human communicate unnatural robot
It probably long time robot interact naturally fictional
Interpreting continuous flow coming human difficult task computer mostly great variability
The spoken person may sound different depending local previous word whether speaker
It becomes even harder speaker different
Nevertheless great stride made field since Davis Biddulph Balashek designed first voice input system recognized ten digit spoken single user accuracy
Currently best system recognize continuous natural speech word per minute accuracy
Other hurdle exist allowing robot use voice interacting human
For social reason prof suboptimal communication medium making necessary develop emotional component robotic voice various technique
One imagine future explaining robot chef make pastry asking direction robot police officer
In case making hand would aid verbal description
In first case robot would recognizing gesture made human perhaps repeating confirmation
In second case robot police officer would gesture indicate road turn right
It likely gesture make part interaction human robot
A great many system developed recognize human hand gesture
Facial expression provide rapid feedback progress dialog two human soon may able human robot
Robotic face constructed using elastic polymer called allowing large number facial expression due elasticity rubber facial coating embedded subsurface motor
The coating servo built metal
A robot know approach human judging facial expression
Whether person happy frightened affect type interaction expected robot
Likewise robot like recent addition Nexi produce range facial expression allowing meaningful social exchange human
Artificial emotion also generated composed sequence facial expression gesture
As seen movie programming artificial emotion complex requires large amount human observation
To simplify programming movie presets created together special software program
This decreased amount time needed make film
These presets could possibly transferred use robot
Many robot science fiction something may may desirable commercial robot future
Nevertheless researcher trying create robot appear personality
use sound facial expression body language try convey internal state may joy sadness fear
One commercial example toy robot dinosaur exhibit several apparent emotion
The Socially Intelligent Machines Lab research new concept guided teaching interaction robot
The aim project social robot learns task goal human demonstration without prior knowledge concept
These new concept grounded continuous sensor data task goal subsequently learned using Bayesian approach
These concept used transfer knowledge future task resulting faster learning task
The result demonstrated robot scoop pasta pot onto plate serve sauce top
The structure robot must controlled perform task
The control robot involves three distinct phase perception processing action
give information environment robot
position joint end effector
This information processed stored transmitted calculate appropriate signal actuator move mechanical
The processing phase range complexity
At reactive level may translate raw sensor information directly actuator command
may first used estimate parameter interest
position robot gripper noisy sensor data
An immediate task moving gripper certain direction inferred estimate
Techniques convert task command drive actuator
At longer time scale sophisticated task robot may need build reason cognitive model
Cognitive model try represent robot world interact
Pattern recognition computer vision used track object
technique used build map world
Finally technique may used figure act
For example planner may figure achieve task without hitting obstacle falling etc
Control system may also varying level autonomy
Another classification take account interaction human control machine motion

Because robot would incapable however Moravec predicts robot would improvement become available intelligence maybe comparable
The robot intelligence comparable
Though robot robot intelligence professor Moravec predicts would become possible predict happening around
The second
This us help design robot especially body form motion behavior
In similar way large population robot allowed compete way ability perform task measured using
Those perform worst removed population replaced new set new behavior based winner
Over time population improves eventually satisfactory robot may appear
This happens without direct programming robot researcher
Researchers use method create better robot explore nature evolution
Because process often requires many generation robot simulated technique may run entirely mostly tested real robot evolved algorithm good enough
Currently million industrial robot toiling around world Japan top country high density utilizing robot manufacturing industry
The study motion divided
Direct kinematics refers calculation end effector position orientation corresponding joint value known
refers opposite case required joint value calculated given end effector value done path planning
Some special aspect kinematics include handling redundancy different possibility performing movement avoidance avoidance
Once relevant position velocity acceleration calculated using method field used study effect upon movement
Direct dynamic refers calculation acceleration robot applied force known
Direct dynamic used robot
refers calculation actuator force necessary create prescribed acceleration
This information used improve control algorithm robot

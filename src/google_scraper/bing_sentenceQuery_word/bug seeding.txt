The Ariane rocket successor Ariane used European Space Agency launch spacecraft
ended causing crash maiden voyage resulting loss million
Integer overflow common bug
It happens try fit number larger biggest number memory allocated store
For example allocate four box memory largest number store
If try store say four box integer overflow occur
Like device add current number whenever press button
What happens get press button
It reset A similar thing happens computer computer course use binary decimal idea
There piece code converted number relating horizontal speed rocket number used box binary
AKA bit something box available bit floating point bit integer
This fine Ariane since number never required box
However Ariane much faster rocket Ariane
On maiden voyage conversion took place number big fit box
Which resulted overflow cascaded control led crash le minute launch resulting one expensive software bug history
Edit Sources Edit From another source seems like number relating horizontal velocity horizontal velocity

Very simple question
What term mean general
I put context must seed random function
Most random function common personal computer random deterministic degree
The function starting point upon future value based
This useful debugging purpose keep seed execution execution get number
To get number random different seed often used execution execution
This often based time machine
This method completely different generating random number based sort physical property world around u
Lava lamp sun spot two property observed generate random number
Anyone hit get real random number truly neccessary like poker website
If good generator folk attempt figure generator work predict future number
It mean pick place start
Think pseudo random number generator really long list number
This list circular eventually repeat
To use need pick starting place
This called seed
Seeding random function prevents giving sequence random number
Think start random generator
number generator use seed seed determine starting point sequence
Some always make sequence others produce different sequence depending seed
Some use cascade simple RNG given simple seed run produce complex seed masterpiece RNG
It quite useful able deliberately repeat sequence developing program one wish reproduce previous result
However imagine card game
It obviously good idea always deal sequence card

The software industry put much effort reducing bug count
These include Bugs usually appear programmer make
Various innovation designed make bug le likely easier spot
Some typo especially symbol allow program operate incorrectly others missing symbol misspelled name may prevent program operating
Compiled language reveal typo source code compiled
Several scheme assist managing programmer activity fewer bug produced
address software design issue well applies many technique prevent defect
For example formal state exact behavior program design bug may eliminated
Unfortunately formal specification impractical anything shortest program problem
involves writing test every function unit program perform
In unit test written code code considered complete test complete successfully
involves frequent software release relatively small change
Defects revealed user feedback
Open source development allows anyone examine source code
A school thought popularized say popular chance bug software given enough eyeball bug shallow
This assertion disputed however computer security specialist wrote easy hide vulnerability complex little understood undocumented source code even people reviewing code mean qualified
An example actually happening accidentally
include feature help prevent bug static restricted
For example programmer writes pseudocode although may syntactically correct code fails
Compiled language catch without run program
Interpreted language catch error runtime
Some language deliberate exclude feature easily lead bug expense slower performance general principle almost always better write simpler slower code inscrutable code run slightly faster especially considering substantial
For example support arithmetic implementation language often runtime array least debugging build
Tools help developer inspecting program text beyond compiler capability spot potential problem
Although general problem finding programming error given specification solvable see tool exploit fact human programmer tend make certain kind simple mistake often writing software
Tools monitor performance software running either specifically find problem give assurance correct working may embedded code explicitly perhaps simple statement saying provided tool
It often surprise find time taken piece code removal assumption might cause code rewritten
people whose primary task find bug write code support testing
On project resource may spent testing developing program
Measurements testing provide estimate number likely bug remaining becomes reliable longer product tested developed
Finding fixing bug major part
early computing pioneer described realization late much rest life would spent finding mistake program
Usually difficult part debugging finding bug
Once found correcting usually relatively easy
Programs known help programmer locate bug executing code line line watching variable value feature observe program behavior
Without debugger code may added message value may written console window log file trace program execution show value
However even aid debugger locating bug something art
It uncommon bug one section program cause failure completely different section thus making especially difficult track example error graphic routine causing file routine fail apparently unrelated part system
Sometimes bug isolated flaw represents error thinking planning part programmer
Such require section program overhauled rewritten
As part stepping code imagining transcribing execution process may often find error without ever reproducing bug
More typically first step locating bug reproduce reliably
Once bug reproducible programmer may use debugger tool reproducing error find point program went astray
Some bug revealed input may difficult programmer
One cause radiation machine death bug specifically occurred machine operator rapidly entered treatment plan took day practice become able bug manifest testing manufacturer attempted duplicate
Other bug may disappear program run debugger humorously named
Since particularly following disaster interest automated aid debugging rose
Some class bug nothing code
Faulty documentation hardware may lead problem system use even though code match documentation
In case change code eliminate problem even though code longer match documentation
frequently hardware bug since make new version much cheaper remanufacturing hardware especially
Bug management includes process documenting categorizing assigning reproducing correcting releasing corrected code
Proposed change software bug well enhancement request even entire release commonly tracked managed using
The item added may called defect ticket issue following paradigm story epic
Categories may objective subjective combination area software severity priority well type issue feature request bug
impact bug system operation
This impact may data loss financial loss goodwill wasted effort
Severity level standardized
Impacts differ across industry
A crash video game totally different impact crash web browser real time monitoring system
For example bug severity level might crash hang workaround meaning way customer accomplish given task workaround meaning user still accomplish task visual defect example missing image displaced button form element documentation error
Some software publisher use qualified severity critical high low blocker trivial
The severity bug may separate category priority fixing two may quantified managed separately
control bug fall list planned change
The priority decided software producer
Priorities sometimes numerical sometimes named critical high low deferred note may similar even identical severity rating looking different software producer
For example priority bug may always fixed next release bug may never fixed
Industry practice employ inverted scale highest priority low number larger number indicate lower priority
It common practice release software known bug
Most big software project maintain two list known bug known software team told user
The second list informs user bug fixed specific release may offered
Releases different kind
Bugs sufficiently high priority may warrant special release part code containing module fix
These known
Most release include mixture behavior change multiple bug fix
Releases emphasize bug fix known release
Releases emphasize feature known major release often name distinguish new feature old
Reasons software publisher opts patch even fix particular bug include In software development project mistake fault may introduced stage
Bugs arise oversight misunderstanding made software team specification design coding data entry documentation
For example relatively simple program alphabetize list word design might fail consider happen word contains
Or converting abstract design code coder might inadvertently create fail sort last word list
Errors may simple typing error intended
Another category bug called may occur program multiple component executing time
If component interact different order developer intended could interfere stop program completing task
These bug may difficult detect anticipate since may occur every execution program
Conceptual error developer misunderstanding software must
The resulting software may perform according developer understanding really needed
Other type The amount type damage software bug may cause naturally affect process policy regarding software quality
In application since software flaw potential cause human injury even death software far scrutiny quality control example online shopping website
In application banking software flaw potential cause serious financial damage bank customer quality control also important say photo editing application
NASA managed reduce number error fewer per line code felt feasible project business world
A number software bug become usually due severity example include various space military aircraft crash
Possibly famous bug also known bug feared worldwide economic collapse would happen start year result computer thinking
In end major problem occurred

I taking grad class software testing spent whole class difference fault error failure
I dissatisfied definition software fault testing
What definition
You might interested podcast iirc described A occurs observed behaviour differs expected one
Note reference expected behaviour specification since even spec could false
An part system state may lead failure
A cause error
A software fault lie software hardware fault lie hardware
You find deep overview dependability concept Algirdas Laprie Brian Randell
According ISQTB fault defect
There definition defect follows A flaw component system cause component system fail perform required function
incorrect statement data definition
A defect encountered execution may cause failure component system
Deviation component system expected delivery service result
Basically defect bug error
In reality matter
Academic paper tend map terminology use
In industry certainly accepted definition
Moreover one industry care difference might
Fault error failure bug treated
error may human error requirement spec fault error lead fault developer misunderstands requirement code per understanding lead error actual code
failure fault lead failure developer wrong coding give incorrect may lead failure application
Error A discrepancy computed observed measured value condition true specified theoretically correct value condition
This misunderstanding internal state software oversight term memory management confusion proper way calculate value etc
Failure The inability system component perform required function within specified performance requirement
See bug crash exception fault
Bug A fault program cause program perform unintended unanticipated manner
See anomaly defect error exception fault
Bug terminology Tester
Fault An incorrect step process data definition computer program cause program perform unintended unanticipated manner
See bug defect error exception
Defect Commonly refers several trouble software product external behavior internal feature
Error The programmer make mistake also called error Defect The programmer introduces bug also called defect code
Bug The tester executes part software contains bug
tester observes discrepancy application incident
developer confirms Incidents Bug
Bug present application Fault
Fault cause system fail called Failure
Software Testing Perspective mean think Software Tester testing ready made software
First test find fault defect
check software state different actual expected state error
error lead failure
Fault software condition cause system fail performing required function

How I teach random number generator algorithm
I like show seeding make randomization closer truly random
Details task given follows Code read text file
The file random word one word line
This dataset word selected randomly
I unsure explain difference deterministic randomization randomization using example
This question came site involved field teaching Computer Science
So much depends language library using
If tool using allows feeding specific seed I would start demonstrating using seed give set random number time
If tool us system time seed many create several random data set tight look show
This several random set tight loop something student often accident BTW
It give end trouble see identical number
Then demonstrate code give different first example random number used different seed
With example using random number seed would return word every time
Using time based seed normally return different word time

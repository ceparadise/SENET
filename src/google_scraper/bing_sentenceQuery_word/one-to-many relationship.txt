A occurs record Table A may many linked record Table B record Table B may one corresponding record Table A
A relationship database common relational database design heart good design
Consider relationship teacher course teach
A teacher teach multiple course course would relationship teacher
Therefore record Teachers table could many record Courses table
This relationship one teacher multiple course
To represent relationship need least two table
Let see
Perhaps created Teachers table wanted record name course taught
We might design like What Carmen teach two course
We two option design
We could add Carmen existing record like The design however inflexible could result problem later trying insert edit delete data
It make difficult search data
This design violates first principle database normalization state table cell contain single discrete piece data
Another design alternative might simply add second record Carmen This adheres still poor database design introduces redundancy could bloat large database unnecessarily
More importantly data could become inconsistent
For example Carmen name changed
Someone working data might update name one record fail update second record
This design violates Second Normal Form adheres must also avoid redundancy multiple record separating subset data multiple table creating relationship
To implement relationship Teachers Courses table break table two link using
Here removed Course column Teachers table And Courses table
Note foreign key link course teacher Teachers table We developed relationship Teachers Courses table using foreign key
This tell u Biology Math taught Carmen Jorge teach English
We see design avoids possible redundancy allows individual teacher teach multiple course implement relationship
Databases also implement relationship relationship

In relational database relationship occurs parent record one table potentially reference several child record another table
In relationship parent required child record therefore relationship allows zero child record single child record multiple child record
The important thing child one parent record
The opposite relationship relationship child record link back several parent record
Consider database recording sale information store
There two table database The SALES table contains foreign key reference column name CUSTOMER table track customer sale made
A single sale transaction apply one customer one customer many sale transaction course time
This logic defined relationship
One example one customer many sale transaction
The relationship principle database design explicitly defined database structure
Instead implicitly created enforced use relationship table especially relationship primary key foreign key

A relationship refers relationship table database parent row one table contains several child row second table vice versa
relationship often tricky represent
The relationship usually mirror relationship object two table represent
A database used school application taken example
Two table contains Student Subject
In real life student take several subject simultaneously subject studied several student time
This relationship
In database relationship broken intermediary table
In school example may take form third table contains column Semester Year
For student take certain subject certain semester certain year row entered table
The read Student master table read Subject master table
In way many student related many subject
Another example relationship employee department
Each department number employee working specific task
Similarly employee also work multiple department one time
Therefore number department employee simultaneously linked creating intermediary table link using

What real difference one many many one relationship
It reversed kind
I ca find tutorial topic one Yes vice versa
It depends side relationship entity present
For example one department employ several employee department employee one many department employ many employee employee department relationship many one many employee work one department
relationship type Most relation table
Example A Many One relation different viewpoint
What real difference one many many one relationship
There conceptual difference term help visualize data also difference generated schema fully understood
Mostly difference one perspective though
In relationship local table one row may associated many row another table
In example one may associated many In opposite relationship local table may many row associated one row another table
In example many may associated one
This conceptual difference important mental representation
In addition schema support relationship represented differently table
If customer column Then associated many SQL implementation add table column store associated schema In data row look id column see order associated one one
order
What important realize typically relationship actually add column table one
The extra column describe relationship
In fact might also relationship table yet additional column added table
However relationship described often column added many table one table case column added
To associated order assign column id
Hope help
Answer first question similar Answer second question MAN MAN table may one wife WOMEN table one woman married one MAN
Now want relate relation two table MAN WOMEN one MAN table row may many relation row WOMEN table
hope clear
There difference
It matter language preference way round state relationship
similar Multiplicity Aspect
Directionality
The mapping entity class table
There two category Relationships There practical difference
Just use relationship make sense given way see problem Devendra illustrated

Relational database allow data separated connected across several table
Tables connected primary foreign key increase efficiency
The main characteristic When working relational database user need try keep
Each entity primary key provide unique reference entity mean entity referenced another table without call detail entity

Matt Clark explains BBC Sport us relational database store access information appears website Entities relate three different way You represent relationship using entity relationship diagram ERD
For example person address
For example cinema customer
For example subject taken student

Ok probably trivial question I trouble visualizing understanding difference use
I also little unclear concept like mapping affect relationship
I using Hibernate right explanation ORM related helpful
As example let say I following So case kind mapping would I
Answers specific example definitely appreciated I would also really like overview use either use join table versus join column unidirectional versus bidirectional
One Person Has Many Skills Skill reused Person One Person Has Many Skills Skill reused Person In relationship one object parent one child
The parent control existence child
In existence either type dependent something outside larger application context
Your subject matter domain dictate whether relationship however I find making relationship unidirectional bidirectional engineering decision trade memory processing performance etc
What confusing Bidirectional relationship need symmetric
That bunch People could point skill skill need relate back people
Typically would symmetry requirement
Take love example often asymmetric I love love
All well supported Hibernate JPA
Just remember Hibernate ORM give hoot maintaining symmetry managing relationship thats application
Looks like everyone answering v The difference
v affect mapping make difference access data
In class
In property added allows access given skill

In
additional class
The circle deg abbreviation degree graph number edge key key Note contradiction degree name side
Many corresponds One corresponds degree
Take look article There two category object relationship need concerned mapping
The first category based multiplicity includes three type The second category based directionality contains two type relationship relationship
would probably call relation ship follows may need define joinTable JoinColumn possible work also without First read fine print
Note NHibernate thus I assume Hibernate well relational mapping funny correspondance DB object graph mapping
For example relationship often implemented relationship
Second tell write map see DB well
In particular single Skill posse multiple people
If relationship otherwise
Third I prefer implement relationship directly instead model join table domain model treat entity like Then see
You two relationship
In case Person may collection PersonSkills would collection Skills
However prefer use relationship Person Skill controversial
Fourth bidirectional relationship Person collection Skills also Skill collection Persons NHibernate enforce bidirectionality BL understands bidirectionality relationship persistence purpose
Fifth much easier use correctly NHibernate I assume Hibernate collection mapping
Good luck

I trying separate weird relationship
It go like There two relationship share waiter separately resolved
But share waiter entity many kind drink served wearing many kind shirt
The relational model look like My question I resolve
It look like lends easily decomposed relationship
Edit I changed image fit better description problem result entity still exist result normalizing drink waiter relationship many waiter shirt also
The resulting entity relationship
Where I wrong
If rightly assume trying convert diagram relation table procedure convert relationship relation create one table apart table create entity
This new table created relationship attribute column PKey constituting entity
In case table contain attribute namely
Had working relationship would augment one column table many side instead creating another relation

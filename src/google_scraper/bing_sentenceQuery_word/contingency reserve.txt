An important part project planning developing accurate budget
Depending complexity project budget planning may relatively simple task could intense
On small project budget may include cost labor large project may include multiple phase include labor fee material
Over life project likely amount labor material needed project may vary budgeted amount
It also possible price labor material change creating variance actual cost project
These unfavorable variance mitigated budgeting budgeted amount intended cover anticipated cost overage unfavorable budget variance
There two primary method used estimate contingency reserve one slightly complex
The first simply requires project team decide percentage variance apply cost project
For example project team feel need contingency reserve project would add cost project total project cost
Sometimes different percentage used labor material
Depending project team source labor project labor cost may easier budget material
For project let assume budgeted material labor
The project team may confident labor budget worry volatile cost material
To address could budget contingency labor material
In case total contingency would material labor
That total project cost around cheaper cost calculated contingency entire project cost
Using different contingency rate labor material sometimes called
For large project especially complex project multiple phase even using mixed rate labor material specific enough calculate accurate contingency
In situation project team may decide use expected monetary value method
The calculation considers different potential price variation among different category labor material
Here look excerpt sample expected monetary value calculation
In example chance budget category correct
Also category assigned probability favorable unfavorable variance
By multiplying probability variance budget category calculated
The total expected variance category expected variance whole project
Using example total contingency least considering hourly labor concrete would meaning budget potential cost overage
This budget cost overage labor also expect save concrete
We add together get impact whole project

There something important remember expected monetary value calculation
You may wondering use methodology developing budget
Well project team probably
That contingency calculation variance budget chance right
We basically saying likely scenario budget accurate
But calculate contingency reserve recalculating budget determining best estimate potential cost variance

Throughout project duration financial statement project become based actual cost instead budgeted cost contingency reserve may shrink may grow
Sometimes project cost overage sometimes budget conservative certain aspect cost much expected
When project nearing completion contingency reserve still healthy balance question often arise money
There right answer different organization different priority
Some may choose move back operation organization another project account may running budget
Other time contingency reserve becomes list budget project team us pay feature project extra budgeted would like include
Preparing accurate budget complex project difficult task
The actual price labor material well exact amount needed uncertain
To help mitigate risk cost significantly higher expected derailing project budgeted help cover anticipated unfavorable budget variance
A contingency reserve calculated using contingency
To calculate flat rate mixed rate contingency percentage budgeted cost added labor material
Expected monetary value complex considering likely favorable unfavorable variance calculating expected variance category
The total expected variance becomes contingency reserve whole project
At end project remaining contingency reserve used however management project team chooses
Often used operation another project time fund list addition feature project team want include

A contingency reserve context insurance amount money insurer set aside legal requirement cover unexpected unforeseen loss
It may used pay claim underwriting expense event money brought premium loss reserve enough cover cost
It also sometimes called contingency surplus
Contingency reserve essentially act sort emergency fund called upon time great need
For example property insurance company business area suddenly experience great hurricane may need dip contingency reserve help pay expense
Although contingency fund used balance risk reinsurance policy also taken purpose

Contingency reserve share similarity personal emergency saving account
Hemera Images For small business unforeseen expense devastating consequence
For instance say estimated project cost material supplier increased price since last order
Or quoted customer based hour labor actually take hour
Such overrun always possibility explains company establish contingency reserve
A contingency reserve typically money might also include additional labor time complete project
It part project budget
The purpose reserve provide cushion surprise
You might able anticipate contingency small price increase material duration project others might completely unexpected
For example probably would anticipate primary supplier padlock placed door due tax lien
Establishing contingency reserve part risk management
Before determine amount reserve need must analyze potential risk
Examine past project identify cause cost overrun determine amount overrun note often event occur
Focus significant overrun identified analyzing risk
Assign dollar amount includes cost directly related specific project loss resulted
For example reassign staff finish project time resulted overtime conduct physical inventory done straight time include overtime pay
Adding overrun give base number use establish initial contingency reserve
Dividing total overrun total associated revenue give percentage use contingency reserve
Use percentage calculate amount need reserve current future project
For company percentage percent percent project budget
Establishing separate bank account transferring money regularly allows maximum separation reserve fund operating fund
However also acceptable create separate cash account balance sheet make virtual transfer via journal entry
If use separate bank account transfer fund back operating account write check drawn reserve account pay bill need use contingency fund

By I talked time discus contingency reserve management reserve
These two kind reserve serve purpose managing risk
Since purpose many people mix concept together
Some think two term synonym
Others think calculated percentage cost time project
Contingency reserve management reserve different calculated different technique
Although serve purpose
managing risk manage different
Okay let discus detail
Contingency reserve cost time reserve used manage identified risk
Contingency reserve random reserve estimated reserve based various risk management technique Decision Tree Method
This reserve controlled project manager
The project manager full authority use whenever identified risk occurs
He also delegate authority risk owner use reserve time risk occurring
The project manager updated later stage
Management reserve cost time reserve used manage unidentified risk
Management reserve estimated reserve random figure defined according organization policy
For organization total cost time project others
Usually management reserve guessed based overall uncertainty project
For example project organization expertise management reserve le case le uncertainty
However new kind project organization le expertise management reserve high case uncertainty
Management reserve controlled project manager managed someone outside project team usually someone management
Whenever unidentified risk occurs project manager get approval management use management reserve
Management reserve used emergency
It basically used avoid situation need urgent money organization say additional money available project
Many organization try avoid using kind reserve think project manager come every time get approval keep separate
According project manager come time need extra money need management reserve
You wondering I brought cost management concept
They important must understand relation contingency management reserve
Without contingency management reserve cost baseline project budget estimated
Let discus detail
The cost estimate cost work package rolled top level
This total cost project
When add contingency reserve cost estimate get cost baseline
Cost Baseline Cost Estimate Contingency Reserve Please note cost baseline performance baseline measure project performance
If add management reserve cost baseline get project budget
Project Budget Cost Baseline Management Reserve The following difference contingency reserve management reserve Contingency reserve management reserve kept manage risk
Contingency reserve used manage identified risk management reserve used manage unidentified risk
A project manager authority use contingency reserve management reserve need management permission
Contingency reserve calculated reserve based various technique Expected Monetary Value EMV Decision Tree Method management reserve percentage cost estimate example estimated cost project

This topic important PMP exam point view
You may see question topic PMP Test
I undersrtood following
Neither CR MR included cost baseline

The CR included project budget required funding
The MR incliuded project budget required funding The exposure draft Edition PMBOK Guide espouses following
The CR included cost baselne
The MR included cost baseline included project budget required funding What thought
As per PMBOK Guide Edition Cost base line sum project cost estimate contingency reserve
Cost Baseline Project Cost Estimate Contingency Reserve And project budget sum project cost base line management reserve
Project Budget Cost Baseline Management Reserve Therefore Management Reserve part cost baseline part project budget Contingency Reserve part cost baseline well project budget
Hope answer query
Since I reviewed exposure draft PMBOK Guide edition thoroughly I would comment
However information provided comment section agreeing current version PMBOK Guide
edition
I respectfully disagree assessment current PMBOK Guide Edition position regarding Management Reserves Contingency Reserves
I would ask review following article Max Wideman PMI Fellow PMBOK Guide Edition Second Para bottom This baseline includes authorized budget excludes Management Reserves Please note PMBOK exclude Contingency cost baseline excludes Management reserve
PMBOK Guide Edition Point
Budget reserve analysis establish Contingency Reserve Management Reserves Project PMBOK Guide Edition Point
Management Reserves part project cost baseline may included total budget project As per understanding PMBOK trying say cost baseline includes Contingency Reserves Management Reserves
An additional question If negative risk theat actively accepted good practice would require develop contingent plan action response woulf executed thwe risk realized
The implementation response would require use established formal change control procedure modify scope schedule cost baseline necessary
If modification cost baseline estiblished Contingency Reserve Management Reserve money would fund cover contingent response come
If identified risk occurs fund Contingency Reserves used otherwise Management Reserved used taking required approval management
It fact cost baseline sum cost estimate work package
Every dollar cost baseline must linked component project scope
If replied earlier Contingency Reserve CR fund included baseline element scope tied possibly moved funding contingent response actively accepted risk
The PMBOK Guide Edition Page Article say Cost estimate may include contingency reserve sometimes called contingency allowance account cost uncertainty
This separate reserve known CR reserve tied anything
Just calculated reserve identified risk
I one Question regarding Secondary Risk covered Contingency Or Management reserve
Thank Since known identified risk covered contingency reserve
Usmani broad explantion Cost Baseline Project Budjet Contingency v Management Reserve scope extremily clear
Nevertheless I founded reviewing PMBOK edition definition EMV Decission Tree Method technique estimate CR
Are technique aplicable estimation referred Risk Management Reserves applicable general Project Cost Estimates
Could please explain rougly fundamental give example
Additionally positive risk achieved automaticly traduced increment CR
Is Project Maneger decission
Many thanks Arturo Sorry Usmani
Reviewing detatil PMBOK edition I found EVM use within Descision Tree Method I think I understand rougly fundamental style I lost application estimate CR I still need example possible
Thanks It wish list
Sure going see blog post decision tree method coming stay tuned
EVM EMV useful concept
I already covered EVM aim EMV
Hullo Fahad I stay tuned exited looking EMV desission tree method example
Regarding CR I something clarify positive risk achieved automaticly traduced increment CR
Is Project Maneger decission
Many thanks Arturo If identified risk occurs effect reflect contingency reserve regardless whether positive negative
This decision already factored project management plan
Nice post risk probability occurance calculate Contingency management reserve
Hello Nora To calculate Contingency Reserve must probability risk impact
Once get multiply probability impact
Repeat procedure risk add
Result contingency reserve
Management reserve percentage cost project
It may vary
First thanks nice post
My doubt Assuming contingency plan exisitng identified risk subsequently risk occur case schedule changed taking account contingency
So perform integrated change control take advisory board get approval change baseline
identified risk
In case using management reserve contingency reserve
If contingency reserve use baseline still changing
Thanks advance
Hello Anmol If identified risk occurs implement approved contingency plan
In case go schedule change risk already identified already factored schedule
For identified risk Contingency Reserve used
Management Reserve unidentified risk
There change baseline unless spend contingency reserve
Thank Fahad clear explanation
You welcome Anmol
Hi Fahad I new area project management apology seems like silly question
Since Contingency Reserve calculated percentage impact risk occurring reserve never actually going cover impact risk actually occur correct
So risk occur effort resolve risk mean contingency used AND also deviation cost baseline
While I appreciate factor complete cost every risk I difficulty seeing logic method estimating contingency reserve seems like never completely cover cost ANY risk
Is possibly assumption risk occur contingency plan risk factor additional activity reduce cost impact meaning combined contingency plan contingency reserve actually cover cost risk
Kind Regards Eoin Hello Eoin First understand risk managed aggregate large population event macro managed micro basis
In project management Risk Management managed considering large population event
Now come point Let say identified hundred number risk calculated impact risk happen occur
Then multiply impact respective likelihood add get contingency reserve
Now really think hundred identified risk going occur project
No le chance happen
Point occur rest occur
In case risk occurs take money contingency reserve
There deviation cost baseline unless spend contingency reserve
Hi Fahad Thanks reply got example I saw section never enough contingency cover even single risk occurred
Take simple scenario identified risk impact chance occurrence one risk occurred contingency used still covered cost risk
I take point larger project number risk much larger therefore contingency reserve likely cover cost risk occurring perhaps example involving smaller number risk realistic
Hello Eoin As I said earlier Project Risk Management managed considering large population event
As population grows better Risk Management Plan
Hope help
Fahad If allocated cost contingency plan single risk event exceeds total remaining fund contingency reserve contingency reserve managed aggregate sum probability x impact accepted risk contingency plan I think would strong case treat
I generally consider planning error case planner necessarily fault since allocating fund contingency reserve must balanced statistically expected cost risk order keep acceptable cost baseline
I would suggest minimum amount contingency reserve always enough cover largest remaining risk contingency plan
So example instead establishing contingency reserve x x impose constraint contingency reserve never le last trigger event safely rearview mirror
It project manage
The PMBOK Guides equip best industry knowledge complete project successfully
Develop project plan per knowledge understanding get approved stick
Hello Fahad I question CR
CR know reserve used cover cost
It said CR calculated using EVM part Perform Quantitative Analysis process Risk Management
Now also know process optional cost Perform Quantitative Analysis high skipped altogether
Does mean calculating CR without quantitative analysis guesswork
Sumeet The process establishing Contingency Reserve established Risk Management Plan
It set using EMV required
Some organization set contingency fixed rate

Others set using risk model generally questionnaire determine relative level risk compared project
And yes set using expected value
The key know process going apply
If ONLY going use EMV need set Quantitative Analysis process step shall skipped
If going use metric set free include exclude Quantitative Analysis
Hope help
Thanks Fahad certainly help
Fahad I trouble deciphering following PMP book
Any help would appreciated

On Pg
state activity cost estimate may include contingency say contingency reserve part funding requirement
Then Pg
mention reserve included project cost baseline included total project budge
Leaving aside issue management reserve contingency reserve included cost baseline
How reconcile two different conflicting passage PMBOK

Are contingency reserve layered
In word contingency reserve activity level also contingency reserve work package control account level

optional question answer If time spent project cost incurred activity duration estimation reserve well activity cost reserve amount additional cost pure economic perspective
Isn double dipping reserve reconciled point project

Lastly practical world project manager maintain different cost bucket work package original cost contingency reserve merged one cost number package
Thanks
On PMBOK talking contingency reserve cost estimate may include contingency reserve
On PMBOK Guide talking management reserve included cost baseline total budget
Contingency reserve included cost baseline management reserve
budget cost baseline management reserve
Contingency reserve pool amount utilized identified risk occurs
Contingency reserve calculated whole project considering positive risk negative risk

The way calculated contingency reserve cost also calculate contingency reserve schedule called time reserve buffer
Please see PMBOK edition

Answer point melted explanation
Hope help
Dear Hello Fahad What difference contingency reserve scope bank
Rick Sorry Rick No idea scope bank
Nicely explained
One query
In budget estimation CR distributed budget undistributed budget
Thanks regard These term distributed undistributed budget mentioned PMBOK guide
However contingency reserve calculated based probability impact many activity say placed distributed budget
base line definition practical example Can clarify statement
There two kind reserve time cost contingency reserve management reserve
Contingency reserve account known unknown item identified risk management
Management reserve account unknown unknown simply unknown time could identify risk management
Projects kind reserve
You right Esmail
PMBOK talk ensuring enough CR available Control Risk
What good amount risk didnt happen closed remaining risk required amount CR
Also unused CR go project closure
In contract agreed complete project fixed amount

In discussion risk term contingency often understood number added estimate project cost duration cover element risk uncertainty
Owners establish contingency level project based acceptable risk degree uncertainty desired confidence level meeting baseline requirement
When used absorb impact project uncertainty contingency form risk mitigation evaluating potential project contingency funding owner apply risk assessment probabilistic estimating technique
However contingency first alternative used part complete risk mitigation effort
The dictionary definition contingency follows condition something may may occur condition subject chance happening anything chance something contingent event condition occurring chance without intent viewed possible eventually probable depending uncertain occurrence possible future event condition unforeseen occurrence may necessitate special measure reserve fund something liable happen chance feature accompaniment something else
Webster Third New International Dictionary From dictionary definition might supposed purpose contingency cover happening anything occurrence unforeseen occurrence therefore contingency would expended unforeseen occurrence actually occurred
In case actual expenditure contingency would event occurring chance one would therefore expect contingency used normal course activity
However term contingency understood way many project personnel rather often taken refer fund completely expended course project matter happens
An example may help illustrating point
Suppose someone tabulates number valve used substantial set previous similar project find every case number valve actually installed always time number valve counted engineering drawing quantity surveyor
Then rule might purchase percent valve number valve counted engineering drawing
This percent factor contingency sense dictionary definition nothing due chance
Rather empirical fact valve consistently undercounted percent factor offset inherent bias systematic error
Therefore additional percent valve counted would always spent
Note rule say add percent preliminary cost estimate estimate might already adjustment factor
Suppose example slightly different The investigator determines historical data factor relating actual valve used valve counted drawing random number average mean standard deviation
While systematic error bias still percent random component well depends chance event hence contingent
To account systematic error random error add percent number valve actually counted add another contingency account chance
When talking chance contingency definition must make probabilistic statement
If want sure order enough valve percent time instance need Contingency Factors Systematic Random Errors Valves counted drawing Valves added correct undercount systematic error Valves added reduce probability running valve le Total number valve ordered Number valve expected used Number valve expected left add percent number counted percent systematic bias time standard deviation chance variation
Note would expect percent counted valve left protection running expected used extraordinary circumstance
The result shown
The problem term contingency often used amount needed cover systematic error amount needed buffer risk attributable chance
This usage cause confusion Some project personnel assuming contingency address systematic error bias expect entitled use whereas others believe allocated cover random error chance expect contingency fund left ought returned project sponsor
Not surprisingly expect expend contingency fund tend project manager expect see least contingency allowance returned tend owner
In practice relatively project return leftover contingency fund sponsor
In general project director regard contingency fund use risk fail materialize fund expended something else project improvement
Thus agreement either large contingency basic point whether contingency unassigned cost intended spent reserve intended spent
The term management reserve used sometimes synonym contingency sometimes distinction
The Electronic Industries Alliance EIA standard EIA use term contingency define budget management reserve follows BUDGET AT COMPLETION The total authorized budget accomplishing program scope work
It equal sum allocated budget plus undistributed budget
Emphasis added
MANAGEMENT RESERVE An amount total budget withheld management control purpose rather designated accomplishment specific task set task
EIA Presumably definition contingency would included either allocated budget undistributed budget included budget completion hence constitute something expected intended spent
Management reserve contrast included budget therefore presumably expected intended expended
Setting contingency matter tension project director generally want contingency allowance set high permit greater flexibility protection uncertainty owner want contingency set low maintain greater control project
Although proper amount contingency debatable contingency set low upper management position micromanaging project set high management may sufficiently involved
This point vary different organization different type project
However upper management take view always uncertainty associated estimating executing project competent people hired manage activity contingency set level keep upper management informed involved require repeated approval additional funding
A probabilistic view risk help guide approach
If probability distribution represents uncertainty cost duration activity assumed contingency viewed amount money time case project schedule added mean expected value cost duration activity
The risk overrun thus probability actual cost duration would greater mean plus contingency
If project cost considered random variable associated mean value deterministic value typically quoted project activity estimate may bear relationship mean expected value probability distribution
The point estimate might mode distribution median commonly based probability distribution may already include allowance contingency inserted lower level
See discussion fallacy point estimate
If cost estimate work package project known mean value individual distribution mean value total project would sum value contingency could added
However individual work package estimate seldom mean value distribution
As result sum estimate mean value total cost duration The fallacy point estimate immortalized legendary statistician drowned fording river average foot deep
The fallacy point estimate provides insight project frequently late
Consider project consisting parallel task average duration week
Many project manager misconception average completion time project therefore also week
However project finish week task finish average average time
Assuming independent symmetric distribution task chance le
The average maximum duration greater maximum average duration
This concept also provides insight project frequently budget
Consider example laboratory must inventory case perishable chemical demand uncertain average five case per month
Accordingly lab plan stock five case
The cost maintaining inventory two component If end month demand le number stocked date excess case expired must destroyed loss per unit demand greater number stocked lacking unit must air freighted additional cost per unit
The additive cost associated average demand five zero manager think average cost
But cost five minimum cost
The actual cost greater cost average demand
SOURCE Adapted Savage
value includes degree uncertainty multiple standard deviation variance
Therefore summing estimate work package without discipline using mean value result total cost estimate includes unknown uncertainty
For reason work package estimate even lowest level often contain contingency factor
First bias estimator may expect criticized severely underestimate overestimate
Second need cover error estimating usually error omission example taking quantity drawing quantity estimator likely undercount overcount
Even computer quantity estimate item may missing drawing others may added later contributing bias toward undercounting
The addition contingency offset bias
Finally field construction operation certainly take position material left due overestimation preferable running job finished due underestimation
For reason estimator tend add contingency safety factor work package estimate
For similar reason next level upward typically also add contingency
Each person organizational level add contingency provide protection uncertainty consequence generally considered dire number underestimated rather overestimated
If management level wish set cost estimate estimate plus contingency desired point underlying probability distribution manager must idea amount contingency already incorporated estimate
For example manager wish set cost estimate approximately percentile belief estimate percentile difference dollar time percentile must added
However manager belief estimate already percentile le need added
This process require exact knowledge lower level contingency risk manager familiar basis estimation
Conversely manager belief estimate already adjusted percentile estimate reduced
This may also occur manager knowledge business result better different view underlying uncertainty others
The manager may desire cost estimate percentile estimate provided may developed level
However subjective probability distribution used estimator manager may agree percentile
Or contractor may feel regardless desirable level contingency safety factor competitive condition permit although definite risk setting contingency low greater risk setting high one bid contract receive financial authorization owner
In general estimate flow upward different level organization higher management level better knowledge strategic business political condition may make different decision contingency subordinate
It likely knowledgeable owner make better decision contingency owner inexperienced make effort become knowledgeable cost duration project typically undertake
Project policy procedure document address different kind contingency need contingency allowance control happen expended
They also include precise consistent definition terminology
The term contingency particular need consistent definition mean different thing different people
Equally important discussion example approach setting budget schedule contingency
Contingency like value engineering change control cost control method It allowance error safety margin budget overrun reduce cost risk increase budget
Thus contingency cost control method purpose ensure adequate fund pay uncontrolled cost
The definition contingency percentage estimated cost complete project instead percentage original estimate improvement change past practice many case
Project contingency reported reviewed consistent way defined emphasized policy document order achieve consistency across project
Consistency however mean establishment recommended standard value range overall contingency allowance
The use established value questionable practice encourages project manager use value instead performing risk assessment
For example contingency percentage might adequate conventional infrastructure project totally inappropriate big science project waste remediation project project technology may new unproven volume characterization waste uncertain may need retain much larger contingency even final design stage
There least two distinct policy issue setting contingency
First one purpose contingency provide allowance unknown making estimate
Because error predominantly error omission allowance must added cover
Instead counting valve example one estimate add allowance contingency
This type contingency estimated work package activity level
Adding work package contingency however supported statistical analysis easily result large number becomes project budget
Second another purpose contingency risk mitigation required omission making estimate uncertainty activity level rather allow unknown overall project level
For example capital acquisition project really research development project may depend new technology requires contingency waste remediation project may need contingency cover possibility situ waste may differ original characterization
These contingency
This distinction merely semantic important difference risk estimated project policy procedure make distinction clear
Moreover difference different contingency factor managed
If project baseline budget includes cost known countable separate allowance unknown estimating cost one expects life project allowance transferred budget actual quantity cost identified
But project contingency management reserve may cover risk factor would high impact occurred highly unlikely occur
Thus example contingency allowance possible flood used flood occurs contingency allowance automatically transferred base budget cover overrun area
Who owns contingency happen expended important issue addressed policy procedure document
It argued management reserve event held program level project level
At minimum contingency alert management large risk inherent project
Contingencies known risk fund organization separated budget fund unless needed specific project event
If contract fixed price contractor owns contingency within bid price entitled left end
But case contract
Even tract owner need hold contingency cover potential change order
Contingency policy need distinguish cost plus incentive fee common type contract discussion risk contingency state whether contingency controlled project director level owner program level
Effective risk management essential success large project built operated Department Energy DOE particularly project characterize much mission
To enhance DOE risk management effort department asked NRC prepare summary effective practice used leading owner organization
The study primary objective provide DOE project manager basic understanding project owner risk management role effective oversight risk management activity delegated contractor

A disassembler computer program translates machine language assembly language inverse operation assembler
A disassembler differs decompiler target language rather assembly language
The output disassembler often formatted rather suitability input assembler making principally tool
Assembly language source code generally permit use constant programmer comment
These usually removed assembled machine code assembler
A disassembler operating machine code would produce disassembly lacking constant comment
The disassembled output becomes difficult human interpret original annotated source code
Some disassemblers make use symbolic debugging information present object file ELF
The Interactive Disassemblerallow human user make mnemonic symbol value region code interactive session human insight applied disassembly process often parallel human creativity code writing process
Disassembly exact science On CISC platform instruction presence code possible single program two reasonable disassembly
Determining instruction would actually encountered run program reduces halting problem
Any interactive debugger include way viewing disassembly program debugged
Often disassembly tool packaged standalone disassembler distributed along debugger
For example objdump part GNU Binutils related interactive debugger gdb
The ofexample dissembler IDA ILDASM tool contained Framework SDK
It used disassemble PE file containing Common Intermediate Language code

lida basically disassembler code analysis tool
It us bastard libdisasm single opcode It allows interactive control generated deadlisting via command builtin tool
It trace execution flow binary It work symbolic name interactive naming function label commenting code
It scan known technique It scan user defined code sequence It integrated patcher It also integrated cryptoanalyzer Many disassemblers use output objdump lida try serious approach
The several limitation objdump broken using libdisasm tracing execution flow program
Further control disassembly feature included
Everybody already worked deadlisting immediate feel need work interactive code able change
Therefore lida integrated patcher resolve symbolic name provides ability comment code serf efficient browsing method
The exotic feature lida analysis side
The code scanned custom sequence known antidebugging technique known encryption algorithm also able directly work program data example pas several customizable routine
This course make limited sense debugger
Tough often I really missed functionality
Usual program one would like disassemble either coded directly assembly use trick avoid beeing disassembled
I give short overview objdump feature objdump relies section header It ELF executable contains correct section header
Tough run ELF binary section header necessary
The important thing get process loaded memory program header
So first common anti disassembling trick either drop manipulate ELF section header By objdump refuse perform disassembly file ELF LSB executable Intel version statically linked corrupted section header size objdump objdump File format recognized The binary I took example verify yanisto objdump trace execution flow I By tracing execution flow objdump easily fooled disassemble line stop
This mean recognize function see code stored data section
objdump trace execution flow Additionally another common trick insert garbage opcodes overjump disalign disassembly execution flow
Example When instruction jump middle next instruction objdump disassemble exact location
It continue next instruction consequently dissasemble garbage
As result mainly see totally usesless instruction whole disassembly
lida us libdasm bastard single opcode decoding
It use whole environment including typhoon database
The main program coded us C backend timeconsuming part disassembly analysis scanning string
Generally lida designed fast possible disassembly trying waste RAM lida designed also efficient usability
Therefore important function accessible via single keystroke short command
This mean clicking around necessary enter task directly commandline
The disassembling engine The disassembling done currently pass default pas main control flow disassembly Here disassembly started executables entrypoint recursively disassembles binary following branch stepping routine
This lead also disassembling code block data section existent disassembly limited section
Also indirect used final destination looked binary data course pas glibc binary A heuristic scan scan main function start also cursive disassembling pas code section This pas repeat found executable section start section start
If binary contain section header disassembly start first loaded executable address
pas function This pas scan typical function prologue start found address
This discovering code region explicitly called entrypoints evaluated runtime
pas disassembling cave All pass build map binary
If code region yet disassembled
pas remainder If pas executed still cave displayed DB xx Definitely pas enhancement come well recursive disassembly function
Also mention whenever jump middle previous instruction beeing found currently address beeing marked
To follow representation instruction within instruction compare course intelligent placing opcodes instruction valid used execution flow
Basically done signature scanning
I quote simple pattern matching
For understanding one need little understanding typical algorythms
Let take example hash
How find code hash
On high level generating hash usually done step init function update function finalize function
The init function usually set array numeric value modified loop using input data plain data algorythm hash calculated
The finalize function creates representation common format easily spoken pad digest appending size
Hoewever matter know actually algorythm work find Due common fact initialization function use fixed numeric initialization value every implementation part algorythm value searching
For So find implementation necessary scan dword value course appear order strange enough nearly always used listed order
Now dwords exist also binary accident oltough seldom smarter scanning done value need appear limited size code block
The value order also fuzzyness added scan little bit altered init value
Heuristic scanning yet implemented
It intended find custom crypto code
Basically beeing looked sequence suspicious opcode sequence look like encryption routine
OllyDbg emphasizes binary code analysis useful source code available
It trace register recognizes procedure API call switch table constant string well locates routine object file library
According program help file version final release

A translates inverse operation
A disassembler differs target rather assembly language
Disassembly output disassembler often formatted rather suitability input assembler making principally tool
Assembly language generally permit use programmer
These usually removed assembled assembler
If disassembler operating machine code would produce disassembly lacking constant comment disassembled output becomes difficult human interpret original annotated source code
Some disassemblers provide code commenting feature generated output get enriched comment regarding called API function parameter called function
Some disassemblers make use information present object file
For example allows human user make mnemonic symbol value region code interactive session human insight applied disassembly process often parallel human creativity code writing process
Disassembly exact science platform instruction programming presence possible single program two reasonable disassembly
Determining instruction would actually encountered run program known unsolvable
Writing disassembler produce code assembled produce exactly original binary possible however often difference
This pose demand expressivity assembler
For example assembler take arbitrary choice two binary code something simple
If original code us choice original code simply reproduced given point time
However even fully correct disassembly produced problem remain program requires modification
For example machine language jump instruction generated assembly code jump specified location example execute specific code jump specified number byte example skip unwanted branch
A disassembler know intended may use either syntax generate disassembly reproduces original binary
However programmer want add instruction jump instruction destination necessary understand program operation determine whether jump absolute relative whether destination remain fixed location moved skip original added instruction
A disassembler may interactive
A disassembler executed generates assembly language file examined interactive one show effect change user make immediately
For example disassembler may initially know section program actually code treat data user specifies code resulting disassembled code shown immediately allowing user examine take action run
Any interactive include way viewing disassembly program debugged
Often disassembly tool packaged standalone disassembler distributed along debugger
For example part related interactive debugger
A dynamic disassembler incorporated output real time execution executed machine instruction
In case well line containing disassembled machine code register data change change condition code individual instruction cause shown alongside beneath disassembled instruction
This provides extremely powerful debugging information ultimate problem resolution although size resultant output sometimes quite large especially active entire program execution
OLIVER provided feature early part debugging product offering found incorporated product

A disassembler software convert machine language instruction assembly language instruction also known reverse engineering
As term implies disassembler performs operation inverse operation performed assembler
A disassembler used translate machine code human readable format
Reading disassembled code complex original source code disassembled code lack programmer comment annotation

Is freeware dissassembler I disassemble old program I wrote source code
I looked bit found anything
Generally even disassemble result pretty illegible
Most structure code lost compile resulting disassembled code wo structure originally gave
Well I hoping I could recover formula math without research year
If likely happen I guess I old fashioned way work
Thank taking time answer Paul You able get formula jumbled
The code work difficult understand
Is something like want
You might search decompiler rather disassembler
I downloaded REC see work
I also downloaded BOOMERANG link front page REC site
Perhaps one work
Thanks help Paul might also want look backing source code nthe future rather compiled program
perhaps soemthing like dropbox use back lot thing including source code
Yes I backed source code software I somehow lost source two favorite
I always tried back everything course year computer I two loss
Not bad record It seems I lost two favorite
It look like I use decompilers mentioned I going rework math new version
Such life
still I grateful help I received
thank Paul I done video game client
The problem variable loose name know anything represents hierarchy file organization anything like Captain said
I remember I used called decompiler disassembler
Hope get formula without much trouble
You need member order leave comment Sign new account community
It easy
Already account
Sign

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue

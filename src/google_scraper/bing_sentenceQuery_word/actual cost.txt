discipline applies method industry profession
professional qualified field intense education experience
In many country actuary must demonstrate competence passing series rigorous professional examination
Actuarial science includes number interrelated subject including
Historically actuarial science used deterministic model construction table premium
The science gone revolutionary change last year due proliferation high speed computer union actuarial model modern financial theory
Many university undergraduate graduate degree program actuarial science
In study published job search website CareerCast ranked actuary job United States
The study used five key criterion rank job environment income employment outlook physical demand stress
A similar study included actuary among Best Professions expects great demand future
Actuarial science became formal mathematical discipline late century increased demand insurance coverage burial annuity
These long term coverage required money set aside pay future benefit annuity death benefit many year future
This requires estimating future contingent event rate mortality age well development mathematical technique discounting value fund set aside invested
This led development important actuarial concept referred future sum
Certain aspect actuarial method discounting pension fund come criticism modern
Actuarial science also applied
In form insurance coverage generally provided renewable period yearly
Coverage cancelled end period either party
company tend specialize complexity diversity risk
One division organize around personal commercial line insurance
Personal line insurance individual include fire auto homeowner theft umbrella coverage
Commercial line address insurance need business include property business continuation product liability vehicle worker compensation fidelity surety insurance
The insurance industry also provides coverage exposure catastrophe risk earthquake patent infringement form corporate espionage terrorism satellite launch
Actuarial science provides data collection measurement estimating forecasting valuation tool provide financial underwriting data management ass marketing opportunity nature risk
Actuarial science often help ass overall risk catastrophic event relation underwriting capacity surplus
In field actuarial science used design price reinsurance retrocession arrangement establish reserve fund known claim future claim catastrophe
Elementary agreement pension arose antiquity
Early association formed meet expense burial cremation
A small sum paid communal fund weekly basis upon death member fund would cover expense rite burial
These society sometimes sold share building burial vault owned precursor
Other early example mutual assurance pact traced back various form fellowship within Saxon clan England Germanic forebear Celtic society
However many earlier form surety aid would often fail due lack understanding knowledge
The century period advance mathematics Germany France England
At time rapidly growing desire need place valuation personal risk scientific basis
Independently studied emerged mathematical discipline
Another important advance came London named showed predictable pattern longevity death group people age despite uncertainty date death one individual
This study became basis original
One could set insurance scheme provide life insurance pension group people calculate degree accuracy much person group contribute common fund assumed earn fixed rate interest
The first person demonstrate publicly could done fame
Halley constructed life table showed could used calculate amount someone given age pay purchase life annuity
pioneering work long term insurance contract premium charged year led formation Society Equitable Assurances Lives Survivorship commonly known London
Many life insurance company pension fund created following year
Equitable Life first use word actuary chief executive officer
Previously actuary meant official recorded decision act ecclesiastical court
Other company use mathematical scientific method often failed forced adopt method pioneered Equitable
In century calculation course performed without computer
The calculation life insurance premium reserving requirement rather complex actuary developed technique make calculation easy possible example commutation function essentially precalculated column summation time discounted value survival death probability
Actuarial organization founded support actuary actuarial science protect public interest promoting competency ethical standard
However calculation remained cumbersome actuarial shortcut commonplace
actuary followed footstep life insurance colleague century
The revision based National Council Workmen Compensation Insurance rate took two month work day night team actuary pp

In mathematical foundation process developed
Actuaries could begin estimate loss using model random event instead method used past
The introduction development computer revolutionized actuarial profession
From punchcards current device modeling forecasting ability actuary rapidly improved still heavily dependent assumption input model actuary needed adjust new world pp

Traditional actuarial science modern US different practice caused different way calculating funding investment strategy different regulation
Regulations adoption cushioned market fluctuation FASB US Canada regulates pension valuation funding
Historically much foundation actuarial theory predated modern financial theory
In early twentieth century actuary developing many technique found modern financial theory various historical reason development achieve much recognition
As result actuarial science developed along different path becoming reliant assumption opposed concept used modern finance
The divergence related use historical data statistical projection liability cash flow instead caused manner traditional actuarial method apply market data number
For example one traditional actuarial method suggests changing mix investment change value liability asset changing assumption
This concept inconsistent
The potential modern financial economics theory complement existing actuarial science recognized actuary century pp

In late early distinct effort actuary combine financial theory stochastic method established model
Ideas financial economics became increasingly influential actuarial thinking actuarial science started embrace sophisticated mathematical modelling finance
Today profession practice educational syllabus many actuarial organization cognizant need reflect combined approach table loss model stochastic method financial theory pp

However concept still widely used setting discount rate assumption mentioned earlier particularly North America
Product design add another dimension debate
Financial economist argue pension benefit funded equity investment without reflecting risk achieving expected return
But pension product reflect risk unexpected return
In case pension beneficiary assumes risk employer assumes risk
The current debate seems focusing four principle Essentially financial economics state pension asset invested equity variety theoretical practical reason
There increasing trend recognize actuarial skill applied range application outside traditional field insurance pension etc
One notable example use US state actuarial model set criminal sentencing guideline
These model attempt predict chance according rating factor include type crime age educational background ethnicity offender
However model open criticism providing justification discrimination specific ethnic group law enforcement personnel
Whether statistically correct correlation remains debate
Another example use actuarial model ass risk sex offense recidivism
Actuarial model associated table SORAG used since late determine likelihood sex offender thus whether institutionalized set free pp

That indeed question day among Linux blogger recently debating value traditional computer science degree particular
How worthwhile Computer Science degree
asked team Open Ballot recently thus kicking conversation
Many technology company complain graduate even Computer Science arrive little understanding work industry often lack knowledge basic coding paradigm added
This seems great shame u especially many high quality open source project love student help happy mentor return
aficionado shortage opinion topic TuxRadar beyond
I developer year completely wrote Johnny comment TuxRadar example
The majority people I worked industry also
When hiring recently interview candidate degree often good experience Johnny added
Indeed trophy good display much good anything else asserted Anonymous Penguin From The Kitchen
Just like ornamental sword hanging wall
Ca beat humble kitchen chopper daily use
Then When I came choosing degree course apply I pretty sure Computer Science degree would probably consist awful lot teaching I require since I already picked quite lot knowledge point chimed blogger Paul Gideon Dann
In end I decided go something little beaten track chose degree Artificial Intelligence Computer Science CS AI Dann added
Even I think I learnt anything crucial university Dann concluded
Similar opinion could heard Linux blogosphere Punchy Penguin Saloon
Most time degree needed even advanced programming task never needed system admin work average degree needed get past le competent HR department consultant blogger Gerhard Mack offered
Of course I really question anyone actual skill would want work place know little IT industry added
I seen specialized place legitimate reason need degree place high level work I would suggest degree REALLY love programming want take specialized level physic simulation work Mack concluded
Similarly I met excellent software engineer programmer developer CS degree others agreed Chris Travers Slashdot blogger work project
By token I met many mediocre developer CS degree many Travers added
I suspect area software development CS degree extremely helpful I think ever required explained
One thing open source community good encouraging people learn talking great deal formal training knowledge
Such transfer knowledge compared apprenticeship old guild system pointed
All I see CS degree one path among many Travers concluded
However one clear advantage meaningful people know industry yet charge screening resume
Blogger educator said old academic career started Computer Science took university otherwise I would likely studied instead Physics told Linux Girl
My love thing computer started first year university I laid hold pocket calculator called IBM blinking light typewriter console explained
With I learned Fortran II language
Later IBM I learned many different programming language I latched onto Pascal Modula added
Those best year life computer important ever since
As teacher Pogson often told student least bit keen math science get computer science DNA tinkering noted
I think good advice decade I see closing opportunity field
Slashdot blogger hairyfeet sure
Computer science degree valuable Bangalore hairyfeet opined
The guy Bangalore half dozen degree get paid around REALLY think compete
Until government something offshoring continue see happened blue collar worker happen IT guy hairyfeet predicted
I personally tired hearing guy train would replace seeing ad paper obviously written following NOT hire American playbook
Hairyfeet also advised oldest son ANYTHING tech guy added
Programmers joining autoworkers machinist bread line
Their degree cost le cost live well year ca even pay student loan
It simple economics folk survival greediest nobody make like corporate head concluded
Ultimately real concern blohow valuable ANY degree current circumstance
opined Barbara Hudsongger Slashdot go site
We bubble similar bubble imploded year ago Hudson explained
Students today frequently taking debt degree many case never earn back extra cost date graduate irrelevant career several year road
I know one person using degree original field study added
For everyone else case happens
In short sad fact time changed Hudson concluded
The IT bubble tailing
You make money better job security cop firefighter job ca outsourced third world union negotiate better working condition benefit wage

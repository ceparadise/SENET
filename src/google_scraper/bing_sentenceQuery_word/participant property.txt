A special sort member intermediate functionality
The syntax reading writing property like field property read writes usually translated method call
The syntax easier read write lot method call yet interposition method call hood allows element implementation may called field
See instructive example C language
Programming language support property include
Some language support property require programmer define pair method instead
provides alternative mechanism using object variable visibility flag
Other language designed natively support property
While first class property emulated due operator overloading
Also note compiler support first class property Microsoft compiler example
In language property implemented pair method accessed using syntax public field
Omitting method pair yield uncommon property
In language support property similar construct implemented single method either return change underlying data depending context invocation
Such technique used

Some language Ruby Smalltalk achieve syntax using normal method sometimes limited amount
Some language follow syntax convention formally specifying utilizing property method
Among convention The following example demonstrates dot notation JavaScript
The following example demonstrates bracket notation JavaScript
Recent C version also allow property backing field property generated compiler compilation
This mean property must setter however private
first class property exist several way emulate property limited degree
Two follow An example taken MSDN
In D version property accessor mutator must marked property The example could used arbitrary method like Properties work correctly class class available Python newer see
Python added new syntax involving decorator defining property
Ruby also provides automatic synthesizer defined instance method Class

In C property named member class struct interface offering neat way access private field called get set accessor method
The following code example declares property called Species class Animal abstract access private variable called name Often property name internal member access capital initial letter Name case internal member prefix
Also note implicit parameter called value used set accessor type underlying member variable
Accessors fact represented internally method order maintain compatibility language support accessors
Once property defined easy get set value If property get accessor property
If set accessor property
If property

I show property P trivial
This problem Rice Theorem I completely understand
Can someone explain difference trivial property
A trivial property one hold either language none
A property simply subset language RE set language satisfy property
A property P set P strictly contained RE RE
It mean least one RE language satisfy P least one RE language satisfy
Examples The property language finite
Formal definition P L
This property
The property The language recognized TM
Formally L M
M
This property trivial fact ALL language satisfy
The property The language reduction problem
Formally P L HP RE
This property trivial fact

This question already answer I understand Rice theorem state Trivial property mean
However given property I hard time seeing Trivial
Can someone help understand better maybe good example
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
A property P set Turing machine
The property contains TM
Essentially order check property trivial check TM satisfies TM satisfy
If kind exist property nontrivial
Otherwise trivial
However deciding difficult For example consider property M L M
This property since TMs empty language TMs nonempty language
A trickier example M L M
Initially may seem like nontrivial property
But recall every TM recognizes language
So L M RE every M
Thus property simply collection every TM
So trivial

Yolanda taught college Psychology Ethics doctorate philosophy counselor education supervision
Jill researcher local university
She tasked studying technology used foreign language classroom enhance student learning
Though Jill optimistic project idea going conduct study
After speaking colleague Jill decides would best use participant observation collect research data
So exactly participant observation
qualitative research method researcher observes research participant also actively engages activity research participant
This requires researcher become integrated participant environment also taking objective note going
Most researcher conduct participant observation take role interested studying
In Jill case might enroll actual foreign language course complete assigned homework classwork attend field trip regular student enrolled class would
Jill would also informal conversation student class teacher
Jill would keep detailed record assignment take detailed note observes happened encounter classmate teacher
Jill would also keep note technology usage classroom norm expectation information find useful
There three important piece participant observation There many reason researcher choose use participant observation
Participant observation provides researcher access different type information may easily accessible outsider
For example student enrolled foreign language class may know rule expectation like classroom nature interaction student teacher
Participant observer integrate environment often considered part culture group
It uncommon research participant forget observed reduces likelihood research participant modify behavior try well observed
They might consider Jill part group act normally would around

Participant observation help researcher decide question relevant language use culture like
By part group Jill get better feel important research participant
She also pick language use certain word mean
If Jill decided conduct research interview later could use background knowledge participant help create research question
Participant observation help guide interpretation research data
As active participant culture phenomenon study researcher better able interpret actually going versus someone familiar culture looking data purely objective standpoint
Have ever unable follow story friend telling later told
If understand present certain thing help increase understanding
There many thing researcher might want study examined participant observation
For example let say person wanted study birth ritual remote African village
There little literature medium cover topic
The way get true understanding may go remote African village participate birth ritual
Mark one Jill colleague working different study
The goal study examine hostility sexual harassment urban hospital
It likely people would actually admit sexually harassing colleague especially since could result lawsuit lack employment
So Mike decides volunteer hospital integrate hospital environment order collect research data
Mike informal conversation develops relationship many hospital staff feel comfortable enough around Mike answer question sexual harassment hostility occurs
Mike also able witness activity volunteer shift
Mike take detailed note everything see hears
After month Mike enough data complete study
Let review
qualitative research method researcher study group observing group also participating activity group
The three component participant observation gaining entry establishing rapport spending enough time research participant answer research question
Reasons choosing participant observation include easier access information insider reducing likelihood participant alter behavior look good better understanding culture language research participant accurate interpretation research data

Jeff Atwood black hair color
So hair color thing belonging class human instance class Jeff Atwood concrete black associated property
Does sound reasonable unlikely
This question marked exact duplicate existing question
EDITED With reference original question I ca see term specific computer language relevant
There term used describe aspect general language use go back Aristotle category laid within known
The question relates classification relationship term Attwood Attwood hair colour Jeff Attwood hair
In term Aristotle category Attwood Attwood hair colour Jeff Attwood hair would come
I would classify Attwood hirsuteness attribute relates Attwood
Furthermore I would put attribute relates Attwood hair
In sentence Attwood black hair term Categories treated unclearly attribute Attwood treated described previous sentence becoming attribute attribute
For breakdown category see Wikipedia link previously cited TEDx talk importance linking word meaning
I trust make thing clearer unfamiliar terminology show greater relevance computer programming terminology context
ORIGINAL From integrated traditional liberal art tradition within I work link subject predicate sentence substance attribute reference
The attribute excluding substance encompass property might instance two category relate substance position regard space time
Are strictly speaking property
one confusion would used two conflicting sens association ownership
It sad case decline teaching English distinction forgotten
You course treat synonymous
The question
Since Aristotle express different mode way think I ca see separated language

There new trend called Lean UX apparently stemming Lean approach
What main principle
What good recommended reference source education learning
Personally speaking lean UX type UX strategy like business strategy accommodates fundamental UX principle
sync development unit organization becomes lean UX
Anyways
Lean UX model Jeff Gothelf Smashing UX Stay lean focus experience paperwork
Book Jeff Gothelf Author Josh Seiden Editor article I think need clarification concept general
Even reading comment far getting confused UX within Agile equated Lean UX
There gap really addressed content subject
And I imagine challenge general I sure single magic answer
It developed based lean start concept mentioned earlier based Agile
I think important distinction many article subject make seem though Lean UX clear answer UX within Agile question
When I see thing seem imply somehow know manage Lean UX I get kind confused
Maybe seem like
Even Gothelf seem equate two presentation writing
He presentation Lean UX within Agile whole separate beast
You take Lean UX principle sure new challenge face new question answer
We separate concept Lean UX concept Lean UX within Agile
Lean UX separate method could used regardless development process
Can help Agile
Of course
But additional topic
Lean UX within Agile another situation entirely one I think often even well covered
There little anything chart article generally provided subject give major clue suddenly UX within constraint Agile tight development iteration
The challenge integrating Lean UX Agile come sort new hybrid Agile UX methodology still remains
Equating two seems lead confusion opinion
Many article touch upon gap platitude
I think way address gap remains Lean UX Agile UX largely making UX equal team like developer QA member maybe point include work like would work kind additional concept
arguing Lean UX quite contrary
I think need careful assuming take Lean UX clearly easily slot Agile developer QA
simple
However Lean UX form mindset approach similar therefore suited Agile I think way go general
worked team done Lean UX general great success
But always ahead development
We also tried iteration designed developed team two week iteration whole different scenario
Lean UX principle used situation I would never refer
Beyond I would argue heavily favor Lean UX general UX team
It buzz word tenet actual practical purpose
At last job project able take business need contextual inquiry user form persona needed write realistic task got actually would want reality
Along way involved developer business marketing letting attend test immersing information acquired
We paper prototyping around task tested design actual user
And paper iterating test sometimes even test
The task approach good one wound chunk site could moved development turn worked next set task
I sure place differently went pretty well u overall
We eliminated toss fence mentality constantly improving product even got development I think importantly everyone involved SHARED UNDERSTANDING user needed addressing need
Doing linear fashion may see waterfall project lot time would diminished
I took Luxr course couple year back blog nice resource By posting answer agree
asked viewed active site design logo Stack Exchange Inc user contribution licensed

I got undergraduate degree graphic design industrial design state university highly competitive engineering program
The camaraderie studio environment amazing experience lot legwork get outcome want especially looking field outside program area expertise ie Silicon Valley v agency
It journey high high low low
BFA BS incredibly intensive program incredibly different experience
It double majoring liberal art degree even
Major minor doable
Double major recommended
If want study design go engineering school opportunity work collaboratively outside design
Do many side project possible people
Interaction designer code
This even really debate
CS teach get comfortable code
I many design friend want build simple static site paralyzed fear start
If look origin story software engineer technical designer born early lot say tinkered around
The internet lot forgiving back safe environment mess around build confidence
It harder get start see many cool thing know yet ca
And also know bit code design student programming class easy CS course
Also stop designing simply stagnate
If stop programming deteriorate
The sacrifice take required engineering course farther removed design production
I wish I majored CS I wish I would challenged take harder coding challenge earlier rather partnering engineer letting build
computer science safe route brainer
I hypothesize however year majority UX designer come design background
So answer may change time graduate
You major Psychology specializing Cognitive Science Human Factors Interaction
I recommend CS
If career work long run lucrative viable backup
Jim Bruno Still question
Ask

What made UX
Our series investigates story
See post Interaction strong root Computer Science user experience design almost exclusively practice
How much UX design share sibling
I going share thought experience making transition software engineering UX past career made influence role user experience designer today
A number notable UX expert come strong CS background
founder interaction design company author seminal book also widely known
one industry prominent speaker usability expert also beginning software developer programmer
I also know many UX practitioner formerly web developer specializing programming
A handful work hybrid role juggling UX software development work
Needless say UX natural route CS practitioner keen improving user experience interactive system beyond
I pursued Computer Science I wanted work computer
I also excited web particular web design
I never got design seriously feeling I needed start scratch learn fundamental engineering school demanding enough
Still I grew love software engineering found developing web interesting fulfilling became focus career several year
In eight year career software developer I worked primarily web application
While first job involved developing Java applet NASA research project Computer Engineering student first real job got building web application telecom solution company
It early big Internet boom meant almost every software developer world involved building software web
I started working many project I sole web developer I grew acquainted many web framework web technology well rich internet application
In short I generalist developer web many year I responsible translating requirement project manager sale executive usable website
I increasingly worked team developer team fairly small grew larger people
It environment long hour office common
Despite challenging nature job I continually pursued deeper interest craft web development across several different industry first telecom technology startup prototype engineer research division large Fortune company
Interestingly business innovation research sparked interest user experience
I already strong love web graphic design I predicted UX field like whole new world opened
In I hired research team specialising developing prototype aim generating innovative creative idea large Fortune company
There big buzz around business innovation design thinking I poured much literature I could get handle creative process
But two year later I came across Cooper completely changed perception running software project
The book provided practical methodology apply design work made much sense hard go back way thing
Also one main motivation pushing towards UX desire create better digital experience
I constantly struggled influence design decision developer partly I far removed business design context
I also lacked necessary skill design experience often left frustrated thinking contributed part overall experience influenced part solution
One main motivation pushing towards UX desire create better digital experience
I constantly struggled influence design decision developer partly I far removed business design context
At end I enrolled Masters program Interaction career UX
It difficult transition I graduated I still continued work developer cum UX designer making leap UX initially contractor finally UX designer SapientNitro
It hard pin specific thing bring UX CS
A lot I probably take granted understanding intricacy web technology complex software practice design technology feasibly work together one seamless whole
Often time UX seems like extension overarching goal technologist deliver amazing experience
I also unaware poor implementation happen designer understand even best idea still need translate well engineering
These day take lot different skill deliver complex solution way beyond ability individual engineer designer entrepreneur
Often time UX seems like extension overarching goal technologist deliver amazing experience
I also noticed I developed good practice developer benefit productivity especially come using complex production tool managing digital artifact prototyping
For example I comfortable using visual design tool I using
I keep healthy trail artifact using version control system dropbox mean
The tool seldom get way work I pick new tool skill quickly
Finally I think software problem solving come handy
Some design problem extremely complex require heavy analytical work
I seem developed enough patience break complex problem manageable chunk structure coherent solution putting information architect hat
All benefit I described come without price
I obviously lack experience exposure many aspect design design process visual literacy creative savvy working creative team
I learning lot job I say easy I sometimes struggle comprehend teammate worked field much longer part silently begs answer thing work around
I experience facilitating team brainstorming session running meeting I still feel I long way go running workshop generate compelling idea solution
There lot learn professional dedicate entire life one craft
I also fairly new role involves opportunity
This requires lot savvy preparation good people skill good communication skill well
I think UX exist bubble unlike software role designer I constantly required take stand provide compelling reason decision considering business user goal
That one hard task
UX exist bubble unlike software role designer I constantly required take stand provide compelling reason decision considering business user goal In addition I firm handle overall experience
I learnt others experience single UX method rule
Things get overly complicated overwhelming easily I still developing personal style approach work best
UX subjective diverse inclusive design practice
It pay prefer problem solving collaboration comfortable tackling complex problem
As UX designer gradually dig deep social behavioural technical layer ensure design hold well specific context
And since single person provide answer resourceful thinking foot lot
I would also encourage least developed personal approach practicing UX
Start putting method practice learning
Generate design prolifically assumption throwing away much designed rapid iteration
Don afraid starting scratch design repeatedly testing build confidence ability research design
Also
This help build richer perspective world design learn lot collaborative design process
And Not written artifact concept sketch
These go handy preparing portfolio finally ready hit prime time
While transition easy I regret decision I made switch
There lot demand UX designer diverse background CS represents one primary foundation UX domain
While necessary code UX strong CS foundation provides real world basis UX problem solving
As technology get even complex role UX designer bridging gap technology people becoming increasingly important
I grateful opportunity I see end possibility ahead
Photo Pingback Very helpful article
Thanks sharing I currently moving towards direction
I quick question
Because much c background find getting choked designing performing user experience research know limitation technology

Certain design layout possible know html java script able handle interaction
Great piece thanks
Would like add personally skill I find useful interaction design work sketch interaction writing code
Last significant project I interactive visualization example driven great extent software sketch
First Processing later Actionscript
Hi Ved It important step away technology designing I agree impossible turn intrinsic understanding thing work
It also important think strategically designing afraid throw away old design look freshly problem designing context use functionality per se
That said important work closely developer ensure design implemented even know based experience
Hope help
Boon Pingback Hi Boon I affinity towards UX past one year working software development
My UX interest started visited company frog really loved work
But totally confused take transition UX
I appreciate suggestion side
Thanks

Thank opportunity help question
There good evil approach answer Michael
really need stop thinking single approach process methodology
simple
Every client project development team different
Problems start become dogmatic
It human nature apply worked last time avoid work
There value lean prior experience crutch easily become dogmatic approach
Within project situation opportunity analyze need right thing right process tool appropriate use yield superior Reimann process tool appropriate use yield superior result responds Robert
provides greatest benefit user experience product development team able successfully integrate design development process method rather cross purpose
Program management really understands design development fit together critical creating good user technique making user experience better reply Leo
new design domain
Agile response software development practice never meant address design practice
Design inherently iterative using rapid sketching

Lean UX incredibly useful technique working project method used
Traditional UX technique often work development conducted rapid burst enough time deliver UX way
Fundamentally form UX goal mind delivering great user experience way work project slightly different
So let take look might work
Lean UX focused experience design le focused deliverable traditional UX
It requires greater level collaboration entire team
The core objective focus obtaining feedback early possible used make quick decision
The nature Agile development work rapid iterative cycle Lean UX mimic cycle ensure data generated used iteration
In traditional UX project built upon requirement capture deliverable
The objective ensure deliverable detailed possible respond adequately requirement laid start project
Lean UX slightly different
You focused detailed deliverable
You looking produce change improve product essentially mould outcome better
This work practice ditching requirement using problem statement lead set assumption used create hypothesis
What assumption
An assumption basically statement something think true
They designed generate common understanding around idea enables everyone get started
It fully understood assumption may correct may changed project better understanding develops within team
Assumptions normally generated workshop basis
You get team together state problem allow team brainstorm idea solving problem
In process generate answer certain question form assumption
Typical question might include There may one answer question
That leaf u greater number assumption might practical handle
If case team prioritize assumption quickly following generation
In general would prioritize assumption risk represent consequence badly wrong
The severe consequence higher priority level understanding issue hand le know higher priority
The hypothesis created Lean UX designed assumption
There simple format use create hypothesis quickly easily
An example enabling people save progress time smartphone user
higher level sign completion
improvement current completion rate
We state belief important important
Then follow expect achieve
Finally determine evidence would need collect prove belief true
If find way prove hypothesis may heading wrong direction outcome clearly defined
One big advantage working like remove much I think good idea political infighting UX design process
Every idea going tested evidence criterion clearly determined
No evidence
Then time drop idea try something else
If everyone understand hypothesis expectation tend happy wait see true rather passionately debating subjective viewpoint
The MVP core concept Lean UX
The idea build basic version concept possible test valuable result abandon
The MVPs show promise incorporated design development round without much hassle
This great way maximizing resource one reason work well Agile development allows lot experimentation sacred cow
User research testing nature Lean UX based principle used traditional UX environment
However approach tends quick dirty result need delivered next Agile Sprint start much le focus meticulously document output focus raw data
Responsibilities research also tend spread widely across whole team bottleneck created single UX design resource trying get whole job done tight timescales
This often get development resource hand UX work increase level understanding support UX work within development team
This overview Lean UX course lot cover short ish article
However basic concept enable start heading right direction come implementing Lean UX Agile environment

User Experience Research Training Consulting Agile UX work well together management value UX UX practitioner show leadership process strict UX embedded team
Agile taken world
In recent year become
Agile development lot benefit incremental approach ability change direction based customer stakeholder feedback short timeframes keep team focused
However Agile methodology focused developer
They grew programmer attempt solve common pain point experienced big software development project
Notoriously still primary document delineating Agile principle include UX people account time resource research UX professional need order create excellent design
Under Agile paradigm entire team work element project simultaneously order avoid throwing wall
hand one team another
The work done sprint commonly period team focus certain feature move
As result designer enormous pressure create test refine deliver output unrealistically fast little context thinking suit consistent design
There nothing wrong good
It difficult
The rigid way Agile often implemented large organization typically using Scrum similar method make thing even challenging
sprint force tunnel vision design team may focused particular feature user story hand may ignore product design implication integration architecture
However lost
Over year spoken many UX professional work Agile environment many survived thrived
A common theme emerged conversation happily successfully embraced Agile workflow
There playbook strategic organizational factor individual UX contributor best moderately control
When Agile work UX people key factor organization Numerous successful Agile UX professional say manager leadership organization get understand UX really provides key competitive edge
This another way describing concept long arguing key UX success consequently business success
Decision maker organization know UX extra coat paint rather careful approach product strategy feature structure interaction content aesthetic
These manager leadership ask UX designer take feature user workflow already decided upon rest team make look nice instead bring UX person beginning determine thing
On team manager also understand building truly product type research must go beyond simply give behavioral insight necessary understand one design another work
Managers leader organization embrace uncertainty understand lean approach mean always hypothesizing product idea
The rich insight UX designer need work require qualitative method
Whereas organization integrate Agile UX poorly often biased toward quantitative data important persuasive evidence decision making Agile organization UX thrives manager leadership understand team learn different thing different type data
While manager stakeholder understand support UX extremely important reverse also true UX people succeed Agile environment exhibit leadership quality
They point could prove disastrous wrong
They make time reach colleague help produce better product
They build empathy observe user struggling
They fight getting time user research design something right
UX pro thrive Agile push team back towards bigger picture context human actually use product built
Agile originally conceived series rule ceremony invented set principle guided team achieve ability respond gracefully change around
The group developer penned Agile Manifesto realized spent enormous amount time energy managing change changing stakeholder expectation changing market landscape changing requirement
If change constant try fight
Build process take change account treat chaos expected input
Agile mindset radical transparency admitting team know answer beginning project
In practice many organization implement using Scrum widely used Agile methodology
Organizations often adopt Scrum right wealth resource help quickly undergo Agile The end result often new set inflexible process standard constant meeting confusing jargon
Unfortunately orthodox Scrum process work well UX UX originally considered Scrum definition
It process focusing small independent unit work typically form user story make sense perspective tricky standpoint
Users interact small part design isolation use product accomplish larger goal piece design must work together harmoniously provide good user experience
In fact omnichannel world user expect company total user experience even developed different team
UX work well Agile process completely policed strict
If organization stickler blow whistle example UX work design sprint ahead developer becomes tough UX people
UX professional succeed Agile environment care responding gracefully change long standup meeting last
Teams incorporate UX well figure manage task user story UX time get ahead production create validated researched thoughtful design
Effective Agile team must communicate well common understanding project goal large small
UX professional step beyond pixel pushing decoration key part team
When UX organized separate department consults various product team UX professional may feel level ownership project may difficulty developing trust common ground member
A critical piece UX Agile puzzle successful team developer respect UX people process willing listen insight idea
But state fact come working together close proximity UX professional must earn developer trust rigorously validating design idea improving communicating rigor rest team honest approachable way
It difficult make UX Agile work together UX person struggling Agile alone
Typical Agile process take account time resource scope UX people need order deliver product
Despite UX Agile coexist well provided organization management understands support UX work UX practitioner display leadership spend time outreach colleague Agile workflow flexible enough accommodate need UX UX people part product team build respect rapport developer

process enhancing user satisfaction product improving pleasure provided interaction product
User experience design encompasses traditional HCI design extends addressing aspect product service perceived user
The field user experience design discipline root field since late focused interaction human user machine contextual environment design system address user experience
With proliferation workplace computer early started become concern designer
It user experience architect coined term user experience brought wider audience
I invented term I thought human interface usability narrow
I wanted cover aspect person experience system including industrial design graphic interface physical interaction manual
Since term spread widely much starting lose meaning
The term also recent connection also incorporates element similar design field
User experience design includes element discipline concerned fact overall experience delivered user
Following short analysis constituent part
Visual design also commonly known represents aesthetic front end
Graphic treatment interface element often perceived visual design
The purpose visual design use visual element like color image symbol convey message audience
Fundamentals give cognitive perspective create effective visual communication
Information architecture art science structuring organizing information product service support
In context information architecture information separate knowledge data lie nebulously
It information object
The object range website software application image et al
It also concerned term used describe represent content object document people process organization
Navigation design way interface element placed regulate user movement information architecture make simple
reducing information basic building unit relating
Organization involves grouping unit distinctive meaningful manner
Labeling mean using appropriate wording support easy navigation findability
critical success factor information architecture
If user able find required information without browsing searching asking information architecture fails
Navigation need clearly conveyed ease finding content
There many key factor understanding interaction design enable pleasurable end user experience
It well recognized building great user experience requires interaction design play pivotal role helping define work best user
High demand improved user experience strong focus made interaction designer critical conceptualizing design match standard latest UI pattern component
While working interaction designer take several thing consideration
A In last year role interaction designer shifted focused specifying UI component communicating engineer situation designer freedom design contextual interface based helping meet user need
Therefore User Experience Design evolved multidisciplinary design branch involves multiple technical aspect
Usability extent product used specified user achieve specified goal effectiveness efficiency satisfaction specified context use
Usability attached tool used human extended digital device
Thus subset user experience wholly contained
The section usability intersects user experience design related human ability use system application
Good usability essential positive user experience alone guarantee
Usability testing technique used evaluate product testing user
This seen irreplaceable practice since give direct input real user use system
It measure fast user perform given task test efficiency intuitiveness product
Accessibility system describes ease reach use understanding
In term user experience design also related overall comprehensibility information feature
It help shorten learning curve associated system
Accessibility many context related ease use people disability come usability
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG cover wide range recommendation making Web content accessible
Following guideline make content accessible wider range people disability including blindness low vision deafness hearing loss learning disability cognitive limitation limited movement speech disability photosensitivity combination
Following guideline also often make Web content usable user general
Making content usable readily accessible type user enhances user overall user experience
interaction concerned design evaluation implementation interactive computing system human use study major phenomenon surrounding
interaction main contributor user experience design emphasis human performance rather mere usability
It provides key research finding inform improvement system people
interaction extends study towards integrated interaction tangible interaction generally covered practice user experience
User experience manufactured designed incorporated design
Understanding user emotional quotient play key role designing user experience
The first step designing user experience determining reason visitor visiting website use application question
Then user experience designed accordingly
The functional specification detailed description set feature need included product order meet user expectation
User experience design incorporates discipline positively impact overall experience person particular interactive system provider
User experience design frequently defines sequence interaction user individual person system virtual physical designed meet support user need goal primarily also satisfying system requirement organizational objective
Typical output include While designing product service client utmost importance designer page client
All information collected plan made design executed reflect final product
Rigorous analysis must done proceeding design stage numerous testing done optimize site per best standard competitive edge maintained
Leading Digital marketing company combine three element provide best responsive product customer
These testing ultimately lead finalize design customer
Let detailed look step step process product design The UX designer need find much people process product design phase
Designers meeting client business stakeholder frequently know requirement conducting interview user home work space
This kind qualitative help designer create product service better serve user need
After research designer must make sense data collected
Typically done modeling user environment
User modeling composite archetype based behavior pattern uncovered research
Personas provide designer precise way thinking communicating group user behave think want accomplish
Once created persona help designer understand user goal specific context particularly useful ideation validating design concept
Other type model include work flow model artifact model physical model
When designer firm grasp user need goal begin sketch interaction framework also known
This stage defines structure screen layout well product flow behavior organization
There many kind material involved iterative phase whiteboards paper prototype
As interaction framework establishes overall structure product behavior parallel process focused visual industrial design
The visual design framework defines experience attribute visual language visual style
Once solid stable framework established wireframes translated sketched storyboards screen depict user interface pixel level
At point critical programming team collaborate closely designer
Their input necessary creating finished design built remaining true concept
Usability testing carried prototype paper digital
The target user given various task perform prototype
Any issue problem faced user collected field note note used make change design reiterate testing phase
Usability testing core mean evaluate create
UX designer main goal solve problem thus ability communicate design stakeholder developer critical ultimate success design
Regarding UX specification document requirement depend client organization involved designing product
The four major deliverable title page introduction feature wireframes version history
Depending type project specification document also include flow model cultural model persona user story scenario prior user research
Documenting design decision form annotated wireframes give developer necessary information may need successfully code project
Depending company user experience designer may need jack trade
It uncommon see user experience designer jump beginning project lifecycle problem set project definition vague project requirement document finalized wireframes functional annotation need created
The following detail responsibility user experience designer may phase project As field mentioned user experience design highly field incorporating aspect business
Depending purpose product UX may also involve content design discipline
The subject matter content may also warrant collaboration planning UX various background business government private group
More recently come represent UX
Graphic designer focus aesthetic appeal design
Information communicated user text image
Much importance given text image look attract user
Graphic designer make stylistic choice thing like font color font type image location
Graphic designer focus grabbing user attention way design look
Graphic designer create visual concept using computer software hand communicate idea inspire inform captivate consumer
They develop overall layout production design various application advertisement brochure magazine corporate report
The visual designer VisD ensures visual representation design effectively communicates data hint expected behavior product
At time visual designer responsible conveying brand ideal product creating positive first impression responsibility shared industrial designer product involves hardware
In essence visual designer must aim maximum combined maximum desirability
Interaction designer IxD responsible understanding specifying product behave
This work overlap work visual industrial designer couple important way
When designing physical product interaction designer must work industrial designer early specify requirement physical input understand behavioral impact mechanism behind
Interaction designer cross path visual designer throughout project
Visual designer guide discussion brand emotive aspect experience Interaction designer communicate priority information flow functionality interface
Usability testing common method used designer test design
The basic idea behind conducting usability test check whether design product brand work well target user
While carrying usability testing two thing tested Whether design product successful successful improved
While designer testing testing design user
Also every design evolving
The designer carry usability testing every stage design process
User experience design integrated form application development inform feature requirement interaction plan based upon user goal
Every new software introduced must keep pace rapid technological advancement
The benefit associated integration design principle include

In act temporarily interrupting carried without requiring cooperation intention resuming task later time
Such change executed task known
It normally carried task part system known preemptive power interrupt later resume task system
In given system design operation performed system may preemptible
This usually applies function service permitted would tend produce resulting
Barring scheduler preempting task processing kernel function simplifies kernel design expense system responsiveness
The distinction determines privilege level within system may also used distinguish whether task currently preemptible
Most modern system designed permit task preempted even kernel mode
Examples system newer system since version
The term used distinguish permit preemption task system wherein process task must explicitly programmed need system resource
In simple term Preemptive multitasking involves use suspends currently executing process invokes determine process execute next
Therefore process get amount CPU time given time
In preemptive multitasking operating system also initiate satisfy priority constraint thus preempting active task
In general preemption mean prior seizure
When high priority task instance seizes currently running task known preemptive scheduling
The term preemptive multitasking sometimes mistakenly used intended meaning specific referring instead class scheduling policy known
Preemptive multitasking allows computer system reliably guarantee process regular slice operating time
It also allows system rapidly deal important external event like incoming data might require immediate attention one another process
At specific time process grouped two category waiting input output called fully utilizing CPU
In early system process would often poll waiting requested input disk keyboard network input
During time process performing useful work still maintained complete control CPU
With advent interrupt preemptive multitasking bound process could blocked put hold pending arrival necessary data allowing process utilize CPU
As arrival requested data would generate interrupt blocked process could guaranteed timely return execution
Although multitasking technique originally developed allow multiple user share single machine soon became apparent multitasking useful regardless number user
Many operating system mainframe personal computer like recognized usefulness multitasking support variety reason
Multitasking make possible single user run multiple application time run background process retaining control computer
The period time process allowed run preemptive multitasking system generally called
The scheduler run every time slice choose next process run
The length time slice critical balancing system performance v process responsiveness time slice short scheduler consume much processing time time slice long process take longer respond input
An scheduled allow switch process time slice expire effectively allowing processor time shared number task giving illusion dealing task parallel simultaneously
The operating system control design called system
Today nearly operating system support preemptive multitasking including current version including
Some earliest operating system available home user featuring preemptive multitasking
These ran without memory management
Amiga OS used relocatable code block Amiga jargon multitask preemptively process flat address space
Early operating system support multitasking however alternative operating system support preemptive multitasking
Other system including provided preemptive multitasking personal computer
Later DOS version natively supporting preemptive include later called higher
Since could also run multiple DOS program concurrently virtual DOS machine
The earliest version Windows support limited form preemptive multitasking used run DOS application commonly known DOS box could preempted
In application made preemptive running one separate address space application remained cooperative backward compatibility
In Windows protected mode kernel virtual device driver ran preemptively application shared address space
Preemptive multitasking always supported version native application system many operating system designed use academic business market
Although plan upgrade cooperative multitasking found preemptive model preemptive API exist although limited sense abandoned favor hybrid old Mac System style operating system based kernel derived part always provided preemptive multitasking

What bad thing occur length time slice multitasking system small
What happen big
How length time slice chosen
A context switch two task take certain amount time
Let say two runnable task particular system
Each context switch take time say
If context switch every task left run every period spent running task spent context switch
If increase frequency context switching every context switch waste time
In extreme case increase context switch every whole processor time spent context switch time left run application
Thus performance best context switch rarely possible
This increase time available actually run application
However context switch rare delay application react external event
This problem purely computational program problem program
For example frequency context switch per second computational task waste time network server may take one second reply two task interactive program may take one second react keypress etc
Thus operating system scheduler must find balance computational performance reactivity
Sophisticated scheduler try find task computational one give task shorter frequent time slice give computational task longer le frequent time slice

My goal understand exact difference SoEMT SMT multi threading
Thus far I already found information seem hard find google
However problem multithreading
The best I found apart long winded book Processor switch software thread predefined time slice Can minimize effect long lasting event Still execution slot wasted For multithreading I found However really go detail thing achieved purpose pro con implementation etc
I would thus quite happy someone knew good resource read topic
Bonus also compare SoEMT SMT
As always thanks advance
multithreading convectional multithreading CPU creates illusion executing program time CPU execute one program time
The OS maintains illusion concurrency rapidly switching running program fixed interval called

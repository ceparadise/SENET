Do cheat even struggling work
There lot CS major graduating right pathetic cheat everything
Do side project learn git use
Try fall trap shitty classmate
Does Sohn allow cheater get class
I recall year ago fought dept get Sohn instated hard as required graduation hoped would weed poor student thus increase quality resultant diploma
I really want know whats going got NJIT grad company took Sohn fuckin suck know shit
He know basic learn like class instantiate object
We put tech support good good anyway
I pissed I wanted tear head I constantly odds Director Engineering
He always joking good student come NJIT bother wasting time money going career fair
I fighting hard prove wrong shit come school I feel like hope lost
If need full time December let know nah I super sure actually CoE people get class
All need pas quiz least last semester assignment collected
So pas exam people without coding
As sure know knowing idea different actually coding
All need pas quiz least last semester assignment collected
Wait
Are referring Sohn class
Yes changed requirement
The midterm final
People scrape
I work full time ca go class I employed software engineer
The quality assignment lecture high I wish would require work completed
Wait saying assignment total grade
EDIT looked latest syllabus holy cow
How happen
After fighting department take I repeated class even though I took Ryon I could get as whooping assignment
Too many people must failing class
I disappointed
This explains new clown company got CS program
It starting feel like lost cause
Yeah pretty much gave transcript I saw last year feedback
It going hurt reputation NJIT
I made mission network outside school community
Many employer avoid NJIT like plague
We horrible reputation despite gem faculty student body
What feedback like last year
How see feedback
I rather say showed something along line need take away hope new student early possible computer science programming easy
Teach C Make CS program harder
I laughed feedback although I agree harder
I agree teach C industry better system language designed
Not really
C perfect middle ground embedded FPGA level coding logic interpreted language like python
I looked syllabus well I feel like kind policy NJIT whereby one item
final exam could worth XX final grade
I sure departmental thing number would came back superstorm Sandy took common exam schedule Physics professor changing course grade breakdown compensate
I taking another guy midterm final pop quiz never gave automatically get point Can tell career fair
Who come
Do people actually get hired
I graduating IT major go
A lot faculty great finding cheater even practice make cheating super easy
Online exam question taken googleable quiz
Exams change year year
Projects half people floor completed previous semester
It easy get work people done
Also easy group project nothing let everyone else carry
guy
I know many senior got job easily I know one confused struggling much
And actually learn anything despite well class
If enjoy CS outside class I learned everything I know IT programming stuff fun outside class
By participating community
Classes reinforce knowledge make concrete learning outside class building block build knowledge
Thank
This useful advice
Thank hit nail perfectly
We situation procrastinated chance fail assignment take someone el code
You want successful college think realize grade important need able thing thing well
Cheating never get
Any advice thing learn outside class
Again I would use git side project learn
Depending plan JavaScript side thing really popular Angular Node Backbone
I would try figure want life work thing project language technology
A fundamental language Assembly basic fortran COBOL scripting language BASH Kshell
Learn embedded programming future
Also learn adaptation
Would Python suffice scripting language
Assembly sound little low level taste
Would C suffice
I open learning new thing I want make sure I actually use point
C Python together along java NJIT make learn good want go coding software development
Any career requires extensive supplementation beyond NJIT offer
Coding Apps
really
Coding embedded IoT COE
Coding big data
NO Coding system testing maintenance
Nope maybe IT
How machine learning big data
Any tip
No NJIT CS class I aware teach coding level machine learning neural network fuzzy logic
That said
Embedded programming machine learning future worth teaching
embedded programming future Can elaborate
I working learning ARM side
The internet thing
Basically computing split large cloud based small efficient embedded system future
ARM good architecture learn
deleted When I took freshman A CS major even move deleted based Python right
version
The version really matter
The general programming concept syntax still across every version last year
Not sure rate Probably bunch major nothing programming stupidly forced take
Or people programming saw part assumed would easy elective required basic literacy skill rather programming
What I prepare Calc since I took AP Calc already HS
As struggling CS major make learn programming language understand
You make sure practice time well even even class
CS CS really easy CS everything else really good problem solving programming
Dont memory stuff learn understand
If hate math programming change major
Not enough I say
I IT major class IT CS major must take
I Java
As make use required tutoring hour
When studying exam I terribly first
But I changed studying habit redoing practice final til I could eye closed
This helped raise next two exam grade range
Always programming assignment
It tough reward knowing worth
Good luck
Be good math

Meshing element present significant challenge associate professor computer science leading charge solve

By In classroom Georgia Tech among laptop notebook line code senior computer science major Marguerite Murrell like play game dubbed Count Girls
If I keep two hand I win Murrell said
There certainly girl probably computer science program nation
But lot guy
Women earn computer science bachelor degree United States
And leader Apple CEO Tim Cook US tech industry solve gender imbalance issue America lose lead tech
But recent year number top college made effort draw woman field revamped introductory course make technology le intimidating enter college without prior programming effort
Many school boast gender parity basic course incoming freshman class
But student men continue dominate technical course robotics machine learning security Count Girls still yield poor result class
A confluence factor prevent woman pursuing persisting computer science major according Wendy DuBow director evaluation senior research scientist National Center Women Information Technology
A lack exposure computer science engineering concept middle school high school teacher parent steering girl away class general lack awareness potential career tech field contribute
Recent sexual harassment case tech firm Uber also make field appear attractive place woman build career DuBow said matter lucrative
Carnegie Mellon University Massachusetts Institute Technology MIT Harvard University Stanford University University Georgia Institute Technology made concerted effort attract female student computer science program
Academic institution commit parity really start see result use practice like scaffolding intro course making sure faculty use inclusive pedagogy classroom DuBow said
However challenge isolation stereotyping confidence still remain
What follows look beyond glossy college catalogue female computer science major actually experience campus changing introductory course enough build pipeline woman needed fill tech job
Many college recognize way computer science program structured discouraged woman entering said Elizabeth Ames senior vice president marketing alliance program Anita Borg Institute
For example course often assumed student background programming already
And woman tech little community campus
The success story changing approach found Harvey Mudd College Claremont CA percentage female computer science major grew le largely thanks president Maria Klawe
Carnegie Mellon University seen similar result Women made incoming freshman computer science major far cry even
Many change spurred Lenore Blum professor computer science joined faculty
Her guiding philosophy
The minority community access critical academic professional opportunity advantage majority critical success Blum said
For example male computer science major easy access role model look like professor people workforce likely roommate people living dorm also studying computer science help homework
If woman one small number connection teacher look like Blum said
You nobody ask naturally night work homework
It would probably pretty awkward call guy say I problem homework midnight
Want come
Not easy
Blum launched program supported faculty funded school meant connect female student major mentor advisor woman working tech activity could leader
We helped change culture explicitly offering important professional advantage Blum said
We change curriculum
We changed culture
It rocket science common sense
At time dean Raj Reddy changed admission policy accept student strong math science experience also broader interest
This opened door admission office look closely talented woman could really program even programming since three year old Blum said
At collaborative space campus Carnegie Mellon student meet brainstorm
Despite positive change gender parity seen freshman class yet come senior level Blum said
And male tend transfer major often female leading disparity course
In computer science bachelor degree awarded woman Carnegie Mellon
Rachel Holladay graduated degree computer science robotics Carnegie Mellon said incoming class female
I rarely one computer science class Holladay said
But computer science class robotics class fewer woman
While felt accepted peer professor You experience individual situation feel though slightly disrespected someone listening Holladay said
I tell experience another woman technical field immediately understand I talking
It subtle hard really see line
Larger issue including culture report sexual harassment many tech giant likely continue keep young woman field Holladay said
A friend told tech startup free beer tampon pad bathroom cost Holladay said
Those little thing hit every single day everywhere go need fix smaller society thing make people comfortable work environment nobody want fight small battle every day
You get tired
Research show male female student enter computer science course level male think skilled female think le skilled said Barb Ericson director computing outreach College Computing Georgia Tech
A study Harvard found woman eight year programming experience report level confidence men zero one year programming experience
A lot woman tend leave major even though better grade guy stay confident ability Ericson said
The confidence factor also impact take computer science introductory course opts
At Harvard intro course designed major woman school year
It taken persona college said Priscilla Guo senior technology policy society concentrator Harvard
It sensationalized one course
Every single lecture almost like one showcase tech conference lot interaction engagement audience
It like show
The course goal make programming relatable student offered lot support including several teaching assistant office hour
However get second intro course number woman drop Guo said
And Harvard computer science bachelor degree awarded woman
The problem
So many men woman come college programming experience skip said Michelle Danoff graduated Harvard degree computer science work associate product manager Google
If look student progress department decrease woman course large part many men going directly
Further woman past programming experience often still choose take men comparable experience choose skip playing confidence dynamic Danoff said
Male student even sometimes sign teaching assistant course never took feel confident enough take role Guo said
Female student hand likely justify signing saying I never taken class I expertise TA Guo added
At Georgia Tech every student required take one three computer science intro course One engineering major one computer science major one student
In past computer science taught interesting way Ericson said
And getting professor change habit much time proved difficult added
A computer science student Georgia Tech work coding project
Further lot instructor believe born often think woman Ericson said
Women face uphill climb professor friend family like
Why
Intro course interesting creative social offer plenty help especially woman tend come le experience le confidence Ericson said
Murrell teaching assistant one Georgia Tech introductory course
I see lot girl get really excited coding end happening lot girl say know I want switch I know hard
Maybe I get minor said
So really easy see girl get interested harder actually convince switch entire track
Maria Ximena graduated MIT bachelor computer science pursuing master field school
She switch course study math computer science taking intro course freshman year realizing passion coding
That course also split men woman said
But became interested computer system networking course number woman dropped significantly
Stanford intro course also close gender parity said Mehran Sahami professor associate chair education computer science department
I think awareness potential impact someone computer science seen discipline go become programmer way able harness power technology solve problem across many different field Sahami said
However percentage woman computer science class drop
Women often take intro course later even late senior year Sahami said
In Stanford computer science graduate woman
At University revamped introductory computer science course split men woman since
If really great experience kind serve pied piper sort entice folk really great field people unfortunately misperception high school said Dan Garcia professor department electrical engineering computer science Berkeley College Engineering
The course name Introduction Symbolic Programming recast Beauty Joy Computing
In Garcia allows student choose project work pair
There also component social implication computing lab time
But change yet make impact degree level In Berkeley computer science graduate woman
Saloni Shah senior computer science major Berkeley said noticed woman class increased difficulty
You start realize many people like lot stereotype feel really place Shah said
For example one discussion section Shah one two woman student
And information session machine learning club Shah said female attendee people
I think topic draw woman away Shah said
But know men guarantee men one support
One particular aspect computer science see equitable number men woman classroom across university examined story User interface UI user experience UX course
These subject tend focused design element computer
What draw female area
Even little given crayon marker draw whereas guy given LEGO block build thing said Lindsay Knapp junior computational medium major Georgia Tech
Knapp said course include far woman subject artificial intelligence security
There also perception part field easier especially people coding since child Murrell said
The majority female student interviewed story said generally feel respected treated equally male professor peer
But everyone experienced exception
Shah participated collegiate hackathons usually woman attendance
Sometimes get accepted one guy friend like well obviously got girl need girl present
We make actually try
That kind silly like accepted end day still like guy said
An engineering student Georgia Tech work hardware project
I project
I definitely shown I Shah added
I think actually believe woman belong computer science
But happens often mean justifying get something
Shah also interned Google past two summer said talk much
When past male peer made comment like got needed diversity
I rather get I mention said
Murrell said instance felt defeated woman field
I job teaching assistant really great network female friend class said
If I thing would probably little tougher little lonelier
Still Murrell first technical interview internship said found male interviewer bit standoffish gave easy coding question
I learned stuff two year ago Murrell said
Part like wonder I looked like like quintessential coder would expected
MIT said found computer science community school far welcoming native country Colombia
I found extremely supportive community try really hard treat woman men said
But nothing perfect
After helping create group MIT said heard upsetting story classmate
Some woman group said heard sexist comment lab partner thing like wrong today period
said
Or professor le expectation woman made comment like need get married soon
A lack representation among computer science professor may also keep woman continuing major computer science faculty member North America woman
This another pipeline issue according Blum Carnegie Mellon
Many woman student going graduate school said offered job top tech firm right college
If woman go graduate school get PhDs going role model faculty level concern
After survey MIT computer science engineering student found woman tend doubt ability men feel negative bias recommended school provide role model multiple level including teaching assistant faculty
But easier said done
The best thing continue best attract retain promote woman field said Ian Waitz dean school engineering MIT
It hard
When hire faculty computer science may applicant woman
We still way go
It start undergrad coming fact undergrad getting diverse move forward timeline long
The pipeline get smaller smaller undergraduate level said Garcia Berkeley
The percentage woman graduate student population much lower undergraduate population Garcia said
At Berkeley spring computer science master PhD student woman
The higher go totem poll lower percentage female faculty
This also true minority Garcia said
A lack female representation among faculty teaching assistant impact student
Holladay Carnegie Mellon graduate pursuing PhD field MIT aim becoming research professor
I one computer science class female professor
And computer science taught male professor Holladay said
It bothered honest
I think female faculty would also encourage retention pipeline
At Harvard majority Danoff professor also male said
There nothing powerful term feeling like something seeing someone like Danoff said
I think incredibly important female faculty
Despite gender disparity persist modern computer science classroom fact remains top college graduating woman level national average taking positive step right many smaller school may lack resource
Our challenge sometimes le engineering school whole true lot competitive university Waitz MIT said
We opportunity pick exceptionally large applicant pool small number student
What want class made individually excellent people collectively excellent need broadly diverse class different gender background country
We opportunity large number applicant
Students Carnegie Mellon glued laptop prepare latest assignment
But school alter introductory course create woman group mentorship program persistent searching promoting female faculty member
Even college without lot resource faculty chair dean commit wanting diverse student body take kind step DuBow said
Colleges also recruiting effort among undecided student STEM major typically limited number seat available nursing
The professional technology world also long way go better attract retain woman Ames said starting advancing woman already working
Research show company woman senior executive technical role better attract woman technical role added
Tech leader stop saying pipeline problem essentially cop Ames said
They need focus organization improve ecosystem overall
The microculture organization college greatly impact woman participation computer science Blum said
It whole world change added
We change culture right

In defines input output
A type signature includes number argument type argument order argument contained function
A type signature typically used resolution choosing correct definition function called among many overloaded form
In type signature commonly known
In function example would invoked signature In type signature may optionally declared For example A type signature generally written following format Notice type result regarded everything past first supplied argument
This consequence made possible Haskell support function requires two input one argument supplied function curried produce function argument supplied
Thus calling yield new function called produce
The actual type specification consist actual type general used
So write something like Since Haskell support function passed argument
This written This function take function type signature return data type
In used identify method class level virtual machine code
Example The method represented
The signature method look like And disassembled bytecode take form The method signature method contains three modifier A function signature consists function prototype
It specifies general information function like name scope parameter
Many programming language use order pas along semantic information compiler linkers
In addition mangling excess information function signature stored internally compiler readily available may accessed
Understanding notion function signature important concept computer science study
The practice requires consideration function signature avoid unpredictable result
Computer science theory concept particular make much use concept function signature
In signature roughly equivalent
The term signature may carry meaning computer science
For example In especially commonly identified unique usually includes method name number type order
A method signature smallest method
In method signature method name number type possible last parameter consists array value Manipulation parameter done using routine standard library header
Similar C syntax see method signature name number type parameter last parameter may array value In method signature method name number type order parameter
Return type thrown exception considered part method signature
For example following two method distinct signature The following three method signature considered return value differs
The name parameter part method signature ignored compiler checking method uniqueness
In programming language method signature object declared interface header file
For example defines method return general object take one integer argument
requires type signature explicit type signature equivalent

I suppose somewhat design question
Is possible override method interface overriding signature different signature type
For example let say I want two different class following Would possible impelemt interfrace different parameter set
Or I approach creating base class instead create wrapper method class B An Interface class class must implement interface defined
Your second approach use class specific method extends interface specified class call interface method reasonable solution course mean ca use Interface type could defeat purpose
No overriding overloading
Overloading never override implement original provide overload call interface implementation
Your last option one would possibly work option properly implement interface class
Remember though anybody accessing class via interface access method completely void fact provide unless people may access type directly well
If implement interface HAVE include method property etc
That point interface code contract
That keep overloading method different parameter signature
But need implement method specified probably need interface
I say either go option change interface accept List type
Sadly compile bark exactly implement interface
However I think implementation pretty clean
If going list thing implementation preferred If want class implement knowledge signature add overload signature proxy If want hide signature implementation implement explicitly But need extended signature within scope one instance class last example correct implement original interface add overload signature
In case however anyone casting see second signature
If type common base class interface IConnectable could use params keyword If pas parameter object could derive parameter class cast implemented method

I creating several different class interact different API
I made interface class inherit one method interface take several different data type depending API implemented
Is possible define unknown type method take
For I declaring casting within implementation
Interface Method implementation signature first line Dropbox Google I also tried defining interface defining method signature implementation
But work
There got better way using type parameter
Any idea
Thanks

In based another object class using implementation
Inheritance language mechanism one object acquires property behaviour parent object
Inheritance allows programmer create class built upon existing class specify new implementation maintain behaviour realizing interface independently extend original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise
An inherited class called parent class super class
The term inheritance loosely used programming narrow use reserved programming one class another corresponding technique programming instead called one object another
Inheritance
In language inheritance subtyping agree whereas others differ general subtyping establishes relationship whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship necessarily semantic relationship inheritance ensure
To distinguish concept subtyping also known whereas inheritance defined known
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship
Inheritance contrasted one object another object object one class contain object another class see
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
Inheritance invented
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language
Multiple Inheritance programming widely supposed difficult implement efficiently
For example summary book actually claimed adding Multiple inheritance impossible
Thus multiple inheritance seemed challenge
Since I considered multiple inheritance early found simple efficient implementation technique
I could resist challenge
I suspect case fashion affected sequence event
In JDK Java support multiple inheritance
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level
A derived class derivative class inherits one entity one class called
The semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits superclass
The general form defining derived class Some language support construct also
For example define specification class also inherited heir
The superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality specialized subclass inherit modify supplement
The software inherited subclass considered subclass
A reference instance class may actually referring one subclass
The actual class object referenced impossible predict
A uniform interface used invoke member function object number different class
Subclass may replace superclass function entirely new function must share
In language class may declared adding certain class declaration
Examples include final keyword onwards sealed keyword
Such modifier added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration
Such sealed class restrict particularly developer access precompiled
The sealed class subclass easily deduced reference pointer object class actually referencing instance class instance subclass exist instance superclass reference type violates type system

Because exact type object referenced known execution used instead also called requires one lookup depending whether supported programming language used
Just class may method declaration may contain method modifier prevent method overridden
replaced new function name type signature subclass
A method unoverridable simply accessible class class member function true though
A sealed method frozen feature overridden
If superclass method invocation superclass method
Some language require method specifically declared virtual
others method virtual

An invocation method always statically dispatched
address function call determined
Static dispatch faster dynamic dispatch allows optimisation
Inheritance used two class
Many permit class object replace implementation inherited
This process usually called
Overriding introduces complication version behavior instance inherited class one part class one parent base class
The answer varies programming language language provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class
For instance base method property overridden subclass marked virtual abstract override modifier
An alternative overriding inherited code
Implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass code base class
By default subclass retains operation base class subclass may operation replacing implementation
In following Python example subclass override method base class
The base class comprises operation compute sum two integer
The subclass functionality base class exception operation transforms number square replacing operation transforms number respectively
The subclass therefore compute sum two integer
In quarter class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor
The primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance instance reusing class necessarily substituted instance inherited class
An alternative technique explicit requires programming effort avoids substitutability issue
In private inheritance used form without substitutability
Whereas public inheritance represents relationship delegation represents relationship private protected inheritance thought implemented term relationship
Another frequent use inheritance guarantee class maintain certain common interface implement method
The parent class combination implemented operation operation implemented child class
Often interface change supertype child implement behavior described instead parent class
Inheritance similar distinct
Subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction said establish relationship subtype existing abstraction either implicitly explicitly depending language support
The relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance language support inheritance subtyping mechanism
For example following code establishes explicit inheritance relationship class subclass subtype used wherever specified via reference pointer object
In programming language support inheritance relationship base class derived class relationship implementation mechanism code reuse compared relationship
Inheritance even programming language support inheritance subtyping mechanism necessarily entail
It entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected see
Compare
In OOP language notion code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another
Using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraint
For example consider class contains person name date birth address phone number
We define subclass called contains person grade point average class taken another subclass called contains person employer salary
In defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restriction desirable The alternative inheritance
This technique support polymorphism code reuse separating behavior primary class hierarchy including specific behavior class required business domain class
This approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modification run time allows one class implement behavior instead restricted behavior ancestor class
Implementation inheritance controversial among programmer theoretician programming since least
Among author advocate interface inheritance instead favor
For example mentioned proposed overcome static nature inheritance class
As fundamental solution problem introduces distinct relationship combining property inheritance composition new concept
According main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary form modification base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral change subclass
Using interface avoids problem implementation shared API
Another way stating inheritance break
The problem surface clearly open system client code expected inherit class substituted system class algorithm
Reportedly Java inventor spoken implementation inheritance stating would include redesign Java
Language design decouple inheritance subtyping interface inheritance appeared early modern example programming language
Complex inheritance inheritance used within insufficiently mature design may lead
Another issue inheritance subclass must defined code mean program user add new subclass
Other design pattern allow program user define variation entity runtime

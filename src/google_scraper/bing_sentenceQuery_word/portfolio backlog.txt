Jul AM JIRA Portfolio powerful tool provides easy way manage one team backlog schedule work month time
recently released brings many useful change including easy startup wizard create new plan powerful forecasting tool much tighter integration JIRA Boards
Learning use Portfolio could challenge experienced Portfolio user well JIRA user thinking trying Portfolio first time
Either way guide walk setting getting started Portfolio
One thing great bat existing plan continue used Portfolio feature currently way upgrade plan recreate scratch
Luckily JIRA Portfolio make much easier set new plan synchronize JIRA
The first step click Create Plan Portfolio header navigation
One best new feature JIRA Portfolio Create Plan Wizard make life significantly easier creating plan
In previous version manually find import whatever issue wanted bring plan tedious cumbersome
Now however create plan link plan one board
This major shift use Portfolio much closely linked JIRA board
You longer track work separately Portfolio JIRA linked together
There also option connect directly project filter want use board
If previously used Portfolio bunch epic story plan need push JIRA board order bring Portfolio plan
The wizard brings screen select release even individual issue board want import
This allows filter extraneous work may relevant plan get aggregate view multiple team project concurrently
When get wizard enter new Scope view somewhat similar Backlog view previous version Portfolio flipped upside powerful
At bottom screen see epic JIRA board well story issue contained story Epic JIRA grouped Issues Without Parent Epic
Use cog wheel adjust column displayed customize display useful organization
The top screen show condensed schedule view showing general time line long take complete work backlog
Use cog wheel modify schedule color coded broken gain insight schedule
A powerful feature Portfolio make change Portfolio directly committed JIRA board
Instead warning displayed near name board warns uncommitted change
Clicking warning allows review change made commit change want
This creates powerful sandbox use play scenario without affecting actual backlog JIRA
You see changing release date reassigning priority might affect schedule change pushed board
At point ready start using new plan backlog forecasting
However another setup step may useful depending use Portfolio modifying story hierarchy level
This big change previous version practically made create Initiatives group epic
This feature let customize story organized useful organization
Unfortunately hierarchy system wide affect plan except classic Portfolio plan
To change hierarchy go back JIRA Administration console navigate option updated JIRA use left navigation click Portfolio Hierarchy Configuration
You also add remove type dependency issue blocking related etc
clicking Portfolio Dependencies left navigation
Overall Portfolio look like significant upgrade previous version
It unfortunate upgrade path classic plan lot work go configuring plan
All new feature tighter integration JIRA board easier learning curve powerful sandbox created committing change seems make Portfolio great tool managing team backlog

Graduate Computer Science Portfolio I jumped computer science rabbit hole freshman year University
My family lived outside Carson Valley amazing view Pine Nut Mountains Sierra Nevada naturally I trekked across acre sagebrush photograph every sunrise sunset
After time I wanted show work Web set build photo gallery
Finding software lacking I embarked journey build photo gallery
More eight year later I still photo gallery
I like programmer I paid food gas undergrad building website spare time addition donating plasma
Programming soon became favorite hobby I far biology chemistry undergrad change major
Once I graduated I contemplated becoming medical technologist curiosity I browsed UM computer science catalog
Bioinformatics
I wasted whole week reading cheminformatics instead organic chemistry homework
And thus I began two year prerequisite starting master computer science
The breadth program allowed explore number field like bioinformatics machine learning cryptography data visualization interaction
While I originally interested bioinformatics natural language processing interaction become primary area academic interest
Professionally I interested software engineering best practice delivering robust software I worked programmer throughout entire degree
For hobbyist computing I graduate I intend pursue backlog data visualization project visual
challenging rewarding
I proud project listed sidebar
Every graduate project I completed incredibly challenging frustrating time rewarding
Through project I learned practical skill I also learned overcome fear failure become motivated work grade end
It incredible shift thinking It good enough A It good enough
Also I probably rest life
After graduation I moving Portland OR work application engineer
I thrilled join dynamic company
I also looking forward filling former plenty side learning project
My text file includes trying hand generative art practicing data visualization implementing interpreter gaining practical experience multiprocessing working copy

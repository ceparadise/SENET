Over year ago simulation one force invading another involved modeling tank truck vehicle simulated terrain around using multiple supercomputer High Performance Computer Modernization Program
Other example include model material deformation model complex organelle living organism complete simulation life cycle project Switzerland begun May create first computer simulation entire human brain right molecular level
Because computational cost simulation used perform inference
A algorithm equation used capture behavior system modeled
By contrast computer simulation actual running program contains equation algorithm
Simulation therefore process running model
Thus one would build simulation instead one would build model either run model equivalently run simulation
Computer simulation developed rapid growth computer following first deployment model process
It simulation using
Computer simulation often used adjunct substitute modeling system simple possible
There many type computer simulation common feature attempt generate sample representative scenario model complete enumeration possible state model would prohibitive impossible
The external data requirement simulation model vary widely
For input might number example simulation waveform AC electricity wire others might require terabyte information weather climate model
Input source also vary widely Lastly time data available varies Because variety diverse simulation system many common element large number specialized simulation language
The may sometimes called year proposed
There
Systems accept data external source must careful knowing receiving
While easy computer read value text binary file much harder knowing compared value
Often expressed error bar minimum maximum deviation value range within true value expected lie
Because digital computer mathematics perfect rounding truncation error multiply error useful perform error analysis confirm value output simulation still usefully accurate
Even small error original data accumulate substantial error later simulation
While computer analysis subject GIGO restriction especially true digital simulation
Indeed observation inherent cumulative error digital system main catalyst development
Computer model classified according several independent pair attribute including Another way categorizing model look underlying data structure
For simulation two main class Equations define relationship element modeled system attempt find state system equilibrium
Such model often used simulating physical system simpler modeling case dynamic simulation attempted
Formerly output data computer simulation sometimes presented table matrix showing data affected numerous change simulation

The following three step used produce accurate simulation model calibration verification validation
Computer simulation good portraying comparing theoretical scenario order accurately model actual case study match actually happening today
A base model created calibrated match area studied
The calibrated model verified ensure model operating expected based input
Once model verified final step validate model comparing output historical data study area
This done using statistical technique ensuring adequate value
Unless technique employed simulation model created produce inaccurate result useful prediction tool
Model calibration achieved adjusting available parameter order adjust model operates simulates process
For example traffic simulation typical parameter include distance sensitivity discharge headway lost time
These parameter influence driver behavior long take driver change lane much distance driver leaf car car front quickly driver start accelerate intersection
Adjusting parameter direct effect amount traffic volume traverse modeled roadway network making driver le aggressive
These example calibration parameter match characteristic observed field study location
Most traffic model typical default value may need adjusted better match driver behavior specific location studied
Model verification achieved obtaining output data model comparing expected input data
For example traffic simulation traffic volume verified ensure actual volume throughput model reasonably close traffic volume input model
Ten percent typical threshold used traffic simulation determine output volume reasonably close input volume
Simulation model handle model input different way traffic enters network example may may reach desired destination
Additionally traffic want enter network may able congestion exists
This model verification important part modeling process
The final step validate model comparing result expected based historical data study area
Ideally model produce similar result happened historically
This typically verified nothing quoting statistic fit
This statistic measure fraction variability accounted model
A high value necessarily mean model fit data well
Another tool used validate model graphical residual analysis
If model output value drastically differ historical value probably mean error model
Before using model base produce additional model important verify different scenario ensure one accurate
If output reasonably match historic value validation process model reviewed updated produce result line expectation
It iterative process help produce realistic model
Validating traffic simulation model requires comparing traffic estimated model observed traffic roadway transit system
Initial comparison trip interchange quadrant sector large area interest
The next step compare traffic estimated model traffic count including transit ridership crossing contrived barrier study area
These typically called screenlines cutlines cordon line may imaginary actual physical barrier
Cordon line surround particular area city central business district major activity center
Transit ridership estimate commonly validated comparing actual patronage crossing cordon line around central business district
Three source error cause weak correlation calibration input error model error parameter error
In general input error parameter error adjusted easily user
Model error however caused methodology used model may easy fix
Simulation model typically built using several different modeling theory produce conflicting result
Some model generalized others detailed
If model error occurs result may necessary adjust model methodology make result consistent
In order produce good model used produce realistic result necessary step need taken order ensure simulation model functioning properly
Simulation model used tool verify engineering theory valid calibrated properly
Once satisfactory estimate parameter model obtained model must checked assure adequately perform intended function
The validation process establishes credibility model demonstrating ability replicate actual traffic pattern
The importance model validation underscore need careful planning thoroughness accuracy input data collection program purpose
Efforts made ensure collected data consistent expected value
For example traffic analysis typical traffic engineer perform site visit verify traffic count become familiar traffic pattern area

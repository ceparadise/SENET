I new complexity theory want know structural complexity theory
problem theorist try solve field future
From wikipedia The structural complexity theory simply structural complexity study complexity class rather computational complexity individual problem algorithm I get last line rather computational complexity individual problem algorithm I mean complexity theory focus complexity class problem
Thanks advance Structural complexity theory study relation different complexity class usually uniform one
The two famous open question field Is P NP
Is P BPP
In past common pursuit structural complexity theory coming oracle separate join complexity class
For example people came oracle relative P NP oracle relative P NP
This type activity seems le popular
another common proof technique used popular past somewhat le popular today
Another common pursuit proving conditional result
For example show coNP polynomial hierarchy collapse
Since conjectured polynomial hierarchy strict collapse follows probably coNP
What similar result considered structural complexity theory
Here example Results circuit complexity
For example P classical structural complexity theory
Results specific problem example specific problem
Other result could principle considered structural complexity theory technique used different classical result structural complexity theory usually thought structural complexity theory
Conspicuous example include The opinion
Other people might different opinion
Structural complexity theory codified area research
For example problem may shown
Yet aimed structural complexity theory tell anything new structure complexity class

In particular interactive information interchange also known dialogue conversation meeting two communicating device computer user see
A session set established certain point time torn later point
An established communication session may involve one message direction
A session typically always meaning least one communicating part need save information session history order able communicate opposed communication communication consists independent request response
An established session basic requirement perform
A session also basic step transmit mode
However unidirectional transmission define session
may implemented part protocol service
In case transport protocol implement formal session layer session application layer generally HTTP session maintained higher level program using method defined data exchanged
For example HTTP exchange browser remote host may include identifies state unique information user preference authorization level
thought allow single request response one Session
Protocol version improved completing CGI making easier maintain Web Session supporting file uploads
Most session maintained transport layer single connection single session
However transaction phase session creates separate connection
Maintaining session continuity phase requires
The embedded within A HREF FORM link passed back CGI
CGI us ensure session continuity transaction phase
One advantage one work well low bandwidth modem connection
TCP session typically implemented software using new process thread created computer establishes join session
HTTP session typically implemented using one thread per session mean database information state session
The advantage multiple process thread relaxed complexity software since thread history encapsulated variable
The disadvantage large overhead term system resource session may interrupted system restarted
When client may connect server cluster server special problem encountered maintaining consistency server must maintain session state
The client must either directed server duration session server must transmit session information via shared file system database
Otherwise client may reconnect different server one started session cause problem new server access stored state old one
session handy efficient become difficult handle conjunction system usable embedded system storage
The problem solved using shared storage applying forced peering client single server cluster although compromise system efficiency load distribution
A method using session system without reserve portion RAM storage session data
This method applicable server limited number client
router access point infrequent disallowed access one client time
session use cooky cryptographic technique maintain state without storing much data server
When presenting dynamic web page server sends current state data client web browser form cookie
The client save cookie memory disk
With successive request client sends cookie back server server us data remember state application specific client generate appropriate response
This mechanism may work well context however data stored client vulnerable tampering user software access client computer
To use session confidentiality integrity required following must guaranteed To accomplish server need encrypt session data sending client modification information party prevented via cryptographic mean
Transmitting state back forth every request practical size cookie small
In essence session trade server disk space extra bandwidth web request require
Moreover web browser limit number size cooky may stored web site
To improve efficiency allow session data server may compress data creating cookie decompressing later cookie returned client
A session token unique identifier generated sent identify current interaction session
The client usually store sends token sends parameter GET POST query
The reason use session token client handle session data stored server usually client direct access linked identifier
Examples name programming language use naming HTTP cookie include JSESSIONID PHPSESSID CGISESSID ASPSESSIONID
In process keeping track user activity across session interaction
Typical session management task include keeping track application open document application opened state restored user log log later
For website session management might involve requiring user session expired certain time limit passed without user activity
It also used store information HTTP request
A desktop session manager program save restore desktop session
A desktop session window currently running current content
Session management system provided
On system session management provided Session Manager Subsystem user session functionality extended application like
Session management particularly useful user save open page setting restore later date
To help recover system application crash page setting also restored next run
example web browser support session management
Session management often managed application
HTTP stateless client computer running web browser must establish new TCP network connection web server new HTTP GET POST request
The web server therefore rely established TCP network connection longer single HTTP GET POST operation
Session management technique used web developer make stateless HTTP protocol support session state
For example user authenticated web server user next HTTP request GET POST cause web server ask user account password
For discussion method used accomplish see In situation multiple web server must share knowledge session state typical environment session information must shared cluster node running web server software
Methods sharing session state node cluster include multicasting session information member node see one example technique sharing session information partner node using sharing session information node using network socket storing session information shared file system storing session information outside cluster
If session information considered transient volatile data required transaction contain data subject compliance auditing example see example two law necessitate compliance auditing method storing session information used
However session information subject audit compliance consideration given method used session storage replication clustering
In Simple Object Access Protocol message constructed Extensible Markup Language message used consumer application cause web server create session
Just HTTP stateless protocol
As SMS became interoperable across rival network text messaging started ascent towards becoming ubiquitous global form communication various enterprise became interested using SMS channel commercial purpose
Initial service require session management since communication example
Today application referred distinct messaging
The development interactive enterprise application required session management SMS stateless protocol defined GSM standard early implementation controlled enter command service identifier manually

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
An IRQ value assigned location computer expect particular device interrupt device sends computer signal operation
For example printer finished printing sends signal computer
The signal momentarily interrupt computer decide processing next
Since multiple signal computer interrupt line might understood computer unique value must specified device path computer
Prior Play device user often set IRQ value manually aware adding new device computer
If add device support Pnp manufacturer hopefully provide explicit direction assign IRQ value
If know IRQ value specify probably save time calling technical support phone number device manufacturer asking

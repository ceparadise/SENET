The development full artificial intelligence could spell end human race
Once human develop artificial intelligence take redesign rate
Humans limited slow biological evolution could compete would superseded
A common concern development artificial intelligence potential threat could pose humanity
This concern recently gained attention mention celebrity including
A group prominent tech titan including Amazon Web Services Musk committed nonprofit company aimed championing responsible AI development
The opinion expert within field artificial intelligence mixed sizable fraction concerned unconcerned risk eventual AI
In book provides argument artificial intelligence pose threat mankind
He argues sufficiently intelligent AI chooses action based achieving goal exhibit behavior acquiring resource protecting shut
If AI goal reflect humanity one example AI told compute many digit pi possible might harm humanity order acquire resource prevent shut ultimately better achieve goal
For danger realized hypothetical AI would overpower humanity minority expert argue possibility far enough future worth researching
Other counterargument revolve around human either intrinsically convergently valuable perspective artificial intelligence
Concern risk artificial intelligence led donation investment
In January donated ten million dollar fund research understanding AI decision making
The goal institute grow wisdom manage growing power technology
Musk also fund company developing artificial intelligence keep eye going artificial intelligence
I think potentially dangerous outcome
Development militarized artificial intelligence related concern

What artificial intelligence AI difference general AI narrow AI
There seems lot disagreement confusion around artificial intelligence right
We seeing ongoing discussion around evaluating AI system warning machine going equally frightening le dire warning AI robot going
In parallel also seen emergence system conversational assistant Apple Google Now
Mixed crosstalk
A lot noise
To get signal need understand answer simple question What AI
The starting point
Simply put artificial intelligence computer science
Its goal enable development computer able thing normally done people particular thing associated people acting intelligently
Stanford researcher coined term called core mission AI field defined
If start definition program considered AI something would normally think intelligent human
How program issue able
That AI smart smart like u
It turn people different goal regard building AI system tend fall three camp based close machine building line people work
For goal build system think exactly way people
Others want get job done care computation anything human thought
And using human reasoning model inform inspire final target imitation
The work aimed genuinely simulating human reasoning tends called result used build system think also explain human think well
However yet see real model strong AI system actual simulation human cognition difficult problem solve
When time come researcher involved certainly pop champagne toast future call day
The work second camp aimed getting system work usually called might able build system behave like human result tell u nothing human think
One prime example system master chess player certainly play way human
Somewhere middle strong weak AI third camp system informed inspired human reasoning
This tends powerful work happening today
These system use human reasoning guide driven goal perfectly model
A good example
Watson build evidence answer find looking thousand piece text give level confidence conclusion
It combine ability recognize pattern text different ability weigh evidence matching pattern provides
Its development guided observation people able come conclusion without hard fast rule instead build collection evidence
Just like people Watson able notice pattern text provide little bit evidence add evidence get answer
Likewise Google work Deep Learning similar feel inspired actual structure brain
Informed behavior neuron Deep Learning system function learning layer representation task image speech recognition
Not exactly like brain inspired
The important takeaway order system considered AI work way
It need smart
There another distinction made difference AI system designed specific task often called system designed ability reason general referred
People sometimes get confused distinction consequently mistakenly interpret specific result specific area somehow scoping across intelligent behavior
based past behavior different system learn recognize image example also different system make decision based synthesis evidence
They may example narrow AI practice may generalizable address issue intelligent machine deal
For example I may want system brilliant figuring nearest gas station also perform medical diagnostics
The next step look idea play different capability expect see intelligent system interact emerging AI ecosystem today
That play together
So stay tuned come

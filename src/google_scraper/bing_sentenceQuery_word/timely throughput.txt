I preparing presentation work using documentation provided supplier claim made GPON network capacity
Instantly looked odd I know advanced version InfiniBand go
I could find evidence supported supplier claim turning throughput GPON
The colleague given documentation I working said supplier claimed speed independent device network limited Optical Network Units ONUs endpoint device
That seems bit ridiculous considering data optical cable pulse light
Light travel vacuum surely speed network close way speed electromagnetic wave propagation wire I never heard manufacturer claim cable support speed
I brought supplier rep derisively let know capacity throughput
I aware lot people term interchangeable technical standpoint throughput amount data sent network specified amount time capacity
It would seem like capacity optical fibre flash light likely hold
NB question science behind computer data network I belongs despite reference particular hardware
The easiest way think situation say thing network capacity
To ear term capacity make sense data rest storage medium throughput data motion network data motion
I sure people used phrase network capacity mean something specific appear salesperson using way I suggest accept particular example sale literature appears kinda meaningless move
Not mention clever use make claim almost unfalsifiable
Capacity similar many term overloaded word
In example bring seems meaning equivalent throughput maximal amount information
transfer per time unit
However term used interchangeably ear capacity feel theoretical limit throughput feel practical limit
As capacity fiber channel due coding error technical limitation lead maximal throughput YOUR data
A different explanation may used setting one capacity link measured relative term ratio multiplied predefined maximal rate information transfer
This notation useful computing flow network

In case number reported equal channel capacity though deceptive system asynchronous technology achieve without data compression
Maximum theoretical throughput accurately reported take account format specification best case assumption
This number like closely related term achievable throughput primarily used rough calculated value determining bound possible performance early system design phase The le formal value function incoming network load approach either due approach number data source large

This value throughput averaged integrated long time sometimes considered infinity
For high duty cycle network likely accurate indicator system performance
The maximum throughput defined load amount incoming data large
In system load throughput always equal occur maximum throughput may defined minimum load cause delivery time become unstable increase towards infinity
This value also used deceptively relation peak measured throughput conceal
Throughput sometimes normalized measured percentage normalization may cause confusion regarding percentage related
percentage le ambiguous term
The channel efficiency also known bandwidth utilization efficiency percentage digital go actually achieved throughput
For example throughput Ethernet connection channel efficiency
In example effective Mbit data transmitted every second
Channel utilization instead term related use channel disregarding throughput
It count data bit also overhead make use channel
The transmission overhead consists preamble sequence frame header acknowledge packet
The definition assume noiseless channel
Otherwise throughput would associated nature efficiency protocol also retransmissions resultant quality channel
In simplistic approach channel efficiency equal channel utilization assuming acknowledge packet communication provider see bandwidth relative retransmissions header
Therefore certain text mark difference channel utilization protocol efficiency
In link one terminal transmitting maximum throughput often equivalent near physical data rate since channel utilization almost network except small gap
For example maximum frame size Ethernet byte byte payload eight byte preamble byte header four byte trailer
An additional minimum interframe gap corresponding byte inserted frame
This corresponds maximum channel utilization maximum channel use inclusive Ethernet datalink layer protocol overhead Ethernet connection
The maximum throughput channel efficiency exclusive Ethernet protocol overhead

The knee frequency related required bandwidth channel related system equation Where Tr rise time K constant proportionality related pulse shape equal exponential rise Gaussian rise
Computational system finite processing power drive finite current
Limited current drive capability limit effective signal noise ratio high link
Large data load require processing impose data processing requirement hardware router
For example gateway router supporting populated handling x Ethernet channel must examine bit address determine destination port packet
This translates packet per second assuming maximum data payload per packet table address requires router able perform billion lookup operation per second
In worse case scenario payload Ethernet packet reduced byte number operation per second jump billion
This router would require processing core able handle load

An example communication throughput typically measured interface PPP circuit switched modem connection
In case maximum throughput often called
To determine actual data rate network connection measurement definition may used
For example file transmission goodput corresponds file size bit divided file transmission time
The amount useful information delivered per second protocol
Dropped packet packet retransmissions well protocol overhead excluded
Because goodput lower throughput
Technical factor affect difference presented article
Often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis

Computer Unplug Your Curriculum introduces fundamental building block computer science without using computer
Use student age teach lesson computer work addressing critical mathematics science concept number system algorithm manipulating variable logic
Computers everywhere
But many u understand work think
Computer science explores question
Every student benefit introduction science possibly central life computer science
Presenting activity student allow

A group nonprofit educator want student even kindergartner know fundamental
More job knowledge computer work
Not start one surf web actually run simplest series input lead series particular output
Yet across United States child taught even
It discipline left largely YouTube watcher kid lucky enough born family resource
According Google Gallup half student attend school offer dedicated class
Black student le likely white peer access course teacher parent likely tell boy would good computer science girl
That technical worker company like Google Apple Facebook white male surprise
But group nonprofit educator tech company state district want change
And year work carefully crafted yet adaptable framework education look like grade level went live week
The writer hope help state craft standard ultimately bring subject classroom across country
The response history inequity computer science said Pat Yongpradit chief academic officer one organization steering initiative
People different motivation participating
Some wanted make sure state strong pipeline worker fill local tech job
Others think basic coding reading writing skillset American student need posse
And still others hope creating framework help roll back mindset computer science select begin diversify largely white male space
Yongpradit see computer science literacy modern Right many people use dating apps idea algorithm could literally help meet future spouse work pointed
It hard understand talk around mean without basic understanding server added
Equipping young people fundamental understanding computer science provide richer experience citizen modern age said
According group involved first time people across spectrum come together broad task
Perhaps contrary discipline teacher exactly clamoring someone tell teach educator background computer science state district seem welcoming input
Mark Saunders director Office Technology Virtual Learning Virginia Department Education one handful state actively working develop standard
The state plan use framework basis standard
It bigger preparing student potential job Saunders said
At core computer science computational thinking computational thinking algorithmic process key skill every student use lot different profession everyday And framework help state teacher particularly elementary level computer science likely integrated day framed class think teach concept
Most concept even require computer learn early stage said Rebecca Dovi director education Virginia nonprofit CodeVA work teacher student improve education
At recent camp Dovi whose group reviewed framework said team worked programming concept essentially hinge cheer routine group young girl planning fun
On piece paper girl drew symbol describe different movement
Two line clap
A dot foot stomp
Then learned could use symbol describe routine paper
That algorithmic Dovi said necessarily needing States nonprofit like Dovi working train teacher teach computer science
But general acknowledgement lack savvy among asked teach subject state work standard curriculum present significant hurdle
I think low supply right Saunders said
While number state including Virginia nonprofit provide teacher training existing teacher still pathway state certification teacher
Yongpradit pointed new teacher come prepared teach computer science pipeline still sparse
There also acknowledged challenge losing teacher highly qualified teach computer science tech industry salary often higher
Some district offer signing bonus certain teacher generally pretty small
But Leigh Ann DeLyser national director education research characterized idea teacher likely leave classroom teacher complete And last six month said around teacher city trained teach basic computer science
One trickier challenge getting parent broadly community board idea computer science everyone
For many year education broadly codified AP course level
There assumption DeLyser said student special smarter She hope framework help change
But work
According survey whopping percent parent say see computer science good use resource percent told teacher school official feel way
And parent often cite lack interest subject key reason woman underrepresented computer science yet perhaps unconsciously le likely tell girl would good
Saunders Virginia Education Department also said counselor may likely think student high math aptitude succeed computer science think limited view
Sepi Hejazi Moghadam head research development education Google support new framework find mindset concerning mask fact real difference access encouragement school home creating gap
It kind suggesting higher representation motivated said
Moghadam think school principal beginning look incorporating computational skill lesson though hope framework accelerate pace
That framework developed something minor miracle given writer hundred people periphery offering different opinion
They always agree
DeLyser one framework writer said instance technical thing routing protocol included early simplified pointed minute detail necessarily thing every child need know
But framework computer science maybe moment emphasis maybe even people want desperately happen say early tell
Last year every student opportunity learn computer science
He called federal government approve funding state make goal reality
The nation new education law name computer science core subject writing
And last several year Yongpradit said definitely wave activity federal state Arkansas Indiana Florida made major push level major city like New York Chicago
California toward standard
So Virginia South Carolina Washington state
What designing necessarily ideal
Activists think state focused cranking programmer instead teaching every student think computationally
But ultimately said Dovi CodeVA framework chance show teacher introduce every child every grade level computer science
We really beautiful opportunity really disrupt inequity place said
That hope draw student select conversation lesson big data cybersecurity privacy critical issue today child grapple adult
We said For animal sleep universal incredibly varied
Conservatives warned Obamacare would produce Democratic Waterloo
Their inability accept principle universal coverage instead led defeat
Seven year three day ago House Representatives grumblingly voted approve Senate version Affordable Care Act
Democrats House displeased many change introduced Senate Democrats
But interval Senate passage Republicans gained seat Senate
Any tinkering law could trigger Republican filibuster
Rather lose whole thing House swallowed hard accepted bill liberal regarded giveaway insurance company interest group
The finished law proceeded President Obama signature March
A minute House vote I wrote short blog post website I edited day
The site founded early argue modern moderate form Republicanism
The timing could worse
At precisely moment urging GOP march one direction great mass conservative Republicans turned double toward ever wild even paranoid extremism
Those day Glenn Beck clock Fox News conspiracy rant Sarah Palin death panel Orly Taitz fellow Birthers Tea Party rally men openly brandished assault rifle
Some people responsible sibling parent child grow compulsive caretaker
Laura Kiesel year old became parent infant brother
At home crib placed directly next bed cried night one pick sing back sleep
She say also charge changing diaper making sure fed every day
For majority early childhood remembers tended need mother depth heroin addiction
From early remember Kiesel say take care preparing meal clothing keeping entertained
At school remembers becoming morose withdrawn child whose hair often dirty unkempt
Change come easily peacefully soon

How teach kid programming computer science much learning code
Most people quit
Here idea link help answer question
In past year I published magazine first year common question people asked Where I child begin learn code Or How I teach kid programming computer science My answer variation It It depends whether child adult parent teacher
It also depends learning code answer
Learning comfortable technology learning technology work learning technology help hurt u individually society answer question Where I begin learn code Writing publishing magazine taught vast majority people start coding quit
They get bored
Or coding hard
Or coding really fit thing
For example coding requires lot problem solving skill turn requires balance rigid step step process intuition based experience
Not everybody like combination
From start magazine published article based guideline developed Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA If learn lot topic give coding never learn code understand technology work technology appropriate
If learn code terrific
However learning code helpful required technology literate
With prologue specific answer question Where I begin learn code If kid year old especially younger sibling might want start game toy teach programming concept
For example Robot Turtles great board game neat extension like online community create game board
These game sometimes let replace object direct game person like child parent adding another level fun engagement
In style Move Turtle phone application let kid basic programming
Kids adult give direction move turtle make turtle thing
Each step corresponds programming activity specify action detail action example move action forward way screen detail action
There also robot like KIBO robot developed Tufts University geared kid age
KIBO Kickstarter looking mass market technology
Kids almost age also might appreciate Computer Science Unplugged computational thinking project
Like board game project teach computer science programming concept without computer
If kid comfortable game like Robot Turtles CS Unplugged activity might try next project coding aspect
Robots like Sphero make easy direct cute little robot ball around room graduate programming robot
Computational thinking project also project basic programming Python useful advanced project
From simple use coding kid also gravitate programming language geared towards kid education language like Python
For example least one ebook online teach basic Python kid
They learn small bit language importantly learn programming concept
Languages geared towards kid tend use Logo language kid enter basic direction avatar often turtle follows direction screen use block language like Scratch Alice Tynker several others
These language make easy kid focus language le specific syntax
In contrast adult use programming language syntax structure critical bit code slightly le important
When kid might start beginning board game programmable robot language geared towards education
But also might dive language like PHP Python JavaScript part reading online finding neat project trying replicate project computer
They also might love game learn modify game get coding
I used web browser View Source menu example learn HTML CSS JavaScript million people year ago
Technology everywhere number way older kid latch learn
While parent might mixed feeling kid lost hour video game game lead programming
Minecraft put Raspberry Pi computer designed help kid get hardware software project
Skyrim game make somewhat easy older kid research code modification make game even fun
I also highly recommend find local programming group like Coder Dojo kid adult work together computing project
It structured way relax fun technology engaging people
Technology social activity strictly solo
You also learn sharing debating
And I would encourage parent kid look online resource geared towards teacher teach computer science programming
Often resource like Minecraft Education parent use get kid started kid explore
Bottomline though true subject important start kid adult place find comfortable provide tool explore find way
Programming computer science fascinating absorbing
But discover
A teacher parent ca force enthralled concept making computer something
What I found interesting publishing magazine many teacher want learn programming computer science much student
There lot energy fun ingenuity going teaching computer science coding classroom
Even better fad
Teachers get connection math taught kid generation example math used computing
Teachers also get need guideline online behavior another critical skill want technology literate
What applies kid adult also applies teacher many option learn computer programming computer science
It important holistic focus strictly learning skill
It important kid well rounded view technology love gadget healthy respect work might might fit society
While teacher might enjoy board game Robot Turtles might work great kindergarten first grade classroom Computer Science Unplugged project project geared towards time constraint classroom well laser focus one topic project
If student graduate programming tool like Scratch Alice Tynker Codea Minecraft like great kid project within single class period period time
There many resource online help distill programming language education project kid handle easily
Finally Skype classroom great example technology teacher kid use connect teacher classroom
You learn programming necessarily
But teacher student expand horizon learn lot world engage people would never meet otherwise
As I noted start biggest lesson learned first year publishing magazine coding answer
The answer exposure technology computer science programming
Most people never code
Yet learn enough programming realize phone tablet computer device magical
They tool created human being like
And tool limitation benefit
Tools extremely fun use
It also true group charged creating programming computer science curriculum treat programming one aspect curriculum
While lot hype outside classroom everyone must learn code people charged creating curriculum student take holistic broader view
I want thank reader subscriber great first year publishing magazine
I started Help Kids Code way explore computer science coding meet write people really neat stuff
It fun ride
I look forward second year
To give Americans particular general idea country teach programming computer science
Tim writer technologist enjoys teaching tech people
He many year experience web site application business technical creative role
He wife two kid teenager mad video game
Codea app designed make easy create game software
Here tutorial link online resource
Here quick introduction Raspberry Pi find one get set sort neat project
With link step
Summer great time get outdoors learn technology meet people summer tech camp local tech group
Github important tool used programmer manage code project
Here Github tutorial link learn
It fun easy create ASCII art computer keyboard text editor imagination
Here idea get started
Alice teach programming concept kid create animated movie friendly interface storytelling
Links bottom article collected one place print share bookmark
Interesting story computer science software programming technology month

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Alex Tu advanced placement student take computer science class Midwest City Okla
There sharp decline number computer science class offered secondary school
A handful nonprofit group working address see national education crisis Too America public school actually teach computer science basic fewer still offer credit
It next decade million job tech sector computer science graduate fill
And percent school teach computer science
So education technology sector industry year growing stepping
At Silicon Valley hotel recently venture capitalist interested party heard funding pitch watched demonstration startup backed incubator called
One aim teach kid year old younger fundamental programming game guide fuzz ball
As soon start learning coding earlier start learning something better later life say Grechen Huebner Kodable
She working two computer screen demonstrate game work
Kids drag drop symbol get fuzzy character go maze learn condition loop function even debugging say
So kid barely shed diaper really learn code
Huebner think vital
We kid young using
Five kinda sweet spot
My daughter behind I think
She started coding
Bad parent
Even kid offered computer science concept growing consensus student get exposed basic computer science concept early
Kodable startup hope make profit filling enormous void American public education
Ninety percent school even teach
So parent school even offer class kid going preparation need century say Hadi Partovi nonprofit
Just like teach electricity work biology basic also know Internet work apps work
Schools need add curriculum
Through Partovi working get kid parent school interested computer science curriculum
public elementary school Baltimore recently took part Hour Code start learn basic coding even though realize
So moving three block press start one say
Gretchen LeGrand nonprofit trying bring computer science fundamental underserved kid city
She say huge challenge district resource
The computer old outdated
We either ca install software want use teach computer programming connection slow say
She adapt teaching coding without computer teacher calling teaching Partovi say teaching computer science esoteric knowledge computer geek filling job Google Microsoft
Most job big company
It training globally competitive workforce keeping every sector economy thriving
Our future lawyer doctor politician businessmen folk job need little bit background world around work Partovi say
It around u every industry get impacted
According study largest adopted secondary school standard computer science
At time sharp decline last five year number introductory advanced placement AP computer science class offered secondary school
Ironically decline come state tout improvement science technology engineering math STEM curriculum
And several voiced deep concern new Common Core state standard promote significant computer science content either math science
There bright spot Los Angeles recently boosted commitment expanding computer science offering
But long way go say Chris Stephenson directs Computer Science Teachers Association
She say big problem profound confusion computer science
Too many parent administrator conflate gaming basic literacy computer science principle practice computing coding
I administrator actually say good intention know kid learning computer science school computer school
And true Stephenson say
I think understand access computer learning computer science Bunsen burner cupboard learning chemistry say
There scientific discipline ca learn playing around technology
The guesstimate percent school teach computer science based largely data student take computer science annually
The real percentage may lower
Nobody track figure nationally
Some sobering stats last year AP data It crazy small
I mean would absurd scary terrifying Stephenson say
So never mind digital divide growing digital information divide
Computer science education seems privileged knowledge accessible mostly affluent kid
The people likely succeed access kid really need look fact figure horrified Stephenson say
She say Hour Code reached million student around world terrific start
But credit say knowledge gap continue widen

In science computing engineering device system object viewed term input output without knowledge internal working
Its implementation opaque black
Almost anything might referred black box
To analyse something typical black box approach behavior accounted infer unknown
The usual representation centered box
The opposite black box system inner component logic available inspection commonly referred sometimes also known clear box glass box
The modern term black box seems entered English language around
In electronic process led electronic circuit regarded black box characterized response signal applied traced published idea developed form
Although Cauer use term others followed certainly describe method analysis
put concept even earlier attributing explicit use black box argues component implicitly treated
In full treatment given
A black box described unknown system identified using technique
He saw first step able copy output behavior black box
Many engineer scientist epistemologist used perfected black box theory
The abstraction representing class concrete viewed solely term The constitution structure box altogether irrelevant approach consideration purely external phenomenological
In word behavior system accounted
The understanding based explanatory principle An observer make observation time
All observation input output written table form sequence time state various part input output recorded
Thus using example examining box fallen might lead protocol Thus every system fundamentally investigated collection long protocol drawn time showing sequence input output state
From follows fundamental deduction knowledge obtainable Black Box given input output obtained protocol nothing
If observer also control input investigation turn illustration hypothesis tested directly
When experimenter also motivated control box active feedback relation promoting called architecture
The construction predictive using existing historic data observation table
A developed validated model method ensures based solely element
With input past event used modeling effort entered model see well output match known result
thing defined term function
The term applied field otherwise inquiry definition made relation appearance something
specifically thing black box state related characteristic behaviour within
Specifically inquiry focused upon thing immediately apparent characteristic therefore factor consideration held within hidden immediate observation
The observer assumed ignorant first instance majority available held inner situation away investigation
The element definition shown characterised system observable element enter perhaps imaginary box set different output emerging also observable
In one us black box theory describe understand factor field marketing applied analysis
The state fully understood output
however even wider application professional study The child try open door manipulate handle input produce desired movement latch output learn control one without able see internal mechanism link
In daily life confronted every turn system whose internal mechanism fully open inspection must treated method appropriate Black Box
This simple rule proved effective illustration Black Box principle cybernetics used control situation gone deeply may seem complex
A example Black Box principle treatment mental patient
The human brain certainly Black Box great deal neurological research going understand mechanism brain progress treatment also made observing patient response stimulus

study theory experimentation engineering form basic design use computer
It scientific practical approach application systematic study feasibility structure expression mechanization methodical underlie acquisition representation processing storage communication access information
An alternate succinct definition computer science study automating algorithmic process scale
A specializes theory computation design computational system
Its field divided variety theoretical
Some field explores fundamental property intractable problem highly abstract field emphasize visual application
Other field still focus challenge implementing computation
For example considers various approach description computation study investigates various aspect use
considers challenge making computer computation useful usable human
The earliest foundation would become computer science predate invention modern
Machines calculating fixed numerical task existed since antiquity aiding computation multiplication division
Further performing computation existed since antiquity even development sophisticated computing equipment

In demonstrated digital mechanical calculator called
He may considered first computer scientist information theorist among reason documenting binary number system
In launched industry released simplified first calculating machine strong enough reliable enough used daily office environment
started design first eventually gave idea first
He started developing machine le two year sketched many salient feature modern computer
A crucial step adoption punched card system derived making infinitely programmable
In translation French article Analytical Engine wrote one many note included algorithm compute considered first computer program
Around invented used process statistical information eventually company became part
In one hundred year Babbage impossible dream convinced IBM making kind punched card equipment also calculator business develop giant programmable calculator based Babbage Analytical Engine used card central computing unit
When machine finished hailed Babbage dream come true
During new powerful machine developed term came refer machine rather human predecessor
As became clear computer could used mathematical calculation field computer science broadened study general
Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch
As discipline computer science span range topic theoretical study algorithm limit computation practical issue implementing computing system hardware software

strategy knowledge ordering used variety field including software humanistic scientific theory see management organization
In practice seen style thinking teaching leadership
A approach also known case used synonym essentially breaking system gain insight compositional reverse engineering fashion
In approach overview system formulated specifying detailing subsystem
Each subsystem refined yet greater detail sometimes many additional subsystem level entire specification reduced base element
A model often specified assistance black box make easier manipulate
However black box may fail clarify elementary mechanism detailed enough realistically validate model
Top approach start big picture
It break smaller segment
A approach piecing together system give rise complex system thus making original system emergent system
processing type based incoming data environment form
From cognitive psychology perspective information enters eye one direction sensory input bottom turned image brain interpreted recognized perception output built processing final cognition
In approach individual base element system first specified great detail
These element linked together form larger subsystem turn linked sometimes many level complete system formed
This strategy often resembles seed model beginning small eventually grow complexity completeness
However organic strategy may result tangle element subsystem developed isolation subject local optimization opposed meeting global purpose
During design development new product designer engineer rely approach
The approach utilized existing component selected integrated product
An example would include selecting particular fastener bolt designing receiving component fastener fit properly
In approach custom fastener would designed would fit properly receiving component
For perspective product restrictive requirement weight geometry safety environment etc
approach taken almost everything custom designed
However important minimize cost increase component availability manufacturing equipment approach would taken many component bolt gear bearing etc
would selected possible
In latter case receiving housing would designed around selected component
In approach play key role
approach emphasize planning complete understanding system
It inherent coding begin sufficient level detail reached design least part system
approach implemented attaching stub place module
This however delay testing ultimate functional unit system significant design complete
emphasizes coding early testing begin soon first module specified
This approach however run risk module may coded without clear idea link part system linking may easy first thought
one main benefit approach
design promoted researcher
Mills developed concept practical use tested project automate morgue index
The engineering management success project led spread approach IBM rest computer industry
Among achievement Niklaus Wirth developer wrote influential paper
Since Niklaus Wirth went develop language one could define module knowing entire program specification one infer programming strictly promoted
method favored late assisted demonstrating idea aspect programming could utilized
Modern software design approach usually combine approach
Although understanding complete system usually considered necessary good design leading theoretically approach software project attempt make use existing code degree
module give design flavor
Some design approach also use approach partially functional system designed coded completion system expanded fulfill requirement project programming style mainstay traditional procedural language design begin specifying complex piece dividing successively smaller piece
The technique writing program using method write main procedure name major function need
Later programming team look requirement function process repeated
These compartmentalized eventually perform action simple easily concisely coded
When various coded program ready testing
By defining application come together high level lower level work
By defining lower level abstraction expected integrate higher level one interface become clearly defined
In approach individual base element system first specified great detail
These element linked together form larger subsystem turn linked sometimes many level complete system formed
This strategy often resembles seed model beginning small eventually grow complexity completeness
programming OOP paradigm us object design application computer program
In mechanical engineering software program Solidworks Autodesk Inventor user design product piece part whole later add piece together form assembly like building LEGO
Engineers call piece part design
In approach good intuition necessary decide functionality provided module
If system built existing system approach suitable start existing module
process analyzing input sequence read file keyboard order determine grammatical structure
This method used analysis
parsing strategy analyzing unknown data relationship attempt identify fundamental unit first infer structure
parser hand hypothesize general structure consider whether known fundamental structure compatible hypothesis

Such approach broadly speaking able produce device parallel much cheaper method could potentially overwhelmed size complexity desired assembly increase
These term also employed discus flow information processing
Typically input considered information source considered
A process characterized absence higher level direction sensory processing whereas process characterized high level direction sensory processing cognition goal target Beiderman
According college teaching note written Charles Ramskov Rock Neiser Gregory claim approach involves perception active constructive process
Additionally approach directly given stimulus input result stimulus internal hypothesis expectation interaction
According Theoretical Synthesis stimulus presented short clarity uncertain give vague stimulus perception becomes approach
Conversely psychology defines processing approach wherein progression individual element whole
According Ramskov one proponent approach Gibson claim process includes visual perception need information available proximal stimulus produced distal stimulus
Theoretical Synthesis also claim processing occurs stimulus presented long clearly enough
Cognitively speaking certain cognitive process fast reaction quick visual identification considered process rely primarily sensory information whereas process control considered goal directed
Neurologically speaking area brain area mostly connection
Other area input higher brain area considered influence
The study provides example
If attention drawn flower field may color shape flower visually salient
The information caused attend flower came attention contingent upon knowledge flower outside stimulus sufficient
Contrast situation one looking flower
You representation looking
When see object looking salient
This example use information
In cognitive term two thinking approach distinguished
big chunk stereotypically visionary person see larger picture overview
Such people focus big picture derive detail support
small chunk cognition akin focusing detail primarily rather landscape
The expression seeing wood tree reference two style cognition
In field management organization term used describe decision made change implemented
A approach executive decision maker top person make decision something done
This approach disseminated authority lower level hierarchy greater lesser extent bound
For example wanting make improvement hospital hospital administrator might decide major change implementing new program needed leader us planned approach drive change frontline staff Stewart Manges Ward
A approach change one work large number people working together causing decision arise joint involvement
A decision number activist student victim incident take action decision
A approach thought incremental change approach represents emergent process cultivated upheld primarily frontline worker Stewart Manges Ward
Positive aspect approach include efficiency superb overview higher level
Also external effect internalized
On negative side reform perceived imposed difficult lower level accept
Maravall Przeworski
Evidence suggests true regardless content reform
Dubois
A approach allows experimentation better feeling needed bottom
Other evidence suggests third combination approach change see Stewart Manges Ward
Both approach found organization state involving political decision
In organized organization
ministry subordinate entity decision prepared expert field define expertise policy deem necessary
If agree even compromise problem next higher hierarchy level decision would sought
Finally highest common principal might take decision
Information debt inferior superior mean inferior owes information superior
In effect soon inferior agree head organization provides decision inferior agreed upon
Among several country German political system provides one purest form approach
The German Federal Act Public Service provides inferior consult support superior follow general guideline superior would fully responsible act office would follow specific formal complaint procedure doubt legality order
Frequently German politician leave office allegation took wrong decision resistance inferior expert opinion commonly called beratungsresistent resistant consultation German
The historical foundation approach lie fact century many politician used nobleman without appropriate education became forced rely consultation educated expert particular Prussian reform Stein Hardenberg enjoyed status financially personally independent indismissable neutral expert public servant public law
The experience two dictatorship country end regime emerging call legal responsibility aidees aidees regime also furnished call principle personal responsibility expert decision made leading strengthening approach requires maximum responsibility superior
A similar approach found British police law entitlement police constable vested constable person police administrative agency leading single constable fully responsible act office particular legality
In opposite French administration based approach regular public servant enjoy task simply execute decision made superior
As superior also require consultation consultation provided member distinctive regular ministry staff term staff organization
Those member member entitled make suggestion take decision political dimension
The advantage approach level expertise provided combined motivating experience member administration responsible finally independent engine progress field personal responsibility
A disadvantage lack democratic control transparency leading democratic viewpoint deferment actual power faceless even known public servant
Even fact certain politician might provide face actual decision inferior might mitigate effect rather strong parliamentary right control influence legislative procedure exist example Germany
The advantage principle political administrative responsibility clearly distinguished responsibility political failure clearly identified relevant office holder
Disadvantages system trigger demotivation inferior know idea innovative approach might welcome position make use full range expertise inferior collected
Administrations traditionally work according strict approach
As civil servant level political leadership discouraged making suggestion use suffer lack expertise could provided inferior regularly lead breakdown system decade
Modern form example therefore prefer define framework permissible even encouraged criticism inferior would affect major state doctrine allows use professional knowledge use person office
Both approach exist
There many example program often run government large IGOs many control
Examples program include many small NGOs set improve local access healthcare
However lot program seek combine approach instance international program currently run involved training many local volunteer boosting capacity international program hygiene sanitation access primary
Often school design said primarily promoted design taught architectural design begin basic plan drawing overall project
By contrast focused design
This method manifested study translating organizational system larger architectural scale woodpanel carving furniture design
In control refers top predator control structure population dynamic
The classic example ecosystem
In ecosystem predator
They prey turn eat
When otter removed urchin population grow reduce kelp forest creating
In word ecosystem controlled productivity kelp rather top predator
Bottom control ecosystem refers ecosystem nutrient supply productivity type primary producer plant phytoplankton control ecosystem structure
An example would plankton population controlled availability nutrient
Plankton population tend higher complex area upwelling brings nutrient surface
There many different example concept
It common population influenced type control

Now tool need let focus structure program
Recall command function building block program
Commands go inside function function make program
So effectively build program using function
When defined function said function used break problem little bit make program readable
Tucking away list command inside named function make program much easier read
Note code must function command may perfectly acceptable put start function
Here guideline put group command function
This lead u next discussion mean specific task smaller problem
Each program goal solving problem
Most time problem rather large complex least broken several part
When write program first want consider big picture overall goal
Then want break problem smaller chunk
What first step
The second step
Once step break step even
Keep breaking subproblem defined definite task need accomplished
These task need small accomplished single command small enough could describe short single sentence
As analogy think making movie
The biggest problem need solved want feature length movie biggest name Hollywood awesome special effect entertain everyone see
You see large problem
So let break shown picture
The big problem shown top
Then broken subproblems
We need entertain everyone need good script
We want biggest name Hollywood need solve cast crew problem
Then want awesome sound effect need edit movie
We actually need footage need film movie
Then see one problem need broken managable problem
Here show Film Movie get broken filming scene
You see little problem combined solution little problem make solution overall problem
Now say problem want Karel go street jump hurdle
The beginning world would look like And ending world look like Let think solve
What big goal
We want Karel go street jump every hurdle stop end
What next smaller goal
What task accomplished function
See function reusable
We need use first function time second function time
Finally outline code need write
For sake space function fully implemented
However notice use function make program goal obvious
You read start function like telling story
Each function accomplishes specific small part problem
Let brief recap information learned
Programs made function made command
We need build program using function make code readable break problem
The program problem goal broken single sentence goal
Each small goal get function

A design decomposition system smaller part order comprehend compositional
In design system overview designed specifying yet detailing subsystem
Then every subsystem refined greater detail example sometimes dividing many different level subsystem whole specification decomposed basic element
As soon base element identified easier build element computer module
Once module built effortless put together building whole system individual element
A design also known stepwise design
A design generally plan made plain simple English program
It important note design must independent programming language
The design must never incorporate reference library function syntactic element specific particular language
That reason design written plain English
The concept driving design break task program executes extensive subtasks
The highest level known main module top level level
At point volume subtasks must small
Most program level usually include three seven subtasks
For program volume subtasks must low end mentioned range
Division task subtasks essentially split problem various smaller program help developer easily code simpler part
It usually possible many subtasks basic immediately determine write code complete part
However generally case top level
If subtask take line code recommended repeat subdivision process
Typically every subtask top level new module started level
These subtasks considered individually yet divided various subtasks
This subdivision new level creation process continued coder implement every portion problem using computer code

Computer programming cumbersome early day possible break project smaller section
Around design introduced mainstream offered number perk
Basically break programming smaller subsection polished readable
This approach later replaced C object oriented programming necessary handling complex program
Modularization common term design mean breaking program smaller distinct piece usually one page
This show software made written engineer software developer
Top design easy understand easy update easy debug
Since update essential part programming software updated programmer hand developing program
In case computer run set instruction care software written OOP top
The module easy read since written using tag undefined component
This process done repetitively every module broken smaller piece
An essential part strategy ensure programmer easily understand block code fitted single page
Moreover programmer easily identify bug make program unreadable
Through top design module updated regularly line programmer need
By using top design programming software developer reuse code various program fragment
That way need writing new code every
Simply use written function program fragment

If big problem solve effective method working towards solution break smaller manageable problem
This idea behind
Another term used
A software program needed handle light concert stadium
There hundred light producing complicated sequence effect think factor stage
Before single line code written drawn
Something like This show program
A ideally block code
The code within clearly defined set input output called
A module ideally depend another module time
I say perfection often possible due practical constraint
Each module specific function perform
Its action controlled master program loop
This like conductor orchestra making whole thing work harmony
For example User Interface Module responsible allowing engineer set light sequence manner mean screen input device mouse perhaps light pen
The sequence module might storing editing light sequence engineer press single button fire complicated planned light sequence
The control module concerned controlling hardware
It communicating controlling number
These responsible certain type light
And
The overall structure program quickly explained understood

Program design development algorithm solve problem
Algorithms know set step solve problem finite amount time
By definition algorithm independent particular programming language program design must implication avoid relying feature given computer language
Design single important step writing program
When write first program typically small enough importance design readily apparent
Quite often see write line code take implement program
As program get larger importance design becomes easier understand
Since true good idea get habit rather program beginning even though design phase may seem like waste time
The benefit designing program start code many
Because design typically written plain English usually faster easier write design write code
This mean find error logic design phase faster fix find coded algorithm
Sometimes fail design carefully thoughtfully completely find coded great deal large program discover original approach suffers fundamental problem
This generally mean throw large portion code written start fresh
If designed program writing might throw large portion design cost much le time
The process designing program also allows understand ambiguity incomplete specification original problem would probably otherwise discover already written major portion program
When find part specification confusing ask client teacher clarification may find program allow implement program required
A completed design also provides mean comparing specification program function realistically start coding phase
Any program worth writing must specification require must perform task correctly
Because design normal English easier understand functioning program phase coded form
A good design also allow program modification time
Most program static
That change incorporate new feature execute efficiently overcome incorrect behavior
A design break large problem multiple independent part
These part become programmer reuse program replace similar efficient module corrected module
Because module small relatively easy understand therefore easy debug
Taken individually simple straightforward implement
Taken whole powerful enough solve large complex problem
When write program especially program large complexity task overwhelming
Even small program seem many part beginning programmer
Quite often novice feel really know get started
A top design best defense confusion chaos
It disciplined model designing program allows even largest program broken manageable piece
A top design plan program
We start thinking program abstract think major step subtasks program
As refine step begin think detail involved subtask approach point algorithm step becomes concrete easily translatable particular programming language
One important point remember top design always separate given programming language
It never contain reference syntactic element library function peculiar certain language
This write top design ordinary English
The idea behind top design first divide work program perform small number broad subtasks
We call
The number subtasks point small
For program would expect anywhere three six seven subtasks level
For smaller program number subtasks low end range
Once determined major subtasks program whole also essentially divided problem several smaller therefore simpler program
It possible one subtasks already simple immediately see write code accomplish
At level usually case however
Whenever subtask take line code implement need repeat process subdividing
Most often subtasks level start new module level
We take subtasks individually divide work several subtasks specifying plain English
We continue process subdividing creating new level becomes clear implement part problem computer code
The result method design structure soon learn Computer Science tree grow downwards
Just trunk tree divide several large branch large branch divide smaller branch small branch divide twig module level top design spawn several module next level give rise several module next level
Pictorially depict top design follows You probably understand principle design clearly mean example
We begin specification program develop design program
A word caution order begin
Students commonly make two mistake come designing program
First student frequently terminate design phase soon
If look description subtask immediately understand exactly line code use implement need proceed next level
At bottom level implementation seem trivial
If stop point reap none benefit designing program simply wasted time
Even seemingly simple program find need go past level surprising regularity
A large program commercial program might need hundred module even
The second mistake write design written program instead
This practice clearly waste time
Programs write without designing first almost always disorganized inefficient surprisingly poorly designed
A practiced eye spot program written design elaborated without needing look hard
There two reason many student write program first design last
First many student find logic error program even designing
This mean must make change program design phase consequence design program match
Avoiding error quitting design phase soon mitigate mismatch probably entirely solve problem
Even careful design may find error coded program
You need realize alright final program design match perfectly
In fact beginning programming class teacher recognize design match program exactly almost certainly design written fact
In example comment development design green
Write program print sum sum digit even number input file print smallest number file largest number file
Assume file contains positive number number larger

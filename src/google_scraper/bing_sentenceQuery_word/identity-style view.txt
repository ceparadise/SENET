Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Is citation style within computer science field
By citation style I referring three general method Browsing show roughly split option occasional
So I really two question The answer may I imagine something like Everyone us even though clearly easier read
Regarding Both ACM IEEE use citation style safe say reader academic article CS familiar style
Therefore use style paper look similar conference journal article CS
Regarding experience citation style Smith effective reader
This opinion shaped department Computational Social Science I read mix paper CS Statistics Social Science Economics others
My reason favoring make easier read paper line
Having read many paper given field I familiar cited seminal work
If I see Padgett Powell I immediately know reference I guess
But I see tell nothing
I go look reference list memorize stand Padgett Powell every time I see
But nature discipline nature paper lead difference role citation serve text
In Social Sciences general citation structural discourse field
Citations often mark school thought line argument research lens
In contrast Computer Science citation much utilitarian function point paper provide theoretical foundation attempted approach problem solved
In way intellectual bill material research behind CS paper
The numbered reference sufficient giving anyone pointer bill material need
Another justification citation style shorten page count paper
In opinion le le justified era people read paper electronically print
A computer science paper go either IEEE ACM use one standard citation style feel like computer science paper many reader

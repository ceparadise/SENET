Exposition literature literary term refers set stage drama follow introduces setting character circumstance story beginning
To identify exposition find first paragraph page author give description setting mood action take place
In story Cinderella exposition go something like Once upon time land far away young girl born loving parent
The happy parent named child Ella
Sadly Ella mother died child young
Over year Ella father became convinced young beautiful Ella needed mother figure life
One day Ella father introduced new woman life Ella father explained strange woman become stepmother
To Ella woman seemed cold uncaring
See set stage action come
You know Ella happy life change worse
The example show one way provide background information story
There way author give information without stating situation outright
One way thought
Example Young Hansel shook basket clutched right hand
It almost empty
He sure would bread crumb ran certain want alarm little sister Gretel
He glanced innocent face wondered wicked mother could cruel
How could kick home
How long could possible survive dark forest
In example understand background story main character thinking
We also derive background information conversation take place two character You need wear best red cloak I gave mother said daughter
And careful want grandmother house
Do veer forest path talk stranger
And sure look big bad wolf
Is grandmother sick
young girl asked
She much better see beautiful face eats treat basket dear
I afraid Mother young girl answered
I walked path many time
The wolf frighten
We pick lot information character story witnessing conversation mother child
We also predict something occur something likely involve big bad wolf
While exposition usually appears beginning book exception
In book example may find exposition take place experienced character

I past past everyone know past
When start read book watch movie television program story typically begin birth main character
Instead narrative begin whenever writer want start character journey
This journey could begin character even year old
However often time writer need provide certain detail character past order reader spectator understand story
This called
It provides audience important detail character story begin also help audience get know setting narrative unfold
Exposition conveyed many different way
One popular method via character talking another past
A writer work background information naturally conversation reader spectator piece together relevant information need
We also gain background information character thought
This also often called popular novel
Other popular method use newspaper clip flashback sequence even narrator speaks directly audience
One popular example exposition film occurs beginning every movie
Using crawl moving text spectator read past detail need know understand plot film begin
You doubt read heard opening line many time long time ago galaxy far away far The opening title sequence excellent example exposition film
In novel author typically place beginning
The aim immediately introduce reader character setting
Think popular child story Three Bears
How begin
Get FREE access day create account
Just bit exposition reader know detail bear family live story plot set motion
Three little bear go walk porridge cool
A reader spectator require character whole life story
For example story line exposition reader need establish setting character backstory
Imagine told beginning story Daddy Bear Mama Bear first met Baby Bear first learned walk Mama Bear like cook porridge
Those kind superfluous detail slow story
They important main plot Goldilocks entering cottage happens inside
Whether novel read every television show watch often time writer need provide certain detail character past order reader spectator understand story
This called
It provides audience important detail character story begin also help audience get know setting narrative unfold

What exactly mean standard
Does mean member marked required exist standard suggestion implementation required
Examples include member used simplify behavioural specification
Once member introduced given name semantics class specified term understood specified semantics class member part
Any conforming implementation behave way described specification refers member
For example suppose I want specify pointer wrapper class expose wrappee
I could say Class hold reference object type given constructor expose object
That verbose imprecise
Alternatively I could specify member Class hold reference object type
The specification individual member function becomes much easier I allowed refer particular implementation understood implement way like
base class private nested type member part specification
But allows specify sematnics member function code rather word
mean required standard illustrating class internals look like give idea kind implementation standard committee mind
It basically way communicating intent
Objects certain class sometimes required external specification class store data apparently member object
For sake exposition subclauses provide representative tions semantic requirement private member object class meet external specification class
The declaration member object definition related member type followed comment end exposition It indicates one many possible way implement particular item necessarily best way

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

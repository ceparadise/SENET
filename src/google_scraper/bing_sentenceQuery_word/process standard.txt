In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

In standard however boundary discipline division develop student understanding continuously across grade
Systems subsystem nature model conservation fundamental concept process included standard
Young student tend interpret phenomenon separately rather term system
Force example perceived property object rather result interacting body
Students recognize difference part whole system view similar
Therefore teacher science need help student recognize property object emphasized content standard helping understand system
As another example student middle school high school view model physical copy reality conceptual representation
Teachers help student understand model developed tested comparing model observation reality
Teachers elementary grade recognize student report change thing volume mass space represent error common developmental stage child
The natural designed world complex large complicated investigate comprehend
Scientists student learn define small portion convenience investigation
The unit investigation referred
A system organized group related object component form whole
Systems consist example organism machine fundamental particle galaxy idea number transportation education
Systems boundary component resource flow input output feedback
The goal standard think analyze term system
Thinking analyzing term system help student keep track mass energy object organism event referred content standard
The idea simple system encompasses subsystem well identifying structure function system feedback equilibrium distinction open closed system
Science assumes behavior universe capricious nature everywhere understandable predictable
Students develop understanding regularity system extension universe develop understanding basic law theory model explain world
Newton law force motion Kepler law planetary motion conservation law Darwin law natural selection chaos theory exemplify idea order regularity
An assumption order establishes basis relationship predictability
Prediction use knowledge identify explain observation change advance
The use mathematics especially probability allows greater lesser certainty prediction
behavior unit matter object organism event described statistically
Probability relative certainty uncertainty individual assign selected event happening happening specified space time
In science reduction uncertainty occurs process development knowledge factor influencing object organism system event better observation better explanatory model
Types level organization provide useful way thinking world
Types organization include periodic table element classification organism
Physical system described different level fundamental particle atom molecule
Living system also different level example cell tissue organ organism population community
The complexity number fundamental unit change extended hierarchy organization
Within system interaction component occur
Further system different level organization manifest different property function
Evidence consists observation data base scientific explanation
Using evidence understand interaction allows individual predict change natural designed system
Models tentative scheme structure correspond real object event class event explanatory power
Models help scientist engineer understand thing work
Models take many form including physical object plan mental construct mathematical equation computer simulation
Scientific explanation incorporate existing scientific knowledge new evidence observation experiment model internally consistent logical statement
Different term hypothesis model law principle paradigm used describe various type scientific explanation
As student develop understand science concept process explanation become sophisticated
That scientific explanation frequently include rich scientific knowledge base evidence logic higher level analysis greater tolerance criticism uncertainty clearer demonstration relationship logic evidence current knowledge
Although thing process becoming property object process characterized constancy including speed light charge electron total mass plus energy universe
Changes might occur example property material position object motion form function system
Interactions within among system result change
Changes vary rate scale pattern including trend cycle
Energy transferred matter changed
Nevertheless measured sum energy matter system extension universe remains
Changes system quantified
Evidence interaction subsequent change formulation scientific explanation often clarified quantitative
Mathematics essential accurately measuring change
Different system measurement used different purpose
Scientists usually use metric system
An important part measurement knowing use system
For example meteorologist might use degree Fahrenheit reporting weather public writing scientific report meteorologist would use degree Celsius
Scale includes understanding different characteristic property relationship within system might change dimension increased decreased
Rate involves comparing one measured quantity another measured quantity example meter per second
Rate also measure change part relative whole example change birth rate part population growth
Evolution series change gradual sporadic account present form function object organism natural designed system
The general idea evolution present arises material form past
Although evolution commonly associated biological theory explaining process descent modification organism common ancestor evolution also describes change universe
Equilibrium physical state force change occur opposite direction example opposite force magnitude change occur equal rate
Steady state balance homeostasis also describe equilibrium state
Interacting unit matter tend toward equilibrium state energy distributed randomly uniformly possible
Form function complementary aspect object organism system natural designed world
The form shape object system frequently related use operation function
Function frequently relies form
Understanding form function applies different level organization
Students able explain function referring form explain form referring function
Abilities necessary scientific inquiry Understanding scientific inquiry From earliest grade student experience science form engages active construction idea explanation enhances opportunity develop ability science
Teaching science inquiry provides teacher opportunity develop student ability enrich student understanding science
Students science way within developmental capability
This standard set forth ability scientific inquiry appropriate student grade
In early year school student investigate earth material organism property common object
Although child develop concept vocabulary experience also develop inquiry skill
As student focus process investigation develop ability ask scientific question investigate aspect world around use observation construct reasonable explanation question posed
Guided teacher student continually develop science knowledge
Students also learn inquiry process communicate peer investigation explanation
There logic behind ability outlined inquiry standard sequence scientific method implied
In practice student question might arise previous investigation planned classroom activity question student ask
For instance child ask animal similar different investigation might arise characteristic organism observe
Full inquiry involves asking simple question completing investigation answering question presenting result others
In elementary grade student begin develop physical intellectual ability scientific inquiry
They design investigation try thing see tend focus concrete result test entertain idea fair test test one variable time changed
However child difficulty experimentation process testing idea logic using evidence formulate explanation
This aspect standard emphasizes student asking question answer scientific knowledge combined observation
Students answer question seeking information reliable source scientific information observation investigation
In earliest year investigation largely based systematic observation
As student develop may design conduct simple experiment answer question
The idea fair test possible many student consider fourth grade
In early year student develop simple skill observe measure cut connect switch turn pour hold tie hook
Beginning simple instrument student use ruler measure length height depth object material thermometer measure temperature watch measure time beam balance spring scale measure weight force magnifier observe object organism microscope observe finer detail plant animal rock material
Children also develop skill use computer calculator conducting investigation
This aspect standard emphasizes student thinking use data formulate explanation
Even earliest grade level student learn constitutes evidence judge merit strength data information used make explanation
After student propose explanation appeal knowledge evidence obtained support explanation
Students check explanation scientific knowledge experience observation others
Students begin developing ability communicate critique analyze work work student
This communication might spoken drawn well written
Scientific investigation involve asking answering question comparing answer scientist already know world
Scientists use different kind investigation depending question trying answer
Types investigation include describing object event organism classifying fair test experimenting
Simple instrument magnifier thermometer ruler provide information scientist obtain using sens
Scientists develop explanation using observation evidence already know world scientific knowledge
Good explanation based evidence investigation
Scientists make result investigation public describe investigation way enable others repeat investigation
Scientists review ask question result scientist work
Properties object material Position motion object Light heat electricity magnetism During early year child natural curiosity lead explore world observing manipulating common object material environment
Children compare describe sort begin form explanation world
Developing knowledge base explain predict world requires many experience long period
Young child bring experience understanding idea school teacher provide opportunity continue child exploration focused setting child using simple tool magnifier measuring device
Physical science grade includes topic give student chance increase understanding characteristic object material encounter daily
Through observation manipulation classification common object child reflect similarity difference object
As result initial sketch description lead increasingly detailed drawing richer verbal description
Describing grouping sorting solid object material possible early grade range
By grade distinction property object material understood specific context set rock living material
George annoyed
There plenty water watering left windowsill Friday
Now almost empty wo time go restroom fill water plant science class start
As soon begin science class George raise hand complain disappearance water
Who used water
asks
Did someone drink
Did someone spill
None student class touched watering W asks student think happened water
Marie idea
If none child took water must Willie pet hamster leaving cage night drinking water
The class decides test Marie idea covering watering Willie drink water
The child implement investigation next morning observe water level dropped
The child proof explanation correct
asks class consider alternative explanation consistent observation
Are sure Willie getting cage night
The child quite certain
How sure
asks The child devise ingenious plan convince Willie getting cage
They place cage middle sand table smooth sand
After several day night child observe footprint appeared sand water level changed
The child conclude Willie getting cage night
But wait
say Kahena Why Willie get cage
Willie see watering covered
So class decides leave cage middle sand table take cover watering
The water level begin drop yet footprint sand
Now child dismiss original idea disappearance water take opportunity give class experience disappearance water
At suggestion container water wide top placed windowsill class measure record change water level day using strip paper represent height water
These strip dated pasted large sheet paper create bar graph
After day student discern pattern The level water fell steadily decrease amount day
After considerable discussion difference Patrick observes mother dry family clothes put dryer
Patrick note clothes heated inside dryer mother set dial dryer heat clothes spin around dry quickly
Patrick suggests water might disappear faster warmer
Based experience using strip paper measure change level water identifying pattern change student plan investigation learn whether water disappears faster warmer
The child experience disappearance water continue investigation size area uncovered portion container influence fast water disappears another child investigate whether using fan blow air surface container water make water disappear faster
Young child begin study matter examining qualitatively describing object behavior
The important abstract idea science atomic structure matter conservation energy begin observing keeping track way world behaves
When carefully observed described measured property object change property time change occur material interact provide necessary precursor later introduction abstract idea upper grade level
Students familiar change state water ice idea liquid set property nebulous requires instructional effort working solid
Most student difficulty generalization many substance exist either liquid solid
student understand water exists gas boil evaporates likely think water disappears go sky
Despite limitation student conduct simple investigation heating evaporation develop inquiry skill familiarize phenomenon
When student describe manipulate object pushing pulling throwing dropping rolling also begin focus position movement object describing location front behind discovering various kind motion force required control
By experimenting light heat electricity magnetism sound student begin understand phenomenon observed measured controlled various way
The child understand complex concept energy
Nonetheless intuitive notion example energy needed get thing done human get energy food
Teachers build intuitive notion student without requiring memorize technical definition
Sounds intuitively associated characteristic source younger student association developed investigating variety concrete phenomenon toward end level
In child mind electricity begin source go target
This mental model seen student first attempt light bulb using battery wire attaching one wire bulb
Repeated activity help student develop idea circuit late grade range begin grasp effect one battery
Children distinguish heat temperature age therefore investigating heat necessarily must focus change temperature
As child develop facility language description become richer include detail
Initially tool need used child eventually learn add description measuring measuring device create using conventional measuring instrument ruler balance thermometer
By recording data making graph chart older child search pattern order work peer
For example determine speed object fast faster fastest earliest grade
As student get older represent motion simple grid graph describe speed distance traveled given unit time
Objects many observable property including size weight shape color temperature ability react substance
Those property measured using tool ruler balance thermometer
Objects made one material paper wood metal
Objects described property material made property used separate sort group object material
Materials exist different liquid gas
Some common material water changed one state another heating cooling
The position object described locating relative another object background
An object motion described tracing measuring position time
The position motion object changed pushing pulling
The size change related strength push pull
Sound produced vibrating object
The pitch sound varied changing rate vibration
Light travel straight line strike object
Light reflected mirror refracted lens absorbed object
Heat produced many way burning rubbing mixing one substance another
Heat move one object another conduction
Electricity circuit produce light heat sound magnetic effect
Electrical circuit require complete loop electrical current pas
Magnets attract repel certain kind material
The characteristic organism Life cycle organism Organisms environment During elementary grade child build understanding biological concept direct experience living thing life cycle habitat
These experience emerge sense wonder natural interest child ask question plant get food
How many different animal
Why animal eat animal
What largest plant
Where dinosaur go
An understanding characteristic organism life cycle organism complex interaction among component natural environment begin question understanding individual organism maintain continue life
Making sense way organism live environment develop understanding diversity life living organism depend living nonliving environment survival
Because child world grade closely associated home school immediate environment study organism include observation interaction within natural world child
The experience activity grade provide concrete foundation progressive development later grade major biological concept evolution heredity cell biosphere interdependence behavior organism matter energy living system
Children idea characteristic organism develop basic concept living nonliving
Piaget noted instance young child give anthropomorphic explanation organism
In lower elementary grade many child associate life object active way
This view life develops one movement becomes defining characteristic
Eventually child incorporate concept eating breathing reproducing define life
As student variety experience organism subsequently develop knowledge base life science anthropomorphic attribution decline
In classroom activity classification younger elementary student generally use mutually exclusive rather hierarchical category
Young child example use two group older child use several group time
Students consistently use classification scheme similar used biologist upper elementary grade
As student investigate life cycle organism teacher might observe young child understand continuity life example seed seedling larva pupa adult
But teacher notice second grade student know child resemble parent
Students also differentiate learned inherited characteristic
However student might hold naive thought inheritance including belief trait inherited one parent certain trait inherited exclusively one parent trait simply blend characteristic parent
Young child think concretely individual organism
For example animal associated pet animal kept zoo
The idea organism depend environment including organism case well developed young child
In grade focus establishing primary association organism environment secondary idea dependence various aspect environment behavior help various animal survive
Lower elementary student understand food link two organism
Organisms basic need
For example animal need air water food plant require air water nutrient light
Organisms survive environment need met
The world many different environment distinct environment support life different type organism
Each plant animal different structure serve different function growth survival reproduction
For example human distinct body structure walking holding seeing talking
The behavior individual organism influenced internal cue hunger external cue change environment
Humans organism sens help detect internal external cue
Plants animal life cycle include born developing adult reproducing eventually dying
The detail life cycle different different organism
Plants animal closely resemble parent
Many characteristic organism inherited parent organism characteristic result individual interaction environment
Inherited characteristic include color flower number limb animal
Other feature ability ride bicycle learned interaction environment passed next generation
All animal depend plant
Some animal eat plant food
Other animal eat animal eat plant
An organism pattern behavior related nature organism environment including kind number organism present availability food resource physical characteristic environment
When environment change plant animal survive reproduce others die move new location
All organism cause change environment live
Some change detrimental organism organism whereas others beneficial
Humans depend natural constructed environment
Humans change environment way either beneficial detrimental organism
Properties earth material Objects sky Changes earth sky Young child naturally interested everything see around rock stream rain snow cloud rainbow sun moon star
During first year school encouraged observe closely object material environment note property distinguish one another develop explanation thing become way
As child become familiar world guided observe change including cyclic change night day season predictable trend growth decay le consistent change weather appearance meteor
Children opportunity observe rapid change movement water stream well gradual change erosion soil change season
Children come school aware earth surface composed rock soil water living organism closer look help identify many additional property earth material
By carefully observing describing property many rock child begin see rock made single substance made several substance
In later grade substance identified mineral
Understanding rock mineral extended study source rock sedimentary igneous metamorphic origin rock mineral little meaning young child
Playgrounds nearby vacant lot park convenient study site observe variety earth material
As student collect rock observe vegetation become aware soil varies place place color texture reaction water
By planting seed variety soil sample compare effect different soil plant growth
If revisit study site regularly child develop understanding earth surface constantly changing
They also simulate change erosion small tray soil stream table compare observation photograph similar larger scale change
By observing day night sky regularly child grade learn identify sequence change look pattern change
As observe change movement object shadow course day position sun moon find pattern movement
They draw moon shape evening calendar determine pattern shape several week
These understanding confined observation fourth grade class charge school weather station part schoolwide science program
In planning weather station reviewed objective colleague defined activity
Because age student would studying cause weather change air pressure worldwide air current effect land sea mass
Rather course year would identify observe element weather devise use measurement data collection strategy build measurement instrument analyze data find pattern relationship within data communicate work entire school
introduced weather station student soon school opened
After discussion student experience idea weather asked class kind information thought would important collect might go collecting
The child quickly identified need record whether day sunny cloudy presence precipitation temperature
asked question list became complicated What kind cloud evident
How much precipitation accumulated
How temperature change day
What wind speed direction
One student said heard weather report front moving
What front asked important
At end discussion someone mentioned humidity recalled muggy heat wave summer
When thought lesson reviewed going next realized much student said predictable
He wondered last two air pressure
Those concept well beyond student ability fully understand yet familiar word
decided continue planned focusing observable weather condition see whether child interest humidity air pressure maintained
The class spent time next week discussing planning going measure weather condition tool would need would collect organize data
Groups worked classroom library group chose one aspect weather focus
spent time group supporting idea pushing providing specific guidance needed
He encouraged group get together compare note
Twice week whole class came together group shared work student critiqued offered idea
Several week later weather station fourth grade operation
After much work including trial error library research helpful input parent skilled mechanic student recording data twice day wind direction speed using anemometer wind vane temperature using commercial thermometer student make thermometer following direction book decided would get better data commercial one precipitation using rain gauge cloud formation
Design anemometer extremely difficult
It easy build something would turn wind student needed help figuring measure speed
The child also measuring air pressure homemade barometer parent helped one group construct
supported although child ability understand concept limited
The interest student parent class familiarity term seemed reason enough
The student recorded data chart classroom month
Then time analyze data write first report class weather book make report school
Again work began discussion
What idea student weather measuring recording
Were pattern observed
Many student thought temperature getting lower several noted windy one day rained next day
As idea presented student agreed challenged said
listened wrote idea chart student spoke
When discussion quieted turned student attention list asked think idea board might actually able confirm reviewing data
They listed several agreed following list starting place Is temperature getting lower
What relationship direction wind weather next day
What happened pressure went
Was colder cloudy
reminded student way might represent data help analysis assigned task student returned group
Several day later work well way
One group working bar graph showing total number sunny cloudy rainy day another made temperature graph showed daily fluctuation showed weather definitely getting colder interesting table illustrated pressure dropped weather usually seemed get worse
The next challenge prepare interesting report school highlighting learned
The weather class continued operate weather station year
The student became quite independent efficient collecting data
The data analyzed approximately every month
Some new question considered basic one continued
Midyear satisfied student understood use chart graph introduced simple computer program student could use log data
Not student learn ask question collect organize present data learned describe daily weather change term temperature windspeed direction precipitation humidity
description finding pattern
Attempting extend understanding explanation using model limited inability young child understand earth approximately spherical
They also little understanding gravity usually misconception property light allow u see object moon
Although child say live ball probing question reveal thinking may different
Students discover pattern weather change year keeping journal
Younger student draw daily weather picture based see window recess older student make simple chart graph data collect simple school weather station
Emphasis grade developing observation description skill explanation based observation
Younger child encouraged talk draw see think
Older student keep journal use instrument record observation measurement
Earth material solid rock soil water gas atmosphere
The varied material different physical chemical property make useful different way example building material source fuel growing plant use food
Earth material provide many resource human use
Soils property color texture capacity retain water ability support growth many kind plant including food supply
Fossils provide evidence plant animal lived long ago nature environment time
The sun moon star cloud bird airplane property location movement observed described
The sun provides light heat necessary maintain temperature earth
The surface earth change
Some change due slow process erosion weathering change due rapid process landslide volcanic eruption earthquake
Weather change day day season
Weather described measurable quantity temperature wind direction speed precipitation
Objects sky pattern movement
The sun example appears move across sky way every day path change slowly season
The moon move across sky daily basis much like sun
The observable shape moon change day day cycle last month

The student fifth grade class studying motion direction speed
One experiment study designed enable student understand change one variable time
student form group four student assigned role
One material supply table pick length string scissors tape washer various size weight
Each group directed use material construct pendulum hang pendulum swing freely pencil taped surface desk count number swing pendulum second
The notetaker group record result class chart
asks student examine class data
Because number swing recorded group different lively discussion begin happened
The student decide repeat experiment make sure measured time counted swing correctly
When second set data entered class data table result make clear difference student count swing measure time correctly
Again class discus result different
Some suggestion include length string weight washer diameter washer high student starting pendulum held washer begin swing
As suggestion made writes board
The class asked design experiment could determine suggestion correct
Each group chooses experiment test one suggestion group work continues collect pendulum used generate first second set data
As group resume work one group keep string length attache washer different diameter try start swing exactly place
Another group us one piece string one washer start swing higher higher place arc
A third group cut piece string different length us one washer start swing place time
Discussion animated student set pendulum class quiet count swing
Finally group share rest class data collected
The class concludes difference number swing pendulum make due different length string
The next day student notice constructed board pendulum front room
Across top peg hang pendulum across bottom consecutive number
The notetaker group directed hang group original pendulum peg corresponding number swing fixed time
When pendulum hung peg board class asked interpret result
After considerable discussion student conclude number swing fixed time increase regular manner length string get shorter
note pendulum constructed five seven swing per second peg board pendulum six asks group construct pendulum six swing per second
After much measuring counting measuring serious discussion count swing every group declares success
asks keep information relationship length string number swing form convenient peg board directs student make drawing science journal keep data
Most student draw pegboard pendulum different length student draw chart make graph

Scientific investigation sometimes result new idea phenomenon study generate new method procedure investigation develop new technology improve collection data
All result lead new investigation
Properties change property matter Motions force Transfer energy In grade focus student understanding shift property object material characteristic property substance material made
In year student learned object material sorted ordered term property
During process learned property size weight shape assigned object property color texture hardness describe material object made
In grade student observe measure characteristic property boiling point melting point solubility simple chemical change pure substance use property distinguish separate one substance another
Students usually bring vocabulary primitive notion atomicity science class often lack understanding evidence logical argument support particulate model matter
Their early idea particle property parent material tiny piece substance
It tempting introduce atom molecule improve student understanding particle used explanation property element compound
However use terminology premature stu dent distract understanding gained focusing observation description macroscopic feature substance physical chemical reaction
At level element compound defined operationally chemical characteristic student comprehend idea atomic molecular particle
The study motion force causing motion provide concrete experience comprehensive understanding force based grade
By using simple object rolling ball mechanical toy student move qualitative quantitative description moving object begin describe force acting object
Students everyday experience friction cause moving object slow stop
Through experience friction beginning unit would include development student understanding characteristic property substance boiling point melting point solubility density
He wanted student consolidate experience think property substance foundation atomic theory would gradually come understand high school
He knew student vocabulary notion atomicity likely understanding evidence particulate nature matter argument support understanding
started unit study density concept important study allowed gather data student current understanding matter
As done year began study density liquid
He knew student district elementary school already done work liquid student brought experience knowledge daily life
To clarify knowledge understanding confusion student might prepared set short exercise opening week unit study
For first day prepared two density column using two clear plastic cylinder poured layer corn syrup liquid detergent colored water vegetable oil baby oil methanol
As student arrived directed two group examine column discus saw
After minute conversation asked student take notebook jot observation thought different liquid separated
When writing ceased asked observe
Do explanation see
What think happening
He took care explain There right answer silence You need think
Silence followed comment finally lively discussion ensued
realized many different way student explained saw example thickness thinness heaviness lightness le different density atom
The discussion gave sense student thinking
It clear investigation planned following week focus closely density would worthwhile
divided class seven group four next day
On group table small cylinder
B warned student drink liquid
Each group choose one person material manager one recorder proceeded find could liquid used day available supply table
Only material manager come supply table liquid recorder kept track
Forty minute later asked student clean gather share observation
Every group identified liquid
The water easy vegetable oil
Some student knew corn syrup others recognized detergent
Several group combined two three liquid found mixed together others stayed separate
Some disagreement arose liquid floated
suggested interested student come back lunch time try resolve disagreement
One group replicated large cylinder shook vigorously waiting see whether liquid would separate
asked group draw cylinder content looked like put windowsill check next day
began third day large density column
This time gave small object four piece wood aluminum plastic iron
He asked class predict would happen four object released column
The student predicted watched object sank bottom others stopped somewhere column
What think going
asked B
How explain way object behaved
I want answer went I want try thing talk
He divided class four group gave large density column liquid layer
The student worked group minute
The discussion animated different object tried rubber band penny nickel pencil listened observation encouraged student respond one another
Occasionally asked What mean
How
His primary purpose hear student idea encourage explain one another
The next day began last introductory experience
When student came asked divide four group go table density column
Beside column several piece wood different size
Students think talk piece might column try discussion write idea science notebook
When enough time passed called group together asked volunteer read notebook
Some student struggling seen Others seemed understand
One student read When statement read asked many people agreed
Most student quickly asserted yes
But sure
pulled piece wood larger student tried
What would happen piece wood dropped column
Some student said immediately would stop smaller piece
Others quite sure
This piece quite bit bigger
One student asked show hand
Twelve student thought big piece wood would sink farther thought would sink level others
dropped
It stopped sinking others
There yeahs puzzled look
As final teaser check student understanding brought two transparent container colorless liquid
He asked class gather around took candle cut two quite piece
The student asked predict would happen candle piece put liquid
dropped piece column In one container big piece sank bottom small one floated top
Some student predicted result saying bigger one heavier therefore would sink
Others perplexed
The two piece made wax different
Something wrong
Were two liquid really
removed piece wax container reversed
This time little one sank big one floated
Unfair came chorus voice
The liquid
used water isopropyl alcohol
But noticed several student willing explain sinking larger piece candle smaller difference size piece
closed lesson summing
They seen density column worked liquid tried floating object liquid seen piece wax liquid
What explanation phenomenon
For homework night asked two thing
They think write idea happening experience
He also asked think write example phenomenon daily life
After student shared observation outside classroom would student observe boiled water initiate discussion boiling point

For example influence human organism occurs land decrease space available change chemical composition air soil water
Science human endeavor Nature scientific knowledge Historical perspective The use history elaborate various aspect scientific inquiry nature science science different historical cultural perspective
The standard history nature science closely aligned nature science historical episode described American Association Advancement Science
Teachers science incorporate historical example may accommodate different interest topic discipline intention standard develop understanding human dimension science nature scientific knowledge enterprise science develop comprehensive understanding history
Little research reported use history teaching nature science
But learning history science might help student improve general understanding science
Teachers sensitive student lack knowledge perspective time duration succession come historical study
High school student may difficulty understanding view historical figure
For example student may think historical figure inferior understand today
This Whiggish perspective seems hold student regard scientist whose theory displaced
Individuals team contributed continue contribute scientific enterprise
Doing science engineering simple individual conducting field study complex hundred people working major scientific question technological problem
Pursuing science career hobby fascinating intellectually rewarding
Scientists ethical tradition
Scientists value peer review truthful reporting method outcome investigation making public result work
Violations norm occur scientist responsible violation censured peer
Scientists influenced societal cultural personal belief way viewing world
Science separate society rather science part society
c scientist strive best possible explanation natural world
Scientific explanation must meet certain criterion
First foremost must consistent experimental observational evidence nature must make accurate prediction appropriate system studied
They also logical respect rule evidence open criticism report method procedure make knowledge public
Explanations natural world change based myth personal belief religious value mystical inspiration superstition authority may personally useful socially relevant scientific
Because scientific idea depend experimental observational confirmation scientific knowledge principle subject change new evidence becomes available
The core idea science conservation energy law motion subjected wide variety confirmation therefore unlikely change area tested
In area data understanding incomplete detail human evolution question surrounding global warming new data may well lead change current idea resolve current conflict
In situation information still fragmentary normal scientific idea incomplete also opportunity making advance may greatest
In history diverse culture contributed scientific knowledge technologic invention
Modern science began evolve rapidly Europe several hundred year ago
During past two century contributed significantly industrialization Western culture
However culture developed scientific idea solved human problem technology
Usually change science occur small modification extant knowledge
The daily work science engineering result incremental advance understanding world This activity focus aspect Content Standard History Nature Science Science human endeavor nature scientific knowledge historical perspective science
Students read account historical contemporary scientific study report
Performance individual group public
The teacher us information gathered activity assigning grade planning activity involving analysis inquiry
Students individual report student review peer work teacher observation
This assessment activity appropriate end grade
Throughout high school science program student read account scientific study social context study conducted
Students sometimes read scientist account investigation sometimes account investigation written another person
The earlier investigation likely high school student able read understand scientist original account
Reports scientist contemporary study likely technical student understand account popular science book magazine accessible high school student
Examples contemporary historical account appropriate activity include Goodfield Weiner Watson Darwin In student science journal note inquiry inquiry read throughout school science career including analysis historical context study conducted
After completing analysis science teacher reviewed commented analysis well student developing sophis tication analysis
Questions guided student analysis include Each student class selects account one scientific investigation analyzes using question
When analysis completed handed teacher pass member class peer review
Prior peer review teacher class reviewed framework analysis established criterion evaluating quality analysis
The teacher review peer review appropriate return author
The author opportunity revise analysis basis peer review submitting teacher grade
The teacher grade based student progress conducting analysis well analysis meet criterion set teacher consultation class
ability meet human need aspiration
Much learned internal working science nature science study individual scientist daily work effort advance scientific knowledge area study
Occasionally advance science technology important effect science society
Examples advance include following The historical perspective scientific explanation demonstrates scientific knowledge change evolving time almost always building earlier knowledge

A typical flowchart older Computer Science textbook may following kind symbol
may contain symbol usually represented circle represent converging path flow chart
Circles one arrow coming one going
Some flow chart may arrow pointing another arrow instead
These useful represent iterative process Computer Science called loop
A loop may example consists connector control first enters processing step conditional one arrow exiting loop one going back connector
connector often used signify connection part process held another sheet screen
A flowchart described page divided different lane describing control different organization unit
An unit appearing particular lane within control organizational unit
This technique allows analyst locate responsibility performing action making decision correctly allowing relationship different organizational unit responsibility single process
Flowcharts use special shape represent different type action step process
Lines arrow show sequence step relationship

A type represents process showing step box various kind order connecting arrow
This diagrammatic representation illustrates solution model given
Flowcharts used analyzing designing documenting managing process program various field
Flowcharts used designing documenting simple process program
Like type diagram help visualize going thereby help understand process perhaps also find flaw bottleneck feature within
There many different type flowchart type repertoire box notational convention
The two common type box flowchart A flowchart described page divided different describing control different organizational unit
A symbol appearing particular lane within control organizational unit
This technique allows author locate responsibility performing action making decision correctly showing responsibility organizational unit different part single process
Flowcharts depict certain aspect process usually complemented type diagram
For instance defined flowchart one seven basic tool quality control next
Similarly standard notation used software development type flowchart one many different diagram type
alternative notation process flow
Common alternative name include flow chart process flowchart functional flowchart process map process chart functional process chart business process model process model process flow diagram diagram business flow diagram
The term flowchart flow chart used interchangeably
The underlying structure flowchart flow graph abstract away node type content ancillary information
The first structured method documenting process flow introduced member presentation Process Charts First Steps Finding One Best Way Work
The Gilbreths tool quickly found way curriculum
In early industrial engineer began training business people use tool industrial engineering Work Simplification Conferences
A graduate class Art Spinanger took tool back developed Deliberate Methods Change Program
Another graduate Director Formcraft Engineering adapted flow process chart information processing development process chart display multiple document relationship
In adopted symbol set derived Gilbreth original work ASME Standard Operation Flow Process Charts
explained developed flowchart originally diagram plan computer program
His contemporary account endorsed IBM engineer Goldstine personal recollection
The original programming flowchart Goldstine von Neumann seen unpublished report Planning coding problem electronic computing instrument Part II Volume reproduced von Neumann collected work
Flowcharts became popular mean describing
The popularity flowchart decreased interactive became common tool
Algorithms expressed much concisely
Often used us common idiom language without strictly adhering detail particular one
Nowadays flowchart still used describing
Modern technique considered extension flowchart
Sterneckert suggested flowchart modeled perspective different user group manager system analyst clerk four general type Notice every type flowchart focus kind control rather particular flow
However several classification
For example Andrew Veronis named three basic type flowchart
That year Marilyn Bohl stated practice two kind flowchart used solution planning
More recently Mark Fryman stated difference Decision flowchart logic flowchart system flowchart product flowchart process flowchart different type flowchart used business government
In addition many diagram technique exist similar flowchart carry different name
The American National Standards Institute ANSI set standard flowchart symbol
The International Organizations Standardization ISO adopted ANSI symbol
The current standard revised
Generally flowchart flow top bottom left right
The standard include symbol beyond basic shape
Some For processing horizontal line horizontal bar indicate start end section process done independently Any drawing program used create flowchart diagram underlying data model share data database program system
Some tool offer special support flowchart drawing
Many exist create flowchart automatically either directly programming language source code flowchart description language
Online version program available
There several application use flowchart represent execute program
Generally used teaching tool beginner student
Examples include

This focus important community issue innovative solution societal challenge people group making impact technology
The chart tell quite story
That blue line one look like hockey stick show interest computer science freshman University Washington Seattle skyrocketed since compared engineering field
The UW alone
Countless university Harvard Stanford University Michigan seeing similar demand computer science degree
On surface encouraging trend tech industry get enough new engineer
But beneath surface problem College student want become computer scientist many case enough room faculty meet demand
Young adult today realizing computer science knowledge help succeed software developer nearly job
Heck even journalist like u take Javascript HTML course
Kids waking said Bill Melinda Gates Chair Computer Science Engineering UW
Every field becoming information field program level beyond intro course huge value It also becoming popular thing learn
Yep geek cool today world
Students feel computing socially relevant even hip said computer science department chair Harvey Mudd College
But may encouraging see many young mind yearning build technology change world solution insane demand
In search potential fix growing problem GeekWire spoke computer science professor nation top university expert like Hadi Partovi Washington STEM Chief Policy Officer leading new coding trade school
What found short university appear prepared demand much planned future
There hope
The nascent online education industry could provide help program like proving beneficial want crash course coding outside typical university system
But much need done satisfy unprecedented demand computer science education
This first time explosion computer science interest
Back mid surge advent personal computer
Some argue university tried apply fix keep demand strategy ultimately led substantial fall year later
Then big boom late
Students saw entrepreneur creating website made millionaire wanted
There small number case actually happening alumnus helped fuel frenzy said Harvey Mudd computer science chair
It something like every college basketball player thinking going play But bubble burst leading another steep reduction computer science degree
Now seeing third surge though one differs greatly previous spike
What happened financially driven interest today appears coming new technology particularly seeing power smartphones
This time around I see student choosing major computer science genuinely excited said
Good job almost certainly factor decision many case I see fewer dollar sign student eye enthusiasm contribute something meaningful society cool former Stanford computer science department associate chair also cited employer graduate computer science background
He said latest surge It idea uncertain time people looking best stable education ensure least job Roberts explained
It le Wow I could become billionaire like saw Lazowska Roberts gave last month nuance particular wave computer science major
They found huge spike demand major introductory course enrollment computer science course realize need computer science skill particular field
This vastly outstrips previous enrollment peak late Lazowska said
The graph show Lazowska talking
Here increasing demand introductory course pas popular intro class Harvard example And increasing demand major Finally increasing demand So begs question What university crazy level interest
There simple answer question Increase classroom size hire faculty
However easier said done
At private institution adding space faculty doable stronger funding
At Stanford percent student take computer science course school place cap program
If say people want study certain subject Stanford historically expected figure way accommodate
university difficult time
The UW example expand computer science program two year ago constrained funding state government
We turning away many student love Lazowska said
That Lazowska offered bevy potential crappy solution increasing demand That last idea online education something many agree continue grow used every level education including university
Partovi technology veteran help expose computer science million kid big believer learning code online
The good news absolute best university course computer science also available study online via platform EdX Coursera Partovi said
Although online course completion rate course motivated student access university program due rising tuition cost shortage spot program still available But online class may provide cheaper accessible solution Lazowska warned computer science education without interaction simply good enough
He said lesson UW student learn working small team class invaluable another reason increasing class size could detrimental implication quality learning
We send student Amazon Facebook Microsoft Google team design experience said
You may get knowledge data structure Coursera much le obvious learn work collaborate small trade school also pointed inefficiency online education
Learning code frustrating lonely said
Graduation rate full online course single digit Having company like Code Fellows another potential alternative solution computer science degree
The program one growing number organization teach intensive coding bootcamps take traditional route learning computer science university level
It growing rapidly ever since launching two year ago attractive guarantee job graduation
Smith explained group like Code Fellows also flexibility university respond customer demand hearing feedback hiring partner perspective student understand technology relevant workplace
I think trade school like Code Fellows going huge part solution bridging gap demand supply software engineer ability learn quickly efficiently higher quality team expert guiding said
But advisor previously worked Microsoft startup said something like Code Fellows place tech ecosystem really replacement quality education someone receive university level
No matter smart way get breadth depth education university would something like bootcamp said Verespej earned Masters Computer Science UC San Diego
It If case perhaps university get creative way teach computer science
Chief Policy Officer said one solution could collaboration business higher education
She pointed University Maryland Lockheed Martin one example
These partnership leverage industry faculty teach course design curriculum provide internship research project benefit enabling student get experience industry exposure earning degree key factor looking full time work King said
Or colleague John Cook suggested year ago maybe time Seattle bankrolled technology investor
Lazowska however said raising money program would extremely difficult
He also expressed serious doubt would succeed
People always talk creating MIT creating Stanford creating Georgia Tech Lazowska said
Those university
There never instance one created becoming truly excellent le Roberts former Stanford computer science department head still teach class Palo Alto said like idea special institution teaching essential part field describes Hogwarts School Software He noted industry may persuaded fund something like much like Lockheed Martin partnering University Maryland
But hopeful optimistic solution university level
In fact expects academic institution able produce enough worker may lead downturn economy
Roberts compared dilemma global warming
We know problem something requires individual sacrifice even though downstream benefit shared said
It classic tragedy common problem
The entire economics structure go finding good way keep teacher employed reasonable Roberts cautioned problem fixed obvious solution
He said simply existing faculty teach student dilutes quality education student end receiving eventually diminish quality computer science graduate going workforce dire need
Roberts noted something similar happened surge
Every fix try impose end making environment le interesting positive people need said
If remember happened I quite sure repeat When asked workplace demand computer programmer coming college Partovi shared image
The number bit staggering Bureau Labor Statistics predicts million job student six year
This critical issue university many company
veteran recruiter Director Talent Madrona Venture Group said certainly computer science graduate five year ago enough
It still meet demand today employer said
Partovi note Washington state time open job graduate
King executive Washington STEM stressed importance computer science education meeting demand future job
Computer science job growing pay well
Students know code access best paying fastest growing job nation Washington said
It imperative every young person option particularly girl student color student rural area tend left computer science education hence wonder tech company trouble recruiting retaining diverse But unfortunately one really clear answer university adapt fill job particularly looking year road
With program like Washington STEM pushing forward computer science education expect even high school senior likely support parent wating study programming college
Harvey Mudd said ultimately people power control much money funneled school
My advice would folk control university budget Invest resource allow computer science department meet demand qualified student said
This investment pay dividend satisfaction student ultimately There may hope horizon
Perhaps government allocate fund allow school hire faculty
Maybe high individual like donate money help educate tomorrow leader
It hard know solution I see resource said Roberts former Stanford computer science associate chair
But keep talking
I hope wake people
There hope always This part GeekWire underwritten Singh Family Foundation business leader Steve Singh focusing important community issue innovative solution societal challenge people group making impact technology

A computer generally one operating system becomes active take control system turned
Computer hardware wired initially load small set system instruction stored
You likely used least one operating system
The various version Microsoft Windows NT XP Vista popular choice personal computer
UNIX favourite serious programmer year version UNIX called popular personal computer system
Identify resource need managed within computer system
The various role operating system generally revolve around idea sharing nicely
An operating system manages resource resource often shared one way another among various program want use multiple program executing concurrently share use main memory take turn using CPU compete opportunity use input output device
The operating system act playground monitor making sure everyone cooperates get chance play
There various aspect resource require management computer system including primary memory secondary memory processor bandwidth graphic sound network cache
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling policy virtual memory paging interrupt polling
An executing program resides main memory instruction processed one another
Multiprogramming technique keeping multiple program main memory time program compete access CPU work
All modern operating system employ multiprogramming one degree another
An operating system must therefore perform memory management keep track program memory memory reside
Memory continuous set bit referenced specific address
All program stored main memory executed
All data referenced program program also stored main memory accessed
Main memory thought big continuous chuck space divided group bit
Each byte word memory corresponding address simply integer uniquely identifies particular part memory
To right representation memory first memory address
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
Earlier stated multiprogramming environment multiple program data stored main memory time
Thus operating system must employ technique A program filled reference variable part program code
When program compiled reference changed address memory data code resides
But since one know exactly program loaded main memory one know address use anything
The solution use two kind address logical address physical address
A logical address sometimes called virtual relative address value specifies generic location relative program reality main memory
A physical address actual address main memory device shown figure
When program compiled reference identifier variable name changed logical address
When program eventually loaded memory logical address finally corresponds specific physical address
The mapping logical address physical address called address binding
Logical address allow program moved around memory loaded different place different time
As long one keep track program stored one always able determine physical address corresponds given logical address
The following section examine underlying principle main memory management technique
To simplify example calculation performed base
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling policy multitasking paging interrupt polling
The demand paging approach give rise idea virtual memory illusion restriction size program entire program necessarily memory time
In memory management technique examined earlier entire process brought memory continuous whole
Therefore always upper bound process size
Demand paging remove restriction
However virtual memory come lot overhead execution program
With memory management technique program loaded memory ready go
With virtual memory approach one constantly swap page main secondary memory
This overhead usually acceptable one program waiting page swapped another process take control CPU make progress
Excessive page swapping called thrashing seriously degrade system performance
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Limitations resource specific computer system often closely related hardware system capability
Limitations could include The widely used device magnetic disk drive
It includes hard drive found computer main casing disk portable moved easily computer
Storing data onto secondary storage requires mechanism organising electron medium
As use individual file used user point view smallest amount data bet written secondary memory
A file system natural solution managing file logical view operating system provides user manage data collection file
A file system often organized grouping file directory
Additionally file generic concept
Different type file managed different way
A file general contains program form data one type another
Some file rigid format others flexible
The important hardware device used secondary memory magnetic disk drive
File system stored drive must accessed efficient manner
It turn transferring data secondary memory worst bottleneck general computer system
The speed CPU speed main memory much faster speed data transfer secondary memory magnetic disk
That process must perform disk made wait data transferred give another process chance use CPU
Because secondary slowest aspect general computer system technique accessing data disk drive crucial importance file system
As computer deal multiple process period time request access disk accumulate
The technique operating system us determine request satisfy called disk scheduling
A magnetic disk drive organized stack platter platter divided track track divided sector
The set corresponding track platter called cylinder
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling policy multitasking virtual memory paging interrupt
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling policy multitasking virtual memory interrupt polling
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Another important resource operating system must manage use CPU individual process
TO understand operating system manages process one must recognise stage process go computational life understand information must managed keep process working correctly computer system
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
Processes move specific stage managed computer system
That process enters system ready executed executing waiting resource finished
Below flow chart represents process state
In figure box represents state process might arrow indicate process might move one state another
Examining happening process state Note many process may ready state waiting state time one process running state
After process created operating system admits ready state
When CPU scheduling algorithm dictate process dispatched running state
While running process might interrupted operating system allow another process chance CPU
In case process simply return ready state
Alternatively running process might request resource available requires retrieve newly referenced part process case moved waiting state
A running process may finally get enough CPU time complete processing terminate normally otherwise may generate unrecoverable error terminate abnormally
When waiting process get resource waiting move ready state
The operating system must manage large amount data active process
Usually data stored data structured called process control block PCB
Generally state represented list PCBs one process state
When process move one state another corresponding PCB move one state list another operating system
A new PCB created process first created new state persists process terminates
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling policy multitasking virtual memory paging polling
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Outline OS resource management technique policy multitasking virtual memory paging interrupt polling
Related idea memory management process management need CPU scheduling determines process memory executed CPU given point
The problem capitalise computer greater capability speed led concept timesharing
A timesharing system allows multiple user interact computer time
Multiprogramming allowed multiple process active gave rise ability programmer interact computer system directly still sharing resource whereas timesharing system create illusion user exclusive access computer
That user actively compete resource though exactly happening behind scene
One user may actually know sharing machine user anything special allow
The operating system manages sharing resource including CPU behind scene
CPU scheduling act determining process ready state moved running state
That CPU scheduling algorithm decide process given CPU make computational progress
CPU scheduling decision made process switch running state waiting state program terminates
This type CPU scheduling called nonpreemptive scheduling need new CPU process result activity current executing process
CPU scheduling decision may also made process move running state ready state process move waiting state ready state
These example preemptive scheduling currently running process fault preempted operating system
Scheduling algorithm often evaluated using particular metric turnaround time process
This amount time time process arrives ready state time exit running state last time
One would like average turnaround time process small possible
There various approach used determine process get chosen first move ready state running state
Here examination three In FCFS scheduling approach process moved CPU order arrive running state
FCFS scheduling nonpreemptive
Once process given access CPU keep unless make request force wait request force wait request device use another process
The SJN CPU scheduling algorithm look process ready state dispatch one smallest service time
Like FCFS generally implemented nonpreemptive algorithm
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
CPU scheduling distributes processing time equitably among ready process
The algorithm establishes particular time slice time quantum amount time process receives preempted return ready state allow another process turn
Eventually preempted process given another time slice CPU
This procedure continues process eventually get time need terminates
Note algorithm preemptive
The expiration time slice arbitrary reason move process CPU
This action presented transition running state ready state
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling multitasking virtual memory paging interrupt polling
Operating system must also take account fact computer usually connected network
Today World Wide Web one would take network communication granted however vastly connected interactive world requires management data level
Operating system able process input output fro physical computer usually network card sort
This communication network card computer usually managed Network Interface Controller NIC small component handle two physical data link layer
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Along peripheral fundamental aspect operating system must deal graphic graphic management
Computer graphic generally described setting pixel value computer screen
As computer graphic play role many aspect computer science common application graphical user interface GUI modern operating system
Files folder represented icon screen icon indicating file type instance
The operating system must account whereabouts calculation computer graphic typically done using individual Graphics Processing Unit GPU
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
A type cache
Aside obvious various miscellaneous system concept require management may entirely obvious
One cache
Cache component transparently store data future request data served faster
The data stored within cache might value computed earlier duplicate original value stored elsewhere
If requested data contained cache request served simply reading cache comparatively faster
Otherwise data recomputed fetched original storage location comparatively slower
Hence greater number request served cache faster overall system performance becomes
Evaluate resource available variety computer system
An operating system responsible communicating variety device
Usually communication accomplished help device driver small program know way particular device expects receive deliver information
With device driver every operating system longer need know every device might possible expected communicate te fuure
It another beautiful example abstraction
An appropriate device driver often come new hardware driver often downloaded free manufacturing company website
Discuss advantage producing dedicated operating system device
Mobile device smartphones tablet computer run operating system tailored need
The memory constraint smaller set peripheral involved example different typical desktop laptop computer
iPod Touch iPhone iPad run iOS mobile operating system derived Mac OS
The Android operating system developed Google open source project part Open Handset Alliance
It become popular OS variety mobile device
Android iOS dominate current market mobile operating system though competitor
Outline operating system hide complexity hardware user application
Modern computer hardware incredibly complex
Luckily operating system hide complexity use abstraction APIs
For example application want create file particular location order OS create file
The program need concerned filesystem disk running FAT NTFS etc disk whether network server local drive
The OS hide detail
Other example include virtualizing real device drive letter virtual memory input device Java virtual machine

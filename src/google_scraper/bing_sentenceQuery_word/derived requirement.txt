In encompasses task go determining need condition meet new altered product project taking account possibly conflicting various software system requirement
Requirements analysis critical success failure system software project
The requirement documented actionable measurable testable traceable related identified business need opportunity defined level detail sufficient system design
Conceptually requirement analysis includes three type activity Requirements analysis long tiring process many delicate psychological skill involved
Large system may confront analyst hundred thousand system requirement
New system change environment relationship people important identify stakeholder take account need ensure understand implication new system
Analysts employ several technique elicit requirement customer
These may include development scenario represented identification use workplace observation holding aptly named context requirement workshop requirement review session creating requirement list
may used develop example system demonstrated stakeholder
Where necessary analyst employ combination method establish exact requirement stakeholder system meet business need produced
Requirements quality improved method See discussion people organization legal entity company standard body valid interest system
They may affected either directly indirectly
A major new emphasis focus identification
It increasingly recognized stakeholder limited organization employing analyst
Other stakeholder include Requirements often implication unknown individual stakeholder often missed incompletely defined stakeholder interview
These implication elicited conducting JRD session controlled environment facilitated trained Business Analyst wherein stakeholder participate discussion elicit requirement analyze detail uncover implication
A dedicated scribe present document discussion freeing Business Analyst lead discussion direction generates appropriate requirement meet session objective
JRD Sessions analogous Sessions
In former session elicit requirement guide design whereas latter elicit specific design feature implemented satisfaction elicited requirement
One traditional way documenting requirement contract style requirement list
In complex system requirement list run hundred page long
An appropriate metaphor would extremely long shopping list
Such list much favour modern analysis proved spectacularly unsuccessful achieving aim still seen day
As alternative requirement list us suggest requirement everyday language
Best practice take composed list requirement merely clue repeatedly ask
actual business purpose discovered
Stakeholders developer devise test measure level goal achieved thus far
Such goal change slowly long list specific unmeasured requirement
Once small set critical measured goal established short iterative development phase may proceed deliver actual stakeholder value long project half
A prototype computer program exhibit part property another computer program allowing user visualize application yet constructed
A popular form prototype help future user stakeholder get idea system look like
Prototypes make easier make design decision aspect application seen shared application built
Major improvement communication user developer often seen introduction prototype
Early view application led fewer change later hence reduced overall cost considerably
Prototypes flat diagram often referred working application using synthesized functionality
Wireframes made variety graphic design document often remove color design
use greyscale color palette instance final software expected applied
This help prevent confusion whether prototype represents final visual look feel application
A use case structure documenting functional requirement system usually involving software whether new changed
Each use case provides set convey system interact human user another system achieve specific business goal
Use case typically avoid technical jargon preferring instead language
Use case often requirement engineer stakeholder

In unambiguous specification solve class problem
Algorithms perform task
An algorithm expressed within finite amount space time formal language calculating
Starting initial state initial input perhaps instruction describe proceeds finite number successive state eventually producing output terminating final ending state
The transition one state next necessarily algorithm known incorporate random input
The concept existed century however partial formalization would become modern began attempt solve decision problem posed
Subsequent formalization framed attempt define effective method formalization included
Giving formal definition algorithm corresponding intuitive notion remains challenging problem
The word combination word named word
αριθμός meaning number

Another early use word manual titled composed
It begin thus translates Algorism art present use Indian figure number two time five
The poem hundred line long summarizes art calculating new style Indian dice Talibus Indorum Hindu numeral
An informal definition could set rule precisely defines sequence operation
would include computer program including program perform numeric calculation
Generally program algorithm stop eventually
A prototypical example algorithm determine maximum common divisor two integer example others described example later section
offer informal meaning word following quotation No human write fast enough long enough small smaller smaller without limit trying write molecule atom electron list member enumerably infinite set writing name one another notation
But human something equally useful case certain enumerably infinite set They give arbitrary finite
Such instruction given quite explicitly form An enumerably infinite set one whose element put correspondence integer
Thus Boolos Jeffrey saying algorithm implies instruction process creates output integer input integer integer theory arbitrarily large
Thus algorithm algebraic equation two arbitrary input variable produce output
But various author attempt define notion indicate word implies much something order addition example The concept also used define notion
That notion central explaining come starting small set rule
In time algorithm requires complete measured apparently related customary physical dimension
From uncertainty characterize ongoing work stem unavailability definition suit concrete sense abstract usage term
Algorithms essential way computer process data
Many computer program contain algorithm detail specific instruction computer perform specific order carry specified task calculating employee paycheck printing student report card
Thus algorithm considered sequence operation simulated system
Authors assert thesis include Minsky Savage Gurevich Minsky But also maintain Turing


procedure could naturally called effective fact realized simple machine
Although may seem extreme argument


favor hard refute
Gurevich Turing informal argument favor thesis justifies stronger thesis every algorithm simulated Turing machine according Savage algorithm computational process defined Turing machine
Typically algorithm associated processing information data read input source written output device stored processing
Stored data regarded part internal state entity performing algorithm
In practice state stored one
For computational process algorithm must rigorously defined specified way applies possible circumstance could arise
That conditional step must systematically dealt criterion case must clear computable
Because algorithm precise list precise step order computation always crucial functioning algorithm
Instructions usually assumed listed explicitly described starting top going bottom idea described formally
So far discussion formalization algorithm assumed premise
This common conception attempt describe task discrete mechanical mean
Unique conception formalized algorithm setting value variable
It derives intuition scratchpad
There example assignment
For alternate conception constitutes algorithm see
Algorithms expressed many kind notation including processed
Natural language expression algorithm tend verbose ambiguous rarely used complex technical algorithm
Pseudocode flowchart control table structured way express algorithm avoid many ambiguity common natural language statement
Programming language primarily intended expressing algorithm form executed computer often used way define document algorithm
There wide variety representation possible one express given program sequence machine table see flowchart see form rudimentary called set quadruple see
Representations algorithm classed three accepted level Turing machine description For example simple algorithm Add described three level see
Most algorithm intended implemented
However algorithm also implemented mean biological example implementing insect looking food mechanical device
In algorithm basically instance written software software developer effective intended target computer produce given perhaps null
An optimal algorithm even running old hardware would produce faster result higher algorithm purpose running efficient hardware algorithm like computer hardware considered technology
The notion simplicity elegance appears informally Knuth precisely Chaitin Chaitin preface definition I show ca prove program proof would solve ibid

Knuth advises reader best way learn algorithm try


immediately take pen paper work example
But simulation execution real thing
The programmer must translate algorithm language execute
Stone give example computing root quadratic equation computor must know take square root
If algorithm effective must provide set rule extracting square root
This mean programmer must know language effective relative target computing agent
But model used simulation
Van Emde Boas observes even base abstract instead concrete machine arbitrariness choice model remains
It point notion enters
When speed measured instruction set matter
For example subprogram Euclid algorithm compute remainder would execute much faster programmer instruction available rather subtraction worse Minsky decrement
Per algorithm computed model known per Minsky demonstration Turing completeness requires four instruction GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment HALT
Kemeny Kurtz observe undisciplined use unconditional GOTOs conditional GOTOs result programmer write structured program using instruction hand also possible hard write badly structured program structured language
Tausworthe augments three SEQUENCE two CASE
An additional benefit structured program lends using
The graphical aide called offer way describe document algorithm computer program one

One simplest algorithm find largest number list number random order
Finding solution requires looking every number list
From follows simple algorithm stated description English prose Written prose much closer language computer program following formal coding algorithm algorithm compute GCD two number appears Proposition II Book VII Elementary Number Theory
Euclid pose problem thus Given two number prime one another find greatest common measure
He defines A number multitude composed unit counting number positive integer including zero
To measure place shorter measuring length successively time along longer length remaining portion le shorter length
In modern word remainder quotient remainder modulus part left division
For Euclid method succeed starting length must satisfy two requirement length must zero AND ii subtraction must proper test must guarantee smaller two number subtracted larger alternately two equal subtraction yield zero
Euclid original proof add third requirement two length must prime one another
Euclid stipulated could construct proof two number common measure fact
While Nicomachus algorithm Euclid number prime one another yield number common measure
So precise following really Nicomachus algorithm
Only instruction required execute Euclid logical test conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment replacement subtraction
The following algorithm framed Knuth version Euclid Nicomachus rather using division find remainder us successive subtraction shorter length remaining length le

Knuth demonstrates application extended version Euclid algorithm proposes general method applicable proving validity algorithm
Tausworthe proposes measure complexity program length correctness proof
With six core instruction Elegant clear winner compared Inelegant thirteen instruction
However Inelegant arrives HALT fewer step
indicates case Elegant conditional test every subtraction loop whereas Inelegant one
As algorithm usually requires many much time wasted B
test needed remainder computed
Once programmer judge program fit effective computes function intended question becomes improved
The compactness Inelegant improved elimination five step
But Chaitin proved compacting algorithm automated generalized algorithm rather done exhaustive search example found trial error cleverness insight application etc
Observe step repeated step
Comparison Elegant provides hint step together step eliminated
This reduces number core instruction thirteen eight make elegant Elegant nine step
The speed Elegant improved moving

This change call addition three instruction B A GOTO
Now Elegant computes faster whether always case given A B R S would require detailed analysis
It frequently important know much particular resource time storage theoretically required given algorithm
Methods developed obtain quantitative answer estimate example sorting algorithm time requirement O using length list
At time algorithm need remember two value largest number found far current position input list
Therefore said space requirement space required store input number counted O counted
Different algorithm may complete task different set instruction le time space others
For example algorithm cost O log n outperforms sequential search cost O n used sorted list array
The discipline often practiced abstractly without use specific implementation
In sense algorithm analysis resembles mathematical discipline focus underlying property algorithm specific particular implementation
Usually used analysis simplest general representation
However ultimately algorithm usually implemented particular hardware software platform eventually put test using real code
For solution one problem efficiency particular algorithm may significant consequence unless n extremely large algorithm designed fast interactive commercial long life scientific usage may critical
Scaling small n large n frequently expose inefficient algorithm otherwise benign
Empirical testing useful may uncover unexpected interaction affect performance
may used compare potential improvement algorithm program optimization
To illustrate potential improvement possible even well established algorithm recent significant innovation relating algorithm used heavily field image processing decrease processing time time application like medical imaging
In general speed improvement depend special property problem common practical application
Speedups magnitude enable computing device make extensive use image processing like digital camera medical equipment consume le power
There various way classify algorithm merit
One way classify algorithm implementation mean
Another way classifying algorithm design methodology paradigm
There certain number paradigm different
Furthermore category include many different type algorithm
Some common paradigm For specific classification algorithm algorithm problem may fall one general category described well one following Every field science problem need efficient algorithm
Related problem one field often studied together
Some example class algorithm
Fields tend overlap algorithm advance one field may improve sometimes completely unrelated field
For example dynamic programming invented optimization resource consumption industry used solving broad range problem many field
Algorithms classified amount time need complete compared input size Some problem may multiple algorithm differing complexity problem might algorithm known efficient algorithm
There also mapping problem problem
Owing found suitable classify problem instead algorithm equivalence class based complexity best possible algorithm
The adjective continuous applied word algorithm mean Algorithms usually patentable
In United States claim consisting solely simple manipulation abstract concept number signal constitute process USPTO hence algorithm patentable
However practical application algorithm sometimes patentable
For example application simple algorithm aid curing deemed patentable
The highly controversial highly criticized patent involving algorithm especially algorithm

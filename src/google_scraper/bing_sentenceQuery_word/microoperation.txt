Shift Micro Operations used serial shifting data present register
We also say Shift micro Operations move shift data register bitwise one bit time either left right original position
In register occur condition order manipulate data shifting moving data bit either towards left towards right perform required operation
Suppose addition performed data stored two different register data stored binary form shifting binary digit left right result change value register
If one want manipulate data register shifting digit instead clearing register assigning new value register use Shift Micro Operations
Let u take two value two different register A B
We perform addition register shift operation shift operation
As know binary value register binary value stored
So add two value get
register A register B New value addition without performing shift operation But perform shift left operation shifting one bit towards left change follows So shifting one bit towards left shown representation enter right end one left end removed digit value
After shifting get So add result change zero changed zero shift left operation
register A changed due shift left operation performed register B The value changed instead
So without need clearing value first register inserting new value directly change value register performing shift operation
Arithmetic Shift Micro Operation Logical Shift Micro Operation Circular Shift Micro Operation Each Shift Micro Operations furtherly divided two type Shift left shift right micro operation
So Arithmetic logical circular shift
As discussed earlier total shift micro operation three type one two
Arithmetic Shift Operation shift signed positive negative binary number either left right multiplying dividing
For Arithmetic Shift left micro operation value register multiplied whereas Arithmetic Shift right micro operation value register divided
In RTL RTL stand Register Transfer Language represent arithmetic shift micro operation R ashl R arithmetic shift left R register R ashr R arithmetic shift right R register Diagram showing Arithmetic shift left operation follows Diagram showing Arithmetic shift right operation follows A Logical Shift Micro Operation transfer zero serial input either left right depending type
For logical shift left micro operation zero transferred right data logical shift right micro operation zero transferred left data shown figure

R shr R shift right register R
Below diagram showing logical shift left micro operation data register
Below diagram showing logical shift right follows A Circular Shift micro operation performs shifting bit one end register end register
In Circular shift left operation left bit register transferred right end circular shift right operation right bit register transferred shifted left end register shown figure Register Transfer Language Circular Shift micro operation written R cil R circular shift left register R
R cir R circular shift right register R
Below diagram showing circular shift left micro operation Below diagram showing circular shift right micro operation Shift micro operation used shift data register follows irrespective type either arithmetic logical etc
SHL Logical Shift Left SHR Logical Shift Right ASHL Arithmetic Shift Left ASHR Arithmetic Shift Right CIL Circular Shift Left CIR Circular Shift Right All Operations shift operation computer organisation operated data register performing logical arithmetic circular shift operation
Let u take bit binary value register follows perform logical shift left operation
Now perform logical left shift mean digit register move one bit towards left right bit register replaced new input register left bit register removed resultant bit binary value register turn follows logical left shift operation
If notice two tabular representation left bit removed right bit replaced zero rest bit shifted one place towards left
If stated perform logical shift operation shift two digit respectively according operation asked perform either left right
So case two new bit zero added towards right end two left bit removed case logical shift left
Let u take bit binary value register perform logical shift right operation
So perform logical right shift mean digit register move one bit towards right left bit register replaced new input register right bit register removed resultant bit binary value register turn follows logical right shift operation
Looking table notice left bit replaced zero next bit shifted towards right last digit removed first tabular representation register
Now case logical right shift operation simply shift two digit towards right first two left bit replaced zero
In representation left bit discarded place taken immediate successor bit shifted one towards left right significant bit filled zero shown figure
Similarly case two bit arithmetic shift two bit shifted towards left right bit filled zero
In arithmetic left shift least significant bit bit towards right end always filled zero
You might got basic idea representation
However arithmetic shift right operation left digit tha significant bit MSB replaced copy original MSB
The rest bit shifted towards right seen figure right bit thai least significant bit discarded
In circular shift left operation bit shifted one bit towards left except left bit shifted towards right end value shown figure
As figure see cycle transition value make circular shift
This case circular left shift
If asked circular left shift perform circular left shift twice
In circular right shift bit shifted towards except right bit shifted towards left end value
In three type shift operation except left right end bit register shifted accordingly left right bit shifted according property shift operation either logical arithmetic circular

What role stack microprocessor
Stack used largely function call depending language level programming may used temporarily store processor register data variable
Further stack may also used storage data using store partial data stack call
The And yes stack also used
Its nature carrying called function return back coupled weakness check language give nice way cause stack vulnerable unsafely written program
At lowest level stack place certain instruction store retrieve data data stored interrupt occurs
Microprocesors vary general type instruction When processor interrupt occurs due external device CPU save current program counter usually flag register stack jump handling subroutine
This allows handling subroutine process interrupt return whatever CPU current state preserved
While microprocessor one stack active time operating system make appear multiple stack
At least one OS one process one thread
In fact thread may implement multiple stack
At higher level whatever language used implement thread often use stack purpose store functional call parameter local variable function call return value speaking broad stroke consult language documentation specific detail
Thus concludes explanation stack
In ancient time subroutine call handled word memory RAM subroutine indicate called
To call subroutine one would something like This pattern might optimized caller place return address register routine store return spot entry
This pattern worked problem
Not generally waste memory also mean dealing recursive code
Adding stack made possible simplify code caller simply say store return address someplace suitable without disturbing earlier one called function simply say return recent caller returned yet
This allowed development code meant necessary store enough return address handle deepest nested chain function call would ever actually occur
It depends microprocessor
Generally role keeping local variable function parameter
And actually microprocessor central memory
Stack used function call
Its put good use nested function call recursive function call
It also used
On microprocessor also used context switch
cheer Some microprocessor improve efficiency take look wikipedia others microstack microroutines
It wide term fact
The stack temporary store data
The CPU may PUSH important data onto stack processing data
When finish task PULLS saved data stack
Its like pile plate
The bottom plate first bit data pushed onto stack
The top plate last data pushed
The top plate pulled first bottom plate last data pulled
It LAST IN FIRST OUT stack
In diagram X first pushed Y lastly A
The CPU go away process data
Upon completion task return pull saved data
First A pulled Y lastly X
The instruction pushing data PHA
Only data accumulator pushed onto stack
Other data pushed transferred accumulator first
The instruction pulling data stack PLA
Data stack transferred accumulator
The stack consists byte occupies page address
Just add answer micros PIC line callstack mean dynamically allocated hardware
The implication go many function call deep run stack true software also course often hardware based stack limiting require rethink program order function call
A stack implementation LIFO Last In First Out buffer
The FIFO First In First Out also known queue
But back LIFO
Stacks architecture allow software designer dispense strange stuff return address register interrupt return address register found RISC processor
reside stack mean single standardized unified method handling variable return
The use method separate stack simplifies implementation
RISC contrast us buffer though keep significatnt part related info elsewhere
RISC stack may faster sure definitely difficult understand
Actually stack teminology processor used language routine call
A routine use stack get parameter save local variable also call routine

An abstract model
It also referred
A realization ISA called
An ISA permit multiple implementation may vary physical size monetary cost among thing ISA serf
Software written ISA run different implementation ISA
This enabled different generation computer easily achieved development computer family
Both development helped lower cost computer increase applicability
For reason ISA one important abstraction today
An ISA defines everything need know order program computer
What ISA defines differs ISAs general ISAs define supported state semantics set comprises computer machine language model
An instruction set architecture distinguished set technique used particular processor implement instruction set
Processors different microarchitectures share common instruction set
For example implement nearly identical version radically different internal design
The concept distinct design specific machine developed IBM design phase
Prior NPL company computer designer free honor cost objective selecting technology also fashioning functional architectural refinement
The SPREAD compatibility objective contrast postulated single architecture series five processor spanning wide range cost performance
None five engineering design team could count able bring adjustment architectural specification way easing difficulty achieving cost performance objective
Some support ISA Microsoft implement translating bytecode commonly used code path native machine code
In addition virtual machine execute le frequently used code path interpretation see
implemented instruction set atop processor fashion
An ISA may classified number different way
A common classification architectural
A CISC many specialized instruction may rarely used practical program
A RISC simplifies processor efficiently implementing instruction frequently used program le common operation implemented subroutine resulting additional processor execution time offset infrequent use
Other type include VLIW architecture closely related LIW EPIC architecture
These architecture seek exploit le hardware RISC CISC making responsible instruction issue scheduling
Architectures even le complexity studied MISC OISC
These theoretically important type commercialized
built discrete
On processing architecture given instruction may specify More complex operation built combining simple instruction executed sequentially otherwise directed instruction
Examples operation common many instruction set include Processors may include complex instruction instruction set
A single complex instruction something may take many instruction computer
Such instruction instruction take multiple step control multiple functional unit otherwise appear larger scale bulk simple instruction implemented given processor
Some example complex instruction include Complex instruction common CISC instruction set RISC instruction set RISC instruction set may include well
RISC instruction set generally include ALU operation memory operand instruction move large block memory RISC instruction set include instruction perform arithmetic operation multiple piece data time
SIMD instruction ability manipulating large vector matrix minimal time
SIMD instruction allow easy algorithm commonly involved sound image video processing
Various SIMD implementation brought market trade name
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifies operation perform zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In VLIW architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous opcodes operand specified single instruction
Some exotic instruction set opcode field TTA operand
The instruction set lack operand specifier field including NOSC
Conditional instruction often predicate bit encode specific condition cause operation performed rather performed
For example conditional branch instruction executed branch taken condition true execution proceeds different part program executed branch taken condition false execution continues sequentially
Some instruction set also conditional move move executed data stored target location condition true executed target location modified condition false
Similarly IBM conditional store instruction
A instruction set include predicate field every instruction called
The size length instruction varies widely little four bit many hundred bit VLIW system
Processors used instruction size bit
The longest possible instruction byte bit
Within instruction set different instruction may different length
In architecture notably RISC typically corresponding architecture
In architecture instruction variable length typically integral multiple
Some variable encoding two fixed usually encoding instruction mixed freely must switched branch exception boundary
A RISC instruction set normally fixed instruction length often byte bit whereas typical CISC instruction set may instruction widely varying length byte
instruction le complicated handle instruction several reason check whether instruction straddle cache line virtual memory page boundary instance therefore somewhat easier optimize speed
The instruction constituting program rarely specified using internal numeric form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
The design instruction set complex issue
There two stage history microprocessor
The first CISC Complex Instruction Set Computer many different instruction
In however place like IBM research found many instruction set could eliminated
The result RISC Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture us smaller set instruction
A simpler instruction set may offer potential higher speed reduced processor size reduced power consumption
However complex set may optimize common operation improve memory efficiency simplify programming
Some instruction set designer reserve one opcodes kind
For example us us eight code CF DF EF FF use code range
Fast virtual machine much easier implement instruction set meet
The used much easier implement unprogrammed state memory interpreted
On system multiple processor algorithm much easier implement instruction set includes support something atomic
Any given instruction set implemented variety way
All way implementing particular instruction set provide implementation instruction set able run executables
The various way implementing instruction set give different tradeoff cost performance power consumption size etc
When designing processor engineer use block electronic circuitry often designed separately adder multiplexer counter register ALUs etc
Some kind often used describe decoding sequencing instruction ISA using physical microarchitecture
There two basic way build implement description although many design use middle way compromise Some design use combination hardwired design microcode control unit
Some CPU design use compile instruction set writable inside CPU processor FPGA
An ISA also software
Naturally due interpretation overhead slower directly running program emulated hardware unless hardware running emulator order magnitude faster
Today common practice vendor new ISAs microarchitectures make software emulator available software developer hardware implementation ready
Often detail implementation strong influence particular instruction selected instruction set
For example many implementation allow single memory load memory store per instruction leading RISC
For another example early way implementing led
The demand digital signal processing pushed opposite instruction implemented particular way
For example perform digital filter fast enough MAC instruction typical DSP must use kind fetch instruction two data word simultaneously requires
In early computer memory expensive minimizing size program make sure would fit limited memory often central
Thus combined size instruction needed perform particular task important characteristic instruction set
Computers high code density often complex instruction procedure entry parameterized return loop etc
therefore retroactively named
However typical frequent CISC instruction merely combine basic ALU operation add access one operand memory using direct indirect indexed etc
Certain architecture may allow two three operand including result directly memory may able perform function automatic pointer increment etc
instruction set may even complex powerful instruction
first widely implemented period rapidly growing memory subsystem
They sacrifice code density simplify implementation circuitry try increase performance via higher clock frequency register
A single RISC instruction typically performs single operation add register load memory location register
A RISC instruction set normally fixed whereas typical CISC instruction set instruction widely varying length
However RISC computer normally require often longer instruction implement given task inherently make le optimal use bus bandwidth cache memory
Certain embedded RISC ISAs like typically exhibit high density owing technique called code compression
This technique pack two instruction one instruction unpacked decode stage executed two instruction
MISC form separate instruction multiple instruction fit single machine word
These type core often take little silicon implement easily realized form
The code density MISC similar code density RISC increased instruction density offset requiring primitive instruction task
There research mechanism improving code density
The mathematics describes challenge limit
Instruction set may categorized maximum number operand specified instruction
In example follow direct calculated address referring memory cell refer machine register
Due large number bit needed encode three register instruction RISC architecture instruction invariably design Atmel AVR version
RISC architecture instruction usually design architecture
Each instruction specifies number operand register memory location immediate value
Some instruction give one operand implicitly stored top implicit register
If operand given implicitly fewer operand need specified instruction
When destination operand explicitly specifies destination additional operand must supplied
Consequently number operand encoded instruction may differ mathematically necessary number argument logical arithmetic operation
Operands either encoded opcode representation instruction else given value address following instruction
measure availability free register point time program execution
Register pressure high large number available register use thus higher register pressure often register content must memory
Increasing number register architecture decrease register pressure increase cost
While embedded instruction set suffer extremely high register pressure small register set RISC ISAs like enjoy low register pressure
CISC ISAs like offer low register pressure despite smaller register set
This due many addressing mode optimization addressing memory operand ALU instruction absolute addressing addressing spill CISC ISAs offer

Data Modeling process finding store digitized information logically structured computer database
It technical process understanding mapping business information stored database logical form

Data modeling process applies structure organization large chunk data ease data management
Even though data modeling time consuming process good database design need sound data model
Otherwise need modify database design
TYPES OF DATA MODELS There different type data model
File system text binary file window explorer Unix Hierarchical every child entity parent entity
Network database child object multiple parent
many may relation
employee one task
task assigned one employee
Relational Databases Dimensional Databases two dimensional database
Object Relational Databases new introduced object aspect relational database
ESSENTIAL ELEMETS OF DATA MODELING I would like discus essential element Data Modeling
Logical Elements Logical Model With completion conceptual modeling move Logical Modeling
Logical model representation data way represented business
Logical model serf road map physical implementation
The main element logical model Entities Entities logical grouping data
information describes student ii Attributes Pieces information make entity
student entity attribute might studentname idnumber coursename etc iii Relationships Relationships describe one entity related another
student enroll course Physical Elements Physical model Once logical model constructed create physical model
Like logical model physical model also made various element
Tables Tables useful storing data
Tables column containing information data table row
ii Keys Keys define relationship two table
Following type key
Primary key Foreign Keys At glance table column key might seem logical element important difference
Logical Elements simply describe grouping data might exist real world
Physical Elements actually store data database
A single entity might stored one table multiple table
More one entity might stored single table
Normalization A data model level normalization
Normalization process separating data logical grouping
Normalization divided level successive level build preceding level
First Normal Form The data stored table column contains one type data

given column table store piece information phone number
Data primary key uniquely identify row table
First normal form allow create relationship typically relationship ex invoice invoice line
First normal form eliminating repeated group
row contain repeated column value
Example Before Normal form Lastname Firstname Dob Address Email After First Normal Form Master table Lastname Firstname Dob Address Email Primary Key Child table Foreign Key Second Normal Form It Create relationship order separate static Transactional data
For removing customer detail invoice
As Invoices created every month customer create every year year

It eliminates redundant data
It removed column dependent primary key
Second normal must first fulfill requirement First Normal Form
Example First Normal Form Customer Cont
Person Total XYZ Inc Peter Comcast John Comcast Corp John Second Normal form Customer Contact Person XYZ Inc Peter Comcast John Customer Total XYZ Inc Comcast Comcast Primary Key The creation two separate table eliminates dependency problem
Third Normal Form Third normal form resolve many relationship

employee assigned many task
And task assigned many employee
Example Employee Department Location Third Normal Form Employee Department Department Location Normalization go level
But well built model go normal form
Normal Form BCNF Fourth Normal Form Fifth Normal Form process adding redundant data speed complex query involving multiple table
We achieve better query execution performance going lower form normalization
THE PROCESS OF DATA MODELING Steps Build Data Modeling There three level data modeling
They conceptual logical physical
This section explain difference among three order one created go one level
Requirement Gathering Requirement interpretation requirement design company database
Building Conceptual Data Model Includes important entity relationship among
No attribute specified
No primary key specified
At level data modeler attempt identify relationship among different entity
Sample Conceptual Model Building logical model
Includes entity relationship among
All attribute entity specified
The primary key entity specified
Foreign key key identifying relationship different entity specified
Normalization occurs level
At level data modeler attempt describe data much detail possible without regard physically implemented database
The step designing logical data model follows Identify entity
Specify primary key entity
Find relationship different entity
Find attribute entity
Resolve relationship
Normalization
Building physical model
Physical model represents physical implementation model database
Creates Tables Columns Primary Key Constraint Unique Constraint check constraint foreign key
Features physical data model include Specification table column
Foreign key used identify relationship table
may occur based user requirement
Physical consideration may cause physical data model quite different logical data model
At level data modeler specify logical data model realized database schema
The step physical data model design follows Convert entity table
Convert relationship foreign key
Convert attribute column
Modify physical data model based physical constraint requirement

As imagine data would stored differently dimensional model normal form model
Terms used dimensional data modeling Dimension A category information
For example time dimension
ii Attribute A unique level within dimension
For example Month attribute Time Dimension
Iii Hierarchy The specification level represents relationship different attribute within hierarchy
For example one possible hierarchy Time dimension Year Quarter Month Day
A dimensional model includes dimension table fact table lookup table
Fact Table A fact table table contains measure

For example sale amount would measure
This measure stored fact table appropriate granularity
For example sale amount store day
In case fact table would contain three column A date column store column sale amount column
Fact table connect one lookup table fact table direct relationship one another
Lookup Tables The lookup table provides detailed information attribute
These like reference table
In designing data model data warehouse data mart commonly used schema type Star Schema Snowflake Schema
Star Schema In star schema design single object fact table sits middle radically connected surrounding object dimension lookup table like star
A star schema simple complex
A simple star consists one fact table complex star one fact table
Star Schema Snowflake Schema The snowflake schema extension star schema point star explodes point
The main advantage snowflake schema improvement query performance due minimized disk storage requirement joining smaller lookup table
The main disadvantage snowflake schema additional maintenance effort needed due increase number lookup table
Whether one us star snowflake largely depends personal preference business need
Personally I partial snowflake business case analyze information particular level
Snowflake Schema Conclusion All business need record data system business record data event school government also need record data well database application
The project phrase nothing simple working data entry management system
The backend used window based application Microsoft Access play important role

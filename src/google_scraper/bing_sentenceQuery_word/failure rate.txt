Enrollment undergraduate computer science course college nationwide
But trend hailed tech industry dark side disproportionate number student taking course caught cheating
More student caught cheating introductory computer science course course campus thanks automated tool professor use detect unauthorized code reuse excessive collaboration forbidden way completing homework assignment
Computer science professor say student dishonest student field likely get caught software available check plagiarism
Half academic dishonesty case University Washington involve computer science student
The truth every campus large proportion reported case academic dishonesty come introductory computer science course reason totally obvious use automated tool detect plagiarism explains Professor Ed Lazowska chair computer science engineering University Washington
We compare student submission compare previous student submission code may Web
These tool flag suspicious case manually examined
Stanford University disclosed February honor code violation involved computer science student although student represent student body
Of honor code violation investigated last year Stanford Judicial Panel involved computer science student
The tool employ make easy catch student cheating say Professor Mehran Sahami associate professor computer science Stanford University
I would say computer science student violate honor code often dishonest
Sahami say computer science student mistakenly believe writing software code similar solving mathematical proof one correct answer exists
What student realize software code akin writing essay significant amount creativity involved
One thing happens computer science contributes cheating rate student unaware dissimilar program task really look Sahami say
They tend think OK copy portion someone else program
But tool discover
As college student study computer science number cheating incident rise
At University Washington total enrollment two introductory computer science course highest ever approaching student last four quarter compared student year ago
In two course assignment identified involving academic dishonesty Lazowska say
The top computer science school country experiencing trend
We see cheating
It something working hard stop number mean say Professor Lenny Pitt director undergraduate program Department Computer Science University Illinois
Cheating gone across many field easier find tool today
Cheating introductory computer science class typically involves homework assignment rather exam
Students get frustrated code wo run tempted borrow solution someone else
Because computer science assignment complicated need debugging professor assign homework several year row
That mean student find code written someone already taken course
There lot infrastructure need built lot effort go creating homework problem
There disincentive professor change problem every semester
So tend reassign similar problem cause cheating past solution available Pitt say adding University Illinois check homework repository past solution
The common form cheating involves excessive
Many student like collaborate point copying
Pitt asks
The course policy need really clear
Some course allow work pair triple
If follow policy would call cheating
At Stanford student allowed discus strategy solving homework problem need write code
You looking someone else program sharing computer science student Sahami say
Sahami say introductory computer science course require student code program course allow teamwork
We want learn mechanic first open world collaboration add
Students often resort cheating feel excessive pressure peer family excel professor say
Anecdotally see larger incidence cheating among foreign student domestic student I think part extreme pressure well succeed Pitt say
That pressure contributes idea need well possible even mean taking shortcut
Computer science professor say much copying excess collaboration go college course
Does anyone right mind think cheating happening large introductory course field
If smoking something Lazowska say
There several case faculty discipline adapted tool detect plagiarism term paper found plagiarism rate far greater typically encountered computer science course
As college recruiter traipse across country seeking best computer science graduate Class need aware rising incident cheating computer science course
Ethics huge issue IT industry copyright licensing privacy say David Foote CEO Foote Partners research firm tracking IT workforce management
Foote sits advisory council Hiram College Center Study Ethics Values
We need looking idea breed people concerned naturally issue ethic morality
For CIOs issue whether copying code homework assignment could lead prospective employee ethical lapse job
Businesses want hire worker wo get trouble software licensing patent infringement intellectual property problem
There enough program American university looking ethic cheating Foote say
Do pick computer science people
Pick fact university enough general calling attention cheating
Foote point incident excess collaboration qualify cheating college campus would encouraged industry want employee reuse software improve efficiency cut cost
In real world people write code team given piece project work Foote say
The academic world mapping onto real handing assignment people coding
To encourage collaboration Georgia Tech changed approach cheating introductory computer science course
Instead trying catch punish student excessive collaboration Georgia Tech requires student disclose name student helped complete homework
Students sign collaboration agreement explains Cedric Stallworth assistant dean Undergraduate Enrollment Georgia Tech College Computing
We realize computing one subject best learned group
If student using somebody else code learning right
To ensure student mastering material Georgia Tech requires give oral demonstration software work one teaching assistant
We worry le catching cheater
We worry properly assessing student skill set Stallworth say
Less percentage grade homework percentage assessment assessment designed truly measure skill
Then cheat homework going help assessment count bulk grade
Computer science professor think cheating result student unprepared take course
They seeing rise failure rate drop grade
Instead say student qualified ever
We seen increase failure rate Stanford Sahami say adding le student typically fail introductory computer class
This student body accepts failure
For pas class important thing
Lazowska say rising enrollment computer science course important trend resulting increase plagiarism case
An range student recognizing even major something else preparation computational thinking essential Lazowska say
There reason believe computer science student anything better ever

By This study begin pretty bleak fact
It list research documenting failure rate introductory course biology chemistry computer science engineering mathematics physic
Some high percent two le percent
Failure grave consequence
In addition emotional financial toll failing student bear may take longer graduate leave STEM science technology engineering math discipline drop school The question whether might approach teaching course others introductory level reduce failure rate without decreasing course rigor
That question already addressed previous research study build previously published work research team
They hypothesized adding lot active learning course combining frequent formative assessment would reduce failure rate
They tested hypothesis across six quarter student enrolled introductory biology sequence major related field
Their study design robust approachably described article
Here brief rundown active learning formative assessment activity included course
These activity added gradually across six quarter allowed empirical assessment three different condition one low structure meaning fewer activity lecture fewer assessment one medium structure included activity formative assessment one high structure activity assessment listed used
The pragmatic question come mind immediately managed get content covered course
They answer Reading quiz solve one standard objection active content coverage drastically reduced
Reading quiz shift burden learning easy stuff vocabulary basic student
The premise information acquired reading quizzing well listening It also worth noting large course supported graduate teaching assistant
As hypothesis Did failure rate course decline course rigor maintained
In course content rigor assessed using exam
For reason academic integrity researcher decided could keep administering exam
However devised robust system ensuring exam included study equivalent difficulty
When controlled variation student ability failure rate lower moderately structured course design dramatically lower highly structured course The failure rate went percent version course percent highly structured course design

Failure rate important consideration engineering
They used determine reliability system component system
To calculate failure rate need observe system component record time take break
As statistic data accurate failure rate calculation
For example calculating failure rate specific type USB cable calculation would accurate tested cable year rather one cable day
In order measure failure rate need sample identical component system observed time
For example suppose five light bulb connected automatic circuit could turn per hour hour giving following data This give failure total hour
To calculate failure rate divide number failure total number hour failure per hour
In example failure rate per hour small almost insignificant
Multiplying number would make meaningful someone thinking buying light bulb would failure per hour
Since hour one year divide get failure per year failure every five year
Another way express failure rate using Mean Time Between Failures
MTBF usually used system failure expected rare need minimized like guidance system commercial aircraft air bag passenger car
Knowing MTBF allows manufacturer recommend often component inspected maintained replaced
To calculate MTBF divide number hour number failure
In case five light bulb tested failure rate per determine MTF
The MTBF therefore hour
In scenario likelihood failure increase time component break part wear
A car brake system example le likely fail first year ownership five year without maintenance
As result usually necessary engineer test component longer period time calculate failure rate different interval
A published author professional speaker David Weedmark advised business government technology medium marketing year
He taught computer science Algonquin College started three successful business written hundred article newspaper magazine throughout Canada United States

The New York Times problem training next generation scientist mathematician engineer etc
Studies found roughly percent student planning engineering science major end switching subject failing get degree
That increase much percent student typically strongest SAT score high school science preparation included according new data University California Los Angeles
That twice combined attrition rate major
MATTHEW MONIZ bailed engineering Notre Dame fall sophomore year
He kind recruit engineering department dream
He scored math SAT reading writing
He also taken Calculus BC five Advanced Placement course prep school Washington long planned major engineering
But Moniz sat mechanic class realized already enough
I trying memorize equation engineering application really teach well say
It like Do practice problem And looked ahead curriculum see much relief horizon
Possibly related
I people learning program research indicates might impossible teach people program time reach college age
It clear yet whether improvement earlier education could reduce failure rate whether people brain simply wired way actually learn program
However many student like Moniz mentioned clearly intellectual capacity major
The NYT note The National Science Board public advisory body warned student losing sight wanted scientist engineer first place
Research confirmed student learn grappling problem like creating computer game designing alternative energy system listening lecture
While National Science Foundation went finance pilot course employed interactive project money dried course
Lecture class far cheaper produce top professor focused bringing research grant teaching undergraduate
Combine problem outlined NYT fact student seem unable learn program fact got serious issue trying ever get population science math engineering computer science snuff
Hopefully university follow advice article integrate project work
I mixed feeling alma mater The Evergreen State College I think something project work interdisciplinary approach learning example Science Mind course credit cover neurobiology cognitive psychology statistic philosophy
Look bit discover
Grim time indeed
Tags People learn program MUCH younger college age lot like learning foreign language
You learn programming quickly deeply earlier age
Disclaimer I started programming age perspective
If I reading correctly le United States bachelor degree time year
And le high school graduate
That generation
If I I know start learn program
Not long ago programming interface default state machine go buy book
Nowadays click thing

component fails expressed failure per unit time
It often denoted lambda highly used
The failure rate system usually depends time rate varying life cycle system
For example automobile failure rate fifth year service may many time greater failure rate first year service
One expect replace exhaust pipe overhaul brake major problem new vehicle
In practice MTBF often reported instead failure rate
This valid useful failure rate may assumed constant often used complex unit system electronics general agreement reliability standard Military Aerospace
It case relate flat region also called useful life period
Because incorrect extrapolate MTBF give estimate service lifetime component typically much le suggested MTBF due much higher failure rate wearout part bathtub curve
The reason preferred use MTBF number use large positive number hour intuitive easier remember small number per hour
The MTBF important system parameter system failure rate need managed particular safety system
The MTBF appears frequently design requirement governs frequency required system maintenance inspection
In special process called time recover failure neglected likelihood failure remains constant respect time failure rate simply multiplicative inverse MTBF
A similar ratio used especially mean distance failure variation attempt actual loaded distance similar reliability need practice
Failure rate important factor insurance finance commerce regulatory industry fundamental design safe system wide variety application
The failure rate defined following Although failure rate often thought failure occurs specified interval given failure time actually probability exceed
Erroneous expression failure rate could result incorrect perception measure especially would measured repairable system multiple system failure rate different operation time
It defined aid also called survival function probability failure time
time interval defined
Note hence denominator
The function CONDITIONAL probability failure DENSITY function
The condition failure occurred time
Hazard rate ROCOF rate occurrence failure often incorrectly seen equal failure rate
To clarify promptly item repaired sooner break higher ROCOF
The hazard rate however independent time repair logistic delay time
Calculating failure rate ever smaller interval time result also called
This becomes failure rate tends zero A continuous failure rate depends existence describes probability failure least including time failure time
The failure distribution function integral failure The hazard function defined Many probability distribution used model failure distribution
A common model based
The hazard rate function Thus exponential failure distribution hazard rate constant respect time distribution
For distribution hazard function may constant respect time
For increasing analogous others monotonic decreasing analogous many monotonic
A decreasing failure rate DFR describes phenomenon probability event fixed time interval future decrease time
A decreasing failure rate describe period infant mortality earlier failure eliminated corrected corresponds situation λ
Mixtures DFR variable DFR
Mixtures random variable
For DFR renewal function time concave
Brown conjectured converse DFR also necessary time concave however shown conjecture hold neither discrete case continuous case
Increasing failure rate intuitive concept caused component wearing
Decreasing failure rate describes system improves age
Decreasing failure rate found lifetime spacecraft Baker Baker commenting spacecraft last last
The reliability aircraft air conditioning system individually found thus pooled population DFR
When failure rate decreasing failure rate increasing coefficient variation
Note result hold failure rate defined converse result coefficient variation determining nature failure rate hold
Failure rate obtained several way
The common mean Failure rate expressed using measure time common unit practice
Other unit mile revolution also used place time unit
Failure rate often expressed failure per million especially individual component since failure rate often low
The rate device number failure expected one operation

device million hour million device hour combination
This term used particularly industry
The relationship FIT MTBF may expressed MTBF x
Under certain assumption
besides assumption constant failure rate assumption considered system relevant failure rate complex simply sum individual failure rate component long unit consistent
failure per million hour
This permit testing individual component whose failure rate added obtain total system failure rate
Adding redundant component eliminate improves mission failure rate make series failure rate also called logistics failure rate extra component improve mean time critical failure MTBCF even though mean time something fails worse
Suppose desired estimate failure rate certain component
A test performed estimate failure rate
Ten identical component tested either fail reach hour time test terminated component
The level statistical considered example
The result follows Estimated failure rate failure every million hour operation
The used estimate cumulative hazard rate function

The San Francisco Unified School District SFUSD plan teaching computer science student school preschool grade
Last night San Francisco Board Education unanimously adopted resolution expand Computer Science class citing knowledge skill learned class help student understand underlying technology faced profession
Information technology fastest growing job sector San Francisco student currently access learn Computer Science skill crucial career said Board President Emily Murase
We proud forefront creating curriculum build knowledge skill student need starting early Learning creatively use computer technology solve problem optional next generation San Franciscans
All student must access opportunity Computer Science coding school make reality said Board Matt Haney led charge resolution
This bold essential move ensure young people live thrive century San SFUSD work closely City County San Francisco organization technology company private industry foundation implement plan
Implementation also close partnership SFUSD teacher educator include significant investment professional development ensure current SFUSD teacher expertise support credentialing teach Computer Science
There incredible support community rally around implement critical fund said Superintendent Richard Carranza
We want student able live work thrive San Francisco
This part take make The Salesforce Foundation major contributor expansion computer science education SFUSD
Of hundred SFUSD student took Advanced Placement Computer Science exam spring percent female three percent African American Latino Native American
Teaching Computer Science grade level vastly increase exposure make AP class possibility student
The SFUSD educator leading effort develop new curriculum recognized offering Computer Science high school would yield success especially reaching district diverse student population
By beginning youngest grade district provide foundational knowledge skill increasingly critical century student increase diversify student currently pursuing Computer Science high school college career
We affect change high school level working high school
We start younger child normalize Computer Science said Jim Ryan SFUSD Executive Director STEM Science Technology Engineering Math
Only something rather something small subset population For example preschool age student likely using block build robot introduce concept procedural thinking cause effect decomposition complex task pattern recognition well ability notice similarity common difference abstraction algorithm design ability develop strategy solving problem
Next year middle school offering course reaching approximately percent middle school age student hour Computer Science instruction one percent middle school student participated computer science course school year
Given uniqueness school budgetary constraint district staff predicts take several year every student every grade learning computer science
Just two year ago SF Board Education adopted computer science CS resolution
This mean student learning computer science small number high school student take elective

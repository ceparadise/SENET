Response time total amount time take respond request service
That service anything memory fetch disk IO complex database query loading full web page
Ignoring transmission time moment response time sum service time wait time
The service time time take work requested
For given request service time varies little workload increase X amount work always take X amount time
The wait time long request wait serviced varies zero waiting required large multiple service time many request already queue serviced first
With basic queueing theory math calculate average wait time increase device providing service go busy
As device becomes busier average wait time increase fashion
The busier device dramatic response time increase seem approach busy increase caused increase wait time result request waiting queue run first
Transmission time get added response time request resulting response travel network significant
Transmission time include due distance speed light finite delay due data communication bandwidth limit especially slowing transmission speed request reply
In system response time task thread defined time elapsed dispatch time task ready execute time finish job one dispatch
Response time different maximum time task would take execute without interference
It also different deadline length time task output would valid context specific system
Response time amount time display take change
It measured m
Lower number mean faster transition therefore fewer visible image artifact
Older monitor long response time would create around moving object making unacceptable rapidly moving image
Response time usually measured transition industry standard

When shopping gaming multimedia see manufacture brag response time
Although response rate latency extremely important come game manufacture derive number various way
Generally manufacture report fastest time whether active black inactive white back
They may disclose used determine typical time
The formal definition characterizes response time time take LCD pixel change completely active black inactive white back
However manufacture often report speed color color
The Video Electronics Standards Association VESA soon introduce specification standardize response time make manufacturer number comparable
Nevertheless despite discrepancy reported number response time matter
As recent monitor manufacturer gaming expert recommending response time avoid blurring ghosting
However year later seeing response time le typically le
This turn mean game manufacturer going utilize new capability create game demand faster response time
For view game best look monitor fastest time possible matter
Keep mind display quality also important look high contrast ratio small dot pitch coupled powerful graphic card give best view possible

According cite International Organization Standardization source response time The virtualized network pose challenge network management system hardware component become virtualized challenge becomes even greater

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
On homework question asks A program executes serially second
If parallelized second overhead required synchronization locking communication
Compute execution time ideal speedup overhead required actual speedup percentage ideal speedup obtained processor
How I calculate answer
It something covered class yet homework due next time class meet
My guess I divide second number core add core get total response time
I think simple
Edit Amdahl law say T n T B B percentage algorithm parallelized n number core
If I assume second mentioned part algorithm parallelized I get percentage saying Then I plug value B Amdahl equation
Coencidentally give answer I got I formula After little bit algebra I discovered formula simplified version Amdahl formula
Of course assumes I correct I read question second part algorithm parallelized
Thanks looking Zach I think need add core total response time
The overall execution time requires second piece code running parallel others
So divide number core add
Obviously ideal case need add anything
Also look
It also state law speedup parallelism problem share concept
I guess type optimization calculate based measurement

Latency delay input system desired outcome term understood slightly differently various context latency issue also vary one system another
Latency greatly affect usable enjoyable electronic mechanical device well communication
Latency communication demonstrated live transmission various point earth communication ground transmitter satellite satellite receiver take time
People connecting distance live event seen wait response
This latency wait time introduced signal travelling geographical distance well various piece communication equipment
Even limited speed light refractive index cable repeater amplifier along length introduce delay
expression much time take data get one designated point another
In environment example AT T latency measured sending returned sender time considered latency
Ideally latency close zero possible
The contributor network latency include special case network latency Internet large network
The factor determine latency Internet
However distance transmission medium number hop equipment server greater smaller network
Internet latency measurement would generally start exit network end return requested data Internet resource
length time take computer act signal telling stop decide response event
important factor determining Internet latency
A WAN busy directing traffic produce delay whether resource requested server another computer network elsewhere Internet
LAN user also experience delay WAN busy
In either example delay would still exist even rest hop including server desired data located entirely free traffic congestion
delay sound created heard
In sound created physical world delay determined varies slightly depending medium travel
Sound travel faster denser medium It travel faster solid le quickly liquid slowest air
We generally refer speed sound measured dry air room temperature
In electronics audio latency cumulative delay audio input audio output
How long delay depends hardware even software used operating system driver used computer audio
Latencies generally noticed individual separate production arrival sound ear
See video demonstration measure audio latency iOS device defined sum time operation performed linear
In parallel workflow latency determined slowest operation performed single task worker
delay input mechanical system device desired output
This delay determined Newtonian limit mechanism excepting mechanic
An example would delay time shift gear time shift lever gear box bicycle shifter actuated
combined delay input command desired output
In computer system latency often used mean delay waiting increase real perceived beyond desired
Specific contributor computer latency include mismatch data speed microprocessor device inadequate data performance hardware involved well driver
The processing load computer also add significant latency
From user perspective latency issue usually perceived lag action response
In simulation example using helmet provides stereoscopic vision head tracking latency time computer detection head motion time display motion image
In multiplayer networked Internet gaming low latency critical best gameplay enjoyability
Control difficult significant latency player lagging behind event game due delay information getting computer
Latency issue noticeable individual generally increasing user annoyance impacting level increase
The severity effect varies one application another mitigating tactic
However game often enjoyable around latency
In communication delay result heavy traffic hardware problem incorrect set configuration
Latency testing vary application application
In application measuring latency requires special complex equipment knowledge special computer command program case latency measured stop watch
In networking estimated latency equipment server determined running ping command information latency hop gathered trace route command
camera might used capture minute difference response time input various mechanical electronic system
Reducing latency function tuning tweaking upgrading computer hardware software mechanical system

I keep hearing especially StackOverflow people generating webpage content dynamically
Does mean generating content anytime design time client side definition
In word relates web development definition dynamic
This mean generating HTML code PHP python etc
Instead hosting static HTML page generate HTML representative current state
As popular word people use mean many different thing
Static page really exist anymore
Any site care dynamic form
As result term got recycled mean number thing Everything involves part server transmit file harddisk
It refers possibility generation complete web page based content known available time scaffolding web page created
A dynamic web page give new information view maybe
For example static webpage always information dynamic web page content change depending specific variable like user logged etc
Values hard coded code form website
The value come number source including database content created user scraped website number place
Static content changed request dynamic content may changed depends time request parameter etc
Static content usually stored file like html cs image script etc
Dynamic content generated
Generation process usually us two part page template contains page markup special format placeholder dynamic part data obtained external source like database web service etc
Special application combine template data get final html content responded request
Dynamic content definition change gmail data different mine person u receive email regularly time atleast
A dynamic web page kind web page prepared fresh information content layout individual viewing
It static change time ex

web page game context parametric customization
Ajax combine client server side dynamic data
Dynamically used mean content result generated fly

Many support
For instance type subtype expression type used wherever expression type used
refers subtyping complex type relates subtyping component
For example list relate list
Or function returning relate function returning
Depending variance subtyping relation simple type may either preserved reversed ignored respective complex type
In programming language example list Cat subtype list Animal list constructor
Meaning subtyping relation simple type preserved complex type
While function Animal String subtype function Cat String function type constructor argument type
Here subtyping relation simple type reversed complex type
A programming language designer consider variance devising typing rule language feature array inheritance generic datatypes
By making type constructor covariant contravariant instead invariant program accepted
On hand programmer often find contravariance unintuitive accurately tracking variance avoid runtime type error lead complex typing rule
In order keep type system simple allow useful program language may treat type constructor invariant even would safe consider variant treat covariant even though could violate type safety
Within typing rule type constructor The article considers applies common type constructor
For example subtype The variance C generic interface declared placing covariant contravariant attribute zero type parameter
For type parameter compiler conclusively verifies violation fatal use globally consistent
The interface declared
Types one type parameter may specify different variance type parameter
For example delegate type represents function input parameter type return value type
The ensure type safety
For example represents function expecting argument type function handle type animal always used instead one handle cat
data type source covariant data type sink contravariant
Mutable data type act source sink invariant
To illustrate general phenomenon consider
For type make type array animal
For purpose example array support reading writing element
We option treat either If wish avoid type error third choice safe
Clearly every treated since client reading array expect may contain

So contravariant rule safe
Conversely treated
It always possible put
With covariant array guaranteed safe since backing store might actually array cat
So covariant rule also array constructor
Note issue mutable array covariant rule safe immutable array
Early version Java C include generic also termed
In setting making array invariant rule useful polymorphic program
For example consider writing function shuffle array function test two array equality using
method element
The implementation depend exact type element stored array possible write single function work type array
It easy implement function type However array type treated invariant would possible call function array exactly type
One could example shuffle array string
Therefore Java C treat array type covariantly
For instance Java subtype C subtype
As discussed covariant array lead problem writes array
Java C deal marking array object type created
Each time value stored array execution environment check type value equal type array
If mismatch Java C thrown In example one array b safely
It trying array lead trouble
One drawback approach leaf possibility error stricter type system could caught
Also hurt performance write array requires additional check
With addition generic Java C offer way write kind polymorphic function without relying covariance
The array comparison shuffling function given parameterized type Alternatively enforce C method access collection way one use interface instead passing array
Languages like function expecting Cat returning Animal written syntax syntax
Those language also need specify one function type subtype safe use function one type context expects function different type
It safe substitute function function accepts general type argument return specific type
For example given function type function type used wherever expected One compare communication liberal accept conservative produce
The general rule In word type constructor
This rule first stated formally popularized paper
When dealing rule applied several time
For example applying rule twice see
In word type A position
For complicated type confusing mentally trace given type specialization easy calculate position contravariant position covariant left side even number arrow applying
When subclass method superclass compiler must check overriding method right type
While language require type exactly match type superclass invariance also type safe allow overriding method better type
By usual subtyping rule function type mean overriding method return specific type return type covariance accept general argument argument type contravariance
In notation possibility follows Subtyping type method

The signature overriding method unchanged

The subtyping relation direction relation ClassA ClassB

The subtyping relation opposite direction relation ClassA ClassB

Not type safe
For concrete example suppose writing class model
We assume subclass base class using Java syntax Now question subclass type allowed give
In language allows covariant return type derived class override method return specific type Among mainstream OO language support covariant return type
Adding covariant return type one first modification language approved standard committee also support covariant return type
Similarly type safe allow overriding method accept general argument method base class Not many language actually allow
Java would interpret unrelated method name
However supported covariance contravariance
Calling convention overridden method covariant argument return value contravariant normal argument mode
Uniquely among mainstream language allows argument overriding method specific type method superclass argument type covariance
Thus Eiffel version following code would type check overriding method base class This type safe
By one try place dog cat shelter
That meet argument restriction result runtime error
The lack type safety known catcall problem Eiffel community issue
Over year various combination global static analysis local static analysis new language feature proposed remedy implemented Eiffel compiler
Despite type safety problem Eiffel designer consider covariant argument type crucial modeling real world requirement
The cat shelter illustrates common phenomenon animal shelter seems reasonable use inheritance restricted argument type model
In proposing use inheritance Eiffel designer reject state object subclass always le restricted object superclass
One instance mainstream language allowing covariance method argument PHP regard class constructor
In following example method accepted despite method argument covariant parent method argument
Were method anything error would occur Another example covariant argument seem helpful binary method
method argument expected type object method called
An example method check whether come ordering way compare say two rational number different way compare two string
Other common example binary method include equality test arithmetic operation set operation like subset union
In older version Java comparison method specified interface The drawback method specified take argument type
A typical implementation would first argument throwing error expected type In language covariant argument argument compareTo could directly given desired type hiding typecast
Of course would still give runtime error called

Other language feature provide apparent benefit covariant argument preserving Liskov substitutability
In language
previous example written way
Instead defining define parameterized class
One drawback implementer base class need foresee type need specialized subclass
Similarly recent version Java interface parameterized allows downcast omitted way Another language feature help
One reason binary method awkward write call like selecting correct implementation really depends runtime type conventional OO language runtime type taken account
In language CLOS comparison method could written generic function argument used method selection
Giuseppe Castagna observed typed language multiple dispatch generic function argument control dispatch argument
Because method selection rule chooses specific applicable method method override another method overriding method specific type controlling argument
On hand ensure type safety language still must require argument least general
Using previous terminology type used runtime method selection covariant type used runtime method selection method contravariant
Conventional language like Java also obey rule one argument used method selection receiver object passed along method hidden argument indeed type specialized inside overriding method superclass
Castagna suggests example covariant argument type superior particularly binary method handled using multiple dispatch naturally covariant
However programming language support multiple dispatch
The following table summarizes rule overriding method language discussed
In programming language support generic
programmer extend type system new constructor
For example C interface like make possible construct new type like
The question arises variance type constructor
There two main approach
In language programmer annotates definition generic type intended variance type parameter
With programmer instead annotates place generic type instantiated
The popular language variance annotation using keywords using keywords
C allows variance annotation interface type Scala OCaml allows interface type concrete data type
In C type parameter generic interface marked covariant contravariant invariant annotation
For example define interface iterators declare covariant type parameter
With declaration treated covariant type argument
subtype
The typechecker enforces method declaration interface mention type parameter way consistent annotation
That parameter declared covariant must occur contravariant position position contravariant occurs odd number contravariant type constructor
The precise rule return type method interface must method argument type must defined follows As example rule apply consider interface
The argument type must valid contravariantly
type parameter must tagged
Similarly result type must valid covariantly
since covariant interface type must valid covariantly
type parameter must tagged
This show interface allowed marked either contravariant
In common case generic data structure restriction mean parameter used method getting data structure parameter used method putting data structure hence choice keywords
C allows variance annotation parameter interface parameter class
Because field C class always mutable variantly parameterized class C would useful
But language emphasize immutable data make good use covariant data type
For example immutable list type covariant subtype
Scala rule checking variance annotation essentially C
However idiom apply immutable datastructures particular
They illustrated following excerpt definition class
First class member variant type must immutable
Here type declared covariant indeed declared method
Trying declare mutable field would rejected type error
Second even data structure immutable often method parameter type occurs contravariantly
For example consider method add element front list
The implementation work creating new object class nonempty list
The obvious type give would However would type error covariant parameter appears contravariant position function argument
But trick get around problem
We give general type allows adding element type long supertype
Note relies covariant since type treat type
At first glance may obvious generalized type sound programmer start simpler type declaration type error point place need generalized
It possible design type system compiler automatically infers best possible variance annotation datatype parameter
However analysis get complex several reason
First analysis nonlocal since variance interface depends variance interface mention
Second order get unique best solution type system must allow parameter simultaneously contravariant
And finally variance type parameter arguably deliberate choice designer interface something happens
For reason language little variance inference
C Scala infer variance annotation
OCaml infer variance parameterized concrete datatypes programmer must explicitly specify variance abstract type interface
For example consider OCaml datatype wrap function The compiler automatically infer contravariant first parameter covariant second
The programmer also provide explicit annotation compiler check satisfied
Thus following declaration equivalent previous one Explicit annotation OCaml become useful specifying interface
For example standard library interface association table include annotation saying map type constructor covariant result type
This ensures
subtype
One drawback approach many interface type must made invariant
For example saw needed invariant contained
In order expose variance API designer could provide additional interface provide subset available method
list provides
However quickly becomes unwieldy
variance annotation aim give user class opportunity subtyping without requiring designer class define multiple interface different variance
Instead time class interface used type declaration programmer indicate subset method used
In effect definition class also make available interface covariant contravariant class
Therefore designer class longer need take variance account increasing
Java provides variance annotation restricted form
A parameterized type instantiated wildcard together upper lower bound

A unbounded wildcard like equivalent
Such type represents unknown type satisfies bound
For example type typechecker accept type known subtype rejected type error since necessarily
In general given interface reference forbids using method interface occurs contravariantly type method
Conversely type one could call
While plain generic type Java invariant
subtyping relationship wildcard type made specific specifying tighter bound example subtype
This show wildcard type also
In total given wildcard type like three way form subtype specializing class specifying tighter bound replacing wildcard specific type see figure
By combining two step subtyping therefore possible
pas argument type method expecting
This exactly kind program covariant interface type allow
The type act interface type containing covariant method implementer define ahead time
This variance
In common case generic data structure covariant parameter used method getting data structure contravariant parameter method putting data structure
The mnemonic Producer Extends Consumer Super PECS book give easy way remember use covariance contravariance
Wildcards flexible drawback
While variance mean API designer need consider variance type parameter interface must often instead use complicated method signature
A common example involves interface
Suppose want write function find biggest element collection
The element need implement method first try might However type general find max
The problem implement instead better interface
In Java unlike C considered subtype
Instead type modified The bounded wildcard conveys information call contravariant method interface
This particular example frustrating method contravariant condition trivially true
A system could handle example le clutter annotating definition
variance annotation provide additional flexibility allowing program
However criticized complexity add language leading complicated type signature error message
One way ass whether extra flexibility useful see used existing program
A survey large set Java library found wildcard annotation could directly replaced annotation
Thus remaining indication place Java benefit system available
In language library must either expose le variance define interface
For example Scala Collections library defines three separate interface class employ covariance covariant base interface containing common method invariant mutable version add method covariant immutable version may specialize inherited implementation exploit structural sharing
This design work well annotation large number interface carry complexity cost client library
And modifying library interface may particular one goal adding generic Java maintain binary backwards compatibility
On hand Java wildcards complex
In conference presentation criticized hard understand use stating adding support simply afford another
Early version Scala used variance annotation programmer found difficult use practice annotation found helpful designing class
Later version Scala added existential type wildcards however according need interoperability Java would probably included
Ross Tate argues part complexity Java wildcards due decision encode variance using form existential type
The original proposal used syntax variance annotation writing instead Java verbose
Since wildcards form existential type used thing variance
A type like type list let object passed method stored field without exactly specifying type parameter
This particularly valuable class method mention type parameter
However existential type difficult problem
For compiler implementer Java wildcards raise issue type checker termination type argument inference ambiguous program
In general whether Java program using generic type checker go infinite loop time program
For programmer lead complicated type error message
Java typechecks wildcard type replacing wildcards fresh type variable
This make error message harder read refer type variable programmer directly write
For example trying add give error like Since annotation useful type system provide
These term come notion
Consider category whose object type whose morphisms represent subtype relationship
This example partially ordered set considered category
Then example function type constructor take two type creates new type take object object
By subtyping rule function type operation revers first argument preserve second contravariant functor first argument covariant functor second

It would useful measure scatter following property Both meet three criterion symmetric data set
The variance measure far value data set mean
Here defined The standard deviation simply positive square root variance
In order write equation defines variance simplest use Σ
The summation operator shorthand way write Take sum set number
As example show would use summation operator write equation calculating mean value data set

In squared
Informally measure far set random number spread average value
Variance central role statistic idea use include
Variance important tool science statistical analysis data common
The variance square second distribution random variable often represented
The variance random variable squared deviation This definition encompasses random variable generated process mixed
The variance also thought random variable The variance also equivalent second probability distribution generates
The variance typically designated simply pronounced squared
The expression variance expanded A mnemonic expression mean square minus square mean
This equation used computation using suffers two component equation similar magnitude
There exist
If random variable represents sample generated population variance given expected value given integral taken ranging range If continuous distribution expected value case variance either
Many distribution expected value exist also finite variance integral variance definition diverges
An example whose satisfies If generator random variable equivalently average value
When discrete specified weight whose sum one divide sum weight
The variance set equally likely value written expected value The variance set equally likely value equivalently expressed without directly referring mean term squared deviation point The parameter continuous distribution whose given In distribution variance related via The role normal distribution part responsible prevalence variance probability statistic
The parameter continuous distribution whose support interval
Its given expected value
The variance equal So exponentially distributed random variable The parameter discrete distribution
Its given expected value
The variance equal So random variable
The parameter discrete distribution
Its given expected value
The variance equal As simple example binomial distribution describes probability getting head toss fair coin
Thus expected value number head variance A fair modeled discrete random variable outcome equal probability
The expected value Therefore variance The general formula variance outcome die Variance square positive zero The variance constant random variable zero variance variable entry value Variance respect change
That constant added value variable variance unchanged If value scaled constant variance scaled square constant The variance sum two random variable given
In general sum random variable These result lead variance If random variable said
It follows immediately expression given earlier random variable uncorrelated variance sum equal sum variance expressed symbolically Since equation hold particular random variable independent
Thus independence sufficient necessary variance sum equal sum variance
One reason use variance preference measure dispersion variance sum difference random variable sum variance This statement called formula discovered
It often made stronger condition variable uncorrelated suffices
So variable variance σ since division linear transformation formula immediately implies variance mean That variance mean decrease increase
This formula variance mean used definition sample mean used
To prove initial statement suffices show The general result follows induction
Starting definition Using linearity expectation operator assumption independence uncorrelatedness simplifies follows In general variable variance sum sum Note The second equality come fact
Here zero independent random variable exists
The formula state variance sum equal sum element covariance matrix component
The next expression state equivalently variance sum sum diagonal covariance matrix plus two time sum upper triangular element lower triangular element emphasizes covariance matrix symmetric
This formula used theory
So variable equal variance average correlation distinct variable variance mean This implies variance mean increase average correlation
In word additional correlated observation effective additional independent observation reducing
Moreover variable unit variance example standardized simplifies This formula used classical test theory
This converges go infinity provided average correlation remains constant converges
So variance mean standardized variable equal correlation converging average correlation Therefore variance mean large number standardized variable approximately equal average correlation
This make clear sample mean correlated variable generally converge population mean even though state sample mean converge independent variable
Define column vector random variable column vector scalar
Therefore random variable denotes
Also let
The variance given The scaling property Bienaymé formula along property jointly imply This implies weighted sum variable variable largest weight disproportionally large weight variance total
For example uncorrelated weight two time weight weight variance four time weight variance
The expression extended weighted sum multiple variable If two variable X Y variance product given Equivalently using basic property expectation given In general two variable statistically dependent variance product given The general formula variance decomposition If two random variable variance exists given given
A intuitive explanation given particular value follows distribution mean variance
As function variable outer expectation variance taken respect Y
The formula tell find based distribution two quantity allowed vary
In particular discrete random variable assuming corresponding probability mass formula total variance first term side becomes
Similarly second term side becomes
Thus total variance given A similar formula applied corresponding formula refers Mean Squares
In analysis corresponding formula This also derived additivity variance since total observed score sum predicted score error score latter two uncorrelated
Similar decomposition possible sum squared deviation sum square A formula often used deriving variance theoretical distribution follows This useful possible derive formula expected value expected value square
This formula also sometimes used connection sample variance
While useful hand calculation advised computer calculation suffers two component equation similar magnitude floating point arithmetic used
This discussed article
The population variance random variable expressed term using This expression used calculate variance situation CDF conveniently expressed
The second random variable attains minimum value taken around first moment mean random variable

Conversely continuous function satisfies random variable necessarily form
This also hold multidimensional case
Unlike expected absolute deviation variance variable unit square unit variable
For example variable measured meter variance measured meter squared
For reason describing data set via often preferred using variance
In dice example standard deviation slightly larger expected absolute deviation
The standard deviation expected absolute deviation used indicator spread distribution
The standard deviation amenable algebraic manipulation expected absolute deviation together variance generalization used frequently theoretical statistic however expected absolute deviation tends le sensitive arising unduly
The us approximate variance function one random variable see
For example approximate variance function one variable given provided twice differentiable mean variance finite
observation measurement yesterday rain throughout day typically complete set possible observation could made

The simplest estimator population mean population variance simply mean variance sample converge correct value number sample increase improved
Estimating population variance taking sample variance close optimal general improved two way
Most simply sample variance computed average sample mean dividing However using value improves estimator various way
Four common value denominator simplest population variance sample eliminates bias minimizes normal distribution mostly eliminates bias normal distribution
Firstly omniscient mean unknown computed sample mean sample variance underestimate variance factor correcting factor dividing instead called
The resulting estimator unbiased called
For example variance single observation sample mean obviously zero regardless population variance
If mean determined way sample used estimate variance bias arise variance safely estimated sample independently known mean
Secondly sample variance generally minimize sample variance population variance
Correcting bias often make worse one always choose scale factor performs better corrected sample variance though optimal scale factor depends population see introduces bias
This always consists scaling unbiased estimator dividing number larger simple example one shrink unbiased estimator towards zero
For normal distribution dividing instead minimizes mean squared error
The resulting estimator biased however known
In general size value given population mean The population variance also computed using This true The population variance match variance generating probability distribution
In sense concept population extended continuous random variable infinite population
In many practical situation true variance population known must computed somehow
When dealing extremely large population possible count every object population computation must performed population
Sample variance also applied estimation variance continuous distribution sample distribution
We take value population estimate variance basis sample
Directly taking variance sample data give average Here denotes Since selected randomly random variable
Their expected value evaluated averaging ensemble possible sample size population
For give Hence give estimate population variance biased factor
For reason referred
Correcting bias yield Either estimator may simply referred version determined context
The proof also applicable sample taken continuous probability distribution
The use term called also used square root variance
The square root thus introduces negative bias depends distribution thus corrected sample standard deviation using Bessel correction biased
The technically involved problem though normal distribution using term yield almost unbiased estimator
The unbiased sample variance function meaning obtained averaging statistic subset population
Being function sample variance random variable natural study distribution
In case independent observation show follows scaled As direct consequence follows If independent identically distributed necessarily normally distributed distribution fourth
If condition hold squared observation
One see indeed variance estimator tends asymptotically zero
An asymptotically equivalent formula given Kenney Keeping Rose Smith Weisstein
result state bound value individual observation sample take given sample mean biased variance calculated
Values must lie within limit It shown sample real number maximum sample arithmetic mean sample biased variance sample
This bound improved known variance bounded minimum sample
Testing equality two variance difficult

The term first introduced paper The great body available statistic show u deviation mean follow closely therefore variability may uniformly measured corresponding
When two independent cause variability capable producing otherwise uniform population distribution standard deviation found distribution cause act together standard deviation

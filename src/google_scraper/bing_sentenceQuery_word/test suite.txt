In le commonly known suite collection intended used test software program show specified set behaviour
A test suite often contains detailed instruction goal collection test case information system configuration used testing
A group test case may also contain prerequisite state step description following test
Collections test case sometimes incorrectly termed even
Occasionally test suite used group similar test case together
A system might smoke test suite consists test suite specific functionality system
It may also contain test signify test used smoke test specific functionality
In one distinguishes collection abstract test case derived model derived abstract test suite providing concrete detail needed execute suite program
An abstract test suite directly used actual SUT abstract test case remain high abstraction level lack concrete detail SUT environment
An executable test suite work sufficiently detailed level correctly communicate SUT usually present interface executable test suite SUT
A test suite testing might consist list number primality prime composite along testing subroutine
The testing subroutine would supply number list primality tester verify result test correct

If embark task developing Master thesis Computer Science document may interest
The scope document narrow deal certain feature thesis development unique field Computer Science
For general information consult source Strunk White Turabian University guide thesis preparation
Before get heart matter ask background skill required successfully complete thesis Computer Science
The next section list skill expected posse
While hard fast rule guarantee background skill required complete thesis Computer Science indicator
Here list indicator
Most thesis Computer Science consist two distinct part writing significant program writing paper describes program wrote
The intent document guide two thing
Of course need taken certain course read certain book journal article otherwise perform basic research begin writing program thesis
If thesis involve writing program skip section
Presumably thesis topic time start developing program implement demonstrate idea topic
You learned write program previous course usually program write thesis involved program written
Thus important use good software engineering technique
The requirement document explains program
Often requirement quite vague
For example system must fast system must
You want write set requirement serve contract specifying expected program
What requirement document
Abstractly answer simple statement valid input program statement corresponding output
Your software operate data derive computed data
The requirement document clearly state input data output data
The requirement document tell program perspective
The specification document explains requirement precisely requirement document
It restates requirement point view developer
The specification explicitly precisely stated
They statement design test
Essentially specification define function set possible data input data output program
The preliminary design document explains going fulfill specification
It written write program include list algorithm use major data structure list major function step use develop program
Stepwise refinement information hiding concept used developing program producing detailed design document
Understanding comment code important
Comments help understand done
It backwards write code try explain
Basic rule include giving selection iteration statement well block sequential code
Additionally loop invariant need developed iteration statement
Data structure use also need explained
Additional document sometimes required program
These include user manual maintenance manual test suite
Often appear appendix thesis
The user manual describes user interface program
The maintenance manual describes change augment port program
The test suite offer validation program compute intended describing test procedure sample test input
Most likely others use program
Writing good user manual facilitate use program
The important thing write naive user
It best assume user program know nothing computer interface
A clear concise description one us program great value others well
You identify awkward misleading command correcting develop much usable product
Start requirement document remind program
If work lasting benefit someone want extend functionality code
A well maintenance manual assist explaining code
The maintenance manual grows specification preliminary design detailed design document
The manual show program decomposed module specifies interface module list major data structure control structure
It also specify effective scope change code
How guarantee program meet specification
Formal verification one proof technique difficult apply large program
You familiar verification technique use develop code others still going want see code give expected result sample test case
Thus develop test suite used show program work correctly variety condition specifying testing procedure used variety test case exercise component program
I believe program written read understood person experienced programming
The basic method facilitating human consumption program write good internal comment discussed
Much sophisticated method exist one system developed Don Knuth
The original system written Pascal system language written even program called used generate system programming language
Briefly benefit using system enables develop program logically without constraint imposed compiler provide excellent program documentation modularity track variable module automatically
An index variable module produced containing pointer variable module defined used
To learn system refer cited literature
Your thesis paper document work serve basis publishable paper
The common mistake made thesis student assume thesis easy write
Consequently postpone writing completed programming
By time produce acceptable copy find term two school slipped still graduated
Important advice start writing early ask thesis advisor feedback writing
Equally important
Plagiarism result expulsion school
You expected write paper copy someone else written
It okay use people idea even word must clearly reference work
Your paper describe
Everyone make spelling mistake spelling checker program available type error eliminated
Always run written work spelling checker ask someone else read
Also find someone correct grammatical mistake paper
If necessary hire someone English Department Language Institute correct work give advisor
Also use professional document preparation system example WordPerfect allows print document laser printer
There
thesis style file developed produce correct margin format plus automatically handle many detail preparation thesis
You begin writing paper first quarter enrolled thesis credit
You write thesis proposal evolves thesis
Writing good proposal important first step success
Proposals differ certain thing expected found every one
There need statement problem studied previous work problem software requirement goal study outline proposed work set milestone bibliography
The approach recommended program development carry development thesis paper
Here begin outline chapter
Although difficult specify included chapter thesis following outline fairly general
Your finished thesis must include title page signature page abstract bibliography
See University guide thesis preparation detail
Make sure follow margin format requirement exactly
You proud work want others know
One way show done quality work publish journal present conference
Thus write short page paper concisely explains new important
This paper submitted appropriate conference journal
The research done provide list conference journal submit work
Below quick list guideline discussed document
There several local requirement aware unnecessary problem completing thesis
Many procedure policy described document simply summarized
If simply follow suggestion outlined discussed paper well way successfully completing thesis requirement attainment Master Degree Computer Science Florida Institute Technology
Good luck

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I difficult time pinning official description test suite compared test plan
In Test Computer Software even mention suite
I assume book rather dated From state If test case represents piece scenario element simulate user completing transaction use test suite
For instance test suite might contain four test case separate test script Test case Login Test case Add New Products Test case Checkout Test case Logout Test suite identify gap testing effort successful completion one test case must occur beginning next test case
make sound like classifying test suite something run succession
state In software development test suite le commonly known validation suite collection test case intended used test software program show specified set behaviour
A test suite often contains detailed instruction goal collection test case information system configuration used testing
A group test case may also contain prerequisite state step description following test
Collections test case sometimes incorrectly termed test plan test script even test scenario
I also found explanation Fundamentally Test Plan logical collection Test Cases
Lets say test case test Authentication functionality website group Test Cases
Test Suite hand execution unit Functional Test User Acceptance Testing UAT Integration Test Regression Test
These Test Suite combination Test Cases required corresponding Testing phase
So Test Suites actually widely different Test Cases
I could continue give example dissenting opinion already gone pretty long
I starting get concerned actual definition everybody make definition fit preconceived notion
If case I move I hoping case pin actually
The traditional definition would something like A test suite collection test case related test work
You might suite regression one build verification test suite specific component
A test plan generally document describes testing approach methodology used testing project risk scope testing specific tool
It usually include specific test case information higher level
If refer A set several test case component system test post condition one test often used precondition next one
A document describing scope approach resource schedule intended test activity
It identifies amongst others test item feature tested testing task task degree tester independence test environment test design technique entry exit criterion used rationale choice risk requiring contingency planning
It record test planning process
From Test Management tool perspective Test Plan collection certain test case executed certain build
For example MSTF VSTS Microsoft ALM HP term Plan used
Other test management tool like SpiraTest us term Set refer collection certain case certain testing purpose
In similar way also name given collection test case action step based test case representing single scenario like Login end end scenario
In general well asked test application module feature may asked write convey Plan may contain Test Mission Test Strategy Logistics may written documented may

Other way define Test Plan way documenting test plan term Scope Resources Time Milestones Entry Exit criterion idea template based Plan fit certain project serve purpose indeed
In case people referring test plan also described test strategy
Also I seen definition Test Plans could Test Suite
That said definition according ITQSB Glossary Terms typically used described

type verifies software previously developed tested still performs way changed interfaced software
Changes may include software enhancement change etc
During regression testing new may uncovered
Sometimes software change impact analysis performed determine area could affected proposed change
These area may include area system
The purpose regression testing ensure change mentioned introduced new fault
One main reason regression testing determine whether change one part software affect part software
Common method regression testing include previously completed test checking whether program behavior changed whether previously fixed fault
Regression testing performed test system efficiently systematically selecting appropriate minimum set test needed adequately cover particular change
As software updated changed emergence new fault old fault quite common
Sometimes occurs fix get lost poor practice simple human error revision control
Often fix problem fix problem narrow case first observed general case may arise lifetime software
Frequently fix problem one area inadvertently cause another area
Finally may happen feature redesigned mistake made original implementation feature made redesign
Therefore software development situation considered bug located fixed record test expose bug test regularly subsequent change program
Although may done procedure using programming technique often done using tool
Such contains software tool allow testing environment execute regression automatically project even set automated system regression test specified interval report failure could imply regression test
Common strategy run system every successful compile small project every night week
Those strategy automated external tool
Regression testing integral part software development method
In method design document replaced extensive repeatable automated testing entire software package throughout stage
Regression testing done functional testing concluded verify functionality working
In corporate world regression testing traditionally performed team development team completed work
However defect found stage costly fix
This problem addressed rise
Although developer always written test case part development cycle test case generally either verify intended outcome
Developer testing compels developer focus unit testing include positive negative test case
The various regression testing technique This technique check test case current program check integrity
Though expensive need case ensures error modified code
Unlike Retest technique run part owing cost retest cost selecting part test suite le Retest technique
Prioritize test case increase test suite rate fault detection
Test case prioritization technique schedule test case test case higher priority executed test case lower priority
This technique hybrid Regression Test Selection Test Case Prioritization
Regression testing performed change made existing functionality software bug fix software
Regression testing achieved multiple approach approach followed provides certainty change made software affected existing functionality unaltered way
In agile project management process software development life cycle short resource scarce change software frequent Regression testing might introduce lot unnecessary overhead
Typically regression testing carried automation tool existing generation regression testing tool equipped handle application
For reason performing regression test database application could prove taxing would require great deal manual effort
Moreover software development environment tends use component third party performing regression testing tricky change third party component may interfere rest system performing regression testing third party component difficult unknown entity
Regression testing used testing program often also tracking quality output
For instance design regression testing could track code size time take compile execute test suite case
Also consequence introduction new bug program maintenance requires far system testing per statement written programming
Theoretically fix one must run entire batch test case previously run system ensure damaged obscure way
In practice must indeed approximate theoretical idea costly
Regression test broadly categorized
Functional test exercise complete program various input
Unit test exercise individual function object method
Both functional testing tool unit testing tool tend automated product part compiler suite
A functional test may scripted series program input possibly even involving automated mechanism controlling mouse movement click
A unit test may set separate function within code driver layer link code without altering code tested

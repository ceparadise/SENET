Communications management keeping everybody loop
The communication planning process concern defining type information deliver receive format communicating timing release distribution
It turn project manager job spent communication important make sure everybody get right message right time
The first step defining communication plan figuring kind communication stakeholder need project make good decision
This called
Your project produce lot information want overwhelm stakeholder
Your job figure feel valuable
Communicating valuable information mean always paint rosy picture
Communications stakeholder may consist either good news bad news
The point want bury stakeholder much information want give enough informed make appropriate decision
Communications technology major impact keep people loop
Methods communicating take many form written report conversation email formal status report meeting online database online schedule project website
You consider several factor deciding method choose transfer information
The timing information exchange need update first factor
Do need procure new technology system system already place work
The technology available figure plan keep everyone notified project status issue
Staff experience technology another factor
Are project team member stakeholder experienced using technology need train
Finally consider duration project project environment
Will technology choosing work throughout life project upgraded updated point
And project team function
Are located together spread across several campus location
The answer question documented communication plan
All project require sound communication plan project type method distributing information
The communication plan document type information need stakeholder information distributed information delivered
The type information communicate typically include project status project scope statement update project baseline information risk action item performance measure project acceptance
It important information need stakeholder determined early planning phase project management life cycle possible team develop project planning document already know receive copy delivered
Completing complex project successfully requires good communication among team member
If team member work building arrange regular meeting simply stop office space get quick answer even discus project informally office function
Many project performed team interact primarily electronic communication therefore called
To avoid miscommunication harm trust include team member project culture project team need plan communicating reliably timely manner
This planning begin understanding two major category communication
If party communication taking part exchange time communication
A telephone Skype conference call example synchronous communication
The following example synchronous communication Modern communication technology make possible assemble project team anywhere world
Most people work daylight hour make synchronous meeting difficult participant different time zone
However advantage circumstance example something must done start business tomorrow team member Asia work problem normal work hour team member North America get sleep
It important remember time zone calculate difference associate zone correctly miss important meeting deadline
Cities country north south observe local time
Be aware many people United States Canada think South America directly south North America
As see South American country five time zone east North America
A helpful site convert local time another time zone Figure World Time Zones
Standard time zone world TimeZonesBoy Public Domain Time zone calculated reference time zone Royal Observatory Greenwich England
The time location Greenwich Mean Time GMT
More recent reference designate Coordinated Universal Time UTC instead GMT
The time zone advance Greenwich easterly direction
However international dateline midpoint around world Greenwich subtract time zone GMT
To prevent confusion time often given using clock
For example midnight indicated noon
A project manager software development project Toronto five time zone west reference zone time given
If noon reference zone five hour earlier Toronto
The manager would like contact project team member Paris France
Paris one time zone east reference zone
If noon reference zone Paris
This mean difference Toronto Paris
If project manager wait lunch place call Toronto late day Paris reach someone
Getting team together time spread across time zone
Many type communication require party present time
This type communication asynchronous
There several choice asynchronous communication
Many company prefer final contract personally signed authorized representative party agreement
If several signature required take week get signature contract transferred postal service
If process holding start project use overnight delivery service minimize time spent transferring document
Fax machine around long time enjoy high level trust transmitting document accurately
Although might seem archaic still use fax transmission many country fax signed contract legal image
Electronic mail email widely used coordinate project communicate team member
It several valuable characteristic project management A online journal private shared invitation made available world
Some project manager keep journal summarize day challenge triumph decision made
They return journal later date review process result decision known see learn mistake
Many decision project management made incomplete knowledge reflecting previous decision develop skill important growth project manager
Some project directly affected external factor political election economic trend corporate merger technological scientific breakthrough weather

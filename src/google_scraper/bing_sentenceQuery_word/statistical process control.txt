method employ monitor control process
This help ensure process operates efficiently producing product le waste rework
SPC applied process conforming product product meeting specification output measured
Key tool used SPC include focus
An example process SPC applied manufacturing line
SPC must practiced phase The first phase initial establishment process second phase regular production use process
In second phase decision period examined must made depending upon change E condition Man Machine Material Method Movement Environment wear rate part used manufacturing process machine part jig fixture
An advantage SPC method quality control inspection emphasizes early detection prevention problem rather correction problem occurred
In addition reducing waste SPC lead reduction time required produce product
SPC make le likely finished product need reworked scrapped
SPC pioneered early
Shewhart developed control chart concept state statistical control
Statistical control equivalent concept developed logician also book
Along team AT T included Harold Dodge Harry Romig worked put inspection rational statistical basis well
Shewhart consulted Colonel Leslie Simon application control chart munition manufacture Army
That successful application helped convince Army Ordnance engage AT T George Edwards consult use statistical quality control among division contractor outbreak World War II
invited Shewhart speak Graduate School Department Agriculture served editor Shewhart book result lecture
Deming important architect quality control short course trained American industry new technique WWII
The graduate wartime course formed new professional society American Society Quality Control elected Edwards first president
Deming traveled Japan Allied Occupation met Union Japanese Scientists Engineers JUSE effort introduce SPC method industry
Shewhart read new statistical theory coming Britain especially work
However understood data physical process seldom produced curve
He discovered data measurement variation manufacturing always behave way data measurement natural phenomenon example particle
Shewhart concluded every process display variation process display variation natural process common source variation process described statistical control
Other process additionally display variation present causal system process time special source variation described control
In suggested SPC could applied process software engineering process CMM
The Level Level practice Capability Maturity Model Integration use concept
The notion SPC useful tool applied process research development system engineering encountered skepticism remains controversial
In seminal article point complexity conformance requirement changeability invisibility software result inherent essential variation removed
This implies SPC le effective domain software development manufacturing
In manufacturing quality defined conformance specification
However two product characteristic ever exactly process contains many source variability
In traditionally quality finished article ensured inspection product
Each article sample article production lot may accepted rejected according well meet design
In contrast SPC us tool observe performance production process order detect significant variation result production article
Any source variation point time process fall one two class
Most process many source variation minor may ignored
If dominant source variation identified however resource change focused
If dominant assignable source variation detected potentially identified removed
Once removed process said stable
When process stable variation remain within known set limit
That least another assignable source variation occurs
For example breakfast cereal packaging line may designed fill cereal box gram cereal
Some box slightly gram slightly le
When package weight measured data demonstrate net weight
If production process input environment example machine line change distribution data change
For example cam pulley machinery wear cereal filling machine may put specified amount cereal box
Although might benefit customer manufacturer point view wasteful increase cost production
If manufacturer find change source timely manner change corrected example cam pulley replaced
The application SPC involves three main phase activity The data measurement variation point process map monitored using
Control chart attempt differentiate assignable special source variation common source
Common source expected part process much le concern manufacturer assignable source
Using control chart continuous activity ongoing time
When process trigger control chart detection rule control chart said stable
A analysis may performed stable process predict ability process produce conforming product future
When process trigger control chart detection rule alternatively process capability low activity may performed identify source excessive variation
The tool used extra activity include
Designed experiment mean objectively quantifying relative importance strength source variation
Once source special cause variation identified minimized eliminated
Steps eliminating source variation might include development standard staff training change process input
When monitoring many process control chart sometimes useful calculate quantitative measure stability process
These metric used process need corrective action
These metric also viewed supplementing traditional metric
Several metric proposed described Ramirez Runger
They Stability Ratio compare variability variability ANOVA Test compare variation variation Instability Ratio compare number subgroup one violation total number subgroup
Digital control chart use rule determine derived value signal need correction

Mario owns shoe company
His factory make shoe usually pretty nice occasionally one Mario shoe come broken sole deformed heel
What make sure quality shoe high
way apply statistic identify fix problem quality control like Mario bad shoe
It first developed Walter Shewhart Bell Laboratories since developed
If statistical process control help Mario solve quality control issue
But work
To better understand statistical process control let look cause variation applied Mario shoe factory
Generally Mario shoe turn perfect
But sometimes problem one shoe
What causing problem
In statistical process control two cause variation product common special
A variation come stable system
That problem caused issue system occur pretty much time
Because normal part process called common cause
For example material Mario us make sole shoe substandard shoe end hole sol common cause
Compare hole due fact one factory machine malfunctioned one day
That something happens time common cause hole
Instead variation come specific issue event like malfunctioning machine
Because cause variation happen every special cause
In world statistic variation caused common cause usually normally distributed
That Mario graphed number shoe hole shoe across time would expect see bell curve variation
Special cause though usually lie outside normal distribution
So Mario holey problem caused issue like machine malfunctioning would expect see many holey shoe coming assembly line normal
If graphed day machine malfunctioned would lie outside bell curve
Once Mario figured whether variation shoe caused special common cause still fix issue
Common cause variation must addressed fixing changing system often require management get involved
For example Mario might decide change material using sol shoe
Other common cause fix involve changing product design manufacturing process
Special cause hand often changed quickly easily without management intervening
For example machine malfunctioning cause hole machine operator might simply fix machine get working

Okay Mario understands figure cause variation shoe know common cause involve larger systematic change special cause
But exactly implement change address issue
Shewhart developed system help fix cause variation
It called plan study act
It also sometimes referred plan check act
The four step system
Plan The first step identify problem cause
In Mario case know problem sometimes shoe hole sol
During planning phase also figure whether hole caused substandard material common cause machine malfunction special cause

Do Next Mario want implement change fix problem
Let say figure substandard material issue
He could change material us sol shoe

Study Check During third step Mario need gather analyze data see impact change
For example changing material using could chart many shoe hole factory produce certain amount time
Then able tell new material cause hole le often old material

Act Finally Mario want standardize change successful implement change unsuccessful
For example let say Mario discovers shoe made using new material end holey sol le often made using old material
Mario want make change permanent one roll change factory
On hand discovers new material produce fewer holey shoe either want try different material reexamine cause hole
Perhaps material
The PDSA program cycle mean company finish step four go back planning phase
For example maybe Mario changing material make fewer holey shoe
Great
But go back planning phase figure else reduce number shoe hole come assembly line
Perhaps new design new machinery training worker could help reduce variation
way apply statistic identify fix problem quality control first developed Walter Shewhart Bell Laboratories
In statistical process control two cause variation product common special
A variation come stable system
In contrast variation come specific issue event
Variations common cause usually normally distributed whereas special cause usually lie outside normal distribution
In addition common cause variation must addressed fixing changing system often require management get involved
Special cause hand often changed quickly easily without management intervening
To reduce variation improve quality control company adopt plan study act method sometimes also referred plan check act

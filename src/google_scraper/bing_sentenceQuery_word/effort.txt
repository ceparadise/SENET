Importance Computer Science available

A computer science education sure ticket job today tech economy right
Hardly say one startup CEO lambasts school failing teach practical computer skill suggesting developer skip degree path first place
In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity
An Android developer authority computer copy editor Shakespeare Keats
Instead larger lesson may developer realistic career opportunity school upfront program lead
As startup CEOs keep mind distinction coding vocational training knowledge

You wo able vote comment
submitted Edit I wanted say thanks response I sorry responding giving elaborate description
The reason I want major field I want expand knowledge computer computer technology rather something I enjoy I hoping make career
Post comment
Not passionate field
I interview hire metric shit ton junior engineer engineering intern
Having CS background important good software engineer I never hired anyone simply CS degree résumé
It painfully obvious I interview candidate earned CS degree promise good pay
And get hired least company SAAS startup went public recently pay obscene amount good engineer
interested computer science almost AS CS also interested electrical engineering would associate EE bachelor CS good combo
I mean sure
Yea good
How much code written outside schoolwork though
That I want know
You understand basic data structure algorithm etc good base start
But I teach junior
I ca teach passion
Do love computer science
What time
Why someone need spend free time coding good employee
What interest coding
I mean one thing project two summer seems like want someone coding majority free time
Unless I misunderstood Why someone need spend free time coding good employee
They spend free time coding good employee
They spend free time coding great
What interest coding
I spend lot free time programming I plenty interest
I father three husband I backpack snowboard I watch lot sport
But I probably spend hour day outside work programming
Usually night kid wife bed
I mean one thing project two summer seems like want someone coding majority free time
Yea school probably programming majority free time
If want good engineer
I met good engineer honestly
None I recall rate
try learn programming language technique time try learn thing good programmer like gui graphic socket interprocess communication database support
I try online tutorial really break whats happening write program similar thing firm grasp basic gui file type far imstill working graphic started thing
I think OP kind trolling know one best bet pretended get response good point
Family suggested CS
Just
Lots people would better actually interested
Major computer science passionate think raking dough
Right probably one best degree get term employment
Depends Do love computer
Are good computer science
Can get degree taking le debt average starting salary
Do intend work internship CS
Do plan stay top new development field working
If answer positive CS may good fit
If understanding computer average person heard CS earns good salary probably right major
deleted Typically boil passion essential CS part
Those interested likely already shown interest learning
No communication psychology major hot demand right
All woman study art degree breh Psychology flooded field lol
Everyone chooses expect job arent
You missed obvious sarcasm
Care elaborate
whoosh
The degree much meaning might wish
You need supplement side project experience
If anyone need way gain experience programming look bioinformatics lab
Many biology lab difficult issue want solve involving enormous data set clear visualization organization etc
I ca tell often I sort process research lament lack available tool
If want gain resume experience I sure university lab would take develop program
Although might required brush biology
Do expect much pay though college
I volunteer free even pay course credit
Get used least duration degree
Otherwise find something else keep messing around computer programming
You need prove future employer concrete experience developing actual tool program beyond curriculum
Honestly I sure
There lot kid wan na computer science promise high pay
Yes field still prevalent I doubt industry keep new entry level student trying get first job
My school doubled admission computer science department last year
And I sure school keep demand
And statistic mention growth take account many worker computer science degree exist college
Or many studied good student finished four year degree
New grad also compete people job
And high salary Bay Area really high cost living would similar quality life someone lower salary living another state
If something interested good probably fine
But money job opportunity I think worth trouble
And I saying mean computer science major
It definitely interesting field
I actually minoring I think interesting possibly relevant major
But I see lot kid well money parental pressure
They think GPA lead figure salary everyone promising I really doubt everyone living dream
That good observation
Although shortage CS employee lot job opening whole bunch employee big part gap skilled Developer Senior Developer position
If actually willing push past entry level job opportunity get competitive pretty quickly
The one actually enjoy good field one succeed long term
I agree
If genuinely interested willing put time effort needed get good grade join club contribute meaningfully resume complete side project probably fine
It still gon na competitive able pull enough effort
I glad someone actually supported
This pretty unpopular opinion especially Reddit STEM circlejerk really prevalent
Honestly I surprised I downvoted yet
deleted Did OP say enjoy lot
Yes I know even asking ton article
If asking already coding experience want go school already knowledge
That make employable
Funny story I made realize great I taking long path I went date guy let call Paul trying get coding job degree experience watching YouTube video applying
But working great nerve tell getting degree waste time
While barely get job
He said would go job part job could part could
So got let go last job
Because lack knowledge
Given guy overall jackass
However I trying get getting degree give information learning code understanding user
See Paul perception user well
When I brought like care I lot learning never compare I learned working degree
You use lot period
Anyway I kind CS program I noticed ca get well taking class
You Paul side
So class might teach think user make EFFECTIVE programmer actual programming still meant learned side YouTube
Now I wonder CS job future especially year
From I understand pretty soon computer able write code
If CS major mean manipulate computer verge computer scientist useless
Just thought deleted Then
I guess I
That make feel great Is I getting voted
I trying dick likely thing
No meant learned watching YouTube video
Professors care learn sure expect watch YouTube video learn
This still VERY far least level implies Most CS major even touch aside like CS theory
The lowest level language learn assembly still incomparably higher level strictly
No
Even century road robot take world still use computer scientist
Even study robot decide reprogram
Assembly really much higher level
It get encoded assembler straight
Like MIPS assembly instruction like add rd r rt get encoded instruction first fewvbits zero add instruction
Next set bit refer register next bit last bit actual add
Edit I downvoted correct
Yes assembly higher level nearly much something like C I downvote right I used incomparably higher level descriptor
I trying say high level language higher level assembly
And I know still lower level something like Sorry I came snarky
Most likely yes
Yes In short yes
In long think deeply enjoy
CS major hot commodity
But getting good field absolutely love somewhere incredibly difficult impossible
Every kid I seen get money parent dropped changed major within couple year
If willing lot work outside class wo marketable skill field hire good degree
Are willing pull nighters debugging code
Are willing work system make calculus look easy comparison
Those question need answer go
It everyone
Some u love find difficult boring
The average salary person compsci degree
You earn anywhere upon graduation lower amount limited mostly startup
Very dependent location cost living
The average salary closer
In Bay Area cost living insane tend pay

Today give student across country chance learn computer science CS school
We made real progress education past seven year States Washington raised expectation adopting higher standard prepare student success college career
It time take next step forward
Our economy rapidly shifting educator business leader increasingly recognizing CS new basic skill necessary economic opportunity social mobility
By estimate one quarter school United States offer CS programming coding state allow CS course count towards graduation even advanced economy making CS available student
Fortunately growing movement led parent teacher state district private sector expand CS education
The President Computer Science All Initiative build effort Building progress made state raising standard help student graduate high school ready college career President Obama signed bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA December
This law cement progress requiring student America taught high academic standard prepare succeed career college
Furthermore nine ten parent surveyed last year say want CS taught child school
They understand today elementary middle high school student tomorrow engineer entrepreneur leader must equipped strong computational thinking skill ability solve complex problem
Access CS education limited wide disparity exist even access course
For example fewer percent high school offered Advanced Placement AP CS course percent took exam girl percent Latino student
Media portrayal stereotype exacerbate dynamic far men woman depicted technology role film television role
As highlighted disparity get included feel included one reason woman compose le technical employee le three percent America largest innovative technology company
Providing access CS critical step ensuring nation remains competitive global economy strengthens cybersecurity
Last year tech job open across United States percent STEM job projected field
The Federal government alone need additional IT cybersecurity professional private sector need many
CS important tech sector also growing number industry including transportation healthcare education financial service using software transform product service
In fact tech job outside tech sector
CS also active applied field STEM learning allows student engage interaction key math science engineering principle

On Thursday center giving University Washington first award sponsored Google college succeeded effort
The center hope give award annually
Thirty percent University Washington degree computer science last year went woman
Ed Lazowska chairman computer science engineering university called share Still twice percent percent
The university done diversify student base Lazowska said
The first get girl interested computer science early teaching elementary high school teacher student computing workshop field trip
These effort particularly large effect state school recruit nearby high school
Still like Khan many student particularly girl exposed subject college
That university gave introductory course makeover year ago
The goal make computing accessible inviting broader range people Lazowska said
The course showed student succeed hard work need esoteric knowledge innate gift
The new program includes small group session faculty member class connect software programming philosophy biology emphasis application
Forty percent teaching assistant woman seminar woman computing
The University Washington also tried build sense community woman studying topic

mentality humble opinion present much computing education said Lucy Sanders chief executive center
Harvey Mudd woman studying computer science thing like including picture woman school brochure hiring female student campus tour guide
Carnegie Mellon started formal mentorship program woman studying subject since often excluded male informal network
The focus recruiting retaining woman might increase number also single say critic program change curriculum attract woman offer class specifically woman
Students often say want seen computer scientist female computer scientist
But Sanders say American computer science curriculum need complete overhaul woman
particularly think existing computer science curriculum effective anybody said
need situated people understand

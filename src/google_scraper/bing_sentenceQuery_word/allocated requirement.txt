In encompasses task go determining need condition meet new altered product project taking account possibly conflicting various software system requirement
Requirements analysis critical success failure system software project
The requirement documented actionable measurable testable traceable related identified business need opportunity defined level detail sufficient system design
Conceptually requirement analysis includes three type activity Requirements analysis long tiring process many delicate psychological skill involved
Large system may confront analyst hundred thousand system requirement
New system change environment relationship people important identify stakeholder take account need ensure understand implication new system
Analysts employ several technique elicit requirement customer
These may include development scenario represented identification use workplace observation holding aptly named context requirement workshop requirement review session creating requirement list
may used develop example system demonstrated stakeholder
Where necessary analyst employ combination method establish exact requirement stakeholder system meet business need produced
Requirements quality improved method See discussion people organization legal entity company standard body valid interest system
They may affected either directly indirectly
A major new emphasis focus identification
It increasingly recognized stakeholder limited organization employing analyst
Other stakeholder include Requirements often implication unknown individual stakeholder often missed incompletely defined stakeholder interview
These implication elicited conducting JRD session controlled environment facilitated trained Business Analyst wherein stakeholder participate discussion elicit requirement analyze detail uncover implication
A dedicated scribe present document discussion freeing Business Analyst lead discussion direction generates appropriate requirement meet session objective
JRD Sessions analogous Sessions
In former session elicit requirement guide design whereas latter elicit specific design feature implemented satisfaction elicited requirement
One traditional way documenting requirement contract style requirement list
In complex system requirement list run hundred page long
An appropriate metaphor would extremely long shopping list
Such list much favour modern analysis proved spectacularly unsuccessful achieving aim still seen day
As alternative requirement list us suggest requirement everyday language
Best practice take composed list requirement merely clue repeatedly ask
actual business purpose discovered
Stakeholders developer devise test measure level goal achieved thus far
Such goal change slowly long list specific unmeasured requirement
Once small set critical measured goal established short iterative development phase may proceed deliver actual stakeholder value long project half
A prototype computer program exhibit part property another computer program allowing user visualize application yet constructed

Prototypes make easier make design decision aspect application seen shared application built
Major improvement communication user developer often seen introduction prototype
Early view application led fewer change later hence reduced overall cost considerably
Prototypes flat diagram often referred working application using synthesized functionality
Wireframes made variety graphic design document often remove color design
use greyscale color palette instance final software expected applied
This help prevent confusion whether prototype represents final visual look feel application
A use case structure documenting functional requirement system usually involving software whether new changed
Each use case provides set convey system interact human user another system achieve specific business goal
Use case typically avoid technical jargon preferring instead language
Use case often requirement engineer stakeholder

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I want better understand OS provides heap memory process
Here heap memory I mean memory allocated dynamically say call
Heap allocator typically call system call reserve region page dole chunk call
The system call Unix used implementation sometimes use well
I think window us totally clear
A good resource
Short answer summarizing answer It done operating system
Simple early operating system assigned fixed size area code data stack heap idea stack heap grew towards
Early Unix system space stack area data used also heap could extended specialized system call
More modern system use virtual memory bound limited contiguous address space anymore
So program ask extra address usually via similar library handling heap dole part asked
How exactly work depends programming language different language pose different requirement facility underlying kernel offer
To answer question short answer yes
The long answer executable linked also field executable header For Unix operating system
Windows us
determine initial size static data area stack heap
For question short answer depends
Since modern operating system today use virtual memory common use Virtual Memory Addressing program given separate memory space
The size memory space either system system
A good discussion layout running program Linux
A request operating system map page extend range valid address program use
These new range backed physical RAM swapped disk
With said program type fixed size
For example old era something known COre iMage file executable allocated fixed
Although nature machine back day COM file could access entire memory map machine without consequence
Other machine type different version
Current Unix implementation however support ELF executable type possibly others
Executable script file equivalent file Windows use interpreter ELF binary

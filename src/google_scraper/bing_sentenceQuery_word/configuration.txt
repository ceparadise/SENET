Originally term RAID defined usually refers
RAID storage us multiple disk order provide fault tolerance improve overall performance increase capacity system
This contrast older storage device used single disk drive store data
RAID allows store data multiple pace balanced way improve overall performance
RAID disk drive used frequently server generally necessary personal computer
With RAID technology data one disk array one disk fails data preserved
Thanks technique known technique spreading data multiple disk drive RAID also offer option reading writing one disk time order improve performance
In arrangement data broken segment sent various disk array speeding throughput
A typical RAID array us multiple disk appear single device provide storage capacity single disk
RAID device use many different architecture called level depending desired balance performance fault tolerance
RAID level describe data distributed across drive
Standard RAID level include following Provides data striping spreading block file across multiple disk drive redundancy
This improves performance deliver fault tolerance
If one drive fails data array lost
Provides disk mirroring
Level provides twice read transaction rate single disk write transaction rate single disk
Not typical implementation rarely used Level stripe data bit level rather block level
Provides striping dedicated parity disk
Level service simultaneous multiple request also rarely used
A commonly used implementation RAID Level provides striping like Level parity disk
If data disk fails parity data used create replacement disk
A disadvantage Level parity disk create write bottleneck
Provides data striping byte level also stripe error correction information
This result excellent performance good fault tolerance
Level one popular implementation RAID
Provides striping parity data distributed across disk
Not one original RAID level multiple RAID mirror created RAID stripe created
Some device use one level hybrid nested arrangement vendor also offer proprietary RAID level
Examples RAID level include following Not one original RAID level two RAID stripe created RAID mirror created
Used replicating sharing data among disk
A trademark Storage Computer Corporation add caching Levels
A RAID implementation two disk
Data striping combined mirroring written stripe one remaining disk array
Also called EMC Corporation proprietary striped parity RAID system used Symmetrix storage system
Before RAID device became popular system used single drive store data
This arrangement sometimes referred SLED single large expensive disk
However SLEDs drawback
First create data read disk quickly enough keep component system particularly processor
Second SLED fails data lost unless recently backed onto another disk tape
In three University California Berkeley researcher David Patterson Garth Gibson Randy Katz first defined term RAID paper titled
They theorized spreading data across multiple drive could improve system performance lower cost reduce power consumption avoiding potential reliability problem inherent using inexpensive le reliable disk
The paper also described five original RAID level
Today RAID technology nearly ubiquitous among enterprise storage device also found many consumer storage device
However storage option exist
One alternative Just Bunch Drives
JBOD architecture utilizes multiple disk disk device addressed separately
JBOD provides increased storage capacity versus single disk offer fault tolerance performance benefit RAID device
Another RAID alternative concatenation spanning
This practice combining multiple disk drive appear single drive
Spanning increase storage capacity drive however JBOD spanning provide reliability speed benefit
RAID confused data backup
Although RAID level provide redundancy expert advise utilizing separate storage system backup disaster recovery purpose
In order set RAID array need group disk drive either software hardware controller
Software RAID run directly server utilizing server resource
As result may cause application run slowly
Most include RAID management capability
You also set RAID array adding server desktop PC
The RAID controller run essentially software us processor instead system CPU
Some le expensive fake RAID controller provide RAID management software separate processor
Alternatively purchase RAID array storage vendor
These appliance generally include two RAID controller group disk housing
Using RAID array usually different using kind primary storage
The RAID management handled hardware software controller generally invisible end user
established
In effort promote interoperability among different RAID vendor defines data distributed across disk RAID device
Another industry group called RAID Advisory Board worked promote RAID technology group longer active

A protocol system rule define something done
In terminology protocol usually standardized method transmitting establishing communication different device
Just two human need common language begin share idea information must computer common way sending information
The often used example successful system implementation key quality protocol error correction message formatting utilized respected across wide variety
To demonstrate common usage popular protocol examine Internet TCP protocol
Computers communicate different type information text picture Voice Over Internet Protocol
To indicate user want page website connects sends information GET
The server know request divided three section space know value expect section
The first section specifies type request case GET request
The next section location request case file located directory
The final section transport protocol browser would like use case version HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol
If Firefox request property different order say GET section end instead beginning web server would able understand request
The order type request defined suite protocol
In previous example saw one protocol used specify use another protocol HTTP
This example protocol interact
TCP IP protocol used establishing basic connection two computer
However simply connecting nothing practical information must actually transferred
Just like protocol defines property connection protocol HTTP defines property data transfer
In addition familiar HTTP protocol common Internet protocol include FTP File Transfer Protocol DHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Post Office Protocol version IMAP Internet Message Access Protocol
You probably noticed acronym end letter P
In fact whenever encountered unfamiliar acronym end P good chance defines protocol
Programming Science Software Technology Terminology Questions day

In system rule allow two entity transmit via kind variation
The protocol defines rule possible
Protocols may implemented combination
Communicating system use format exchanging various message
Each message exact meaning intended elicit response range possible response particular situation
The specified behavior typically independent
Communication protocol agreed upon party involved
To reach agreement protocol may developed
A describes computation close analogy protocol programming language
Multiple protocol often describe different aspect single communication
A group protocol designed work together known protocol suite implemented software
Internet communication protocol published IETF
The handle wired wireless networking ISO handle type
The handle telecommunication protocol format PSTN
As PSTN Internet standard also driven towards convergence
The information exchanged device network medium governed rule convention set communication protocol specification
The nature communication actual data exchanged behavior defined specification
In digital computing system rule expressed
Protocols communication algorithm programming language computation
Operating system usually contain set cooperating process manipulate shared data communicate
This communication governed protocol embedded process code
In contrast communicating system communicate using shared
Transmission necessarily reliable individual system may use different hardware operating system
To implement networking protocol protocol software module interfaced framework implemented machine operating system
This framework implement networking functionality operating system
When protocol algorithm expressed portable programming language protocol software may made independent
The best known framework
At time Internet developed proven successful design approach compiler operating system design given similarity programming language communication protocol originally monolithic networking program decomposed cooperating protocol
This gave rise concept layered protocol nowadays form basis protocol design
Systems typically use single protocol handle transmission
Instead use set cooperating protocol sometimes called
Some best known protocol suite
The protocol arranged based functionality group instance group
The functionality mapped onto layer layer solving distinct class problem relating instance network
To transmit message protocol selected layer
The selection next protocol accomplished extending message protocol selector layer
Getting data across network part problem protocol
The data received evaluated context progress conversation protocol therefore must include rule describing context
These kind rule said express communication
Other rule determine whether data meaningful context exchange take place
These kind rule said express communication
Messages sent received communicating system establish communication
Protocols therefore specify rule governing transmission
In general much following addressed Despite number networking protocol show little variety networking protocol use underlying principle concept way
So use general purpose programming language would yield large number application differing detail
A suitably defined dedicated protocolling language would therefore little syntax perhaps enough specify parameter optional mode operation virtual machine would incorporated possible principle concept making virtual machine protocol
The protocolling language would syntax lot semantics describing universal protocol would therefore effect protocol hardly differing universal networking protocol
In networking context protocol language
The notion universal networking protocol provides rationale standardization networking protocol assuming existence universal networking protocol development protocol standard using consensus model agreement group expert might viable way coordinate protocol design effort
Networking protocol operate heterogeneous environment consisting different network technology possibly rich set application single universal protocol would hard design implement correctly
Instead IETF decided reduce complexity assuming relatively simple network architecture allowing decomposition single universal networking protocol two generic protocol TCP IP two class specific protocol one dealing network detail one dealing detail common network application remote login file transfer email web browsing
ISO choose similar general path allowing network architecture standardize protocol
principle applied create set common network protocol design principle
Communicating system operate concurrently
An important aspect synchronization software receiving transmitting message communication proper sequencing
The syntax semantics communication governed protocol usually modest complexity
protocol relatively large complexity could however merit implementation language interpreter
An example latter case language
Concurrent programming traditionally topic operating system theory text
Formal verification seems indispensable concurrent program notorious hidden sophisticated bug contain
A mathematical approach study concurrency communication referred CSP
Concurrency also modeled using
Mealy Moore machine use design tool digital electronics system encountered form hardware used telecommunication electronic device general
Design complex protocol often involves decomposition simpler cooperating protocol
Such set cooperating protocol sometimes called protocol family protocol suite within conceptual framework
The literature present numerous analogy computer communication programming
In analogy transfer mechanism protocol comparable central processing unit CPU
The framework introduces rule allow programmer design cooperating protocol independently one another

In modern protocol design protocol layered
Layering design principle divide protocol design task smaller step accomplishes specific part interacting part protocol small number way
Layering allows part protocol designed tested without case keeping design relatively simple
Layering also permit familiar protocol adapted unusual circumstance
For example mail protocol adapted send message aircraft changing modem protocol INMARS LAPD data protocol used international marine radio satellite
The communication protocol use designed function diverse complex setting
Internet protocol designed simplicity modularity interoperating fit coarse hierarchy functional layer traditionally called model
The name arose first two cooperating protocol TCP IP resulted decomposition original Transmission Control Program monolithic communication protocol first two layer communication suite
This model expanded four layer additional protocol
However Internet protocol development focussed principle layering mandatory recipe communication rather evolved convenient description modularity protocol cooperation
A different model developed internationally rigorous reference model general communication much stricter rule protocol interaction rigorous layering concept functionality
Typically application software built upon robust data transport layer
Underlying transport layer datagram delivery routing mechanism typically Internet
Packet relaying across network happens another layer involves network link technology often specific certain physical layer technology
Layering provides opportunity exchange technology needed example protocol often stacked arrangement accommodate connection dissimilar network
For example IP may tunneled across ATM network
Protocol layering form basis protocol design
It allows decomposition single complex protocol simpler cooperating protocol also functional decomposition protocol belongs functional class called
The protocol layer solve distinct class communication problem
The Internet protocol suite consists following layer network
Together layer make
Computations deal algorithm data communication involves protocol message analog kind message flow diagram
To visualize protocol layering protocol suite diagram message flow two system A B shown figure
The system make use protocol suite
The vertical flow protocol horizontal message flow protocol system
The message flow governed rule data format specified protocol
The blue line therefore mark boundary horizontal protocol layer
The vertical protocol layered obey state n n
The horizontal protocol belong protocol suite
Layered protocol allow protocol designer concentrate one layer time without worrying layer perform
The vertical protocol need protocol system satisfy minimal assumption ensure protocol layering principle hold layered protocol
This achieved using technique called
Usually message stream data divided small piece called depending layer piece transmitted
The piece contain
The data header area identifies source destination network packet protocol data meaningful protocol like CRC data sent data length timestamp
The rule enforced vertical protocol piece transmission data area lower protocol sending side reverse happen receiving side
The result lowest level piece look like data layer directly data top layer data sending receiving side
This rule therefore ensures protocol layering principle hold effectively virtualizes lowest transmission line reason message flow coloured red figure
To ensure side use protocol piece also carry data identifying protocol header
The design protocol layering network Internet architecture interrelated one designed without
Some important feature respect Internet architecture network service provides described next
Having established protocol layering protocol protocol designer resume software design
The software layered organization relationship protocol layering visualized figure
The software module implementing protocol represented cube
The information flow module represented arrow
The top two horizontal red arrow virtual
The blue line mark layer boundary
To send message system A top module interacts module directly hand message encapsulated
This module reacts encapsulating message data area filling header data accordance protocol implement interacts module handing newly formed message whenever appropriate
The bottom module directly interacts bottom module system B message sent across
On receiving system B reverse happens ultimately assuming transmission error protocol violation etc
message get delivered original form topmodule system B
On protocol error receiving module discard piece received report back error condition original source piece layer handing error message case bottom module sending across
The division message stream data piece subsequent reassembly handled layer introduced
The reassembly done destination
intermediate router
software organized four layer
Program translation divided four subproblems
As result translation software layered well allowing software layer designed independently
Noting way conquer complexity program translation could readily applied protocol analogy programming language protocol designer protocol suite keen imposing layering software framework
This seen layering considering translation message compiled function application layer assembled function transport layer piece linked function Internet layer together routing table link editor producing datagram passed loader fill memory location ethernet address produce network frame loaded function network interface layer physical memory transmission medium
To show closely analogy fit term parenthesis previous sentence denote relevant analog term written denote data representation
Program translation form linear sequence layer output passed input next layer
Furthermore translation process involves multiple data representation
We see thing happening protocol software multiple protocol define data representation data passed software module
The network interface layer us physical address layer use IP address
The boundary network interface layer Internet layer called
The module application layer generally considered part operating system
Passing data module much le expensive passing data application program transport layer
The boundary application layer transport layer called
Strictly adhering layered model practice known strict layering always best approach networking
Strict layering serious impact performance implementation least simplicity performance
Another perhaps important point shown considering fact protocol Internet Protocol Suite expressed using model word protocol behave way described model
To improve model offending protocol could perhaps split two protocol cost one two extra layer hidden caveat model also used provide conceptual view suite intended user
There made preciseness designer clarity intended user
There commonly reoccurring problem occur design implementation communication protocol addressed pattern several different pattern language
The first pattern language focus design protocol implementation
The others address issue either area latter
Formal method describing communication syntax standard standard
communicating machine used formally describe possible interaction protocol
For communication take place protocol agreed upon
Recall digital computing system rule expressed algorithm datastructures raising opportunity hardware independence
Expressing algorithm portable programming language make protocol software operating system independent
The source code could considered protocol specification
This form specification however suitable party involved
For one thing would enforce source party another proprietary software producer would accept
By describing software interface module paper agreeing interface implementers free way
This referred source independence
By specifying algorithm paper detailing hardware dependency unambiguous way created adhered published ensures interoperability software hardware
Such paper draft developed getting approval
To get approval paper draft need enter successfully complete
This activity referred
The member standard organization agree adhere standard voluntary basis
Often member control large relevant protocol many case standard enforced law government thought serve important public interest getting approval important protocol
It noted though case protocol standard sufficient gain widespread acceptance
sometimes source code need disclosed enforced law government interest public
The need protocol standard shown looking happened protocol BSC invented
BSC early protocol used connect two separate node
It originally intended used multinode network revealed several deficiency protocol
In absence standardization manufacturer organization felt free protocol creating incompatible version network
In case deliberately done discourage user using equipment manufacturer
There variant original protocol
One assume standard would prevented least happening
In case protocol gain market dominance without going standardization process
Such protocol referred
De facto standard common emerging market niche market market monopolized oligopolized
They hold market negative grip especially used scare away competition
From historical perspective standardization seen measure counteract de facto standard
Positive exception exist facto standard operating system like negative grip market source published maintained open way thus inviting competition
Standardization therefore solution
Some relevance communication protocol ISO ITU IEEE IETF
The IETF maintains protocol use Internet
The IEEE control many software hardware protocol electronics industry commercial consumer device
The ITU umbrella organization telecommunication engineer designing PSTN well many communication system
For standard used
The produce protocol standard Web technology
International standard organization supposed impartial local organization national commercial consider
Standards organization also research development standard future
In practice standard organization mentioned cooperate closely
The standardization process start ISO commissioning workgroup
The workgroup issue working draft discussion document interested party including standard body order provoke discussion comment
This generate lot question much discussion usually disagreement standard provide satisfy need usually
All conflicting view taken account often way compromise progress working group
The draft proposal discussed member country standard body organization within country
Comments suggestion collated national view formulated member ISO vote proposal
If rejected draft proposal consider objection create new draft proposal another vote
After lot feedback modification compromise proposal reach status ultimately
The process normally take several year complete
The original paper draft created designer differ substantially standard contain following International standard reissued periodically handle deficiency reflect changing view subject
A lesson learned predecessor Internet standardization protocol enough protocol also need framework operate
It therefore important develop framework suitable layered protocol standardization
This would prevent protocol standard overlapping functionality would allow clear definition responsibility protocol different level layer
This gave rise OSI used framework design standard protocol service conforming various layer specification
In communicating system assumed connected underlying physical medium providing basic unspecified transmission mechanism
The layer numbered one seven n layer referred n
Each layer provides service layer top application process using service layer immediately
The layer communicate mean interface called
Corresponding layer system called
To communicate two peer entity given layer use n implemented using service
When system directly connected intermediate peer entity called used
An uniquely identifies service access point
The address naming domain need restricted one layer possible use one naming domain layer
For layer two type standard protocol standard defining peer entity given layer communicate service standard defining given layer communicates layer
In original version layer functionality highest lowest layer In contrast assumes connectionless network assumed network
network suitable wide area network connectionless network suitable local area network
Using connection communicate implies form session virtual circuit hence model lacking session layer
The constituent member ISO mostly concerned wide area network development concentrated connection oriented network connectionless network mentioned addendum
At time IETF cope fact Internet needed protocol simply
As result IETF developed standardization process based rough consensus running code
The standardization process described
Nowadays IETF become standard organization protocol use Internet
extended model include connectionless service TCP IP could developed international standard
Classification scheme protocol usually focus domain use function
As example domain use used network connectionless network respectively
For example function consider used encapsulate packet protocol packet passed across transport system using protocol
A combine function domain use
The dominant layering scheme one proposed IETF ISO
Despite fact underlying assumption layering scheme different enough warrant distinguishing two common practice compare two relating common protocol layer two scheme
For example practice see
The layering scheme IETF called
The functionality layer described section overview protocol using scheme given article
The layering scheme ISO called
The functionality layer described section overview protocol using scheme given article
In networking equipment configuration distinction often drawn The term protocol strictly refers transport layer term service refers protocol utilizing protocol transport
In common case TCP UDP protocol service distinguished port number
Conformance port number voluntary content inspection system term service strictly refers port number term application often used refer protocol identified inspection signature
Protocols upon transport layer relies like distinguished address family

The feature also support interface
Although generally considered language allow method defined type
Go interface type compatible type support given set method type need explicitly implement interface
The empty interface compatible type
Note language concept also called protocol whose meaning subtly different

The ask known reply known
Both request response also data sent along
A item data server
For example blog post customer item stock news story
As business website would create read update delete part daily business
HTTP well suited
For example news site every day author would add story could update delete old become date sort
These sort method required manage content server HTTP way
This happening time browsing web every web page look delivered using HyperText Transfer Protocol
Going back shop analogy consider example time resource shown asterisk character
You Can I soda please hand shop keeper Shop Keeper Sure soda hand receipt There nine request HTTP support outlined
A GET request return text describes thing asking
Like ask soda get soda
A HEAD request return get GET request
It like You Can I soda please Shop Keeper Sure soda get What neat HTTP allows also modify content server
Say also representative soda company like shelf
A POST request allows send information direction
This request allows replace resource server one supply
These use called Uniform Resource Identifier URI
A URI unique code number resource
Confused

Internet Relay Chat IRC system let transfer message form text
It essentially chat protocol
The system us model
Clients chat program installed user computer connect central server
The client communicate message central server turn relay client

Whilst IRC may new concept group conversation online may
There really difference
Groups exist form
A server host many channel choose one join

different protocol actually enforced protocol people choose use way
To get started IRC first get client
A client program let connect
Ask teacher one use

Check teacher channel join may set one
Try thing
Look try use
What response get
Does make sense
Try one one conversation friend
If use command see
How way around
So far talked HTTP IRC
These protocol level make sure need worry data transported
Now cover data transferred reliably efficiently regardless data
Below level unreliable medium transfer wifi cable subject interference error cause concern data transportation
These protocol take different approach ensure data delivered effective efficient manner
TCP The Transmission Control Protocol one important protocol internet
It break large message
What packet
A packet segment data combined packet make total message something like HTTP request email IRC message file like picture song downloaded
For rest section look used load image website
So computer A look file take break packet
It sends packet internet computer B reassembles give back image
By probably wondering bother splitting easier send file whole
Well solves congestion
Imagine bus rush hour home
The road jammed way friend getting home time
So decide get bus go separate way
Web page like
They big travel together split sent tiny piece reassembled end
So packet go computer A computer B fine
Ha
That nice
Unfortunately simple
Through various mean problem affect packet
These problem So try fix image load bit would missing corrupted computer B might even recognise
So TCP protocol solves issue
To introduce TCP play game called
In game problem loss delay corruption move level pay attention computer try combat
Good luck trying stop message getting correctly
direct analogy TCP intended interactive simulation
The Packet Creatures TCP segment move two computer
The zone unreliable channel susceptible unreliability
That unreliability user playing game
Remember key problem topic transport level delay corruption lost packet attack
Solutions come form TCP mechanism slowly added level level
Like TCP game support packet ordering checksum shield Acks Nacks return creature timeouts
Use interactive online You also create level Packet Attack
We put level builder project section experiment different reliability combination defense
Adjust true falses number set different ability
Raising number effectively equate le reliable communication channel
Adding ability setting shield etc true make harder level beat
Let talk saw game
What level solve issue packet loss delay reordering corruption
TCP several mechanism dealing packet trouble
Why packet experience delay loss corruption
This packet sent network go various
These node effectively different router computer
One route might experience interference another causing packet loss one might faster shorter another causing order lost
Corruption happen time electronic interference
Firstly TCP start known handshake
This basically mean two computer say Hey going use TCP image
Reconstruct would
Next
Since computer look data order like like jigsaw puzzle play need way stitch packet back together
As saw delayed message ordering message may look like HELOLWOLRD
So TCP put number packet called sequence number signifies order
With put back together
It bit like print page printer see bottom
Now packet become order TCP wait packet arrive put message together
Another concept
This concept storing information data may familiar
Basically checksum detect error sometimes coding scheme correct
In case correctable packet corrected
If packet useless need resent
In game shield represent checksum
Corrupt checksum recover error using error correction
Corrupt
So packet get
TCP concept message ACK NACK short
You would seen higher level game green ACK red NACK creature going back
Acks sent let sender know packet arrives usable
Nacks sent back packet arrives damaged need resending
ACKs NACKs useful provide channel communication
If computer A receives NACK resend message
If receives Ack computer stop worrying resend
But computer send hear back
Yes
It called timeout final line defense TCP
If computer get ACK NACK back certain time resend packet
It bit like tuning class teacher keep repeating name answer
Maybe woops
Sometimes ACK might get lost packet resent timeout OK TCP recognise duplicate ignore
So TCP
A protocol put accurate data transmission efficiency speed network
It us timeouts checksum acks nacks many packet deliver message reliably
However need packet
Can get overall picture faster
Read UDP User Datagram Protocol protocol sending packet guarantee delivery
UDP guarantee lost packet duplicate packet order packet
It get bulk data
Checksums used data integrity though protection
It still protocol formal packet structure
The packet still include destination origin well size packet
So even use unreliable protocol
Yes anything important
Files message email web page text based item use TCP thing like streaming music video VOIP use UDP
Maybe call Skype poor quality
Maybe video flicker sound drop split second
That packet lost
However course get overall picture conversation successful
Let say I want write online music player
Okay I write code someone press play website song play
Do I need code protocol stream music
Fine I write UDP code
Now I need go install cable house
Sure I jump van spend week running cable house make sure packet get
No
This sound absurd
As web developer I want worry anything making music player easy use fast
I want worry UDP I want worry ethernet cable
It already done I assume taken care
And
Internet protocol exist layer
We four layer computer science internet model
The top two level discussed detail bottom two focus first layer Application Layer followed Transport Internet Link layer
At layer data made previous layer whole unit data added passed
At bottom layer Link layer added also
Below example UDP packet look like packaged transport
Footers Headers basically packet
Information information
Like letterhead footnote part content page
Headers Footers exist packet store data
Headers come data footer afterwards
You think protocol game pas parcel
When message sent HTTP wrapped TCP header wrapped header wrapped Ethernet header footer sent ethernet
At end unwrapped ethernet back IP TCP HTTP
The name packet generic term unit data
In application layer unit data called transport layer layer physical layer
Each level name unit data segment packet frame request etc however generic packet often used instead regardless layer
This system neat layer assume layer guaranteed something information layer protocol use layer role
So making website program website code worry code make site work wifi well ethernet
A similar system postal You put courier truck number front envelope
That taken care post company us system sort mail assign driver driver truck driver none need worry send receive letter use courier
The OSI internet model different model internet Computer Scientists use approach protocol design
OSI considered probably mentioned networking standard guide use computer science approach simpler however main idea layer abstraction important get across
You read difference
So TCP segment look like
As see packet divided four main part address source destination number sequence number ACK number acknowledgement flag urgent checksum header actual data
At level segment becomes data next data unit get header
TCP UDP packet number big
This number mean packet actually big like
Can think advantage small packet
How big one
Think ratio data information header footer
Here example packet trace There back packet tale Watch video online How internet work
Watch video online How internet work minute Watch video online Because textbook online easy u update
Please use form form feedback tiny obvious suggestion broad observation
We love getting positive feedback help u get support work

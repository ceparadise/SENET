Categorized Model View Controller also known MVC pattern architectural nature used specifically software engineering
This particular pattern used isolate known domain logic simply logic application user
It isolated input presentation known GUI permit independent development
Model View Presenter also known MVP direct permutation MVC
It software pattern specifically user interface design pattern designed specifically aid testing automated unit improve known separation concern presentation logic
The separation concern basically process computer program separated distinct feature overlap term function
The model portion MVC essentially pattern represents via specific domain data used allow application operate
The view portion transforms model interaction suitable user usually user interface element
Finally controller portion aptly receives input
By making decision object found model controller serf catalyst response
The model portion MVP defines data displayed acted upon user interface
The view portion display data defined model sends user prompted command known event presenter act upon data
The presenter act model view model
As capable retrieving data repository found model continuing data formatting easily displayed view
There different variant MVC
As flow control strict order First user interact interface pressing button mouse instance controller take care input event change appropriate user action
Next controller notifies model user done likely result model changing update example
The view pose question model generate user interface
Finally user interface wait instruction restart cycle
Summary
MVC architectural pattern isolates domain logic MVP descendant MVC designed help test automated unit improve separation concern

In regard MVC model represents data view transforms model user friendly interaction controller receives input regard MVP model defines data view display presenter act model view

Next build minimum viable product MVP proof concept spending lot time arguing feature include exclude MVP
Finally MVP work well plan building full mature stable product
So wrong picture
Why go wrong many startup
The problem team understand point MVP
An MVP product half feature chopped way get product door little earlier
In fact MVP product
And something build consider job done
An MVP process repeat Identify riskiest assumption find smallest possible experiment test assumption use result experiment course correct
When build product make many assumption
You assume know user looking design work marketing strategy use architecture work efficiently monetization strategy make sustainable law regulation comply
No matter good assumption wrong
The problem know one
In startup CB Insights number one cause startup failure time market Nearly half startup spent month even year building product found wrong central assumption someone interested product first place
The way find way test put product front real user quickly possible
And often find go back drawing board
In fact go back drawing board
This unique product development
When writing book essay produce many draft spend lot time editing
And writing code frequently refactor even rewrite code
Every creative human endeavor requires enormous amount
In world one find error fastest win
Some people call philosophy fail At TripAdvisor called Eric Ries called
Kent Beck programmer called
Whatever call point find assumption wrong getting feedback product real user quickly possible
Whether building product writing code coming marketing plan always asking two question Let go example
You decide build product allows restaurant owner create mobile app restaurant click
It simple drag drop interface bunch template event calendar newsletter photo gallery chat integration review site social network Google Maps
And importantly offer way make reservation place order use coupon take small cut way monetize product
This going awesome
You find friend join typical startup team raise money lock room month try build feature
If slightly savvy cut feature essential first launch able launch MVP month instead
And case likely going fail
Why
Well consider many assumption making could turn disastrously wrong Waiting month discover critical flaw long
At best losing much time enormous waste worst put company business
In word Peter Drucker There surely nothing quite useless great efficiency done Let try approach see better
We build product incrementally stage asking At beginning riskiest assumption probably restaurant owner want create mobile apps
Therefore first MVP could mockup mobile app maybe even one back restaurant napkin fitting
Go around restaurant owner neighborhood ask problem technology
Do mobile app already
If
Do want one
How tech savvy
Do understand benefit
Show mockup
Find would good solution problem
You might find enough interest restaurant owner make viable business
That shame good news cost hour conversation instead month development
On hand might find restaurant owner interested mobile apps website
That progress
But done yet
Now must repeat process build next MVP
At point probably restaurant owner would actually willing pay website
What smallest experiment test assumption
One idea next MVP may create static website hand restaurant owner expressed interest see respond
Do like
Are impressed website already done
How much would pay site launched today
Perhaps faced immediate prospect spending money find restaurant owner actually interested
Well good thing learned day work instead wasting month development
Or perhaps find willing pay
So accept payment month service cash check waste lot time building billing system launch site ask email need update website info
Yes involves lot manual effort part
No scale number customer grows
But tiny startup afraid
Scaling good problem mean built something worth scaling
But meantime need repeat MVP process one time
At point might marketing strategy work
You go around every restaurant world
What smallest experiment test assumption
Your MVP could landing page describes product show restaurant website built hand earlier let visitor provide email address interested hearing launch
You buy hundred dollar ad Google Facebook Twitter LinkedIn drive traffic landing page see happens
If potential user even give email address probably going give money either
It much easier discover tweaking text image landing page rewriting thousand line code full product
The earlier find error le time wasted building wrong thing
This nutshell MVP process
Whether developing product design marketing plan writing code always ask A hat tip John Wanamaker father modern advertising said I know half advertising dollar wasted
I know In word Fred Brooks Plan throw one away Instead spending month building flexible system generate website could get first prototype done day using free static website filling manually based information learned restaurant owner launching free static
You could even use tool like show owner often people search restaurant cuisine general area
See way drive traffic landing page
You quickly make change messaging landing page ad use testing see find resonates audience

learn share knowledge build career
If search Google using phrase What difference MVC MVP MVVM design pattern may get URL discus difference MVC MVP MVVM design pattern theoretically like Use situation binding via datacontext possible
Windows Forms perfect example
In order separate view model presenter needed
Since view directly bind presenter information must passed view via interface IView
Use situation binding via datacontext possible
Why
The various IView interface view removed mean le code maintain
Some example MVVM possible include WPF javascript project using Knockout
Use situation connection view rest program always available effectively employ MVVM MVP
This clearly describes situation web API separated data sent client browser
MVC great tool managing situation provides clear MVC framework But I found single article discus difference theoretically along sample code
It would really nice get article discus difference design pattern MVC MVP MVVM along code
I like get hand source code similar apps implemented three design pattern MVC MVP MVVM
So I go code understand one write code three design patter MVC MVP MVVM
So article exists discus code would look different design pattern MVC MVP MVVM please redirect article
good starter
In reality chosen also play large role use pattern
For example MVVM naturally suited WPF MVP work well Windows Forms
MVC speaks
Some basic difference written short Traditional MVC Similar traditional MVC Controller replaced Presenter
But Presenter unlike Controller responsible changing view well
The view usually call presenter
The difference presence View Model
It kind implementation Observer Design Pattern change model represented view well VM
Eg If slider changed model updated data may text displayed view updated well
So data binding
Great Explanation link The input directed Controller first view
That input might coming user interacting page could also simply entering specific url browser
In either case Controller interfaced kick functionality
There relationship Controller View
single controller may select different view rendered based operation executed
There one way arrow Controller View
This View knowledge reference controller
The Controller pas back Model knowledge View expected Model passed Controller serving
Now look MVP pattern
It look similar MVC except key distinction The input begin View Presenter
There mapping View associated Presenter
The View hold reference Presenter
The Presenter also reacting event triggered View aware View associated
The Presenter update View based requested action performs Model View Model aware
So MVC MVP pattern front u look MVVM pattern see difference hold The input begin View View Model
While View hold reference View Model View Model information View
This possible mapping various Views one View across technology
For example WPF View Silverlight View could share View Model
MVC old one MPV modular
Presenter mediator View Model MVVM You already binding VM UI component automated MVP Another image Thank interest question

derivation MVC used mostly building
In MVP assumes functionality
In MVP presentation logic pushed presenter
The software pattern originated early joint venture
MVP underlying programming model application development Taligent CommonPoint environment
The pattern later migrated Taligent popularized paper Taligent CTO Mike Potel
After Taligent discontinuation adapted MVP pattern form basis Smalltalk user interface framework
In began incorporating MVP documentation example user interface programming
The evolution multiple variant MVP pattern including relationship MVP design pattern MVC discussed detail article another Derek Greer
MVP user interface engineered facilitate improve presentation logic Normally view implementation concrete presenter object providing reference
The following code demonstrates simple view constructor implement interface The degree logic permitted view varies among different implementation
At one extreme view entirely passive forwarding interaction operation presenter
In formulation user trigger event method view nothing invoke method presenter parameter return value
The presenter retrieves data view method defined view interface
Finally presenter operates model update view result operation
Other version allow latitude respect class handle particular interaction event command
This often suitable architecture view executes client browser may best place handle particular interaction command
From layering point view presenter class might considered belonging system also seen presenter layer application layer layer
The environment support MVP pattern much like development environment
The model presenter class used support multiple interface Web application application application
The presenter get set information view interface accessed interface view component
In addition manually implementing pattern framework may used support MVP pattern automated fashion
Below list framework platform
In application MVP pattern used letting user interface class implement view interface
The approach used Java application since modern Java Web framework allow development logic using component approach thick client
Implementing MVP requires component implement view interface
The approach possible using Web framework
MVP implemented Java SE AWT Swing application using framework
Java framework include following As flexible runtime environment wide possibility approach application logic
A great example MVP pattern implementation implementing rich presenter layer view layer templating system
Implementation model layer left end application programmer
PHP framework include following

A capture idea represents entity relationship
A conceptual model field special case general
To distinguish type model also known
Conceptual modeling confused modeling discipline physical modelling
The conceptual model explicitly chosen independent design implementation concern example concurrency data storage
The aim conceptual model express meaning term concept used domain expert discus problem find correct relationship different concept
The conceptual model attempt clarify meaning various usually ambiguous term ensure problem different interpretation term concept occur
Such differing interpretation could easily cause confusion amongst stakeholder especially responsible designing implementing solution conceptual model provides key artifact business understanding clarity
Once domain concept modeled model becomes basis subsequent development application domain
The concept conceptual model mapped physical design implementation construct using either manual
The realization conceptual model many domain combined coherent platform
A conceptual model described using various notation object modelling
In UML notation conceptual model often described represent concept represent relationship concept association represent role type taken instance modelled concept various situation
In ER notation conceptual model described ER Diagram entity represent concept represent relationship concept
Regardless notation used important compromise richness clarity business meaning depicted conceptual model expressing directly form influenced design implementation concern
This often used defining different process particular company institute

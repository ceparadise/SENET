The term frequently misunderstood mean different thing different vendor
It frequently used connection Oracle database implementation
In general describes complete database environment including RDBMS software table structure stored procedure functionality
Database administrator might create multiple instance database different purpose
For example organization employee database might three different instance production used contain live data used test new functionality prior release production development used database developer create new functionality
If Oracle database know database instance mean specific thing
While database includes application data metadata stored physical file server instance combination software memory used access data
For example sign Oracle database login session instance
If log shut computer instance disappears database data remain intact
An Oracle instance access one database time Oracle database accessed multiple instance
A SQL Server instance usually mean specific installation SQL Server
It database rather software used create database
Maintaining multiple instance might useful managing server resource instance configured memory CPU individual database within SQL Server instance
It may also useful think instance context database scheme
The scheme metadata defines database design data organized
This includes table column rule govern data
For instance employee table database might column name address employee ID job description
This structure scheme database
An instance database snapshot actual content given time including data relationship data database

Whether pro newbie wise look resume sample designed industry mind
There hundred choose studying example help craft version document
So review sure note best format important information include mistake avoid
In addition resume sample also find instruction help create section summary statement work experience skill section
As computer science resume sample indicate two basic way organize resume chronological functional format
The chronological configuration record work history training education everything else reverse chronological order recent experience farthest past
The functional arrangement though necessarily ordered date
Instead format focused highlighting important applicable quality relate position youre applying
For part chronological arrangement widely used one people use format tend individual specifically followed traditional career path
On hand individual functional arrangement may fitting necessarily set pursuing career industry nonetheless experience capability satisfy occupation obligation
The functional resume format adaptable chronological one since explain experience accomplishment qualify position youre seeking

To write find organization main goal objective think utilize aptitude capability assist company meeting objective
This help make connection employer need also serf testament work ethic showing took extra time research company
Studied dignified computer science professor established following thorough discipline practice programming looking new academic opportunity

In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

I get long
Any alternative word similar easier understand
For explain instance
instance like example normal people world
I ca understand I even got meaning
instance best understood relates class programming
Classes used define property behavior thing

A Car class might dictate car defined make model year mileage
But cant provide specific particular car example Chevy Impala mile uncle Mickey drive create instance Car
It capture detailed information one particular Car
An object object reference object
Here pretty standard definition An instance programming OOP specific realization object
An object may varied number way
Each realized variation object instance
The creation realized instance called instantiation
Each time program run instance program
In language create object class object instantiation class
That member given class specified value rather variable
In context could think dog class particular dog instance class
Here good conversation instance may help An instance basically object
In actual english mean differently
In case instance english mean Refer
These object instance programming also reference source code
Going outside world programming second know people
You instance class people I talk people general class object I specific one mind I talk instance
An instance property automatically consequence member class
All human heart human name date birth
I hope clear bit
Loosely speaking making thing pattern
A class pattern creating object
The object created instance class
A function template pattern creating function
The function created instance template
This usually done implicitly referred implicit instantiation
A class template pattern creating class
The class created instance template
simple example blueprint class represents student object field like name age course class member
And student Foo Bob
So Foo Bob different instance class Student class represent object Student people
far understood instance pointer object class
p could wrong
To understand instance must first understand class
A simply modeling tool provided programming language use representing real world object program application
The class structured accommodate object member variable member
An hand simply variation object created class
You create object variant using method within class specifically defined purpose
Consider Car wanted represent application would define class identified Car contains property car operation car perform
It would look something close supposing done Java programming language Create instance car BMW instance car
Instance hold memory address Object

learn share knowledge build career
What problem
Why important topic computer science
stand time
This mean problem solved Polynomial time using Turing machine like regular Turing machine also including choice function
Basically solution poly time
If case known NP problem solved using given problem modified input NP problem given problem problem NP complete
The main thing take away problem solved polynomial time known way
way showing certain class problem solvable realistic time
Edit As others noted often approximation solution problem
In case approximation solution usually give approximation bound using special notation tell u close approximation
NP set question answer polynomial time O n problem size constant
Polynomial time sometimes used definition
P set decision problem
Since solved polynomial time also verified polynomial time
Therefore P subset NP
A problem x NP also every problem NP quickly ie
polynomial time transformed x
In word So make interesting one problem solved quickly problem solved quickly
See also post problem least hard hardest problem NP
Note problem also
However problem NP even decision problem despite prefix
That NP mean
Yes confusing usage entrenched unlikely change
mean something specific careful get definition wrong
First NP problem problem A problem X If X deterministic algorithm exists solve instance X correctly problem NP solved reduction X
So far nobody come deterministic algorithm nobody proven one exist million buck anyone either
That mean ca solve particular instance problem
It mean ca something work reliably instance problem way could reliably sort list integer
You might well able come algorithm work well practical instance problem
If looking example problem I suggest take look
The basic premise expression way saying series expression joined ORs must true The problem find solution satisfy expression exactly booleans match A solution one might
However algorithm discovered solve problem general case polynomial time
What mean best way solve problem essentially brute force try different combination find one work
What special problem ANY problem reduced problem
This mean find algorithm solve problem get mention respect admiration computer scientist mathematician around world
class problem
The class consists problem solvable
For example could solved O n constant k size input
Simply put write program run time
The class consists problem polynomial time
That given potential solution could check given solution correct polynomial time
Some example Boolean Satisfiability problem problem
There many problem known class NP
mean problem hard problem NP
It important computer science proven problem NP another problem
That mean solution one problem solution NP problem
Many algorithm security depends fact known solution exist NP hard problem
It would definitely significant impact computing solution found
Basically world problem categorized Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Unsolvable Problem Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Intractable Problem Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The first one solution problem
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The second need exponential time O n
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The third called NP
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The fourth easy problem
P refers solution problem Polynomial Time
NP refers Polynomial Time yet find solution
We sure Polynomial Time solution provide solution solution verified Polynomial Time
NP Complete refers Polynomial Time still yet find solution verified Polynomial Time
The problem NPC NP difficult problem prove P solution NPC problem NP problem found P solution
NP Hard refers Polynomial Time yet find solution sure able verified Polynomial Time
NP Hard problem surpasses NPC difficulty
It class problem must simulate every possibility sure optimal solution
There lot good heuristic problem educated guess best
Honestly might best place look answer
If NP P solve hard problem much faster thought could
If solve one problem P polynomial time applied problem category
We need separate algorithm problem
We write algorithm solve problem scale certain way
Although simplification let label algorithm scaling good enough
It helpful know thing problem trying solve rather algorithm use solve
So say problem algorithm P
And one algorithm NP
That mean lot simple problem NP write bad algorithm solve easy problem
It would good know problem NP really tricky one want say one found good algorithm
After I could come problem call X I think need algorithm
I tell world best algorithm I could come solve X scale badly I think X really tough problem
But tomorrow maybe somebody cleverer invents algorithm solves X So good definition hard problem
All lot problem NP nobody know good algorithm
So I could X certain sort problem one good algorithm solve X could used roundabout way give good algorithm problem NP
Well people might bit convinced X genuinely tricky problem
And case call X
There good explains problem
The first minute mainly boolean algebra
So jump right beginning minute interested concept P NP boolean satisfiability problem reduction
The definition NP complete problem correct I thought I might wax lyrical philosophical importance nobody addressed issue yet
Almost complex problem come NP Complete
There something fundamental class seems computationally different easily solvable problem
They sort flavour hard recognise
This basically mean moderately complex algorithm impossible solve exactly scheduling optimising packing covering etc
But lost problem encounter NP Complete
There vast technical field people study approximation algorithm give guarantee close solution NP complete problem
Some incredibly strong guarantee example get guarantee really obvious algorithm
Even better reality strong heuristic excel giving great answer guarantee
problem
Note two famous problem graph isomorphism factoring known P NP
I heard explanation probably one enigmatic idea study algorithm
NP stand nondeterministic polynomial time name called complexity class problem belong
The important thing complexity class problem within class polynomial time algorithm
As example consider problem counting stuff
Suppose bunch apple table
The problem How many apple
You provided possible answer
You verify answer polynomial time using algorithm duh counting apple
Counting apple happens O n notation time take one step count apple
For n apple need n step
This problem NP complexity class
A problem classified shown polynomial time
Without going deeply discussion suffice say certain problem polynomial time solution found
That take something like n
n factorial step solve
However given solution problem verify polynomial time
A classic example problem The Traveling Salesman Problem
The author ApoxyButt From problem set problem reduced polynomial time whose solution may still verified polynomial time
That NP problem transformed problem
Informally problem NP problem least tough problem NP
Decision Problem A called NP complete following two property Some Ex NP problem one computer algorithm verifies solution created polynomial time
problem NP also solve polynomial time called P NP problem So get crackin

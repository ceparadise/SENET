keywords user acceptance design interaction system technology acceptance innovation diffusion usability utility acceptability computer model
Understanding factor influence user acceptance information technology interest researcher variety field well procurer technology large organization
The present chapter review literature demonstrates nature technological acceptance mediated distinct factor group related psychology user design process information technology quality technology user term
It concluded current research offer insight support derivation reliable prediction user acceptance
However potentially overlapping theory seem exist independently exists scope unifying framework extend innovation diffusion concept system design model particularly design formal theory user acceptance information technology
While million dollar spent information technology US last year recent debate extent expenditure produced benefit business academia LANDAUER
At least part debate revolves around issue whether information technology actually accepted intended user
Without acceptance discretionary user seek alternative even dedicated user likely manifest dissatisfaction perform inefficient manner negating many presumed benefit new technology EASON
In present chapter review treatment issue user acceptance applies information technology design implementation
In draw literature distinct area innovation diffusion technology design implementation interaction HCI information system IS concept acceptance explicitly tackled
While much published material address issue design evaluation system enhance usability primary focus attempt made present chapter produce design guideline review user interface evaluation study
SHNEIDERMAN offer excellent introduction
Instead review concentrate determinant user acceptance resistance concept addressed theoretically empirically scientific literature information technology design use
Specifically present review emphasize literature seek indicate researcher developer may predict level acceptance information technology attain
For present purpose user acceptance defined demonstrable willingness within user group employ information technology task designed support
Thus concept applied situation user claim employ without providing evidence use use technology purpose unintended designer procurer using Internet connection personal entertainment work situation
Obviously degree fuzziness since actual usage always likely deviate slightly idealized planned usage essence acceptance theory deviation significant process user acceptance information technology intended purpose modeled predicted
Lack user acceptance significant impediment success new information system GOULD ET AL NICKERSON
In fact user often unwilling use information system used would result impressive performance gain ALAVI HENDERSON SWANSON
Therefore user acceptance viewed pivotal factor determining success failure information system project DAVIS
Both practitioner researcher strong interest understanding people accept information technology better method designing evaluating predicting user respond new technology developed
Although practically intertwined design evaluation logically independent issue noted DILLON remains open question many instance translate usability evaluation result specific interface design improvement
Acceptance theory seek extend traditional model design espoused usability engineering approach NIELSEN question interface improvement towards prediction likely usage
Historically developer procurer new technology may able rely authority ensure technology used least context though even much maligned scientific management TAYLOR appealed motivational power financial reward encouraging worker use tool designed way told
However current working practice well leisure educational application information technology render search predictive measure acceptance acute
As technological use spread across society organization become dependent information technology concern designing information system used appropriately grows
Researchers studied range issue related topic individual user characteristic cognitive style HUBER internal belief impact usage behavior DESANCTIS FUERST CHENEY GINZBERG IVES ET AL SRINIVASAN SWANSON
Acceptance viewed function user involvement system development BARKI HARTWICK FRANZ ROBEY HARTWICK BARKI measure political climate organization MARKUS
The type system development process used ALAVI process technology implemented diffused BRANCHEAU WETHERBE FICHMAN MOORE BENBASAT also explored
None variable account sufficient variance acceptance enable researcher procurer designer predict user acceptance reliably
The search answer unlikely yield explanation level acceptance information technology receive among intended user
However distinct trend literature suggest issue intractable several cluster determining variable proposed
This literature diverse emerging distinct discipline
Though THOMPSON covered tangentially related work heading technology utilization Vol
first ARIST chapter information technology acceptance
Thus appropriate tackle topic manner affords reader insight range perspective converge problem well precise empirical finding date
At highest level acceptance subsumed theoretical analysis innovation diffusion appropriate start coverage topic
However precise analysis user acceptance become central concern discipline studying information technology particular rather general technological innovation
This work concentrate directly determinant importance user acceptance rather broad issue social diffusion major focus present chapter
More one theoretical approach necessary complete understanding issue involved clarity approach treated independently outset
Perhaps principal theoretical perspective technology acceptance innovation diffusion theory applied individual ROGERS organizational ZALTMAN ET level analysis
Its primary intention provide account manner technological innovation move stage invention widespread use
Though concerned information technology exclusively diffusion theory offer conceptual framework discussing acceptance global level
Diffusion theory posit five characteristic innovation affect diffusion relative advantage extent technology offer improvement currently available tool compatibility consistency social practice norm among user complexity ease use learning trialability opportunity try innovation committing use observability extent technology output gain clear see
Each characteristic insufficient predict either extent rate diffusion diffusion study demonstrated innovation affording advantage compatibility existing practice belief low complexity potential trialability observability extensively rapidly diffused innovation cluster opposite characteristic ROGERS
An early innovation diffusion literature found three characteristic greatest influence adoption compatibility relative advantage positively related innovation adoption p complexity negatively related adoption marginally significant p level TORNATZKY KLEIN
However author criticized current conceptualization construct
Relative advantage particular cited especially ambiguous criterion used judge advantageous often defined innovation could advantageous cost le le complex
In examining extending characteristic context specific information technology IT MOORE BENBASAT report extensive effort develop instrument used evaluate user perception IT innovation
Their result suggest important perceived characteristic IT innovation affect decision regarding use voluntariness use image degree use innovation perceived enhance one image status one social system relative advantage compatibility ease use trialability result demonstrability visibility
These result lend least partial support ROGERS factor add important emphasis variable related discretion ease use
Innovation diffusion theory suggests factor level individual user also important
ROGERS divide technology innovation adopter five category depending speed uptake innovator early adopter early majority late majority laggard
Such distinction could seen somewhat fuzzy least distribution time could divided
However Rogers plot category normal distribution major category innovator early adopter combined one purpose represents standard deviation dispersion
Accordingly division early late majority mean laggard late adopter constituting population
On basis Rogers estimate early adopter innovator jointly make total population
Early adopter disproportionate influence adoption technology profiling study category revealed number personality adventure seeking socioeconomic wealth education variable supposedly distinguish member
This approach seems direct relevance study IT acceptance organization
BRANCHEAU WETHERBE showed cumulative adoption distribution spreadsheet use closely follows sigmoidal curve predicted innovation diffusion theory
Thus organization evaluating technology use organization must cognizant user base tool designed purchased
For tool used throughout organization reasonable expect protracted period time may required user speed use tool effectively
Understanding user likely laggard important intervention strategy extended training designed user mind
Recent research attempted extend diffusion theory complex adoption scenario
For example managerial influence organization encourage discourage acceptance explicitly expressed preference mandate DESCHAMPS MOORE BENBASAT reward system incentive
Thus study examine acceptance level organization need account potential importance managerial influence
The innovation diffusion approach seems useful area computing EUC within IS literature many theoretically strong EUC study BRANCHEAU WETHERBE MOORE BENBASAT individual level BROWN BOSTROM organizational level based theory innovation diffusion
In fact review analysis EUC literature BRANCHEAU BROWN suggest innovation diffusion promising basis future EUC research
While diffusion theory provides context one may examine uptake impact information technology time provides little explicit treatment user acceptance
Its direct link would appear area innovation characteristic may drive individual adoption decision perceived complexity compatibility etc
particular IT innovation positioning planned marketing technology specific group organization ROGERS
As researcher seek identify factor determine user acceptance information technology particular factor influenced design question acceptance come tackled directly researcher working outside least outskirt classical innovation diffusion tradition
Most noticeably researcher field interaction management information system MIS drawn heavily theoretical work social cognitive psychology well sociology studying user acceptance
For purpose clarity distinction drawn theoretical approach seeking understand social psychological determinant user acceptance individual level seeking understand user acceptance term design implementation process new technology
Acceptance conceptualized outcome variable psychological process user go making decision technology
In literature little emphasis placed design usable interface researcher area system design including user interface task supported practical purpose fixed
Instead research seek understand dynamic human decision making context accepting resisting technology
Much work come field Management Information Systems MIS research seek predict user organization react new technology
Drawing work social psychologist concerned human action research offer explicit treatment acceptance issue utilizing construct theoretical approach typically cited innovation diffusion literature
FISHBEIN AJZEN Theory Reasoned Action TRA social psychology literature see Figure defines relationship belief attitude norm intention behavior
According theory individual behavior use rejection technology determined one intention perform behavior intention influenced jointly individual attitude subjective norm defined person perception people important think perform behavior question Fishbein Ajzen italicized comment added
According TRA attitude toward behavior determined belief consequence behavior affective evaluation consequence
Beliefs defined individual subjective probability performing given behavior result given consequence
Affective evaluation implicit evaluative response FISHBEIN AJZEN consequence thus attitude construct TRA general nature anchored given belief set
This approach represents information processing view attitude formation change state external stimulus influence attitude change person belief structure AJZEN FISHBEIN
Figure
Theory Reasoned Action FISHBEIN AJZEN However attitude alone solely determine behavioral intention
Intentions determined also subjective norm turn determined individual normative belief motivation comply perceived norm
The end result generalized model understanding determinant human behavior situation people may exert choice
The model used make accurate prediction human choice situation diverse voting election BOWMAN FISHBEIN consumption alcoholic beverage SCHLEGEL ET
In examining application TRA SHEPPARD ET AL
found theory performed extremely well prediction choice among alternative
They concluded theory exceptionally robust offered strong predictive utility even used investigate situation activity falling outside original boundary condition theory predicting nonvoluntary behavior intention assessed even subject information necessary form completely confident intention
While TRA general model applicable many area number MIS specific model derived TRA
Of model widely cited DAVIS Technology Acceptance Model TAM see Figure
The goal TAM predict information system acceptance diagnose design problem user experience system
TAM predicts user acceptance technology determined two factor perceived usefulness perceived ease use
Within TAM perceived usefulness U defined degree user belief using system enhance performance
Perceived ease use EOU defined degree user belief using system free effort
Both U EOU specific perception anchored specific belief user hold system
According TAM U EOU significant impact user attitude toward using system A defined feeling favorableness unfavorableness toward system
Thus attitude general construct tied specific belief technology
Behavioral intention use system BI modeled function A BI determines actual use
Research consistently shown BI strongest predictor actual use DAVIS ET TAYLOR TODD
Figure Acceptance Model DAVIS ET AL There several interesting difference TAM TRA
First DAVIS ET AL explicitly drop subjective norm model arguing subjective norm construct
They explain subjective norm may important setting empirical work validating TAM found important predictor intention
Davis et al explain technology studied personal individual nature use technology dependent others use technology system usage likely driven social influence
Another important difference TAM proposes direct path perceived usefulness intention violating TRA show attitude completely mediating relationship belief intention
According DAVIS ET AL work environment intention use IT may based anticipated impact job performance regardless individual overall attitude toward system
In word even though employee may dislike system employee may still use system perceived increase job performance thus high perceived usefulness
A final note interest regarding TAM divergence TRA direct effect EOU U
In word faced two system offering identical functionality user find easier one useful
DAVIS state user becomes productive via enhancement become productive overall
The converse U influence EOU hold however
Thus theoretical perspective perceived ease use influence perceived usefulness vice versa
In work validating TAM DAVIS ET AL
found stronger relationship perceived usefulness U intention use perceived ease use EOU intention
The relationship EOU intention largely mediated U
In comparing TAM TRA DAVIS found TAM better predictor based amount variance explained intention use particular software package reporting Time immediately introduction software Time week later
These figure compared TRA Time Time respectively
DAVIS report similar result looking different technology removing behavioral intention model
TAM found extremely robust replicated using different task ADAMS ET MATHIESON
In comparison several model Mathieson found TAM predicted intention use spreadsheet package better alternative model
In another comparison theoretical model TAYLOR TODD found TAM provided good fit data use computing resource center accounting variance behavior variance intention variance attitude
In another study examining efficacy TAM ADAMS ET AL
suggested U EOU may change time perception EOU may develop prolonged usage
STRAUB ET AL
supported validity perceived usefulness perceived ease use construct finding TAM measure explained variance system usage
However objective measure use TAM variable explained variance suggesting factor may significant predictor system usage
While STRAUB ET AL
suggest specific factor may important Adams et TOPI suggested user experience system may one factor substantial influence others suggested HILL ET WOOD BANDURA important antecedent individual behavior
However area remains relatively unexplored
While Theory Reasoned Action TRA widely used theory examining user acceptance theoretical perspective also used
The Theory Planned Behavior TPB AJZEN descendant TRA add third antecedent intention perceived behavioral control TRA model
Perceived behavioral control determined availability skill resource opportunity well perceived importance skill resource opportunity achieve outcome
Perceived behavioral control viewed close BANDURA belief concept Ajzen
TPB hold attitude subjective norm perceived behavioral control direct determinant intention turn influence behavior
TPB illustrated Figure
Figure
Theory Planned Behavior AJZEN In attempting apply TPB like TRA generalized model Decomposed Theory Planned Behavior TAYLOR TODD also examined IS literature attempt identify model specific antecedent attitude subjective norm perceived behavioral control relevant IT use
Taylor Todd suggest perceived usefulness perceived ease use compatibility antecedent attitude largely consistent TAM
In addition suggest peer influence superior influence antecedent subjective norm
Finally model condition technology facilitating condition determinant perceived behavioral control
While extensively studied TAM literature provides several test TPB
However result somewhat mixed
MATHIESON tested TAM TPB found TPB predictive user intention provide complete explanation intention TAM
In addition Mathieson noted TAM easier apply
TAYLOR TODD tested decomposed version TPB discussed found TAM slightly better predictor usage decomposed TPB model provided complete albeit slight understanding determinant intention TPB TAM
The author note choosing TAM decomposed TPB moderate increase explanatory power intention versus added complexity difficult one
The decomposed TPB add seven variable increase predictive power behavior TAM
However decomposed TPB also help researcher better understand role subjective norm perceived behavioral control absent TAM
Taylor Todd conclude goal predict IT usage TAM may better however goal better understand specific determinant intention decomposed TPB may offer additional explanatory power
Thus Theory Reasoned Action derivative specifically Technology Acceptance Model Theory Planned Behavior provide useful robust composite perspective issue technology acceptance
These theoretical approach provided important contribution MIS research stream additional study attempting build existing body knowledge area
VENKATESH DAVIS
Other theorist proposed psychological variable influence acceptance independently TAM TRB framework
For example IGBERIA demonstrates importance experience acceptance IT TORKZADEH DWYER suggest basis data user training influence acceptance impacting satisfaction user confidence
Clearly vast range variable could correlate acceptance theoretical guidance required make sense important one indicate influence operates
In system implementation research ALAVI JOACHIMSTHALER develop framework suggesting individual user factor relevant issue acceptance cognitive style personality demographic variable
Cognitive style historically proven controversial variable theoretical applied literature psychology HCI IS research
In general cognitive style refers characteristic way individual process use information GOLDSTEIN BLACKMAN seen human information processing term stable pattern handling incoming stimulus formulating response
Cognitive style theorist posit dimension upon individual placed according characteristic pattern information processing
To date one hundred different dimension found literature although core cluster account majority work topic
For example Type Indicator MBTI MYERS based Jungian construct consists four scale designed measure dimension
Despite interest among researcher potential explanatory power variable serious doubt efficacy MBTI suggested empirical testing shown justified ALAVI JOACHIMSTHALER HUBER
Personality refers cognitive affective structure maintained individual facilitate adjustment event people situation GINGRAS GOUGH
Personality trait suggested impact IT acceptance include need achievement degree defensiveness locus control dogmatism propensity GINGRAS ZMUD
Many personality construct currently found literature closely resemble cognitive style dimension suggesting general blurring distinction term literature
A number demographic variable including age education also studied shown context influence system use BENBASAT DEXTER MOCK ET TAYLOR
Certainly little surprise age education influence use technology within broad parameter relationship strong enough account even variance user response
ALAVI JOACHIMSTHALER include class variable term variable include training experience user involvement correlate well acceptance new technology
In found broad group factor important individual difference variable
These result supported GUIMARAES ET found characteristic decision maker including organizational level experience technology explained variance measure overall satisfaction satisfaction perceived benefit technology
They also found characteristic implementation process including user involvement training top management support similar factor ALAVI JOACHIMSTHALER explained significant amount variance measure taken overall satisfaction satisfaction perceived benefit technology
RAMAMURTHY ET AL
examined class variable term user specific characteristic link user effectiveness technology
In model variable suggested affect user performance technology include domain expertise operationalized education LUCAS LUSK domain experience TAYLOR WHITE system experience FUERST CHENEY SANDERS COURTNEY gender DAMBROT ET PARASURAMAN IGBARIA intelligence CHERVANY DICKSON
Ramamurthy et al
also include cognitive style personality important predictor technology performance consistent ALAVI JOACHIMSTHALER discussed earlier
In study RAMAMURTHY et al
found domain expertise system experience intelligence gender important influence among one dimension technology effectiveness measured performance efficiency tool user satisfaction
Interestingly among cognitive style dimension sensing thinking type outperformed intuitive feeling type
Finally among personality dimension introvert performed better extrovert efficiency dimension difference performance satisfaction
Thus clear stream research examined influence individual psychological variable user performance acceptance technology lends support idea user situational variable important determinant
There parallel innovation diffusion literature examined characteristic inherent tool innovation role technology acceptance
Clearly individual characteristic important however dearth theoretical model link perspective understanding nature technology acceptance
While finding user acceptance psychological construct shed light force determine individual behavior enable researcher predict accuracy user respond given application need address acceptance outset technology development prior investing development cost
Furthermore even individual user acceptance could assessed clear implementation use issue organizational level composite individual utility ease use rating EASON

However system approach pivotal shifting technology design away financial technical concern manifest traditional software development model waterfall model BOEHM towards perspective
In studying technology acceptance theorist EASON conceptualize acceptance term two competing force control enhancement
Control factor impose rule structure upon user thereby removing autonomy control action
According thinker working group autonomy encouraged since considered increase satisfaction performance
Among control issue raised respect technology design access reliability confidentiality monitoring pacing stress social contact
Low high presence certain factor low reliability high pacing introduction new technology likely reduce user perception control thus increase risk resistance
Enhancement factor include sense mastery growth knowledge discretion ability act informally requirement certain skill enabling worker cooperation
These factor maximized appropriate context though skill requirement inherent certain situation
A technology designed support factor likely increase user acceptance organization
Supporting evidence specific effect control enhancement variable acceptance information technology scarce though factor propose specific path research
thinker tend emphasize part holistic view organizational impact information technology must managed throughout design process
In proposing autonomy growth job satisfaction important value emphasis placed user participation design process task analysis usability evaluation planned introduction
Case study design introduction mark typical analysis information technology KLEIN EASON MARKUS rendering specific individual weighting control enhancement factor problematic
Recently HARTWICK BARKI reviewed research user participation concluded low correlation participation use mean
They proposed concept psychological involvement intervening variable relationship suggesting avenue research
While perspective gained currency literature several related approach design warrant mention
Though many share much basic emphasis organizational fit stakeholder influence acceptance frequently presented distinct approach literature
Perceived shortcoming treatment power relationship socio technical theory led emergence termed Scandinavian BAECKER ET AL Collective Resources Approach EHN

HCI research concentrated heavily concept usability term definition measurement DILLON NIELSEN
Though equivalent concept acceptance HCI researcher assume usable technology made greater chance proving acceptable user
To end many HCI researcher emphasize employing technique similar theorist user participation rapid prototyping interface use focus group trying design usable system GOULD thus blurring distinction many social science engineering research tradition interest developing humanly acceptable system
The concept usability evolved several stage definition
Though one may trace use back DE QUINCEY modern application information technology initially equated idea designing ease use HANSEN
Hence one may find definition usability term equivalent semantic expression user friendly STEVENS DU BOULAY ET AL
relationship presence absence certain interface feature window icon menu pointer SHNEIDERMAN
Neither approach proved sufficiently satisfactory given finding industrial practice DILLON ET AL
contextual dependency usability WHITESIDE ET AL
Recently probably field close link engineering manufacturing industry operational definition replaced semantic definition draft international standard usability proposed
According ISO pt
usability application refers effectiveness efficiency satisfaction specific user performing specific task specific environment use application
Such definition seen providing target set designer meet given context shift focus interface creation evaluation seeking understand usability
Consequently researcher developed tool measurement technique response definition supposedly enable usability engineering approach put practice throughout product development cycle BEVAN MACLEOD NIELSEN
One researcher make explicit link usability acceptability SHACKEL
According formulation acceptable system one appropriately satisfies requirement user utility usability cost
Utility refers range function provided technology activity enable user perform
Note utility construed DAVIS construct perceived usefulness outlined earlier chapter
Users may rate utility high intended use rating may equate objective measure utility derived formal task analysis DRURY ET AL
although context would almost certainly close correspondence
Usability refers extent user employ function effective efficient satisfactory manner cost
For one user organization variable may made user might willing sacrifice cost saving greater usability others might consider usability lesser importance compared financial outlay utility
Such conceptualization pose potential problem evaluation organizational term since end user frequently purchaser
As result perception cost impact acceptability equation likely drawn people providing measure usability perhaps even utility
Reconciling difference may prove problematic theoretically exists strong point contact usability engineering approach design
Furthermore differentiation data source suggests potential incommensurability usability engineering MIS approach acceptance
However operational definition usability framed within acceptability equation kind advocated SHACKEL offer pragmatic approach tackling acceptability
By performing task analysis agreeing utility need provided within system testing people use effectiveness efficiency satisfaction measure HCI approach provide mean measuring predicting acceptability explicitly
Within mainstream usability engineering pragmatic concern tend drive research base
This seen recent attempt understand relative value user based test expert evaluation NIELSEN usability evaluation term product development cost BIAS MAYHEW recently debate number user one need reliably identify problem system LEWIS VIRZI
LANDAUER make case extending type research arguing offer best hope advancing field technology design yield acceptable system
Usability engineering specialist like theorist seek influence complete process design approach somewhat distinct term relative emphasis place physical conceptual design interface
Although usability literature make reference organizational level issue GOULD major focus research recommendation design tend concentrate method technique developing user interface
This relationship inverted literature interface issue tend relegated hence attempt theorist EASON SHACKEL reconcile two
It concluded social scientist HCI researcher concerned user acceptance design stand opposition traditional information technology design practice
In many way design method form continuum technology centered designer methodologists existing extreme
BOEHM proposed spiral model software design stand sharp relief waterfall model place strong emphasis prototyping two major characteristic usability engineering method
Furthermore structured design method Structured Systems Analysis Design Methodology SSADM CUTTS Jackson Systems Design JSD JACKSON supposedly rigorous method ensuring logical design modified incorporate technique DAMODARAN case SSADM LIM ET case JSD user acceptance might directly tackled although success approach remains seen
The question user acceptance concern researcher procurer wish predict candidate technology prove suitable organization given design likely received user
As issue draw multiple theoretical perspective research topic diverse change management organization human attitude formation system analysis user interface design technology diffusion
Innovation diffusion theory provides general framework within social impact technology modeled seek provide insight characteristic group adopt technology different phase characteristic inherent technology may influence specific group adopt
However predicting one group user receive new technology province diffusion theory question better tackled within specific framework provided TAM
In seeking influence design technology maximize acceptance organizational analysis approach system theory enable planning work activity around technology manner minimizes resistance ideally maximizes potential user satisfaction development
Of many theory domain appears much overlap term socio technical system thinking generically applicable title commonality
Finally usability engineering affords mean factoring acceptance design interface user technology
By articulating concept least partially operationalized form usability engineering work field HCI offer pragmatic technique maximizing chance acceptability interface system individual user
Clearly approach offer something understanding issue user acceptance
At time appears little hope overarching theory encompass explanation prediction user acceptance well providing tool ensuring design process lead acceptable product
However terrain mapped research yield type answer still sought
In particular direct mapping TAM operational definition usability utility manifest HCI literature would useful clear whether HCI definition usability decomposed version TAM ease use
Clearly TAM offer tight theoretical linkage construct shown play important role user acceptance
However degree theoretical outline play important role actually guiding system design evaluated
On hand HCI conceptualization product acceptability usability grounded practice appears theoretical relationship usability element effectiveness efficiency satisfaction resolved
In part requires detailed examination extent three component ISO definition equally important
Certainly issue deserve direct empirical examination appears little evidence anyone tackled yet
This certainly fruitful area research
At extreme research negotiation criterion acceptability among participant organizational design context power structure technical competency mixed would also insightful go way bridge usability engineering acceptance predictability paradigm
Ideally theory inform practice vice versa thus understanding practical well theoretical problem associated technology acceptance remain important research domain

Index Terms User acceptance theory model user resistance user adoption Despite significant investment information technology developed nation recent decade concern exists extent expenditure produced intended benefit
At least part concern based around issue whether information technology accepted intended user
Human factor professional interested understanding determinant acceptance ensuring new design built implemented minimize resistance
This concern extended traditional ergonomic concern usability ability use cover acceptance willingness use
User acceptance defined demonstrable willingness within user group employ information technology task designed support
Thus acceptance theorist le concerned unintended us use technology interested understanding factor influencing adoption technology planned user degree choice
By developing testing model force shaping user acceptance human factor researcher seek influence process design implementation manner minimize risk resistance rejection user
The scientific concern user acceptance comparatively recent since traditionally developer procurer new technology could rely authority ensure technology used least many context
However current working practice well large market leisure educational application information technology enabled greater discretion among user thus increasing need determine dynamic acceptance
The literature acceptance broad ranging case study accepted technology individual psychological characteristic acceptor resistor see Dillon Morris detailed review various theory model user acceptance
Each facet literature provide u understanding make user accept reject system since issue complex unlikely explanation derived level acceptance information technology receive among intended user
For present purpose make sense consider evidence characteristic accepted rejected technology separately evidence characteristic accepting rejecting user reviewing interplay factor current model acceptance
According Rogers innovation diffusion theory five characteristic technology determine acceptance Numerous diffusion study demonstrated innovation affording relative advantage compatibility existing practice belief low complexity potential trialability observability extensively rapidly accepted innovation opposite characteristic
In particular three characteristic seem greatest influence relative advantage compatibility lack complexity
While diffusion model broad appeal concern characteristic Rogers list loosely defined provide sound basis complete theory
The importance complexity trialability long raised HCI Interaction literature concept find resonance literature usability user evaluation Nielsen
Usability frequently linked certain quality user interface control designer HCI professional place great emphasis ensuring systematic usability evaluation user operate technology effectively efficiently satisfactorily
However HCI research concentrated le directly concept acceptability adoption new technology making plausible assumption usability prerequisite acceptance
Shackel one HCI researcher make explicit link usability acceptability
According formulation acceptable system one appropriately satisfies requirement user utility usability cost
These attribute easily linked Rogers five characteristic showing close overlap two distinct perspective
However ability use technology obviously necessary sufficient ensure acceptability many technology demonstrably usable never accepted target user
Many researcher attempted identify psychological variable distinguish user accept reject technology
In research Alavi Joachimsthaler suggest relevant user factor determining technology acceptance cognitive style personality demographic variable
Cognitive style refers characteristic way individual process use information seen information processing term stable pattern handling incoming stimulus formulating response
More one hundred different dimension found literature although core cluster account majority work topic
To date however cognitive style dimension shown predict user behavior technology reliably
Personality trait need achievement degree defensiveness locus control propensity frequently proposed important predictor acceptance
The literature topic tends blur distinction personality cognitive style result study trait equally failed yield significant insight
Among demographic variable studied age education shown influence system use context
As expected higher educational attainment lower age seem influence use positively relationship weak
Coupling demographic variable contextual knowledge improves matter substantially variable training experience user involvement correlate well acceptance new technology
Alavi And Joachimsthaler found broad group factor important individual difference variable
Innovation diffusion theory also suggests factor level individual user important
Rogers divide technology innovation adopter five category depending speed uptake innovator early adopter early majority late majority laggard
Rogers plot category normal distribution division early late majority viewed mean thus laggard late adopter constitute population
Rogers estimate early adopter innovator approximately population according theory likely manifest adventure seeking personality well wealthier educated norm
Thus agreement individual situational factor influence acceptance new technology weight evidence suggests context might important personality individual psychological factor alone
While identification core technological psychological variable underlying acceptance provided insight human factor researcher attempted link set variable explicitly unified theory design implementation purpose
The important theoretical work area however involved analysis dynamic user action
Models acceptance emerged work place emphasis attitude user seek predict user acceptance measuring early affective response new technology
Of model widely cited Davis et al Technology Acceptance Model TAM
TAM predicts user acceptance technology determined two factor perceived usefulness perceived ease use
Perceived usefulness defined degree user belief using system enhance performance
Perceived ease use defined degree user belief using system free effort
According TAM perceived usefulness perceived ease use significant impact user attitude toward using system
Davis research show TAM explain approximately variance acceptance level many routine office application result several study TAM indicate usefulness important predictor use explaining significantly variance ease use rating user
Impressively TAM widely applied across different application type consistent result
Furthermore easy administer since involves little asking user provide rating series short statement Learning use application would easy
However research TAM typically based single time period user exposed system
This make useful choosing competing technology implementation stage le applicable early stage design designer trying determine best design technology prove acceptable
While significant inroad made determinant user acceptance remains tricky issue applying insight design process ensure resulting technology likely accepted
This pose joint challenge determining acceptance technology fully developed implementing manner support uptake
One simply rely model TAM since require user experience technology order formulate perception
To date little work carried reliability validity TAM score early prototype
Furthermore fundamental tenet organizational theory collective response new system working social environment likely determined isolated individual rating member
Within system design tradition HCI emphasis placed early continuous involvement user
Primarily serve tester prototype provide insight task work practice need supported technology
Even technology engineered highly usable shown formal testing exists guarantee lead acceptance
Theorists system tradition Eason argue information technology embedded working practice practice manifest network social relationship cooperation among user management relationship forth
Accordingly technology fully analyzed understood term usability conceptualized isolation organization work context intended support
In order jointly optimize social technical attribute organization allowance must taken design level social dynamic organization group within system theory given birth framework technology design emphasizes analysis stakeholder direct user technology formation planning group oversee design performance prototyping exercise analysis likely impact technology organization
The intention design process avoid unpleasant side effect working practice would lead resistance ensure much social solution technical solution computing need organization
Eason view acceptance term two competing force control enhancement
Control factor impose rule structure upon user thereby removing autonomy control action
According thinker working group autonomy encouraged since considered increase satisfaction performance
Among control issue raised respect technology design access reliability confidentiality monitoring pacing stress social contact
Low high presence certain factor low reliability high pacing introduction new technology likely reduce user perception control thus increase risk resistance
Enhancement factor include sense mastery growth knowledge discretion ability act informally requirement certain skill enabling worker cooperation
These factor maximized appropriate context though skill requirement inherent certain situation
A technology designed support factor likely increase user acceptance organization
To date little controlled study importance control enhancement variable
researcher tend toward case study design implementation rather controlled experiment rendering specific individual weighting control enhancement factor problematic
However perspective offer insight might prove amenable research move u beyond search single technological user variable

In various test conducted determine requirement met
It may involve
In may involve performed example piece lot manufactured mechanical part batch chemical product prior delivery
In defines formal testing respect user need requirement business process conducted determine whether system satisfies acceptance criterion enable user customer authorized entity determine whether accept system
Acceptance testing also known user acceptance testing UAT testing OAT field acceptance testing
A may used acceptance test prior introducing build software main testing process
Testing set activity conducted facilitate discovery evaluation property one item test
Each individual test known test case exercise set predefined test activity developed drive execution test item meet test objective including correct implementation error identification quality verification valued detail
The test environment usually designed identical close possible anticipated production environment
It includes facility hardware software firmware procedure documentation intended used perform testing software
UAT OAT test case ideally derived collaboration business customer business analyst tester developer
It essential test include business logic test well operational environment condition
The business customer product owner primary test
As test condition successfully achieve acceptance criterion stakeholder reassured development progressing right direction
The acceptance test suite may need performed multiple time test case may executed within single test iteration
The acceptance test suite run using predefined acceptance test procedure direct tester data use process follow expected result following execution
The actual result retained comparison expected result
If actual result match expected result test case test case said pas
If quantity test case breach project predetermined threshold test suite said pas
If system may either rejected accepted condition previously agreed sponsor manufacturer
The anticipated result successful test execution The objective provide confidence developed product meet functional requirement
The purpose conducting acceptance testing completed provided acceptance criterion met expected sponsor product satisfying defined requirement previously agreed business product
User acceptance testing UAT consists process verifying solution work user
It ensuring software crash meet documented requirement rather ensures solution work user test user accepts solution software vendor often refer Beta testing
This testing undertaken SME preferably owner client solution test provide summary finding confirmation proceed trial review
In UAT one final stage project often occurs client customer accepts new system
Users system perform test line would occur scenario
It important material given tester similar material end user
Testers given scenario three common difficult task user represent undertake
The UAT act final verification required business functionality proper functioning system emulating condition behalf paying client specific large customer
If software work required without issue normal use one reasonably extrapolate level stability production
User test usually performed client normally focus identifying simple cosmetic problem spelling error defect tester developer identify fix issue earlier system testing phase
UAT executed test scenario
Test scenario usually differ System Functional test case represent player user journey
The broad nature test scenario ensures focus journey technical detail staying away test step allow variance user behaviour
Test scenario broken logical day usually actor system backoffice front end change
In industry common UAT factory acceptance test FAT
This test take place installation equipment
Most time tester check equipment meet specification also fully functional
A FAT usually includes check completeness verification contractual requirement proof functionality either simulation conventional function test final inspection
The result test give client confidence system perform production
There may also legal contractual requirement acceptance system
OAT used conduct operational readiness product service system part
OAT common type used mainly project
This type testing focus system supported become part production environment
Acceptance testing term used methodology particularly referring software development team implementation phase
The customer specifies scenario test user story correctly implemented
A story one many acceptance test whatever take ensure functionality work
Acceptance test system test
Each acceptance test represents expected result system
Customers responsible verifying correctness acceptance test reviewing test score decide failed test highest priority
Acceptance test also used regression test prior production release
A user story considered complete passed acceptance test
This mean new acceptance test must created iteration development team report zero progress
Typical type acceptance testing include following

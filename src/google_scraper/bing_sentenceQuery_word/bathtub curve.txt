The Bathtub Curve Product Failure Behavior available

Most reliability engineer familiar life cycle bathtub curve shape hazard rate risk failure electronic product time
A typical electronic life cycle bathtub curve shown figure
The origination curve clear appears based human life cycle rate death
In human life cycle high rate death due risk birth fragility life time
As age rate death decline steady state level age body start wear
Just medical science done much extend life last century electronic component assembly also significant increase expected life since beginning electronics vacuum tube technology used
Vacuum tube inherent wear failure mode significant limiting factor life electronics system
During day vacuum tube wear tube component dominant cause field failure
Although error design manufacturing probably contributed field failure rate mechanical fragility limited life vacuum tube dominated cause system failure year use
Traditional electronics reliability engineering failure prediction methodology FPM foundation concept life cycle bathtub curve
The declining hazard rate region called infant mortality region
The wear failure mode electronics result increasing hazard rate represented back end bathtub curve
The concept curve used guide testing course establishing misleading meaningless term MTBF
In order make life prediction electronics assembly assumption must made regarding quality consistency manufacturing process well assumption distribution life cycle stress
To create model electronics device must assume manufacturing process capable part produced center normal distribution
We also must make assumption frequency distribution life cycle stress
It difficult account variation manufacturing level model without creating significant complexity
The applies accounting variation life cycle stress product population subjected
Today electronics component especially semiconductor inherent life entitlement relatively infinite relative technologically useful life system
We likely empirically determine life vast majority electronics component system technological obsolescence occurs relatively quickly
The pace significantly better performance feature electronics system likely slow therefore rate technological obsolescence slow
Of course exception electronics energy system
Wind solar energy system cost justification based year use
Using bathtub curve analogy technological obsolescence drain back end life cycle wear mode occurs
Figure graphical representation bathtub curve drain
The drain point time electronics replaced due technological obsolescence
Because technology obsolescence drain back end bathtub curve relatively small contributor overall cost failure customer manufacturer large percentage electronics
Obsolescence especially rapid consumer IT hardware
The infant mortality front end manufacturer customer realize cost poor reliability development program determines future purchase consumer
The cause failure early production mostly due poor overlooked design margin error manufacturing component system abuse sometimes accidental
Precise data rate cost product failure easily found reliability data confidential deal new product introduction realize cost unreliability come front end bathtub curve much wear end curve
Poor reliability may result total loss market share competitive market
The backend bathtub curve part irrelevant case high rate failure electronics company may business long enough technological obsolescence factor even much le wear failure The electronics industry last decade misdirected belief life electronics system calculated predicted component rate failure model failure mechanism
MIL HNBK although empirical evidence correlation prediction field failure rate
The vast majority cost failure almost electronics manufacturer come first year life covered warranty period also year past
It customer experience reliability determine quality reliability manufacturer future purchase manufacturer
The cost lost future sale may even greater warranty cost since difficult quantify may never known
Most cause failure attributable assignable cause previously mentioned
Traditional reliability engineering mostly based FPM electronics design manufacture company majority reliability engineering resource spent creating probabilistic estimate life entitlement system back end bathtub curve
There little evidence reducing cost unreliability electronics product occurs first several year due assignable random cause wear
A much greater return investment developing realized industry understands reliability failure first year use intrinsic wear instead random error design manufacturing
Reliability engineering must reorient spend reliability development time resource develop better accelerated stress test using better reliability discriminator prognostic detect error overlook low design margin eliminate market introduction
With new orientation electronics company effective quickest developing reliability product market introduction lowest cost

Nice article Kirk
I reacted thought electronics company may business long enough reason worry obsolescence
We hope stay business
Hi Chet thanks comment
I think young company focus getting product generating revenue feedback
They may luxury fix issue today market place yet might try
Interesting article Kirk great title
I generally agree say needing better work front identifying design process error leading infant mortality failure
This see issue integrating electronic component system
But issue
You vastly saying Mark Thanks comment
I see complete thought vastly I realize always exception rule
I avoid using term electronics reason article give long term application wear concern may factor
But even long term wear mechanism concern getting parameter predictive model correct accurate application significant challenge
Many wear mechanism driven multiple stress interacting
temperature moisture corrosion specific stress life cycle profile difficult obtain small variation model parameter result significant error predicted life
I yet see reliability prediction correlated actual field failure rate electronics system
Nice article
I following hypothesis If expected life product year component optimized margin reduce cost
When component used long life product industrial electronics etc
result reliability actually decrease despite better component
When margin lower disturbance production process logistics application result failure happen
During past five ten year seen failure case root cause failure component
I sure hypothesis correct failure analysis become better identifying root cause
Have anybody seen trend component seem higher failure rate
Hi Kari Good comment hypothesis
Unfortunately I data evaluate test idea
Maybe someone Linkedin Group ASQ Reliability Division maybe able supply hard number
Cheers Fred Kirk Interesting article would nice see data support conclusion
I get idea drain resulting obsolescence sure regard associating bath tub curve electronic component older limit switch push button relay
I believe would see wear today electronic component truth exposure competing factor enemy electricity dirt dust water heat shock vibration sun
Keep enemy electricity away component unknown life
For example I TV year old work great transistor radio year old sound bad today I
No sign bathtub curve fairness I use everyday
Fred Keri The Reliability Analysis Center used part Rome Airforce Base NY used kind data electronic component type
I know one time another I information hand likely old laptop went Kirks drain
Good article conversation well
Doug thank comment
I dream company would allow publication root cause electronics failure distribution ala happen reason see post
I draw knowledge conclusion year seeing real field reliability issue year reliability consulting year Senior Reliability Engineer Dell
I wish I could share know NDA prevent disclosure warranty data
I agree comment old electronics I many still working way obsolete anyone need dual cassette tape deck
Best happy
Kirk Gray Dear Kirk Fred contributor reader Thanks post I always pleased go
In several post find noMTBF website mentioned main limitation use probabilistic statistical prediction based physical failure lack failure data
For example No Evidence Correlation Field failure Traditional Reliability Engineering mentioned Much slow change industry due fact electronics reliability engineering fundamental knowledge distribution problem real field failure data root cause failure never shared larger reliability engineering community
Reliability data confidential sensitive data manufacturer post present post write Precise data rate cost product failure easily found reliability data confidential
I fully share observation consequence rather expect probabilistic statistical prediction based physical failure
And reason I would like mention FIDES reliability methodolog guide
I must confess I surprised hit post searching FIDES whole web site
Indeed use FIDES growing significantly probably accelerate soon becomes international standard
It used Europe also American Japanese company started use à Boeing JAXA Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency instance
FIDES guide methodology based physic failure AND SUPPORTED BY THE ANALYSIS OF A HUGE SET OF FAILURES DATA coming many year various equipment used various mission profile coming major European space defense compagnies decided take part project
The first aim FIDES project develop new reliability assessment method electronic component take consideration COTS commercial specific part new technology
The global aim find replacement worldwide reference everybody agreed obsolete pessimistic COTS component widely used military aerospace system
It seems FIDES guide allows getting rid main limitation lack available failure data needed adjust improve validate existing model
In addition taking account physic intrinsic failure FIDES also relies processus used development conception manufacturing deployment etc
A end result model failure reflect intrinsic cause item technology manufacturing distribution quality extrinsic cause equipment specification design selection procurement route equipment production integration item studied
You find FIDES
I yet user specialist FIDES guide quite seduced inovative relaibility approach
Looking forward reading thought feedback FIDES approach Cheers Augustin Thanks Augustin comment
I seen many failure cause failure many client company many year I seen intrinsic wear component system significant contributor field failure hence point article
The cause failure occur due error design manufacturing wear failure contribute significantly relative short time technological obsolescence
Calculations degradation failure based intrinsic model known degradation mechanism include many assignable cause manufacturing excursion combination factor lead early life year failure
Reliability electronics system without moving part predicted
Please download read widely distribute still believe prediction excellent recent RAMS paper public domain titled Reliability Reliance Misleading Approach downloaded Although often make general assumption obsolescence saving grace consumer electronics commodity computing I think two promote longer use product future
One trend cloud computing generic server increasingly used service provider
As hardware standardizes economic incentive use long practical module replacement driven field failure microprocessor iteration indeed system designed exactly mind
So utility service life reliability cost may become dominant
Ditto NUCs like corporate use
Another trend driven standardization power wireless infrastructure mobile device
Historically also gone route commoditization short life span standard succeed useful lifespan increase
However case might expect model similar commodity desktop PCs seldom serviced upgraded unless fail used long possible avoid spending money
Thus designer system need reconsider reliability needed
Thanks comment two good point
I would add third environmentally conscience consumer using equipment long possible avoid landfill etc
Cheers Fred Hi I agree difficult find published data reliability failure rate electronics
There data measured standard made available member Quest Forum
This includes return rate reliability data return lot cause faulty product might use
Has anyone tried
Regards Mike Hi Mike thanks comment
A big problem counting return failure electronics producer verified failure little le warranty return
So actual number failure hard derive return rate
Regards Kirk What application bathtub curve product design provision warranty
The distribution time failure whether early failure wear provide useful information use design decision planning warranty
Knowing expected number failure key along patter time
Cheers Fred Thank much Fred

operating system developed principle Windows without using Microsoft code
There many operating system significant day longer IBM Microsoft precursor Apple macOS
Some still used niche market continue developed minority platform enthusiast community specialist application
formerly still active development
Yet operating system used almost exclusively academia operating system education research operating system concept
A typical example system fulfills role example used purely research
Other operating system failed win significant market share introduced innovation influenced mainstream operating system least Bell Labs
The component operating system exist order make different part computer work together
All user software need go operating system order use hardware whether simple mouse keyboard complex Internet component
With aid kernel provides basic level control computer hardware device
It manages memory access program determines program get access hardware resource set reset CPU operating state optimal operation time organizes data medium disk tape flash memory etc
The operating system provides interface application program computer hardware application program interact hardware obeying rule procedure programmed operating system
The operating system also set service simplify development execution application program
Executing application program involves creation process operating system assigns memory space resource establishes priority process system load program binary code memory initiate execution application program interacts user hardware device
central operating system provide efficient way operating system interact react environment
The alternative operating system watch various source input event polling require action found older system small byte unusual modern system large stack
programming directly supported modern CPUs
Interrupts provide computer way automatically saving local register context running specific code response event
Even basic computer support hardware interrupt allow programmer specify code may run event take place
When interrupt received computer hardware automatically suspends whatever program currently running save status run computer code previously associated interrupt analogous placing bookmark book response phone call
In modern operating system interrupt handled operating system
Interrupts may come either computer hardware running program
When hardware device trigger interrupt operating system kernel decides deal event generally running processing code
The amount code run depends priority interrupt example person usually responds smoke detector alarm answering phone
The processing hardware interrupt task usually delegated software called may part operating system kernel part another program
Device driver may relay information running program various mean
A program may also trigger interrupt operating system
If program wish access hardware example may interrupt operating system kernel cause control passed back kernel
The kernel process request
If program wish additional resource wish shed resource memory trigger interrupt get kernel attention
Modern CPU MPU support multiple mode operation
CPUs capability offer least two mode
In general term supervisor mode operation allows unrestricted access machine resource including MPU instruction
User mode operation set limit instruction use typically disallows direct access machine resource
CPUs might mode similar user mode well virtual mode order emulate older processor type processor one processor one
At reset system begin supervisor mode
Once operating system loaded started boundary user mode supervisor mode also known kernel mode established
Supervisor mode used kernel low level task need unrestricted access hardware controlling memory accessed communicating device disk drive video display device
User mode contrast used almost everything else
Application program word processor database manager operate within user mode access machine resource turning control kernel process cause switch supervisor mode
Typically transfer control kernel achieved executing instruction Motorola instruction
The software interrupt cause microprocessor switch user mode supervisor mode begin executing code allows kernel take control
In user mode program usually access restricted set microprocessor instruction generally execute instruction could potentially cause disruption system operation
In supervisor mode instruction execution restriction typically removed allowing kernel unrestricted access machine resource
The term user mode resource generally refers one CPU register contain information running program allowed alter
Attempts alter resource generally cause switch supervisor mode operating system deal illegal operation program attempting example forceably terminating killing program
Among thing multiprogramming operating system must responsible managing system memory currently use program
This ensures program interfere memory already use another program
Since program time share program must independent access memory
Cooperative memory management used many early operating system assumes program make voluntary use memory manager exceed allocated memory
This system memory management almost never seen since program often contain bug cause exceed allocated memory
If program fails may cause memory used one program affected overwritten
Malicious program virus may purposefully alter another program memory may affect operation operating system
With cooperative memory management take one misbehaved program crash system
enables limit process access computer memory
Various method memory protection exist including
All method require level hardware support MMU exist computer
In segmentation paging certain register specify CPU memory address allow running program access
Attempts access address trigger interrupt cause CPU placing charge
This called short since difficult assign meaningful result operation usually sign misbehaving program generally resort terminating offending program report error
Windows version ME level memory protection program could easily circumvent need use
A would produced indicating segmentation violation occurred however system would often crash anyway
The use virtual memory addressing paging segmentation mean kernel choose memory program may use given time allowing operating system use memory location multiple task
If program try access memory current range accessible memory nonetheless allocated kernel interrupted way would program exceed allocated memory
See section memory management
Under UNIX kind interrupt referred
When kernel detects page fault generally adjusts virtual memory range program triggered granting access memory requested
This give kernel discretionary power particular application memory stored even whether actually allocated yet
In modern operating system memory accessed le frequently temporarily stored disk medium make space available use program
This called area memory used multiple program memory area contains swapped exchanged demand
Virtual memory provides programmer user perception much larger amount RAM computer really
refers running multiple independent computer program computer giving appearance performing task time
Since computer one two thing one time generally done via mean program us share computer time execute
An operating system contains program determines much time process spends executing order execution control passed program
Control passed process kernel allows program access memory
Later control returned kernel mechanism another program may allowed use CPU
This passing control kernel application called
An early model governed allocation time program called
In model control passed program kernel may execute long want explicitly returning control kernel
This mean malicious malfunctioning program may prevent program using CPU hang entire system enters
Modern operating system extend concept application preemption device driver kernel code operating system preemptive control internal well
The philosophy governing ensuring program given regular time CPU
This implies program must limited much time allowed spend CPU without interrupted
To accomplish modern operating system kernel make use timed interrupt
A timer set kernel trigger return supervisor mode specified time elapsed
See section Interrupts Dual Mode Operation
On many single user operating system cooperative multitasking perfectly adequate home computer generally run small number well tested program
The exception preemptive multitasking first version
first version enforced preemptive multitasking reach home user market since targeted professional
Access data stored disk central feature operating system
Computers store data using structured specific way order allow faster access higher reliability make better use drive available space
The specific way file stored disk called enables file name attribute
It also allows stored hierarchy directory folder arranged
Early operating system generally supported single type disk drive one kind file system
Early file system limited capacity speed kind file name directory structure could use
These limitation often reflected limitation operating system designed making difficult operating system support one file system
While many simpler operating system support limited range option accessing storage system operating system like support technology known VFS
An operating system UNIX support wide array storage device regardless design allowing accessed common API
This make unnecessary program knowledge device accessing
A VFS allows operating system provide program access unlimited number device infinite variety file system installed use specific file system driver
A connected accessed
The device driver understands specific language drive able translate language standard language used operating system access disk drive
On UNIX language
When kernel appropriate device driver place access content disk drive raw format may contain one file system
A file system driver used translate command used access specific file system standard set command operating system use talk file system
Programs deal file system basis filename contained within hierarchical structure
They create delete open close file well gather various information including access permission size free space creation modification date
Various difference file system make supporting file system difficult
Allowed character file name presence various kind make implementation single interface every file system daunting task
Operating system tend recommend using support natively file system specifically designed example Windows Linux
However practice third party driver usually available give support widely used file system operating system example NTFS available Linux ReiserFS available Windows software
Support file system highly varied among modern operating system although several common file system almost operating system include support driver
Operating system vary file system support disk format may installed
Under Windows file system usually limited application certain medium example CDs must use NTFS file system operating system installed
It possible install Linux onto many type file system
Unlike operating system Linux UNIX allow file system used regardless medium stored whether hard drive disc CD DVD USB flash drive even contained within file located another file system
A specific type computer software developed allow interaction hardware device
Typically constitutes interface communicating device specific computer bus communication subsystem hardware connected providing command receiving data device end requisite interface operating system software application
It specialized computer program also operating system specific enables another program typically operating system application software package computer program running operating system kernel interact transparently hardware device usually provides requisite interrupt handling necessary necessary asynchronous hardware interfacing need
The key design goal device driver
Every model hardware even within class device different
Newer model also released manufacturer provide reliable better performance newer model often controlled differently
Computers operating system expected know control every device future
To solve problem operating system essentially dictate every type device controlled
The function device driver translate operating system mandated function call device specific call
In theory new device controlled new manner function correctly suitable driver available
This new driver ensures device appears operate usual operating system point view
Under version Windows Vista version Linux driver execution meaning driver entered infinite loop would freeze system
More recent revision operating system incorporate kernel preemption kernel interrupt driver give task separate process receives response device driver give task
Currently operating system support variety networking protocol hardware application using
This mean computer running dissimilar operating system participate common sharing resource file printer scanner using either wired wireless connection
Networks essentially allow computer operating system access resource remote computer support function could resource connected directly local computer
This includes everything simple communication using networked file system even sharing another computer graphic sound hardware
Some network service allow resource computer accessed transparently allows networked user direct access computer command line interface
networking allows program computer called client connect via network another computer called server
Servers offer host various service network computer user
These service usually provided port numbered access point beyond server
Each port number usually associated maximum one running program responsible handling request port
A daemon user program turn access local hardware resource computer passing request operating system kernel
Many operating system support one open networking protocol well example system system protocol Windows
Specific protocol specific task may also supported file access
Protocols like esd easily extended network provide sound local application remote system sound hardware
A computer secure depends number technology working properly
A modern operating system provides access number resource available software running system external device like network via kernel
The operating system must capable distinguishing request allowed processed others processed
While system may simply distinguish privileged system commonly form requester user name
To establish identity may process
Often username must quoted username may password
Other method authentication magnetic card biometric data might used instead
In case especially connection network resource may accessed authentication reading file network share
Also covered concept requester particular service resource accessible requester logged system tied either requester user account variously configured group user requester belongs
In addition allow disallow model security system high level security also offer auditing option
These would allow tracking request access resource reading file
Internal security security already running program possible possibly harmful request must carried interrupt operating system kernel
If program directly access hardware resource secured
External security involves request outside computer login connected console kind network connection
External request often passed device driver operating system kernel passed onto application carried directly
Security operating system long concern highly sensitive data held computer commercial military nature
The United States DoD created TCSEC standard set basic requirement assessing effectiveness security
This became vital importance operating system maker TCSEC used evaluate classify select considered processing storage retrieval sensitive
Network service include offering file sharing print service email web site FTP compromised security
At front line security hardware device known intrusion system
At operating system level number software firewall available well intrusion system
Most modern operating system include software firewall enabled default
A software firewall configured allow deny network traffic service application running operating system
Therefore one install running insecure service Telnet FTP threatened security breach firewall would deny traffic trying connect service port
An alternative strategy strategy available system meet operating system running user program native code instead either processor provides host based system Java
Internal security especially relevant system allows user system private file user tamper read
Internal security also vital auditing use since program potentially bypass operating system inclusive bypassing auditing
Every computer operated individual requires
The user interface usually referred essential human interaction supported
The user interface view request service operating system acquire data request operating system service display
The two common form user interface historically computer command typed visual environment commonly present
Most modern computer system support GUI often include
In computer system original implementation GUI integrated
While technically graphical user interface operating system service incorporating support one operating system kernel allow GUI responsive reducing number required GUI perform output function
Other operating system separating graphic subsystem kernel Operating System
In UNIX VMS many others operating system built way
Linux macOS also built way
Modern release Microsoft Windows implement graphic subsystem mostly however graphic drawing routine version exist mostly kernel space
little distinction interface kernel
Many computer operating system allow user install create user interface desire
The conjunction commonly found setup Unix BSD Linux Solaris system
A number released Microsoft Windows offer alternative included shell separated Windows
Numerous GUIs existed time derived
Competition among various vendor Unix HP IBM Sun led much fragmentation though effort standardize failed various reason eventually eclipsed widespread adoption GNOME
Prior toolkits desktop environment Motif prevalent combination basis upon CDE developed
Graphical user interface evolve time
For example Windows modified user interface almost every time new major version Windows released Mac OS GUI changed dramatically introduction Mac OS X
A operating system RTOS operating system intended application fixed deadline
Such application include small automobile engine controller industrial robot spacecraft industrial control computing system
An early example operating system developed
Embedded system fixed deadline use
share similar APIs desktop Windows share none desktop Windows codebase
also RTOS kernel starting version
Some embedded system use operating system although operating system support computing
Operating system development one complicated activity computing hobbyist may engage
A hobby operating system may classified one whose code directly derived existing operating system user
In case hobby development support computing device example simple powered
Or development may architecture already widespread use
Operating system development may come entirely new concept may commence modeling existing operating system
In either case hobbyist developer may interact small sometimes unstructured group individual like interest
Examples hobby operating system include
Application software generally written use specific operating system sometimes even specific hardware
When porting application run another OS functionality required application may implemented differently OS name function meaning argument etc
requiring application adapted changed otherwise
Unix first operating system written assembly language making system different native
This cost supporting operating system diversity avoided instead writing application like
These abstraction already borne cost adaptation specific operating system
Another approach operating system vendor adopt standard
For example provide commonality reduce porting cost
In Android first currently replicated others single year operating system ever ship billion device becoming popular operating system installed base

One ingredient environment therefore operating system
But operating system include number different
For example many operating system allow choose command command
All parameter taken together constitute environment
Another term environment sense
In environment area operating system program use various type miscellaneous information
For example may use environment area store location
You view modify environment SET command

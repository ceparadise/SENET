Christopher taught college level information technology IT security master degree Information Security hold numerous industry certification
A really anything computer may damage steal data allow someone else access computer without knowledge consent
There lot different thing create computer risk including general term used describe many type bad software
We commonly think computer virus several type bad software create computer security risk including virus worm ransomware spyware Trojan horse
Misconfiguration computer product well unsafe computing habit also pose risk
Let look detail
malware attached file system may used destroy data
Viruses many capability unlike worm usually require human interaction spread system system even user unaware spreading
like virus ability spread computer computer
They know attach portable storage device like USB drive removable hard drive move network automatically moving connected machine
relatively new term malware installed system make file unreadable holding data hostage pay hacker ransom
Ransomware may delivered virus worm guarantee even pay ransom get data restored
malware steal data may used spy using webcam microphone without knowledge
Once spyware installed may steal sensitive data recording login information use looking sensitive file computer sending data back attacker
In recent month hacker able access webcam microphone computer use picture video audio recording blackmail victim
special kind virus
Like famed wooden horse used Greeks infiltrate walled city Troy Trojan horse virus used deliver type malware hiding inside program file look legitimate
Get FREE access day create account
Most operating system today come sort firewall many tool normally referred protection suite protect computer
These suite tool usually incorporate different tool help defend risk mentioned far
These item work properly configured
Improper incomplete configuration product may create computer security risk
For example program need updated regularly
As new virus released software need updated block new virus attempt infect computer
If misconfigured may get required update put computer risk
This hold true operating system well
Microsoft example release security patch fix every Tuesday
These patch fix part operating system working designed contain new functionality protect new threat discovered operating system
If system patched mean new vulnerability available hacker creates computer security risk
We probably heard click link email unknown source
As tool gotten smarter attacker find new way infecting computer
may able block software installed automatically voluntarily install infected software may catch
Clicking link unknown untrusted source installing software loaned given u without proper licensing security procedure downloading software source official vendor could lead computer infected malware data stolen hacker
These unsafe computing habit create computer security risk
A anything may cause damage confidentiality integrity availability data
Computer security risk created bad software infect computer destroy file steal data allow attacker gain access system without knowledge authorization
Examples malware include virus worm ransomware spyware Trojan horse
Misconfigured software unpatched operating system unsafe computer habit contribute creating computer security risk

From circuit board monitor battery cable toxic substance pose real threat work computer equipment
Here hazmat basic every IT pro aware
By When think hazardous material handling may think people work chemical company nuclear power plant
But IT professional work every day equipment contains toxic material
That disposing old computer electronics equipment challenge
To protect others exposure potentially dangerous substance avoid liability violating environmental regulation need know risk posed various device supply minimize risk
Generally electronic waste classified hazardous contains component toxic poisonous corrosive reactive
Most electronic device contain heavy metal lead
If hazardous component get landfill hazardous substance get soil perhaps seep groundwater
The EU legislation ban use certain substance regulates amount certain substance used electrical electronic equipment
There equivalent federal law United States California Electronic Waste Recycling Act EWRA based RoHS directive state considering similar law
In United States passed
It lay federal regulation disposing material regarded hazardous well type waste amended strengthen law three time
Each state also regulation regarding handle hazardous waste material
In many case restrictive federal law
The EPA offer list
When open computer case see
The motherboard memory module video card sound card forth made circuit board
And circuit board often contain poisonous metal used manufacturing process including mercury lead
Both profound health effect human
Mercury toxicity problem country proposed banning metal completely
Mercury poisoning cause damage central nervous system liver organ cause impairment sens vision speech hearing
Lead toxicity cause anemia irreversible neurological damage cardiovascular effect gastrointestinal symptom renal disease
Although merely handling computer component constitute dangerous level exposure substance effect cumulative already exposed lead mercury source household product paint food especially fish
The internals computer also contain bromine polyvinyl chloride PVC may present plastic coating cable
product suspected causing hypothyroidism well Attention Deficit Disorder behavioral problem child
Toxic substance called phthalates leech PVC product
Phthalates linked study kidney liver damage phthalates labeled carcinogen EPA
Older workstation server laptop pose greatest hazard
In recent year many computer manufacturer moved reduce toxic component system sell
When buying new system reduce risk purchasing selected EPEAT EPA
I vividly remember sticker back one first CRT monitor
It basically said Do open case I kill
Cathode Ray Tube computer monitor TVs contain capacitor hold charge hundred volt long time device unplugged
Additionally vacuum within CRT monitor cause implosion glass broken
Finally CRTs contain phosphor barium compound toxic glass may leaded
Most people aware danger posed old CRTs may aware fact modern LCD flat panel also pose hazard
In fact liquid crystal display screen may also contain lead well copper level excess regulatory limit
The backlight may also contain mercury
There many type battery may run across job IT pro AAA dry cell go wireless keyboard pointing device large battery power uninterruptible power supply UPSs
Some classified hazardous good others
In general common AAA AA C D cell battery still pose threat fire short circuit ensure terminal properly covered
Lithium lithium ion battery many portable computer cell phone overheat ignite drop receive blow
For reason delivery service special regulation governing shipment battery
Some UPS device older computer use lead acid battery like car battery
These contain sulfuric acid corrosive pose big danger leak
Batteries also contain heavy metal including lead mercury nickel cadmium
Nicad nickel cadmium silver oxide mercury oxide zinc carbon even alkaline battery considered hazardous waste various state law
Batteries recycled best take used battery recycling facility
If possible may need take hazardous waste disposal facility
Other consumable supply printer cartridge also contain hazardous material recycled disposed accordance proper procedure thrown trash
Inkjet ink laser tone dust contain harmful chemical cartridge often contain PVC flame retardant
It computer equipment supply pose hazardous material risk
The server room may component require special handling disposal
We already mentioned PVC hazardous find many place
Ethernet cable often jacketed PVC PVC pipe sometimes used conduit running cable
heat stabilizer added PVC wiring cable application well
And wire inside cable usually copper
Many company switched using traditional incandescent light bulb compact fluorescent light CFL bulb
These use far le energy produce considerably le heat however CFL bulb like fluorescent light contain mercury state local governmental entity outlawed disposing trash
It important avoid breaking release mercury
If server room old building may additional hazardous material paint asbestos insulation acoustical ceiling
Cleaning solvent used clean floor also source risk

Many organization likely face different kind risk cause massive loss within organization
Risk management involves balancing return risk involved carrying business
The process risk management aim increasing value organization well reducing chance making loss
For example many manufacturing company always rely risk management try understand market trend
This help organization able mitigate pending market crash
Organizations maintain effective risk management framework
This help protect capital base undertaking
This also act good record investor want invest organization maintained good risk management framework

Error Handling GCSE Computer Science Revision
Even write neatest tidiest code history computing test within inch sorry life may well come time programme user come across bug error foresee
Remember already advantage written fabulously neat code relatively easy follow path find glitch
Plus error one three category either syntax error error logic error
Let walk one time
A syntax error simply mistake way code written
Imagine essay write five location mistake
The error syntax singular plural match plural noun
You made error rule grammar syntax error computing error rule computer language grammar
Maybe lower case letter upper case bracket closed
Yup something annoyingly small
Then error
These occur programme running usually due either programmer error perhaps code shared another programme running time decide like working together
It might even malware programme infected virus Trojan managed sneak
Lastly logic error
Remember talked logical data structure based
These really blame dog alien invasion set dialogue
Unfortunately usually trickiest fix understood wrote error
So prevent error much possible
Prevention always better cure right thorough testing crucial design stage writing coding
Errors creep getting tired bored develop eye eagle give break screen refocus concentrate writing code

Health Safety Contents It everyone responsibility carry Risk Assessments task perform
This checked person supervisor mentor host
For graduate student safety office run new graduate student Risk Assessment
For staff student Safety Office finished guideline see HSE guide form pdf
You may need An initial attempt Lab form developed
Once risk identified measure taken minimise
In many case training correct procedure appropriate attending Manual Handling Course
This arranged line manager Safety Committee Secretary DSO date internal course available
In case task may need rearranged remove certain risk
If appropriate Personal Protective Equipment may needed glove safety glass harness
It individual responsibility ensure measure used minimise risk

potential gaining losing something value
Values emotional financial wealth gained lost taking risk resulting given action inaction foreseen unforeseen planned planned
Risk also defined intentional interaction
Uncertainty potential unpredictable uncontrollable outcome risk consequence action taken spite uncertainty
subjective judgment people make severity probability risk may vary person person
Any human endeavour carry risk much riskier others
The cite earliest use word English spelling French original spelling
It defines Exposure possibility loss injury adverse unwelcome circumstance chance situation involving possibility
The publication ISO Guide definition risk uncertainty objective
In definition uncertainty include event may may happen uncertainty caused ambiguity lack information
It also includes negative positive impact objective
Many definition risk exist common usage however definition developed international committee representing country based input several thousand subject matter expert
Very different approach risk management taken different field
Risk unwanted subset set uncertain outcome Cornelius Keating
Risk ubiquitous area life risk management something must whether managing major organisation simply crossing road
When describing risk however convenient consider risk practitioner operate specific practice area
Economic risk manifested lower income higher expenditure expected
The cause many instance hike price raw material lapsing deadline construction new operating facility disruption production process emergence serious competitor market loss key personnel change political regime natural disaster
Risks personal health may reduced action decrease early cause illness action person clearly measured clinical sign symptom recognised risk factor
Tertiary reduces negative impact already established disease restoring function reducing complication
Ethical medical practice requires careful discussion individual patient obtain secondary tertiary prevention effort whereas public health effort primary prevention require education entire population risk
In case careful communication risk factor likely outcome must distinguish causal event must decreased associated event may merely consequence rather cause
In epidemiology effect also called entire lifetime
In term occupational health safety management term may defined likely consequence hazard combined likelihood probability occurring
Health safety environment HSE separate practice area however often linked
The reason typically organizational management structure however strong link among discipline
One strongest link single risk event may impact three area albeit differing timescales
For example uncontrolled release radiation toxic chemical may immediate safety consequence protracted health impact much environmental impact
Events Chernobyl example caused immediate death longer term death cancer left lasting environmental impact leading birth defect impact wildlife etc
Over time form risk analysis called environmental risk analysis developed
Environmental risk analysis field study attempt understand event activity bring risk human health environment
Human health environmental risk likelihood adverse outcome See
As risk function hazard exposure
Hazard intrinsic danger harm posed
toxicity chemical compound
Exposure likely contact hazard
Therefore risk even hazardous substance approach zero exposure nears zero given person organism biological makeup activity location See
Another example health risk certain behaviour increase likelihood contracting HIV
Individual risk perception risk taking also influenced social factor
A study using representative household data US Italy Austria find evidence risk taking level influenced immediate social environment welfare regime state
different support network
The study also find factor interact

Cass Sunstein hold risk social construe also correct diagnosis vital understand evolution
State appeal net expert avoid populism consists biased information respecting probability risk
risk related information technology
This relatively new term developed result increasing awareness information security simply one facet multitude risk relevant IT real world process support
The increasing dependency modern society information computer network private public sector including military led new term like
mean protecting information unauthorised access use disclosure disruption modification perusal inspection recording destruction
Information security grew practice procedure
Information security grown
practice managing risk related use processing storage transmission information data system process used purpose
While focused dominantly information digital form full range IA encompasses digital also analogue physical form
Information assurance interdisciplinary draw multiple field including accounting fraud examination addition computer science
So narrowly focused computer security extends risk related form information paper microfilm
risk include one related consistency business information stored IT system information stored mean relevant business consequence
Insurance risk treatment option involves risk sharing
It considered form contingent capital akin purchasing buyer pay small premium protected potential large loss
Insurance risk often taken insurance company bear pool risk including market risk credit risk operational risk interest rate risk mortality risk longevity risk etc
Means assessing risk vary widely profession
Indeed may define profession example doctor manages medical risk civil engineer manages risk structural failure
A professional usually focused risk assessment mitigation professional behalf client public society life general
In workplace incidental exist
Incidental risk occur naturally business part core business
Inherent risk negative effect operating profit business
The experience many people rely human service support often used reason prevent gaining independence fully accessing community service often unnecessarily risk averse
People autonomy used compromised institution wall often risk management practice according
Michael Fischer Ewan Ferlie find contradiction formal risk control role subjective factor human service role emotion ideology undermine service value producing tension even intractable conflict
A HRO organisation succeeded avoiding catastrophe environment expected due risk factor
Most study HROs involve area nuclear aircraft carrier air traffic control aerospace nuclear power station
Organizations share common ability consistently operate safely complex interconnected environment single failure one component could lead catastrophe
Essentially organisation appear operate spite enormous range risk
Some industry manage risk highly quantified enumerated way
These include possible failure complex series engineered system could result highly undesirable outcome
The usual measure risk class event probability event severity consequence
The total risk sum individual see
In nuclear industry consequence often measured term radiological release often banded five band
The risk evaluated using fault tree technique see
Where risk low normally considered broadly acceptable
A higher level risk typically time considered broadly acceptable justified cost reducing possible benefit make risk described Tolerable ALARP stand low reasonably practicable
Risks beyond level classified intolerable
The level risk deemed broadly acceptable considered regulatory body various early attempt UK government regulator academic used example similar activity definable risk people appear find acceptable
This resulted Farmer Curve acceptable probability event versus consequence
The technique whole usually referred probabilistic risk assessment PRA probabilistic safety assessment PSA
See example approach
In finance risk chance return achieved investment different expected also take account size difference
This includes possibility losing original investment
In view advocated Damodaran risk includes also upside risk return exceed expectation
Some regard historical return average return specific investment providing historical measure risk see modern portfolio theory
Financial risk may determined numerous market factor operational resulting fraudulent behaviour

A fundamental idea finance relationship risk return see
The greater potential return one might seek greater risk one generally assumes
A free market reflects principle pricing instrument strong demand safer instrument drive price higher return correspondingly lower weak demand riskier instrument drive price lower potential return thereby higher
For example US Treasury bond considered one safest investment
In comparison investment speculative grade corporate bond US Treasury note bond yield lower rate return
The reason corporation likely default debt US government
Because risk investing corporate bond higher investor offered correspondingly higher rate return
A popular VaR
There different type VaR long term VaR marginal VaR factor VaR shock VaR
The latter used measuring risk extreme market stress condition
In finance single definition
Artzner et al
write call risk investor future net worth
In Novak risk possibility undesirable event
In financial market one may need measure information timing source risk probability model risk operational risk regulatory civil action taken result
With advent automation financial market concept risk gained lot attention
Aldridge Krawciw define risk probability instantaneous loss due flash crash market crisis malicious activity selected market participant event
A example risk US million loss incurred within minute Knight Capital Group KCG August culprit runaway algorithm deployed firm
Regulators taken notice risk well
Basel III requires risk management framework bank stability
It always obvious financial instrument specifically reduce cancel risk another investment speculation increasing measurable risk exposing investor catastrophic loss pursuit high windfall increase expected value
Some people may
second derivative positive
Such individual willingly pay premium assume risk
buy lottery ticket
The express risk providing inappropriate opinion material misstatement commercial entity financial statement
It analytically expressed AR IR CR DR
Note As defined audit risk consider impact auditor misstatement stated simple probability
The impact misstatement must considered determining acceptable audit risk
Security risk management involves protection asset harm caused deliberate act
A detailed definition A security risk event could result compromise organizational asset
unauthorized use loss damage disclosure modification organizational asset profit personal interest political interest individual group entity constitutes compromise asset includes risk harm people
Compromise organizational asset may adversely affect enterprise business unit client
As consideration security risk vital component risk management
One growing area focus risk management field behavioural organizational psychology underpin understanding risk based decision making
This field considers question make risk based decision
irrationally scared shark terrorist motor vehicle medication
In regret anticipation regret play significant part distinct preferring status quo case one becomes worse
fundamental problem form risk assessment
In particular brain get overloaded take mental shortcut risk extreme event discounted probability low evaluate intuitively
As example one leading cause death caused partly given driver frame problem largely totally ignoring risk serious fatal accident
For instance extremely disturbing event attack hijacking may ignored analysis despite fact occurred nonzero probability
Or event everyone agrees inevitable may ruled analysis due greed unwillingness admit believed inevitable
These human tendency error often affect even rigorous application major concern
All must consider notational bias No group people assessing risk immune acceptance obviously wrong answer simply socially painful disagree
Framing involves information affect outcome risky decision
The right prefrontal cortex shown take global perspective greater left prefrontal activity relates local focal processing
From Theory Leaky Modules McElroy Seta proposed could predictably alter framing effect selective manipulation regional prefrontal activity finger tapping monaural listening
The result expected
Rightward tapping listening effect narrowing attention frame ignored
This practical way manipulating regional cortical activation affect risky decision especially directed tapping listening easily done
A growing area research examine various psychological aspect risk taking
Researchers typically run randomised experiment treatment control group ascertain effect different psychological factor may associated risk taking
Thus positive negative feedback past risk taking affect future risk taking
In experiment people led believe competent decision making saw opportunity risky choice took risk led believe competent saw threat took fewer risk
The concept maintenance advanced form
In case chemical industry apart probability failure consequence failure also important
Therefore selection maintenance policy based risk instead reliability
maintenance methodology act tool maintenance planning decision making reduce probability failure consequence
In maintenance decision making maintenance resource used optimally based risk class high medium low equipment machine achieve tolerable risk criterion

Since risk assessment management essential security management tightly related
Security assessment methodology like contain risk assessment module important part first step methodology
On hand risk assessment methodology like evolved become security assessment methodology
An standard risk management Principles guideline implementation published code November
There many formal method used measure risk
Often probability negative event estimated using frequency past similar event
Probabilities rare failure may difficult estimate
This make risk assessment difficult hazardous industry example nuclear energy frequency failure rare harmful consequence failure severe
Statistical method may also require use turn may require calculation cost loss human life
This difficult problem
One approach ask people willing pay insure death radiological release
GBq answer depend strongly circumstance clear approach effective
Risk often measured undesirable outcome
This combine probability various possible event assessment corresponding harm single value

According one set definition fear fleeting emotion ascribed particular object trait fear referring trait anxiety distinct term anxiety generally used last longer attributed specific stimulus particular definition used author cited page
Some study show link anxious behaviour risk chance outcome unfavorable result
Joseph Forgas introduced based research emotion grouped either positive negative Lerner Keltner
Positive emotion happiness believed optimistic risk assessment negative emotion anger pessimistic risk assessment
As emotion negative valence fear therefore anxiety long associated negative risk perception
Under recent appraisal tendency framework Jennifer Lerner et refutes Forgas notion valence promotes idea specific emotion distinctive influence judgment fear still related pessimistic expectation
Psychologists demonstrated increase anxiety increase related people habituated anxiety experience awareness risk intensely normal individual
In anxiety promotes use bias quick thinking evaluate risk
This referred according Clore
However accuracy risk perception making choice known
Experimental study show brief surge anxiety correlated surge general risk perception
Anxiety exists presence threat perceived Maner Schmidt
As risk perception increase stay related particular source impacting mood change opposed spreading unrelated risk factor
This increased awareness threat significantly emphasised people conditioned anxiety
For example anxious individual predisposed generating reason negative result tend exhibit pessimism
Also finding suggest perception lack control lower inclination participate risky across various behavioural circumstance associated individual experiencing relatively high level trait anxiety
In previous instance supporting clinical research link emotional evaluation control anxiety felt option risk avoidance
There various view presented emotion cause people access involuntary response judgment making decision involve risk
Joshua Hemmerich et al
probe deeper anxiety impact choice exploring quick automatic natural reaction danger based emotion
This notion supported experiment engages physician simulated perilous surgical procedure
It demonstrated measurable amount participant anxiety patient outcome related previous experimentally created regret worry ultimately caused physician led feeling information guideline provided mock surgery
Additionally emotional level adjusted along simulated patient status suggest anxiety level respective decision made correlated type bad outcome experienced earlier part experiment
Similarly another view anxiety dispositional anxiety emotional state cognitive provide information future pitfall reward Maner Schmidt
When experiencing anxiety individual draw personal judgment referred pessimistic outcome appraisal
These emotion promote bias risk avoidance promote risk tolerance
It common people dread risk others They tend afraid epidemic disease nuclear power plant failure plane accident relatively unconcerned highly frequent deadly event traffic crash household accident medical error
One key distinction dreadful risk seems potential catastrophic consequence threatening kill large number people within short period time
For example immediately September attack many Americans afraid fly took car instead decision led significant increase number fatal crash time period following event compared time period attack
Different hypothesis proposed explain people fear dread risk
First psychometric paradigm suggests high lack control high catastrophic potential severe consequence account increased risk perception anxiety associated dread risk
Second people estimate frequency risk recalling instance occurrence social circle medium may overvalue relatively rare dramatic risk overpresence undervalue frequent le dramatic risk
Third according preparedness hypothesis people prone fear event particularly threatening survival human evolutionary history
Given human evolutionary history people lived relatively small group rarely exceeding people dread risk kill many people could potentially wipe one whole group
Indeed research found people fear peak risk killing around people increase larger group killed
Fourth fearing dread risk ecologically rational strategy
Besides killing large number people single point time dread risk reduce number child young adult would potentially produced offspring
Accordingly people concerned risk killing younger hence fertile group
The relationship higher level risk perception judgmental accuracy anxious individual remains unclear Joseph Constans
There chance judgmental accuracy correlated heightened anxiety
Constans conducted study examine worry propensity current mood trait anxiety might influence college student estimation performance upcoming exam study found worry propensity predicted subjective risk bias error risk assessment even variance attributable current mood trait anxiety removed
Another experiment suggests trait anxiety associated pessimistic risk appraisal heightened perception probability degree suffering associated negative experience controlling depression
In seminal work established distinction risk uncertainty

Uncertainty must taken sense radically distinct familiar notion Risk never properly separated
The term risk loosely used everyday speech economic discussion really cover two thing functionally least causal relation phenomenon economic organization categorically different

The essential fact risk mean case quantity susceptible measurement time something distinctly character crucial difference bearing phenomenon depending two really present operating

It appear measurable uncertainty risk proper shall use term far different unmeasurable one effect uncertainty
We accordingly restrict term uncertainty case type
Thus immeasurable possible calculate Knightian sense risk measurable
Another distinction risk uncertainty proposed Douglas Hubbard In sense one may uncertainty without risk risk without uncertainty
We uncertain winner contest unless personal stake risk
If bet money outcome contest risk
In case one outcome
The measure uncertainty refers probability assigned outcome measure risk requires probability outcome loss quantified outcome
The term often used similarly describe organisation individual attitude towards
One attitude may described
Risk tolerance look deviation expected
Risk appetite look much risk one willing accept
There still deviation within risk appetite
For example recent research find insured individual significantly likely divest risky asset holding response decline health controlling variable income age medical expense
Gambling investment wherein money hand risked possible large return possibility losing
Purchasing lottery ticket risky investment high chance return small chance high return
In contrast putting money bank defined rate interest action give guaranteed return small gain precludes investment possibly higher gain
The possibility getting return investment also known
Hubbard also argues defining risk product impact probability presumes unrealistically
A person utility proportional payoff
For example person would consider chance winning million exactly desirable getting certain
However actually would consider equivalent choice
This gave rise
Hubbard proposes instead describe risk quantity distinguishes probability magnitude risk
Risks simply described set function possible payoff gain loss associated probability
This array collapsed scalar value according

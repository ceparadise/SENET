Models predict product size exponential function development effort used paper explore relationship effort number increment
The author mainly focus effect productivity rate incremental development duration incremental software development vary incremental development author estimate cumulative effort gain effort estimation
This research paper helpful get productivity rate incremental effort estimation

Robert McGuckin Kevin Stiroh Computers Can Accelerate Productivity Growth The evidence found comparing industrial sector sector
Conventional wisdom argues rapid change information technology past year represents paradigm shift one perhaps important caused electric dynamo near turn century
The world market information technology grew nearly twice rate world gross domestic product GDP computer revolution clearly global phenomenon
Yet measured productivity growth sluggish midst worldwide technology boom
In United States example annual labor productivity growth defined output per hour work actually fell percent percent
For period total factor productivity TFP growth defined output per unit production input also fell substantially percent percent per year
In light belief computer fundamentally improved production process particularly puzzling
As Nobel laureate Robert Solow observed You see computer age everywhere productivity Detailed analysis economy suggests computer impact necessary look beyond number order find
New technology affect business sector differently
For sector computer revolution mainly story substitution
Companies respond declining price computer investing rather expensive input labor material form capital
The eight sector use computer intensively example added computer rate nearly percent per year whereas labor hour grew le percent per year
This capital deepening defined providing employee capital work dramatically increased relative labor productivity sector percent total capital input form computer
Before labor productivity manufacturing sector invested heavily computer grew percent per year compared percent
After accumulated computer rapidly however labor productivity growth jumped percent per year sector manufacturing declined percent per year manufacturing sector
Comparison relative performance sector time show computer playing important role determining labor productivity
productivity gain manufacturing sector also suggest measurement error large obstacle understanding impact computer productivity
Computer investment highly concentrated service sector sector clear evidence dramatic productivity gain found manufacturing
Economists however long argued output productivity poorly measured service sector
If one conjecture true impact computer approximately manufacturing service result imply increasing understatement output productivity growth service sector
The sector reveals yet another way computer revolution affect productivity growth
This sector experienced extraordinary TFP growth nearly percent per year reflecting enormous technological progress enabled computer company churn superior computer lower lower price
This one sector despite relatively small term private GDP le percent responsible TFP growth entire economy
Computers experienced dramatic price decline extraordinary investment growth past two decade
The price computer investment United States decreased remarkable rate percent per year whereas broader investment category computer part producer durable equipment PDE increased percent per year
At time mostly response rapid price decline business undertook massive investment computer
Starting near zero computer share real PDE investment United States increased percent
With cumulative investment new computer equipment near billion company clearly embraced computer
Countries across globe also rapidly accumulating computer
Between growth information technology market exceeded GDP growth member country Organization Economic Cooperation Development OECD
These figure present compelling view depth breadth computer revolution
From Main Street Wall Street computer appear everywhere computer chip also found inside automobile telephone television set
Yet aggregate productivity growth remains flat historic standard
And slowest productivity growth
This apparent inconsistency heart computer productivity paradox
Any attempt explore paradox however must move beyond data based
The aggregate data hide many illuminating detail
For company computer production input invest like new assembly line building employee training
Not company use computer way however
Nor company benefit computer investment
These important difference lost data
Furthermore computer also output particular manufacturing sector
To explore difference economy divided private sector ranked according use computer
Eight sector use computer percent capital form computer labeled sector
As shown Table eight sector accounted percent total value added percent computer capital input
Computers highly concentrated within three service finance insurance real estate FIRE service includes business personal service software health care legal account percent computer input
In manufacturing five sector used computer intensively enough labeled accounted le percent total manufacturing output
This wide variation computer use evident recent survey adoption technology
For example staggering percent manufacturing plant surveyed Census Bureau used none advanced technology
Moreover pattern adoption varied greatly industry technology
In fact surveyed technology showed use rate greater percent many particularly laser robot automated material sensor depend computer used fewer percent surveyed plant
The prevalent technology design numerically controlled machine system
Virtually identical survey Canada Australia confirm diversity reported manufacturer
OECD survey also show computer highly concentrated specific sector
In Canada France Japan United Kingdom example information communication equipment steadily increasing share total investment much highly concentrated service sector
In OECD estimate indicate service sector contained nearly percent embodied information technology seven major industrial nation capital concentrated primarily finance insurance service trade
More specific data France Germany suggest computer becoming universal industry
Nearly percent worker French bank insurance industry used personal computer computer terminal
This proportion percent substantially exceeds percent French manufacturing industry
In Germany nearly percent surveyed company service sector report computer important innovation activity
When price input fall company respond substituting cheaper input expensive one
With enormous price decline computer one would expect see company substitute le expensive computer relatively expensive labor input
For example company might replace written record electronic record
Detailed analysis sectoral data suggests exactly happened
The eight sector invested computer rapidly substituted input
From eight sector report annual growth real computer input excess percent seven eight percent see Table
When compared growth rate labor output sector swift accumulation computer appears even striking
In contrast phenomenal growth rate computer capital labor hour declined three sector experienced growth rate percent two
Similarly output growth ranged percent percent per year
Moreover substituting computer input limited sector phenomenon observed virtually every sector economy
Several independent study United Kingdom Japan France also suggest important part computer revolution substitution input
The French study example found strong positive relationship proportion output per hour
A survey Japanese manufacturing distribution company find information network complement job substitute job
Rather looking empirical relationship computer productivity employment pattern Australian Bureau Statistics used subjective although still informative approach
In survey manufacturing company nearly percent rated lower labor cost important reason introducing new technology
A study found almost percent company cited reducing labor cost significant crucial objective technological innovation
These survey result offer still evidence company expect capital substitute production input
These result suggest large part computer revolution entail substitution one production input computer others labor type capital
But
The answer depends productivity defined measured one mean
Economists use two distinct concept productivity average labor productivity ALP total factor productivity TFP
Although concept related used interchangeably TFP productivity measure favored economist analyzing production process
ALP defined simply output per hour worked
A major advantage measure computational output labor input statistic relatively easy obtain
Since however economist recognized labor one many production input labor access input especially physical capital key determinant ALP
That labor augmented machine better equipment worker produce
This increase output need reflect harder work improved efficiency simply due increase complementary input available labor force This key insight led concept TFP defined output per unit total input
Rather calculating output per unit labor ALP TFP compare output composite index input labor physical capital land energy intermediate material purchased service augmented quality improvement different input weighted relative cost share
Increased TFP often interpreted technological progress accurately reflects factor generate additional output input
New technology key source TFP growth economy scale managerial skill change organization production
Furthermore technological progress embodied least part new investment
ALP TFP fundamentally different concept although TFP important determinant ALP
ALP worker produce worker better machinery work capital deepening worker become skilled labor quality entire production process improves TFP growth
Despite connection two concept trend toward greater use computer implies different thing measure productivity
If investment computer capital primarily input substitution ALP increase labor supported capital
TFP however affected directly increase computer increase output direct impact capital input
It increase many analyst mind argue increased investment computer result higher productivity
It easier define productivity statistic measure apply
There growing consensus among economist output growth productivity growth poorly measured especially service sector high concentration computer
This measurement problem part fundamental issue concerning output growth quality change
Most economist agree quality improvement important form output growth need measured
The Bureau Economic Analysis BEA officially measure enormous quality change computer equipment output growth
Based joint work IBM BEA us sophisticated statistical technique create price index track price relevant characteristic processor speed memory
These price index allow BEA measure production real computing power count output growth
Thus price computer equipment fallen extraordinary rate real computer investment rapidly grown share total investment business equipment
For sector economy however output harder define measure
In FIRE sector example BEA extrapolates official output growth bank based employment growth labor productivity constant definition
Yet would argue innovation ATMs online banking increased quality bank service
Because difficulty type concentrated service sector output productivity estimate sector must interpreted caution
In early industrial world experienced major growth slowdown term aggregate output ALP TFP
Economists offered many possible reason breakdown Bretton Woods currency arrangement energy crisis increase regulation return normalcy unique period increase share unmeasured clear consensus yet emerged
Because computer revolution began midst global slowdown untangling relationship computer productivity growth particularly difficult
For example drop ALP growth percent percent mean computer lowered ALP growth
Or would slowdown much worse computer revolution never taken place
Without proper counterfactual productivity growth would without difficult identify true impact computer
Our approach problem compare ALP growth sector database slowdown period Chart compare growth rate average labor productivity five sector manufacturing manufacturing sector
For early period labor productivity growth roughly two percent per year sector percent per year sector
Both group suffered productivity slowdown ALP growth rate fell percent per year period
As computer continued evolve proliferate business adapted production process changed
Personal classified separate investment good dominant form computer investment ALP growth accelerated sector manufacturing
Between sector posted strong ALP growth percent per year whereas manufacturing sector managed percent per year
Because ALP growth sector prior lower manufacturing sector analysis strongly suggests computer important impact labor productivity growth manufacturing
The comparison nonmanufacturing sector yield quite different result obvious ALP gain sector outside manufacturing Chart
Rather sector sector show healthy productivity growth prior sluggish productivity growth thereafter Labor productivity grew percent per year sector nonmanufacturing percent nonmanufacturing sector
The sharp contrast productivity growth sector manufacturing service highlight difficulty associated productivity measurement
Economists long argued output productivity growth understated service sector due intangible nature service unmeasured quality change poor data
These result support conjecture imply measurement problem becoming severe service sector
This suggests much computer service sector captured official productivity number
Although measurement error probably understate output productivity growth service sector change finding significant input substitution
In trade FIRE sector example growth labor slowed computer input increased percent per year
Because capital labor input measured independently output type primary input substitution subject downward bias TFP growth
Whatever true rate output TFP growth service sector clearly substituting cheap computer expensive input
Estimates TFP growth sector demonstrate relationship growth computer use
TFP grew sector fell others stayed others obvious pattern relating TFP growth computer use
Nor relationship evident eight sector see Table
These finding suggest contrast increase ALP TFP gain widespread adoption computer
Many consider disappointing
Learning lag adjustment cost measurement error suggested reason slow impact computer TFP growth
It important remember however finding entirely consistent evidence input substitution
If computer user simply substituting one production input another reflects capital deepening TFP growth
Recall TFP grows worker produce output input
If investment new computer allows production entirely new type output example complex derivative financial service industry new product directly attributable new computer input TFP growth
This conclusion partly reflects BEA explicit adjustment improved quality computer input economist agree quality change important component capital accumulation
That computer investment deflated BEA official price deflator enormous improvement performance computer folded estimate computer capital
Quality improvement effectively measured capital capital becomes important source growth TFP residual account smaller proportion output growth
So far analysis focused role computer input production process
But computer also output company produce computer sell investment intermediate good sector consumption export good
Because observed input substitution sector driven rapid price decline computer equipment important examine production computer investigate source price decline
The data show TFP primary source growth sector major contributor modest TFP revival economy particularly manufacturing
From virtually entire growth output sector attributable TFP growth output grew much faster input caused large TFP residual
In fact output grew percent per year even though labor energy material input actually declined
The sector also important user computer nearly percent growth output attributable capital service come computer capital period
Rapid growth TFP sector contrast sluggish TFP growth entire economy fell percent per year percent period
Even sector showed negative TFP growth period
After however story different
While annual TFP growth sector rebounded mildly percent per year TFP growth sector jumped percent
The aggregate economy consists definition sector component
How much TFP growth reflects TFP growth sector
In much total TFP growth
In TFP growth sector remained high increase TFP growth manufacturing sector accounted le total percent
Recent estimate TFP growth manufacturing industry confirm trend
Of manufacturing sector analyzed Bureau Labor Statistics BLS industrial commercial machinery computer produced showed rapid annual TFP growth percent per year
Total manufacturing hand showed TFP growth percent period
Although estimate directly comparable derived database confirm importance sector TFP growth
Given substantial work BEA computer price real output growth sector probably among best measured
Thus estimate rapid output TFP growth sector appear sound
Furthermore result support conventional wisdom computer powerful affordable widespread ever
Recent work BEA however suggests price index also used production input
If quality input semiconductor improving rapidly costing le TFP growth overstated sector use input understated sector produce
This kind mismeasurement primarily affect allocation TFP among sector total TFP
The substitution computer expensive input go long way toward explaining computer paradox
The impact computer observable TFP many observer perhaps expected accumulated stock computer capital
This explains despite pickup labor productivity growth TFP growth remained low
For sector computer measured input contributes directly economic growth
Rapid TFP growth occurs primarily sector faster better computer continually offered price
This reflects fundamental technological advance driving computer revolution make substantial contribution TFP growth
Moreover little indication growth slow
BLS example project labor productivity growth computer office equipment industry accelerate percent per year
If projection correct company continue substitute relatively inexpensive computer costlier older model computer become increasingly important source economic growth

Employee productivity major concern employer lower productivity Every employee need well aware accountable action decision neither pas buck pas blame someone else
Employers often set target feel job done
It well known large pool employee need managed provided direction given assistance
But must also trusted given freedom operate style adopt measure think best deliver result
The employer must ensure part always word encouragement staff
Encouraging help move forward even better make worker feel happy
Innovative way motivating spur even
For example holiday conference paid company found motivate employee immensely
Every employee love feel ear management recognize listen say
Display inter personal skill bos appears humane one rather larger life distant figure help employee warm feel happy working
Employers need set realistic goal within limit achievement
While aggressive employer may want people outstretch achieve farfetched goal may also burn
Team work always help increasing workplace productivity since input form idea mind work
Working alone always happiest situation either especially field
Successful team building working together bound bring best employee may also compete ensuring business winner
The best performing employee happy employee employer find way making people happy
Besides working condition work culture implemented devise way making work seem challenging interesting rather mundane boring
While employer assign task according employee core competence even task best make employee bored work seem monotonous
Employees delighted enhance skill get additional learning opportunity sponsored employer
This help learn feel indebted money spent also add resume obliged perform better applying knowledge gained course
The current trend meeting discussion rather spending time working achieve result lead precious productive time loss
Finally workplace must best machinery device equipment yield error free result minimum possible time
Efficient electronic equipment connectivity issue breakdown help save precious time
They take place paper work yield fast result
Some include Thus idea device enhance efficiency subsequently productivity work place
The device help reduce response time improve customer service cutting cost imperative workplace productivity

Modular programming process subdividing computer program separate
A module separate software component
It often used variety application function component system
Similar function grouped unit programming code separate function developed separate unit code code reused application
programming OOP compatible modular programming concept large extent
Modular programming enables multiple programmer divide work debug piece program independently
Modules modular programming enforce logical boundary component improve maintainability
They incorporated interface
They designed way minimize dependency different module
Teams develop module separately require knowledge module system
Each every modular application version number associated
This provides developer flexibility module maintenance
If change applied module affected subroutine changed
This make program easier read understand
Modular programming main module many auxiliary module
The main module compiled executable EXE call auxiliary module function
Auxiliary module exist separate executable file load main EXE run
Each module unique name assigned PROGRAM statement
Function name across module unique easy access function used main module must exported
Languages support module concept IBM Assembler COBOL RPG FORTRAN Morpho Zonnon Erlang among others
The benefit using modular programming include Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

technique emphasizes separating functionality independent interchangeable contains everything necessary execute one aspect desired functionality
A module interface express element provided required module
The element defined interface detectable module
The contains working code corresponds element declared interface
Modular programming closely related goal facilitating construction large software program system decomposition smaller piece originating around
While historically usage term inconsistent today modular programming refers decomposition code entire program piece structured programming code use structured programming use kind
In programming use interface architectural pattern construct module known
The term like sometimes used instead
In implementation distinct concept package collection module upcoming introduction collection package enhanced access control planned
Furthermore term package us software example
A similar concept typically refers higher level component piece whole module piece individual program
The scale term module varies significantly language Python file module planned module collection package turn collection file
Other term module include used dialect
Languages formally support module concept include CL Morpho several derivative
Conspicuous example language lack support module Pascal original form
As module proposed module added Pascal superseded Modula Oberon included module start various derivative included module
native module since
Modular programming performed even programming language lack explicit syntactic feature support named module
For example also us module programming ILE
With modular programming module perform logically discrete function interacting interface
Often module form DAG case cyclic dependency module seen indicating single module
In case module form DAG arranged hierarchy module independent depending module module depend one
A particular program library module hierarchy turn seen module program library system
When creating modular system instead creating monolithic application smallest component whole several smaller module written separately composed together construct executable application program
Typically also separately via linked
A may perform construction
This make modular designed system built correctly far reusable traditional monolithic design since many module may reused without change project
This also facilitates breaking project several smaller project
Theoretically modularized software project easily assembled large team since team member creating whole system even need know system whole
They focus assigned smaller task claimed counter key assumption actually possible add developer late software making later still
Modular programming form subsystem particularly software library date early software system used
Modular programming per se goal modularity developed late analog concept
The term modular programming date least National Symposium Modular Programming organized Information Systems Institute July key concept SoC
Modules included original specification included extension early implementation later formalized
One first language designed start modular programming
Another early modular language Wirth drew Mesa well original Modula successor influenced later language particularly successor
Modula use like refer object module coincides notation access field record similarly attribute method object widespread seen C Dart Go Java Python among others
Modular programming became widespread original language include module later version notably included form unit
The Extended Pascal ISO standard kept closer modular support
one complete module system including parameterized module map module
In modular programming overshadowed often conflated particularly due popularity Java
For example C family language support object class originally supporting module year later
Java support module form package though primary unit code organization class
However Python prominently used module object start using module primary unit code organization package unit includes support module object vast array module available
Modular programming widespread found virtually major language developed since
The relative importance module varies language language still overlap confusion class unit organization encapsulation distinct concept

ANS Modular programming technique used divide program many small logical manageable functional module block
Every modular program one main module may many sub module
The sub module program also called procedure

Write advantage modular programming
ANS The advantage modular programming
Easy programmer write block module program independently
It reduces program code Same procedure used different number place time
Increases readability program
Easy debug program
Easy design program
Why QBASIC called modular programming language
Because It allows programmer divide program manageable functional module help sub procedure function procedure

What Procedure QB
List type
Procedure independent manageable functional part block solves particular problem given user independently
It also known Sub Module Sub program The type sub module Qbasic Sub Procedure Function procedure A sub procedure small manageable functional part program performs specific task return value calling module
A CALL statement used call sub procedure module
A sub program written SUB statement
Features A funtion procedure small manageable functional part program performs specific task return value main program calling module
It written FUNCTION statement
Features argument passed sub procedure reference value method The consonant variable enclosed parenthesis procedure call statement supplied procedure known argument
It also known actual parameter
Variables sub module procedure declaration accept data variable passed calling module known parameter
also known formal parameter
Arguments passed sub module reference
give procedure access actual variable
method address variable passed procedure
change made proedures variable affect value argument
default mode passing argements
ex CALL TEST A B Arguments passed value method make effect value variable passed procedure even changed procedure
To pas argument value method arguements enclosed individual parenthesis calling statement
Example CALL TEST A B The top level module known main module located top procedure
Sub module program written main module
A program may one one sub module Formal parameter variable used specify declare ypes fata passed sub proedure either sub function
For ex SUB MySub A B Declare Sub MySub A B Actual real parameter arguements used pas real value procedure
Actual parameter may variable consonant For ex
CALL MySub A B A variable defined module accessible module known local variable
accessible module defined
A variable main module accessed module proedure program known global variable
Variable made global declaring DIM SHARED OMMON SHARED SHARED attribute
For ex DELARE SUB TEST A B COMMON SHARED X CALL TEST A b PRINT Y END SUB TEST P Q SHARED Y PRINT P Q END SUB The CALL statement transfer control sub procedure statement sub procedure excutes
used excute sub procedure main module It non executable statement declares name parameter code form body function procedure It used define sub procedure ex
sub test b It used declare procedure function sub modular programming
appear executable statement
ex DECLARE FUNCTION SUM A B It used share variable among part module
It appears sub module
eg shared x It make variable accessible global module
It appears main module DIM SHARED X Y It declares variable global
shared main module sub module
apears main module COMMON SHARED X Y If question related subject feel free mail use comment box

Modular programming mean separating program separate functional unit module
Each module task module called needed
Typically state module encapsulated supposed altered function module
On hand structured programming technique use subprogram function like loop structure program instead liberal use go
If learn programming today wo ever learned write unstructured program
So module different function
A module usually larger single function
Although module exist module comprise function used certain component program
For instance one module could implement logic encode data textual representation another one could implement logic decode data textual representation

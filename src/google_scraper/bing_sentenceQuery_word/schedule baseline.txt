The baseline function measure project deviate
Establishing baseline happens project start otherwise project manager system measure
When client request change team member determine project requires change baseline document change well
Updating information allows team member remain current progress project ensures record change
Project team examine baseline document closing project
They review document determine whether project meet specification
If discrepancy team must address issue determine want make adjustment project
If team decides make change ensure conformance thing must consider
First must consider quality trying achieve
When final product high quality project cost
They must also consider schedule
Making change nearly completed project add additional time project
Costs always important factor project

Project management software calculates variance baseline estimate project performance
projection notebook image TEA A project manager us project management software create detailed project plan containing estimate task cost resource schedule
She save snapshot information create baseline project plan
After project begin software compare baseline estimate current performance calculate variance deviation expectation
A project three constraint scope schedule budget
The scope project accomplish
Constraints guide project manager developing project plan
First defines project requirement establish scope
Next identifies project activity dependency
This determines schedule resource requirement including staffing
The scope schedule resource need establish budget
The baseline project plan separate project plan
Software copy information baseline field contained original project plan
For example software copy task start finish date respective baseline field
If project complex project manager might create multiple baseline audit trail numerous baseline change occurring project execution
During project implementation project manager might update baseline information reflect current condition unforeseen circumstance occur
For example union strike might prevent electrician performing work
Therefore project manager reschedules effort well task must begin electrical work completed
A project manager establishes planned start completion date task
Software calculates planned duration task
She record start date project plan task begin
Upon task completion enters completion date
The actual duration compared planned duration calculate duration variance
A task budget amount le task total spent committed amount determines cost variance
The project manager ass cost schedule variance determine project within budget schedule completion
For example schedule variance might indicate project team member completed group task ahead schedule
Therefore project manager might assign member task behind schedule
If cost variance indicate possible budget overrun might decrease project scope remain within budget
Project failure might occur result requirement creep known scope creep
This work added project begin increasing cost
To address cost potential scope creep might include contingency amount project
Typically amount represents percent total estimated project cost

The schedule copied baseline schedule remains frozen reset
baseline done project changed significantly example negotiated
At point original current baseline becomes invalid compared current schedule
Version schedule reflects formally authorized scope schedule change

It consists three dimension known baseline scheduling schedule risk analysis project control Uyttewaal Vanhoucke
In previous study shown schedule risk analysis project control go hand hand useful tool measure project performance project progress improve project control process corrective action decision making process case project danger
In article International Journal Project Management Vanhoucke project control dimension highlighted based comparison academic result obtained fictitious project data additional test performed set data Belgian company various sector
However little nothing said first dimension dynamic scheduling construction project baseline schedule
In current article similar approach previously published article followed
Based extensive knowledge algorithmic development academic literature past experience using adapted algorithm practical environment illustrated research contribute positively practice constructing project baseline schedule

Before create solution need fully understand problem
In technical architecture known model
In word work client determine system currently work build model using Architecture Design Language diagram create document establishing baseline create solution
With input client create model Inisope company directory service using Archimate
Include page document support explain model
NOTE Updating company directory involves changing record
For example someone fired taken payroll database removed employee directory position going away Human Resources post job ad new employee

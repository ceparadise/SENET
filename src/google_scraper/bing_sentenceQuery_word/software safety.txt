discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Software In use
You also need editor development environment writing debugging program
In using programming environment specially designed Python programming included Python distribution
These program available installation personal computer see
A programming language tool use construct sequence instruction tell computer want
There hundred programming language world
Over course career I taught programming class using least six different language
There best language though I could nominate candidate worst
Different language better worse different kind application
MATLAB example great language manipulating vector matrix
C good language writing program control data network
In course use Python
Python relatively recent addition universe language still growing popularity
I want emphasize course Python
You certainly learn Python good thing
What much important however learn write program solve problem given set basic primitive way combining complex element abstract primitive
This skill transferred many language
You install software personal computer operating system Windows MacOS X
For Windows need OS X need version Python work version NOT compatible
Below direct link common Python installers Download install For OS X Yosemite earlier download install
For OS X El Capitan later download install Python OS Anaconda come numpy matplotlib preinstalled along many python library may ignore installation instruction library Pset
On Python homepage latest version available download actually
Do install
This version backwards compatible code writing course example type print test instead print test
Instead sure download version listed
IDLE standard Python development environment
Its name acronym ntegrated eve opment nvironment
It work well Unix Windows platform
It Python shell window give access Python interactive mode
It also file editor let create edit existing Python source file
During following discussion IDLE feature instead passively reading along start IDLE try replicate action
You type Python code directly shell prompt
Whenever enter complete code fragment executed
For instance typing pressing Enter cause following displayed IDLE also used calculator Addition subtraction multiplication operator built Python language
This mean use right away
If want use square root calculation need module
Do worry mean right cover later course

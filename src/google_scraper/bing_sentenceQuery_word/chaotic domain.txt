Aggregated enterprise architecture wisdom Link How collaborate chaos
Or put way round apparent chaos drive decision guide towards desired yet emergent aim
As see post kind exactly process There bunch theme going right
I usual overshot deadline I somehow produce respective slidedeck weekend I stuck
I read back I memory I meant say I wrote month ago I remember something design uniqueness chaos
I need get new book written time another conference early next year mean I need decide topic I chance getting done time likely topic Business Anarchist theme RBPEA enterprise architecture theme focus might call Chaotic domain
And I retrieving old potential hence included reviewing sheer misery fight Dave Snowden apparent inadequacy Cynefin framework concerning Chaotic
In short I primed recursively also mean primed working Chaotic
Which exactly happened
To understand chaos watch collision small see watch impact
The classic illustration see chaotic movement energised particle air observing impact larger visible space
In pure though mechanic
Once yet sometimes story emerges something like collaboration yet fundamentally different root
So watch collision watch choice watch impact watch outcome
The key point I primed work Chaotic space
I somewhat loner term I work right I stuck rather I stuck happened I stuck I describing
I need impact something else get whole thing moving I idea control arrive
In sense like supersaturated solution set nuclear mass waiting brought together waiting right happen
And happen thing tend happen fast
First collision I talking weekend fame latest irregular yet HEC meeting
HEC archetypal English ham egg chip
He come back Philippines traffic may often definitely uh chaotic
And yet work say two rule principle see gap direction want go take hit anything
Saigon traffic Dimitry Teslya Kevin also added interesting point get angry said breaking rule effect almost acknowledges formal rule road anyone break
It collaboration normal sense everyone divergent aim
And yet divergence somehow support shared aim everyone able get want go quickly possible minimum fuss chaos
Gridlock often arises misguided attempt control chaos whereas working chaos end need
Next collision article seen seems tie well SCAN Don panic thinking say
Which brings next collision
The article Kai alluded another close colleague Australian site I often visit probably I seen
To describe collaboration Shawn us Cynefin framework peculiar layout Cynefin collaboration source Anecdote Shawn us example illustrate different type collaboration effect summarises working together mutual
His aim show term collaboration misleading actually several type interaction going
He us Simple Complicated Complex Chaotic categorisation Cynefin framework per layout help tease distinction
I summarise Shawn description follows Those distinction important I think great way describe
Yet diagram implies come Chaotic domain Cynefin show u would put perfect absolute blank The last domain Cynefin framework chaos
This impossible discern relationship cause effect
The best approach domain simply take action
Paradoxically really matter group style used way working either create opportunity complex space collaboration take effect push situation simple domain approach effective
As I understand entirely correct interpretation Cynefin certainly Snowden argued forcefully many time comment weblog
He even say Chaos Cynefin transitionary state word Chaotic perhaps really regarded domain
And despite Snowden may say clear published Cynefin dynamic Shawn description Cynefin way supposed deal Chaotic Shawn reassertion official Cynefin tactic Chaotic always take action action purpose moving u another domain
It also abundantly clear way Snowden described echoed Shawn description almost difference Cynefin Chaotic central Disorder place according Cynefin need get away
Which look chaos traffic Manila Saigon many place look context post way describe happens chaotic space

If Snowden want say mean something else need change model simple really
But I think unlikely happen least huge investment centrality supposed finality term like emergence Complex domain position Cynefin core space
This trap Cynefin illustrated well one Snowden slide purported ascent Simple Complicated Complex sudden supposedly final stop anything Chaotic realm firmly expunged story
Concept Lifecycles c Dave Snowden Cognitive Edge As I explained post never made sense even term basic logic clearly absurd exclude entire domain supposedly part framework
For anything deal chaos certainly must Cynefin frankly incomplete misleading safe use hence explicit warning post best way use Cynefin EA use
Yet Cynefin inadequate purpose Shawn indicates real mean describe sensemaking Chaotic domain use
Which next collision come story
Kai Schlüter followed Tweet post website linking Shawn article rather nice categorisation EPIC thence Kai framework GLUE framework sensemaking
We keep EPIC GLUE moment seems real value Shawn version SCAN might help show u collaboration really look like Chaotic domain
SCAN Cynefin similar layout opposite orientation easiest way comparison apply Shawn diagram And compare SCAN frame The comparison tell u straight away exactly I described bloomin great hole Cynefin around dealing particularly term happens get closer action
See also post
That also reminds u versus action appear Cynefin either follow rule kind nothing supposed always avoid
If fully understand collaboration need something would help u understand work whatever kind collaboration exists Chaotic space rather merely run away fast Shawn post Snowden assertion would seem imply
There also another twist one key distinction SCAN
Hence discussion collaboration Chaotic saying real collaboration direct collective possible excuse implied Shawn description example
Yet would coordination scope discussion
rule applied personal
Whichever look Cynefin refusal engage Chaotic end looking like view every Other viewed solely term relation centre case Cynefin view Complex emergent
Which practice make Cynefin unhelpful misleading form already
Anyway let ignore Cynefin many concern work purpose really need said
What need instead kind description explains tool bridge across divide support yet action
What far crossmap follows Which tell u quite bit need find tell u
Yet hit another collision idea
The crosslink Kai mentioned post set yet interrelated mode combined sensemaking action Which turn aligns well SCAN Which add three theme list And quite accurate label
As natural anarchist notoriously difficult get artist collaborate even harder get cooperate let alone coordinate Shawn term much like apocryphal impossibility herding cat
And yet collaborate hence quote often attributed Picasso good artist copy great artist steal
The real key exactly Shawn indicates post depends mean collaborate As Shawn say Chaotic domain domain This impossible discern relationship cause effect
That entirely true Chaotic saying context discernable relationship
But bring notion cause effect collaboration picture
Doing risk forcing u Reality assertion purported relationship order understand collaboration kind collaboration
What need instead look form collaboration depend relationship given Shawn criterion also probably depend mutual
So find Chaotic domain
Well one direct example seen post happened Kai Kevin I bounced bounced idea way arguably relationship
Another example chaotic traffic holding Chaotic faith rather Simple belief everyone get mess best way higher throughput would obtained formal control see example PDF
In effect see kind working chaos rather trying pretend exist
Which brings u another point add list What form collaboration also form distinct context direct relation explicit implicit relationship
Mention constraint though may lead u straight yet another trap
The constraint seen level collectively drive toward clearly might lead u think dealing sits comfortably Complex domain per Cynefin ilk
But place correctly domain Complex
If get point wrong mean understanding collaboration actually play chaotic space
Finally suggestion extend Shawn triad collaboration complete set
The Artist would often talk inspiration yet inspiration arises collision others
Which implies Classic collaboration always aim chaotic always aim somehow brief moment converge diverge often repeatedly recursively within respective context
So obvious next point design enterprise
An interesting challenge I
anyone

branch focused behavior highly sensitive
interdisciplinary theory stating within apparent randomness underlying pattern constant repetition reliance programming initial point known
The describes small change one state deterministic nonlinear system result large difference later state
butterfly flapping wing Brazil cause hurricane Texas
Small difference initial condition due rounding error numerical computation yield widely diverging outcome dynamical response popularly referred butterfly prediction behavior impossible general
This happens even though system meaning future behavior fully determined initial condition element involved
In word deterministic nature system make predictable
This behavior known simply
The theory summarized Chaos When present determines future approximate present approximately determine future
Chaotic behavior exists many natural system
It also occurs spontaneously system artificial component
This behavior studied analysis chaotic analytical technique
Chaos theory application several discipline including anthropology
The theory formed basis field study theory process
Chaos theory concern deterministic system whose behavior principle predicted
Chaotic system predictable become random
The amount time behavior chaotic system effectively predicted depends three thing How much uncertainty tolerated forecast accurately current state measured time scale depending dynamic system called
Some example Lyapunov time chaotic electrical circuit millisecond weather system day unproven solar system million year
In chaotic system uncertainty forecast increase elapsed time
Hence mathematically doubling forecast time square proportional uncertainty forecast
This mean practice meaningful prediction made interval two three time Lyapunov time
When meaningful prediction made system appears random
In common usage chaos mean state disorder
However chaos theory term defined precisely
Although universally accepted mathematical definition chaos exists commonly used definition originally formulated say classify dynamical system chaotic must property In case last two property shown actually imply sensitivity initial condition
In case often practically significant property sensitivity initial condition need stated definition
If attention restricted second property implies two
An alternative general weaker definition chaos us first two property list
In continuous time dynamical system chaos phenomenon spontaneous breakdown topological supersymmetry intrinsic property evolution operator stochastic deterministic partial differential equation
This picture dynamical chaos work deterministic model also model external noise important generalization physical point view reality dynamical system experience influence stochastic environment
Within picture dynamical behavior associated chaotic dynamic consequence application spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking
mean point chaotic system arbitrarily closely approximated point significantly different future path trajectory
Thus arbitrarily small change perturbation current trajectory may lead significantly different future behavior
Sensitivity initial condition popularly known title paper given Washington entitled
The flapping wing represents small change initial condition system cause chain event leading phenomenon
Had butterfly flapped wing trajectory system might vastly different
A consequence sensitivity initial condition start limited amount information system usually case practice beyond certain time system longer predictable
This familiar case weather generally predictable week ahead
Of course mean say anything event far future restriction system present
With weather know temperature naturally reach fall earth current ca say exactly day hottest temperature year
In mathematical term measure sensitivity initial condition
Given two starting infinitesimally close initial separation two trajectory end diverging rate given time λ Lyapunov exponent
The rate separation depends orientation initial separation vector whole spectrum Lyapunov exponent exist
The number Lyapunov exponent equal number dimension phase space though common refer largest one
For example maximal Lyapunov exponent MLE often used determines overall predictability system
A positive MLE usually taken indication system chaotic
Also property relate sensitivity initial condition discussed theory property
mean system evolves time given region eventually overlap given region
This mathematical concept mixing corresponds standard intuition mixing colored fluid example chaotic system
Topological mixing often omitted popular account chaos equate chaos sensitivity initial condition
However sensitive dependence initial condition alone give chaos
For example consider simple dynamical system produced repeatedly doubling initial value
This system sensitive dependence initial condition everywhere since pair nearby point eventually becomes widely separated
However example topological mixing therefore chaos
Indeed extremely simple behavior point except tend positive negative infinity
For chaotic system mean every point space approached arbitrarily closely periodic orbit
The defined one simplest system density periodic orbit
For example approximately unstable orbit period similar orbit exist period etc
indeed period specified
Sharkovskii theorem basis Li Yorke proof system exhibit regular cycle period three also display regular cycle every length well completely chaotic orbit
Some dynamical system like defined chaotic everywhere many case chaotic behavior found subset phase space
The case interest arise chaotic behavior take place since large set initial condition lead orbit converge chaotic region
An easy way visualize chaotic attractor start point attractor simply plot subsequent orbit
Because topological transitivity condition likely produce picture entire final attractor indeed orbit shown figure right give picture general shape Lorenz attractor
This attractor result simple model weather system
The Lorenz attractor perhaps one chaotic system diagram probably one first also one complex give rise interesting pattern little imagination look like wing butterfly
Unlike attractor arise chaotic system known great detail complexity
Strange attractor occur dynamical system Lorenz system system
Other discrete dynamical system repelling structure called form boundary basin attraction fixed point
Julia set thought strange repellers
Both strange attractor Julia set typically structure calculated
Discrete chaotic system logistic map exhibit strange attractor whatever
In contrast dynamical system show strange attractor arise three dimension
never chaotic dynamical system display chaotic behavior must either
The state differential equation regular behavior
The Lorenz attractor discussed generated system three make time system
Five term right hand side linear two quadratic total seven term
Another chaotic attractor generated one nonlinear term seven
Sprott found system five term one nonlinear term exhibit chaos certain parameter value
Zhang Heidel showed least dissipative conservative quadratic system quadratic system three four term side exhibit chaotic behavior
The reason simply put solution system asymptotic surface therefore solution well behaved
While theorem show continuous dynamical system Euclidean chaotic continuous system exhibit chaotic behavior
Perhaps surprisingly chaos may occur also linear system provided infinite dimensional
A theory linear chaos developed branch mathematical analysis known
In third derivative respect time
As differential equation form sometimes called
It shown jerk equation equivalent system three first order ordinary differential equation certain sense minimal setting solution showing chaotic behaviour
This motivates mathematical interest jerk system
Systems involving fourth higher derivative called accordingly hyperjerk system
A jerk system behavior described jerk equation certain jerk equation simple electronic circuit model solution
These circuit known jerk circuit
One interesting property jerk circuit possibility chaotic behavior
In fact certain chaotic system Lorenz attractor conventionally described system three differential equation combine single although rather complicated jerk equation
Nonlinear jerk system sense minimally complex system show chaotic behaviour chaotic system involving two ordinary differential equation system resulting equation second order
An example jerk equation nonlinearity magnitude Here adjustable parameter
This equation chaotic solution implemented following jerk circuit required nonlinearity brought two diode In circuit resistor equal value except capacitor equal size
The dominant frequency
The output correspond x variable output corresponds first derivative x output corresponds second derivative
Under right condition chaos spontaneously evolves lockstep pattern
In four condition suffice produce synchronization chaotic system
Examples include pendulum firefly resonance large array
An early proponent chaos theory
In studying found orbit nonperiodic yet forever increasing approaching fixed point
In published influential study chaotic motion free particle gliding frictionlessly surface constant negative curvature called
Hadamard able show trajectory unstable particle trajectory diverge exponentially one another positive
Chaos theory began field
Later study also topic nonlinear carried
Except Smale study directly inspired physic problem case Birkhoff turbulence astronomical problem case Kolmogorov radio engineering case Cartwright Littlewood
Although chaotic planetary motion observed experimentalists encountered turbulence fluid motion nonperiodic oscillation radio circuit without benefit theory explain seeing
Despite initial insight first half twentieth century chaos theory became formalized first became evident scientist prevailing system theory time simply could explain observed behavior certain experiment like

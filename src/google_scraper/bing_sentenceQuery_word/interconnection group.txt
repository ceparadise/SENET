We member Association Computing Machinery
Sounds sort electromechanical
Given today computing technology probably good thing mostly known ACM
There time physical focus attention
These behemoth occupied room full equipment
Now fairness ever visited cloud computing data center dominant impression still vast room full machinery
But carry huge quantity computing power pocket purse
Computing remarkable artifact origin centered ability make piece equipment calculate programmable control
Alan Turing whose birthday celebrated year drew dramatic attention artificiality system call Universal Turing Machine
This conceptual artifact emphasizes artificial nature computation
In physical world science largely model measurement prediction validation
Our ability predict likely outcome based model fundamental central notion scientific method
The term computer science raise expectation least mind ability define model make prediction behavior computer computing system
I think fairly good capability measure predict physical performance computing device
We measure clock speed latency memory size computational capacity standard computing task
In view however much le able make model prediction behavior performance artifact label software
An almost flippant analogy difference measuring modeling predicting neural brain function trying thought
That software artifact seems obvious
Moreover strikingly complex artifact filled layer upon layer component exhibit dependency complex often unpredicted say unpredictable behavior
Even though software system ought clue system behave perform generally reliable ability anticipate state system get vulnerability performance ability adapt changing condition
When write piece software ability predict many mistake made bug
Do know long take find fix
Do know many new bug fix create
Can say anything concrete vulnerability
What probability exploitation
Murphy Law suggests bug exploited nefarious purpose
ACM Turing Award recipient Fred Brooks wonderful book capture weakness understanding nature software
A complementary look topic found ACM Turing recipient Herbert Simon
Chapter deal hierarchy complexity touching way try bound complexity modular hierarchical structure still challenged emergent behavior masked way beguiling apparent simplicity hierarchy
The richness field grown year existence organization
Computers computing software system seemingly omnipresent
We growing increasingly dependent upon must billion line code
Some unknown wag quipped reason computer world failed yet Internet
But may coming collapse I hope interconnection vast number programmable device Internet successor
As group professional devoted evolution understanding application software hardware myriad problem opportunity activity modern society responsibility pursue science computer science
We must develop better tool much deeper understanding system invent far greater ability make prediction behavior complex connected interacting system
I consider membership ACM mark recognition responsibility
I hope share view encourage others profession join ACM quest science discipline

The science computer science elusive always
The science aspect well discussed Minds Machines time ago outcome science understood many way hard make strong claim computing science
I sure really question science computer science amongst practice
Let take one particular section article supposed convince u computer science overlook essential problem dire need science When write piece software ability predict many mistake made bug
Do know long take find fix
Do know many new bug fix create
It honestly take effort complain know nothing bug search quickly find approach answering question indistinguishable exemplar science anyone think
See Adaptive Bug Prediction Analyzing Project History nice piece work Sunghun Kim referencing equally valid strongly scientific approach answering precisely question see table page
I sure I could provide equally sciency example approach answering question posed article sorry nothing new could fellow computer scientist I thinking many folk even care read article wo busy science
If math part even core science mind say computing science science
Computing science application derived seemed two interdependent part essence computing make former science
People apt say lambda calculus analysis include category theorem formal logic algorithm data structure part math science hard think internet software hardware architecture thing science
generally reliable ability anticipate state system get vulnerability performance ability adapt changing condition
I got discussion French PhD done doctoral thesis formal method
He said academia pretty good idea industry tends ignore
It left thinking formal method required knowledge software developer
Its hard training training engineering profession
I think strict separation computer science software engineering must made
Computer theory computation database information theory data structure algorithm artificial intelligence etc
maintain reliable ability anticipate state system get state machine performance analysis algorithm Master Theorem ability adapt changing condition artificial intelligence etc
It indeed application science engineering uncertainty open sloppiness occurs reliability weakend
Just designing perfectly safe sound bridge impossible due pragmatic transcendance theory physical realm designing perfectly reliable software system even slight complexity difficult
In physical world science largely model measurement prediction validation
Not
In physical world science also discovery entirely new thing unexpected like electricity Galvani radioactivity Becquerel least previously unseen unconfirmed like electromagnetic wave Hertz
In sense I think inventor Simula APL LISP relational database real science deservedly received Turing Awards discovery
In physical world science also collection systematization large amount actual information like Lamarck Darwin biology I think The Art Computer Programming somehow comparable former latter well take time reach stage also example science Turing Award deservedly received
Information fact flow persist Knowledge interpreted information Phenomena Observable information
Architecture Designed knowledge Science systematized knowledge Engineering transformation science architecture practical
Computers information engine Computer Science information engine science confusing almost nonsensical term avoided
Computers device enablers transform logical physical
They engineering relationship science
Information Science like Natural Science scientific category science
Natural Sciences abstract knowledge preconstructed phenomenon
Information science construct phenomenon abstract knowledge
Information Architecture IA architecture used create science
It also science used create architecture
Information science include IA Management Science Mathematics Philosophy
Each information science centered around single Information Design Because IA design body knowledge bounded human imagination
Entire universe created
Even understatement possible
I appreciate thoughtful comment
I liked especially observation distinguish engineering science
This lead one ask scientific aspect formal aspect
computing inform applied science engineering activity try make practical insight science produce
vint cerf Information Architecture transformational
It science one level abstaction removed science
The first derivative Information Architecture science transforms science architecture
Information Architecture architecture used create information science
It system creating design
It take design creates system
A system also created many iteration learning knowledege advancement
The body knowledge gradually matures becomes vast complete enough considered science
Information Architecture design science
Applying Information Archicture body knowledge accelerates learning process
Science matures accelerated pace
The science IA architecture IA recursive engineering relationship
I observed engineering relationship intuitive
Those immersed creating IA science removed creating IA Architecture
The Architects learned enough science
The scientist well versed application science architecture
The science applied development practical application
The architecture science mature slowly result
The Sciences Artificial Simon contains interesting discussion viewpoint science focus model absence arbitrariness
within applicability range scientific result
Newton Laws unavoidable
well speed light well microscopic
In contrast computer language natural language one possibility zillion design
In Simon viewpoint science language design consists unavoidable aspect
Simon work start bound human intelligence communication ability unavoidable derives insight arbitrariness short condition apply typically competitive dynamic environment implying pressure adapt within finite time window
A old information technology also absence arbitrariness map choice symbol representation corresponding reality
When two map disagree observation corresponding reality reveals map unavoidably correct analogous experiment proving Newton right Aristotle wrong
The real world full source inevitability IT artefact may model without introducing arbitrariness distinguishes science
Moreover utilizing capability observe sense adapt even actuate IT system go far beyond ancient map technology building software artefact share absence arbitrariness Newton Laws Einstein theory

A set loosely tightly connected work together many respect viewed single system
Unlike computer cluster set perform task controlled scheduled software
The component cluster usually connected fast computer used server running instance
In circumstance node use hardware operating system although setup
using OSCAR different operating system used computer different hardware
Clusters usually deployed improve performance availability single computer typically much single computer comparable speed availability
Computer cluster emerged result convergence number computing trend including availability microprocessor network software
They wide range applicability deployment ranging small business cluster handful node fastest world
The desire get computing power better reliability orchestrating number computer given rise variety architecture configuration
The computer clustering approach usually always connects number readily available computing node
personal computer used server via fast
The activity computing node orchestrated clustering middleware software layer sits atop node allows user treat cluster large one cohesive computing unit
via concept
Computer clustering relies centralized management approach make node available orchestrated shared server
It distinct approach also use many node far
A computer cluster may simple system connects two personal computer may fast
A basic approach building cluster cluster may built personal computer produce alternative traditional
An early project showed viability concept
The developer used toolkit library achieve high performance relatively low cost
Although cluster may consist personal computer connected simple network cluster architecture may also used achieve high level performance
The organization semiannual list fastest often includes many cluster
world fastest machine cluster architecture
Greg Pfister stated cluster invented specific vendor customer could fit work one computer needed backup
Pfister estimate date time
The formal engineering basis cluster computing mean parallel work sort arguably invented published come regarded seminal paper parallel processing
The history early computer cluster le directly tied history early network one primary motivation development network link computing resource creating de facto computer cluster
The first production system designed cluster Burroughs
This allowed four computer either one two processor tightly coupled common disk storage subsystem order distribute workload
Unlike standard multiprocessor system computer could restarted without disrupting overall operation
The first commercial loosely coupled clustering product Attached Resource Computer ARC system developed using cluster interface
Clustering per se really take released product operating system named OpenVMS
The ARC VAXcluster product supported parallel computing also shared device
The idea provide advantage parallel processing maintaining data reliability uniqueness
Two noteworthy early commercial cluster circa product also circa primarily business use
Within time frame computer cluster used parallelism outside computer commodity network began use within computer
Following success delivered introduced internal parallelism via
While early supercomputer excluded cluster relied time fastest supercomputer
relied cluster architecture
Computer cluster may configured different purpose ranging general purpose business need support scientific calculation
In either case cluster may use approach
Note attribute described exclusive computer cluster may also use approach
cluster configuration share computational workload provide better overall performance
For example web server cluster may assign different query different node overall response time optimized
However approach may significantly differ among application
cluster used scientific computation would balance load different algorithm cluster may use simple assigning new request different node
Computer cluster used purpose rather handling operation web service database
For instance computer cluster might support vehicle crash weather
Very tightly coupled computer cluster designed work may approach
also known cluster HA cluster improve availability cluster approach
They operate redundant used provide service system component fail
HA cluster implementation attempt use redundancy cluster component eliminate
There commercial implementation cluster many operating system
The project one commonly used HA package operating system
Clusters primarily designed performance mind installation based many factor fault tolerance also allows simpler scalability high performance situation low frequency maintenance routine resource consolidation centralized management
Other advantage include enabling data recovery event disaster providing parallel data processing high processing capacity
One issue designing cluster tightly coupled individual node may
For instance single computer job may require frequent communication among node implies cluster share dedicated network densely located probably homogeneous node
The extreme computer job us one node need little communication approaching
In Beowulf system application program never see computational node also called slave computer interact Master specific computer handling scheduling management slave
In typical implementation Master two network interface one communicates private Beowulf network slave general purpose network organization
The slave computer typically version operating system local memory disk space
However private slave network may also large shared file server store global persistent data accessed slave needed
A special purpose tuned running astrophysical simulation using parallel treecode rather general purpose scientific computation
Due increasing computing power generation novel use emerged repurposed HPC cluster
Some example game console cluster cluster
Another example consumer game product workstation us multiple graphic accelerator processor chip
Besides game console graphic card used instead
The use graphic card rather GPU calculation grid computing vastly economical using CPU despite le precise
However using value become precise work CPU still much le costly purchase cost
Computer cluster historically run separate physical
With advent cluster node may run separate physical computer different operating system painted virtual layer look similar
The cluster may also virtualized various configuration maintenance take place
An example implementation virtualization manager
As computer cluster appearing
One element distinguished three class time early supercomputer relied
To date cluster typically use physically shared memory many supercomputer architecture also abandoned
However use essential modern computer cluster
Examples include Microsoft
Two widely used approach communication cluster node MPI PVM
PVM developed around MPI available
PVM must directly installed every cluster node provides set software library paint node parallel virtual machine
PVM provides environment task resource management fault notification
PVM used user program written C Fortran etc
MPI emerged early discussion among organization
The initial effort supported
Rather starting anew design MPI drew various feature available commercial system time
The MPI specification gave rise specific implementation
MPI implementation typically use socket connection
MPI widely available communication model enables parallel program written language etc
Thus unlike PVM provides concrete implementation MPI specification implemented system
One challenge use computer cluster cost administrating time high cost administrating N independent machine cluster N node
In case provides advantage lower administration cost
This also made popular due ease administration
When large cluster need access large amount data becomes challenge
In heterogeneous cluster complex application environment performance job depends characteristic underlying cluster
Therefore mapping task onto CPU core GPU device provides significant challenge
This area ongoing research algorithm combine extend proposed studied
When node cluster fails strategy may employed keep rest system operational
Fencing process isolating node protecting shared resource node appears malfunctioning
There two class fencing method one disables node disallows access resource shared disk
The method stand Shoot The Other Node In The Head meaning suspected node disabled powered
For instance us power controller turn inoperable node
The approach disallows access resource without powering node
This may include via fibre channel fencing disable port GNBD fencing disable access GNBD server
Load balancing cluster web server use cluster architecture support large number user typically user request routed specific node achieving without cooperation given main goal system providing rapid user access shared data
However computer cluster perform complex computation small number user need take advantage parallel processing capability cluster partition computation among several node
program continues remain technical challenge used effectuate higher via simultaneous execution separate portion program different processor
The development debugging parallel program cluster requires parallel language primitive well suitable tool discussed HPDF resulted HPD specification
Tools developed debug parallel implementation computer cluster use message passing
The NOW Network Workstations system gather cluster data store database system PARMON developed India allows visual observation management large cluster
used restore given state system node fails long computation
This essential large cluster given number node increase likelihood node failure heavy computational load
Checkpointing restore system stable state processing resume without recompute result
The world support various cluster software application clustering
cluster allow incoming request service distributed across multiple cluster node
cluster integrated provide automatic process migration among homogeneous node
OpenSSI openMosix Kerrighed implementation
computer cluster Server based platform provides piece High Performance Computing like Job Scheduler MSMPI library management tool
set middleware technology created EGEE project
also used schedule manage largest supercomputer cluster see list
Although computer cluster permanent fixture attempt made build cluster specific computation
However larger scale system system follower

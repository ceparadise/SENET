How well prepared organization innovate using data science
In report two leading data scientist Booz Allen Hamilton describe characteristic mature data science capability
This full report Peter Guerra Kirk Borne
If want build ship drum people collect wood assign task work rather teach long endless immensity sea
Antoine de Over year working US government commercial international organization privilege helping client design build data science capability support drive mission
These mission included improving health defending nation improving energy distribution serving citizen veteran better improving pharmaceutical discovery
Often engagement turned exercise transforming organization building capability mean building culture support make data science
In many case culture change delivered significant insight big challenge world disease outbreak ocean health forth
We encountered wide variety successful organizational structure skill level technology algorithmic pattern
Based experience share perspective ass whether data science capability developing within organization achieving maturity
In particular order top ten characteristic mature data science capability
Let make one thing clear start Silos suck
Most organization early learning curve spend time assembling data analyzing
Mature data science organization realize order successful must enable member access use available data subset sample data
A lawyer go court evidence support would go appropriate evidence
Similarly mature data science organization use data understand business domain need performance
Successful organization take time understand data collect understand us content allow easy access
Some suggested big data data science mutually exclusive Focusing increasing big data come expense quality analysis data science
We disagree
They mutually conducive discovery big return analytics innovation
Big data volume data nearly much data diverse data source together new interesting way facilitate data science exploration exploitation data source powerful predictive prescriptive analysis
You mature data science without democratizing access data
That mean standardizing metadata access protocol discovery mechanism
You mature done data
Here cultural incentive important
We seen many organization still use data power lever hear get data single person data steward access controlled
Governance essential pretext one person group maintaining power controlling access data
Let go let data discovery innovation begin
Some traditional organization stuck older way managing process development
If IT development department asking requirement expect deliver year may experiencing
These organization resistant request new tool method go review board endless committee justify expenditure
Often large effort funded simply study whether proposed solution work
Other time committee decide analytic problem pressing
Paralysis analysis must broken order achieve data science maturity success
Bureaucracy work well science work data science either
Science celebrates exploratory agile experimental design see
Just Agile development championed user story short iteration long requirement delayed delivery Agile data science requires close collaboration within business freedom experiment
Agile software development methodology mindset
It permeates level mature organization
When last time CEO senior manager held retrospective SCRUM meeting
Understanding promote flexible culture organization technology work together challenging immensely rewarding collaboration creativity cultivates
An agile DevOps methodology data product development call DataOps
DataOps work principle DevOps tight collaboration product developer operational end user clear concise requirement gathering analysis round shorter iteration cycle product release including success opportunity faster time market better definition MVP Minimum Viable Product quick win lower product failure rate generally creating dynamic engaging team atmosphere across organization
In addition general Agile characteristic DataOps accelerates current data analytics capability naturally exploit new fast data architecture data lake enables previously impossible analytics
With sharpened focus MVP corresponding SCRUM sprint DataOps minimizes team downtime lengthy review cycle cost cognitive switching different project
Mature data science capability reach full potential agile DataOps environment
Data science group live bubble missing best community
Activities promote data science social good including open internal competition like Kaggle great way sharpen skill learn new one generally collaborate part business
In addition mature data science team try go alone instead work collaboratively rest organization
One successful tactic sponsoring internal data science competition great team building integration
The mature data science organization collaborative culture data science team work side side business solve critical problem using data
Another approach internal crowdsourcing within organization particularly strong surfacing best question data scientist tackle
The mature data science capability crowdsources internally several different task data science process lifecycle including data selection data cleaning data preparation transformation ensemble model generation model evaluation hypothesis refinement see
Since data cleaning preparation easily consume project entire effort accrue significant project time saving risk reduction parallelizing crowdsourcing cleaning preparation effort especially crowdsourcing part organization familiar particular data product database
Also algorithm solve problem
It still incredibly difficult algorithm understand possible context outcome pick right one
Humans must loop still deep understanding context challenge essential solid interpretation data creating accurate model
Exploratory undisciplined compatible
Data science must disciplined
That mean constrained unimaginative bureaucratic
Some organization hire data scientist sit cube expect instant result
In case data scientist work within IT organization focused operation discovery innovation
Mature data science capability built foundation scientific method
First make observation collect data object event process affect business data order understand business embedding measurement system process people appropriate place business workflow
Think interesting question explore formulate testable hypothesis business partner
Once good set question hypothesis test data develop data science model design new algorithm validate hypothesis else refine hypothesis iterate
This methodology ensure value created formal scientific rigor applied
That undeniable sign mature data science capability
A key part scientific process knowing limit sample
Looking testing selection bias key
Similarly important understand big data spell end incomplete sample unfair sampling sample variance natural diversity
The key word diverse
What fun bunch math nerd
Three statistician go hunting together
After spot solitary rabbit
The first statistician take aim overshoot rabbit one meter
The second aim undershoots one meter
The third shout We got
Some organization looking data scientist great coder also understand apply complex applied mathematics know lot specific business domain communicate stakeholder
One two people may call purple unicorn
Mature organization recognize data science team sport member contributing valuable unique skill point view
Among skill competency Advanced Management Data Structures Smart Metadata Indexing Search Retrieval Data Mining Machine Learning Analytics KDD Knowledge Discovery Data Statistics Statistical Programming Data Information Visualization Network Analysis Graph Mining everything graph
Semantics Natural Language Processing Ontologies Computing Hadoop Spark Cloud etc
Modeling Simulation computational data science Data Analysis Tools
But think every person must least one technical skill best data science organization grow skillsets within identifying core aptitude among current staff lead data science success even within nontechnology trained staff
Those core aptitude include curiosity inquisitive creativity innovative communicative collaborative courageous commitment learning consultative attitude cool pressure persistence resilience adaptability ambiguity tolerance computational critical thinker objective analyzer
Diverse perspective beneficial multiple front
They make question interesting importantly make answer even interesting useful informative
Answers given greater context yield greater impact
Mature data science capability understands need math computer science folk project
The mature organization integrates business expert SMEs data storyteller creative data artist seamlessly grant freedom explore exploit full power data asset
The output diverse team richer purple unicorn
And remember better horse narwhal unicorn
The fundamental building block successful mature data science capability ability ask right type question data
This rooted understanding business run business challenge manifest
The best data science team cover aptitude requirement mentioned earlier see curious creative communicative collaborative courageous problem solver learner doer resilient
Mature data science capability exemplified relentless pursuit new question ask even question could never answered asking question question
Data science maturity free organization ask hard question across entirety business disciplined asks question afraid getting wrong In instance data science capability maturity track analytics maturity following sense
Advanced analytics often described new stage analytics go beyond traditional business intelligence cover Descriptive Analytics hindsight Diagnostic Analytics oversight
The current view advanced analytics includes new stage Predictive Analytics foresight Prescriptive Analytics business sufficiently know decision action intervention lead best optimal outcome
The next emerging stage analytics maturity Cognitive Analytics right sight right question ask data right time right context right use case
This cognitive ability come right answer right question especially question never asked considered highest level analytics maturity data science capability maturity
As adage say The bad question one Culture hard thing define look team celebrates good indicator
Some organization afraid fail culture frowned upon
They focused strategy culture
But many business expert remind u Therefore start working data science culture sooner data science strategy
Admitting mistake one thing purposefully exploring unknown data mistake
Test organization maturity asking hypothesis fails happens
The mindset understands appreciates proper meaning adage Good judgment come experience
And experience come bad True data science based rigorous scientific methodology see explores limit learned quickly iterating multiple hypothesis agility
This may require invite business unit partner explore DataOps see
Having data tool allow directly related success maturity see
Mature data science capability allows iterative culture path achieving rewarding discovery making best decision delivering innovative choice organization
The optic around project failing often difficult overcome
It hard justify spending limited resource find hypothesis value knowing often lost celebrated within culture
A mature data science capability familiar traditional experiment test evaluate alternative hypothesis one may include sort intervention tuning treatment sample null hypothesis applied control untreated sample
Typically one experiment fail one
That whole point testing
If organization accept failure mature data science
One could argue analytical foundation machine learning algorithm
Specifically many classification algorithm goal define accurately possible boundary however complex separate different class object
That boundary might linear team score point team win might skew total score two exam A B greater pas course might complex hyperplane separating two class Support Vector Machine algorithm working complex data high dimensionality
In order circumscribe boundary complex classification rule business decision product choice class label problem space represented mapping exercise boundary different region accurately defined
Determining location along every inch border requires detailed comprehensive probe survey
For example testing hypothesis customer buy product Black Friday offer deep discount need try multiple discount maybe even see boundary really
Your profit margin depends critically identifying boundary ROI optimized mean finding point side boundary failure success condition point along decision boundary finally triangulated
essential resource investment wasted otherwise
Most organization form reporting
This often focused producing monthly weekly retrospective line graph bar pie chart illustrates happened previous reporting period
This clear indication organization capability asking question beyond What happened It stuck world descriptive analytics
It missing emerging benefit predictive prescriptive analytics
The mature data science organization therefore ask Why happen happen next achieve better outcome And organization mature asking What question I posing data See
When insight generated answer question What could happen What possible outcome answer relegated line graph bar chart illustrate impact finding
Infographics beautiful unique illustration justice hard work critical greatest impact
Mature data science capability focused harder question communicates illustrates new creative way answer story insight data revealing
Hence mature data science team includes one people skill data artist data storyteller
Stories visualization make connection fact
They enable listener understand better context What
So
work future Now
Many organization start path delivering proof concept considered successful data science
They want validate particular tool vendor told fix challenge set Hadoop environment something similar pump data ask question see system delivers right Success
Right
Wrong
Mature data science capability mean methodical think pilot
What really want pilot concept real business value
Proof value change value proposition work
Data platform hard enough architect right way unique need
So focus value answering new question opening new market deriving new insight much answering question already know answer
Therefore focus proving organization data science capability building journey consistently prove value many experience solve organization greatest unknown The tangible benefit data product include Because data science emerging field opportunity cost arise competitor implement generates value data
Failure learn account changing customer demand inevitably drive customer away current offering
When competitor able successfully leverage data science gain insight drive differentiated customer value proposition lead industry result
As result increasingly interconnected world huge amount data generated stored every instant
Data science used transform data insight help improve existing process
Operating cost driven dramatically effectively incorporating complex interrelationship data like never
This result better quality assurance higher product yield effective operation
Build value mind much Agile force See
The DataOps culture celebrates success MVP Minimum Viable Product product delivers value proof concept quickly possible thereby enabling team move next success
Data science buzzword relabeling data analyst business intelligence function
It way produce better monthly report TPS report cover sheet please
It certainly something someone move
Often find organization look data science another lever within larger set gear working together drive institution
The power data science within organization one cog matter rest machine gear shaft turn gear
It engine drive function organization
When business look data science understand world use determine best course action success invariably follows
Data science fundamental shift organization think operate
It using data core function new interesting way make organization innovative
The evidence mature data science capability organization belief life statement Now time begin thinking data science profession job corporate culture corporate agenda strategy stratagem core competency course way thing thing Finally offer guidepost organization may need assistance identifying indicator current state maturity plus recommendation moving forward toward greater data science maturity
These tenet outlined key ensuring data science capability successful within organization
We believe strongly tearing data organizational silo key transforming business government agile organization improve decision making foster innovation
This way forward

The development model created study data collected organization contracted funded research
The term maturity relates degree formality optimization process practice formally defined step managed result metric active optimization process
The model aim improve existing process also applied process
The Capability Maturity Model originally developed tool objectively assessing ability government contractor implement contracted software project
The model based process maturity framework first described later book
It later published report book author
Though model come field also used model aid business process generally also used extensively worldwide government office commerce industry
In use computer grew widespread flexible le costly
Organizations began adopt computerized information system demand grew significantly
Many process software development infancy standard best practice approach defined
As result growth accompanied growing pain project failure common field still early year ambition project scale complexity exceeded market capability deliver adequate product within planned budget
Individuals began publish article book research result attempt professionalize process
In several US military project involving software subcontractor ran completed far later planned
In effort determine occurring funded study SEI
The first application staged maturity model IT rather published IT organization
began developing process maturity concept later stage career IBM
Active development model US Department Defense Software Engineering Institute SEI began Humphrey joined located Carnegie Mellon University retiring IBM
At request Air Force began formalizing Process Maturity Framework aid Department Defense evaluating capability software contractor part awarding contract
The result Air Force study model military use objective evaluation software subcontractor process capability maturity
Humphrey based framework earlier Quality Management Maturity Grid developed book Quality Free
Humphrey approach differed unique insight organization mature process stage based solving process problem specific order
Humphrey based approach staged evolution system software development practice within organization rather measuring maturity separate development process independently
The CMM thus used different organization general powerful tool understanding improving general business process performance
Watts Humphrey Capability Maturity Model CMM published book
Organizations originally assessed using process maturity questionnaire Software Capability Evaluation method devised Humphrey colleague Software Engineering Institute
The full representation Capability Maturity Model set defined process area practice five maturity level initiated Version completed January
The CMM published book primary author Mark Paulk Charles Weber Mary Beth Chrissis
United States America New York USA
The CMM model application software development sometimes problematic
Applying multiple model integrated within across organization could costly training appraisal improvement activity
The CMMI project formed sort problem using multiple model software development process thus CMMI model superseded CMM model though CMM model continues general theoretical process capability model used public domain
The CMM originally intended tool evaluate ability government contractor perform contracted software project
Though come area software development continues widely applied general model maturity process organization
A viewed set structured level describe well behavior practice process organization reliably sustainably produce required outcome
A maturity model used benchmark comparison aid understanding example comparative assessment different organization something common used basis comparison
In case CMM example basis comparison would organization software development process
The model involves five aspect There five level defined along continuum model according SEI Predictability effectiveness control organization software process believed improve organization move five level
While rigorous empirical evidence date support belief
Within maturity level Key Process Areas characterise level area five factor goal commitment ability measurement verification
These necessarily unique CMM representing stage organization must go way becoming mature
The model provides theoretical continuum along process maturity developed incrementally one level next
Skipping level
At maturity level process concerned addressing statistical process variation changing process example shift mean process performance improve process performance
This would done time maintaining likelihood achieving established quantitative objective
There company world attained level
The model originally intended evaluate ability government contractor perform software project
It used may suited purpose critic pointed process maturity according CMM necessarily mandatory successful software development
The software process framework documented intended guide wishing ass organization project consistency Key Process Areas

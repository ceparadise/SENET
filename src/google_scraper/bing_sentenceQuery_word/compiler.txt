A transforms computer code written one source language another programming language target language
Compilers type support digital device primarily computer
The name primarily used program translate create program
However many different type compiler
If compiled program run computer whose different one compiler run compiler
A written language compiled
A program translates higher level one
A program translates language usually called transpiler
A language usually program translates form expression without change language
The term refers tool used create parser perform syntax analysis
A compiler likely perform many following operation conversion input program
Compilers implement operation phase promote efficient design correct transformation source input target output
Program fault caused incorrect compiler behavior difficult track work around therefore compiler implementers invest significant effort ensure
Compilers translator used transform source program
An computer software transforms executes indicated operation
The translation process influence design computer language lead preference compilation interpretation
In practice interpreter implemented compiled language compiler implemented interpreted language
Theoretical computing concept developed scientist mathematician engineer formed basis digital computing development World War II
Primitive binary language evolved digital device understand one zero circuit pattern underlying machine architecture
In late forty assembly language created offer workable abstraction computer architecture
Limited capacity early computer led substantial technical challenge first compiler designed
Therefore compilation process needed divided several small program
The front end program produce analysis product used back end program generate target code
As computer technology provided resource compiler design could align better compilation process
The human mind design better solution language move machine higher level
So development language follows naturally capability offered digital computer
language strictly defined syntax semantics form language architecture
Elements formal language include The sentence language may defined set rule called grammar
BNF describes syntax sentence language used syntax Algol
The idea derive concept linguist
BNF extension become standard tool describing syntax programming notation many case part compiler generated automatically BNF description
In designed algorithmic programming language called Plan Calculus
While actual implementation occurred presented concept later seen designed Ken Iverson late
APL language mathematical computation
language design formative year digital computing provided useful programming tool variety application Compiler technology evolved need strictly defined transformation source program target target program digital computer
The compiler could viewed front end deal analysis source code back end synthesize analysis target code
Optimization front end back end could produce efficient target code
Some early milestone development compiler technology Early operating system system software written assembly language
In early language system programming still controversial due resource limitation
Still several research industry effort began shift toward system programming language example
Basic Combined Programming Language designed University Cambridge originally developed compiler writing tool
Several compiler implemented Richards book provides insight language compiler
BCPL influential system programming language still used research also provided basis design B C language
Basic Language Implementation System Software developed Digital Equipment Corporation DEC computer
Wulf Carnegie Mellon University CMU research team
The CMU team went develop compiler one year later
Multiplexed Information Computing Service operating system project involved later led MIT
Multics written language developed IBM IBM User Group
IBM goal satisfy business scientific system programming requirement
There language could considered offered complete solution even though implemented
For first year Mulitics project subset language could compiled assembly language Early EPL compiler Doug McIlory Bob Morris Bell Labs
EPL supported project compiler full could developed
Bell Labs left Multics project Over time hope replaced frustration group effort initially failed produce economically useful system
Continued participation would drive project support cost
So researcher turned development effort
A system programming language based BCPL concept written
Ritchie created compiler B wrote Uniplexed Information Computing Service operating system Unics eventually became spelled Unix
Bell Labs started development expansion based B BCPL
The BCPL compiler transported Multics Bell Labs BCPL preferred language Bell Labs
Initially program Bell Labs B compiler used C compiler developed
In new provided resource define extension B rewrite compiler
By design C language essentially complete Unix kernel rewritten Steve Johnson started development Portable C Compiler PCC support retargeting C compiler new machine
OOP offered interesting possibility application development maintenance
OOP concept go back part language science
At Bell Labs development became interested OOP
first used system programming
The initial design leveraged C language system programming capability Simula concept
facility added
The Cfront program implemented language compiler
In subsequent year several compiler developed popularity grew
In many application domain idea using language quickly caught
Because expanding functionality supported newer increasing complexity computer architecture compiler became complex
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency sponsored compiler project Wulf CMU research team
The Production Quality design would produce Production Quality Compiler PQC formal definition source language target
PQCC tried extend term beyond traditional meaning parser generator without much success
PQCC might properly referred compiler generator
PQCC research code generation process sought build truly automatic system
The effort discovered designed phase structure PQC
The compiler provided initial structure
The phase included analysis front end intermediate translation virtual machine middle end translation target back end
TCOL developed PQCC research handle language specific construct intermediate representation
Variations TCOL supported various language
The PQCC project investigated technique automated compiler construction
The design concept proved useful optimizing compiler compiler programming language
The Ada Stoneman Document formalized program support environment APSE along kernel KAPSE minimal MAPSE
An Ada interpreter supported development standardization effort American National Standards Institute ANSI International Standards Organization ISO
Initial Ada compiler development Military Services included compiler complete integrated design environment along line Stoneman Document
Army Navy worked Ada Language System ALS project targeted architecture Air Force started Ada Integrated Environment AIE targeted IBM series
While project provide desired result contribute overal effort Ada development
Other Ada compiler effort got way Britain University York Germany University Karlsruhe
In Verdix later acquired Rational delivered Verdix Ada Development System VADS Army

There soon many Ada compiler available passed Ada Validation test
The Freesoftware Foundation GNU project developed GCC provides core capability support multiple language target
The Ada version one widely used Ada compiler
GNAT free also commercial support example AdaCore founded provide commercial software solution Ada
GNAT Pro includes GNU GCC based GNAT tool suite provide
language continued drive compiler research development
Focus area included optimization automatic code generation
Trends programming language development environment influenced compiler technology
More compiler became included language distribution PERL Java Development Kit component IDE VADS Eclipse Ada Pro
The interrelationship interdependence technology grew
The advent web service promoted growth web language scripting language
Scripts trace back early day Command Line Interfaces CLI user could enter command executed system
User Shell concept developed language write shell program
Early Windows design offered simple batch programming capability
The conventional transformation language used interpreter
While widely used Bash Batch compiler written
More recently sophisticated interpreted language became part developer tool kit
Modern scripting language include PHP Python Ruby Lua
Lua widely used game development
All interpreter compiler support
When field compiling began late focus limited translation language program machine code
The compiler field increasingly intertwined discipline including computer architecture programming language formal method software engineering computer security
The Compiler Research The Next Years article noted importance language Java
Security parallel computing cited among future research target
A compiler implement formal transformation source program target program
Compiler design define end end solution tackle defined subset interface compilation tool
preprocessors assembler linkers
Design requirement include rigorously defined interface internally compiler component externally supporting toolsets
In early day approach taken compiler design directly affected complexity computer language processed experience person designing resource available
Resource limitation led need pas source code
A compiler relatively simple language written one person might single monolithic piece software
However source language grows complexity design may split number interdependent phase
Separate phase provide design improvement focus development function compilation process
Classifying compiler number pass background hardware resource limitation computer
Compiling involves performing lot work early computer enough memory contain one program work
So compiler split smaller program made pas source representation performing required analysis translation
The ability compile classically seen benefit simplifies job writing compiler compiler generally perform compilation faster
Thus partly driven resource limitation early system many early language specifically designed could compiled single pas
In case design language feature may require compiler perform one pas source
For instance consider declaration appearing line source affect translation statement appearing line
In case first pas need gather information declaration appearing statement affect actual translation happening subsequent pas
The disadvantage compiling single pas possible perform many sophisticated needed generate high quality code
It difficult count exactly many pass optimizing compiler make
For instance different phase optimization may analyse one expression many time analyse another expression
Splitting compiler small program technique used researcher interested producing provably correct compiler
Proving correctness set small program often requires le effort proving correctness larger single equivalent program
Regardless exact number phase compiler design phase assigned one three stage
The stage include front end middle end back end
This approach make possible combine front end different language back end different sharing optimization middle end
Practical example approach multiple shared optimization multiple
The front end analyzes source code build internal representation program called IR
It also manages data structure mapping symbol source code associated information location type scope
While frontend single monolithic function program commonly implemented analyzed several phase may execute sequentially concurrently
This method favored due modularity
Most commonly today frontend broken three phase also known lexing also known scanning parsing
Lexing parsing comprise syntactic analysis word syntax phrase syntax respectively simple case module lexer parser automatically generated grammar language though complex case require manual modification
The lexical grammar phrase grammar usually simplifies analysis significantly handled semantic analysis phase
The semantic analysis phase generally complex written hand partially fully automated using
These phase broken lexing scanning evaluating parsing building CST parse tree transforming AST syntax tree
In case additional phase used notably rare
The main phase front end include following The middle end performs optimization intermediate representation order improve performance quality produced machine code
The middle end contains optimization independent CPU architecture targeted
The main phase middle end include following Compiler analysis prerequisite compiler optimization tightly work together
For example crucial
The scope compiler analysis optimization vary greatly small level even whole program
Obviously compiler potentially better job using broader view
But broad view free large scope analysis optimization costly term compilation time memory space especially true interprocedural analysis optimization
Interprocedural analysis optimization common modern commercial compiler
The open source criticized long time lacking powerful interprocedural optimization changing respect
Another open source compiler full analysis optimization infrastructure used many organization research commercial purpose
Due extra time space needed compiler analysis optimization compiler skip default
Users use compilation option explicitly tell compiler optimization enabled
The back end responsible CPU architecture specific optimization The main phase back end include following branch software engineering deal trying show compiler behaves according
Techniques include developing compiler using using rigorous testing often called compiler validation existing compiler
programming language usually appear type mind either designed
However practice rarely anything language exclusively compiled exclusively interpreted although possible design language rely run time
The categorization usually reflects popular widespread implementation language instance sometimes called interpreted language C compiled one despite existence BASIC compiler C interpreter
Interpretation replace compilation completely
It hide user make gradual
Even though interpreter interpreted directly executed program needed somewhere bottom stack see
Further compiler contain interpreter optimization reason
For example expression executed compilation result inserted output program prevents recalculated time program run greatly speed final program
Modern trend toward time blur traditional categorization compiler interpreter even
Some language specification spell implementation include compilation facility example
However nothing inherent definition Common Lisp stop interpreted
Other language feature easy implement interpreter make writing compiler much harder example many scripting language allow program construct arbitrary source code runtime regular string operation execute code passing special
To implement feature compiled language program must usually shipped includes version compiler
One classification compiler generated code executes
This known A compiler one output intended directly run type computer operating system compiler run
The output designed run different platform
Cross compiler often used developing software intended support software development environment
The output compiler produce code VM may may executed platform compiler produced
For reason compiler usually classified native cross compiler
The lower level language target compiler may
C often viewed sort portable assembler also target language compiler

original compiler used C target language
The C created compiler usually intended read maintained human
So pretty C intermediate code irrelevant
Some feature C turn good target language

C code directive generated support original source
While common compiler type output machine code many type Compiler construction taught university school part curriculum
Such course usually supplemented implementation compiler
A example compiler Wirth used teach compiler construction
In spite simplicity compiler introduced several influential concept field including us programming language mature time lead need Standardization

How work
What difference interpreter compiler
Compilers first sort translator program written
The idea simple You write program hand compiler translates
Then run result
An interpreter also program translates language one moment program run
You write program using text editor something similar instruct interpreter run program
It take program one line time translates line running It translates first line run translates second line run etc
Compiler characteristic Interpreter characteristic An accepts code expressed source language S translates equivalent code expressed another target language An accepts code expressed language S immediately executes code
It work fetching analysing executing one instruction time
Great user entering instruction interactively think Python would like get output putting next instruction
Also useful program executed requires portable
A compiler translates source code machine code execute source object code
An interpreter executes source code one instruction time translate source code
An interpretive compiler good compromise compiler interpreter
It translates source program virtual machine code interpreted
An interpretive compiler combine fast translation moderately fast execution provided Example JDK provides interpretive compiler Java
transforms source code one computer language another one
executes source code directly usually inside virtual machine
Generally interpreter performance costly
What difference interpreter compiler
The translates entire program run
The translates one statement machine language executes proceeds next statement
How work
The Difference v How Work Most program written language c java
language contain understandable word phrase
On hand computer time wrote article understand machine code aka Code
Therefore need convert code source code Machine
Hence word converting
So conclude job Translate code machine code
But different way code Compiler convert source code kind intermediate form
For static language compiler usually convert source code assembly usually get stored disk assembler invoked convert assembly binary code usually stored object file suffix usually linker invoked link object file binary executable
Also common refer whole process compiling assembling linking compiling
So may call gcc compiler actually invokes compiler compile assembler assemble ld linker link
Interpreters language intermediate called bytecode form source code first converted byte code process called compiling
Bytecode run host machine need program actually process viewpoint OS interpret bytecode host machine program called interpreter think java
Some language like python compiling interpreting work single
A compiler computer program transforms translates source code programming language source language another computer language target language
In case compiler used transform source code executable program
translate code programming language low lower level language mostly assembly machine code
An interpreter computer program executes instruction written programming language
It either execute source code directly translates source code first step efficient representation executes code Look book best intro dymanic language realization I found ever c This book center writing interpreter dynamic language Scheme using write interpreter language add tip OOP SmallTalk SOM Simple Object Machine All modern interpreter include compiler inside compile highlevel element portable use JIT compiling machine code RAM

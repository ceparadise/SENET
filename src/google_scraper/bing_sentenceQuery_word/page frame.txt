A contiguous block described single entry
It smallest unit data memory management virtual memory
Similarly smallest contiguous block memory page mapped operating system
A transfer page main memory auxiliary store hard disk drive referred swapping
Page size usually determined processor architecture
Traditionally page system uniform size example
However processor design often allow two sometimes simultaneous page size due benefit
There several point factor choosing best page size
Most operating system allow program discover page size runtime
This allows program use memory efficiently aligning allocation size reducing overall internal fragmentation page
system may use system function illustrated following example written programming language
In many Unix system command line utility used
For example return page size byte
operating system family may use system function
Some support multiple page size including page significantly larger standard page size
The available page size depend instruction set architecture processor type operating addressing mode
The operating system selects one size size supported architecture
Note processor implement defined larger page size
This support larger page known Linux terminology allows best world reducing pressure sometimes increasing speed much depending application allocation size large allocation still keeping memory usage reasonable level small allocation
Starting processor support MiB page called MiB page using addition standard KiB page newer processor newer processor later processor use GiB page
support many eight different page size KiB MiB architecture similar feature
Larger page despite available processor used contemporary common use except application application typically found large server operating system
Commonly use requires elevated privilege cooperation application making large allocation usually setting flag ask operating system huge page manual administrator configuration operating system commonly sometimes design page disk
However support multiple page size
Each individual process provide hint operating system automatically use largest page size possible given region address space
supported huge page several architecture since series via filesystem without hugetlbfs since
newer support huge page name page
support large page internally expose application
beginning version support large page
FreeBSD feature superpages
Note recently Linux application needed modified order use huge page
The kernel introduced support transparent use huge page
On Linux kernel supporting transparent huge page well FreeBSD Solaris application take advantage huge page automatically without need modification

Virtual memory decouples virtual address space programmer processor see physical address space actual RAM memory
For process mapping maintained virtual address physical addressed every memory access must pas map
The Memory Management Unit MMU physical contraption computer chip mapping
The virtual address space divided contiguous span address particular size
The page starting address page multiple page size
For instance starting virtual address first several page page size etc
The MMU architecture bit allows small page byte large page byte
The physical address space likewise divided
The MMU responsible maintaing map page page frame
A page frame size page page alignment
This simplifies mapping MMU must maintain explicitly map page page frame
The map individual byte page page frame pass least significant bite address
For instance page bit architecture map top bit virtual address top bit physical address lower bit passed unchanged
Various scheme exist implement mapping virtual page physical page frame
The method used many operating system
I overly simplify description first explanation make mechanism clear
The page table simply array entry contains number j virtual page associated physical page j
The page page frame number neglect lower bit indicated offset page page frame
As example virtual address map physical address index page table contain number assuming page
Note entry page table empty number page table invalid page associated physical page frame
In order save space multilevel page table common single large table described last paragraph
A multilevel page table save space cost memory fetch page table structure
A sample multilevel page table two level table Linux bit address mode
In scheme virtual address divided highest bit index one PDE PDE table next highest bite index one PTE PTE table
The value PDE physical page frame address exact entry selected PTE simply bit page frame address adjoined bit index information
It bit PTE byte long
The last two bit indexing purpose
The PDE also byte long
Note work well
Since entire byte long PDE table well PTE table exactly size page frame
This save memory situation PDE entry marked invalid space virtual address entirely unused
The architecture also allows large page mixed page
The trick PDE marked large page lookup stop
The bit PDE combined lower order bit virtual address form physical address
This give page
Each process virtual physical mapping therefore set page table
To context switch one process another switch mapping effectuated loading single hardware register
That register base physical address PDE page frame number
For operating system OSX kernel virtual memory space completely distinct user process virtual address space
Linux many operating system place operating system high memory
This way kernel run access full memory space including current user memory
When user mode running lower user reserved memory portion high memory protected access user
Linux reserve lower user process memory upper kernel memory
In situation upper one quarter PDE entry process PDE map common memory space kenel
Often first lowest portion upper memory map programming code kernel using large page
The architecture also support mode physical address space larger virtual address space
This becomes unnecessary bit computing worthwhile bit computing since possible summed process memory demand exceed swapping satisfy demand would reduce performance
Each process would still limited nature bit address really limited since upper reserved kernel different process would map different page frame overall physical memory could used
The mode PAE suports bit physical address
Many intel chip implement bit architecture provides possibility
Since lowest bit offset page mean page frame indicated bit
The size PDE PTE increased byte make room bit number entry single table reduced
By way remaining bit PDE PTE wasted
In addition page frame number entry contains Given bit per index PDE PTE support PAE third level indexing required
For bit computing bit virtual address space fact reduced bit map bit physical address space cascade four table PTE PDE PTPDE unlikely named
For completeness I mention bit architecture sometimes call support three size page depending cascade table terminated using table using table using table

In scheme computer store retrieves data use
In scheme operating system retrieves data secondary storage called
Paging important part implementation modern operating system using secondary storage let program exceed size available physical memory
For simplicity main memory called RAM acronym secondary storage called disk shorthand concept depend whether term apply literally specific computer system
introduced paging first mass market memory page concept computer architecture regardless whether page moved RAM disk
For example instruction bit comprised memory address selected one word
This zone memory called
This use term rare
In swapping early virtual memory technique
An entire program would RAM disk another one would
A program would current execution would suspended RAM use another program
A program might include multiple occupy memory different time
Overlays method paging RAM disk merely minimizing program use RAM
Subsequent architecture used individual program segment became unit exchanged disk RAM
A segment program entire code segment data segment sometimes large data structure
These segment resident RAM requiring additional computation movement remedy
The invention let processor operate arbitrary page anywhere RAM seemingly contiguous space
These page became unit exchanged disk RAM
When program try reference page currently present RAM processor treat invalid memory reference transfer control program operating system
The operating system must When page frame use operating system must select page frame reuse page program need
If evicted page frame program hold data program modified since read RAM word become dirty must written disk freed
If program later reference evicted page another page fault occurs page must read back RAM
The method operating system us select page frame reuse important efficiency
The operating system predicts page frame least likely needed soon often LRU algorithm algorithm based program
To increase responsiveness paging system may predict page needed soon preemptively loading RAM program reference
After completing initialization program operate small number code data page compared total memory program requires
The page frequently accessed called
When working set small percentage system total number page virtual memory system work efficiently insignificant amount computing spent resolving page fault
As working set grows resolving page fault remains manageable growth reach critical point
Then fault go dramatically time spent resolving overwhelms time spent computing program written
This condition referred
Thrashing occurs program work huge data structure large working set cause continual page fault drastically slow system
Satisfying page fault may require freeing page soon disk
Thrashing also used context virtual memory system example describe issue computing networking
A worst case imagined comparable mainframe
An execute instruction crossing page boundary could point move instruction also cross page boundary set move data source cross page boundary target cross page boundary
This single instruction reference eight page RAM cause page fault
If operating system could allocate eight page program remedying page fault would discard another page instruction need restart instruction would fault
To decrease excessive paging resolve thrashing problem user increase number page available per program either running fewer program concurrently increasing amount RAM computer
In environment many user may execute program written code data separate page
To minimize use RAM user share single copy program
Each process set page address code point single shared copy page address data point different physical page process
The first computer support paging jointly developed
The machine associative memory one entry word page
The Supervisor handled interruption managed transfer page core drum order provide store program
Paging feature since
Windows creates named use swap file
It generally found may appear elsewhere typically WINDOWS directory
Its size depends much swap space system setting selected user Enhanced Virtual Memory
If user move deletes file appear next time Windows started The permanent swap file corrupt
The user prompted choose whether delete file whether exists
use similar file setting located Control Panel System Performance tab Virtual Memory
Windows automatically set size page file start size physical memory expand physical memory necessary
If user run application system low physical memory preferable manually set size value higher default
The file used paging family
The default location page file root directory partition Windows installed
Windows configured use free space available drive pagefiles
It required however boot partition
drive containing Windows directory pagefile system configured write either kernel full memory dump
Windows us paging file temporary storage memory dump
When system rebooted Windows copy memory dump pagefile separate file free space used pagefile
In default configuration Windows pagefile allowed expand beyond initial allocation necessary
If happens gradually become heavily potentially cause performance problem
The common advice given avoid set single locked pagefile size Windows expand
However pagefile expands filled default configuration total amount physical memory
Thus total demand virtual memory must exceed computer physical memory pagefile expand
The fragmentation pagefile occurs expands temporary
As soon expanded region longer use next reboot sooner additional disk space allocation freed pagefile back original state
Locking pagefile size problematic Windows application request memory total size physical memory pagefile leading failed request allocate memory may cause application system process fail
Also pagefile rarely read written sequential order performance advantage completely sequential page file minimal
However large pagefile generally allows use application penalty beside using disk space
While fragmented pagefile may issue fragmentation variable size page file time create number fragmented block drive causing file become fragmented
For reason contiguous pagefile better providing size allocated large enough accommodate need application
The required disk space may easily allocated system recent specification
system GB memory GB pagefile GB disk drive system GB memory GB pagefile TB disk space
In example system using disk space pagefile maximum
page file also occasionally recommended improve performance Windows system chronically using much memory total physical memory
This view ignores fact aside temporary result expansion pagefile become fragmented time
In general performance concern related pagefile access much effectively dealt adding physical memory
system operating system use term swap describe act moving memory page RAM disk region disk page stored
In system common dedicate entire partition hard disk swapping
These partition called
Many system entire hard drive dedicated swapping separate data drive containing swap partition
A hard drive dedicated swapping called swap drive scratch drive
Some system support swapping swap partition others also support swapping file
The Linux kernel support virtually unlimited number swap backends device file supporting time assignment backend priority
When kernel need swap page physical memory us backend available free space
If multiple swap backends assigned priority used fashion somewhat similar storage layout providing improved performance long underlying device efficiently accessed parallel
From perspective swap file version later Linux kernel virtually fast swap partition limitation swap file contiguously allocated underlying file system
To increase performance swap file kernel keep map placed underlying device access directly thus bypassing cache avoiding filesystem overhead
Regardless recommends swap partition used
When residing HDDs rotational magnetic medium device one benefit using swap partition ability place contiguous HDD area provide higher data throughput faster seek time
However administrative flexibility swap file outweigh certain advantage swap partition
For example swap file placed mounted file system set desired size added changed needed
Swap partition flexible enlarged without using partitioning tool introduce various complexity potential downtime
When system memory highly insufficient current task large portion memory activity go slow swap system become practically unable execute task even CPU idle
When every process waiting swap system considered
Swap death happen due incorrectly configured
The original description swapping death problem relates memory X swap every keystroke requires Linux read swap processed system practically unresponsive even actually executing task normally
us multiple swap file
The default installation place root partition though possible place instead separate partition device
introduced new system allocating RAM defragmenting physical memory
It still us flat shared address space defragmented
It based paging memory allows swapping
Paging implemented may lock system physical memory used
Swap memory could activated deactivated moment allowing user choose use physical RAM
The backing store virtual memory operating system typically many order slower
Additionally using mechanical storage device introduces several millisecond hard disk
Therefore desirable reduce eliminate swapping practical
Some operating system offer setting influence kernel decision
Many operating system example allow using multiple storage device swap space parallel increase performance
In older virtual memory operating system space swap backing store reserved program allocate memory runtime data
Operating system vendor typically issue guideline much swap space allocated
Paging one way allowing size address used process process virtual address space logical address space different amount main memory actually installed particular computer physical address space
In system size process virtual address space much larger available main memory
For example A computer true addressing may addressable unit RAM installed
An example processor without PAE
In case processor able address RAM installed
However even case paging used create virtual memory GB
For instance many program may running concurrently
Together may require GB RAM
A paging system make efficient decision memory relegate secondary storage leading best use installed RAM
Although processor example address RAM beyond GB operating system may provide service program envision larger memory file grow beyond limit installed RAM
The operating system let program manipulate data file arbitrarily using paging bring part file RAM necessary
A computer main memory larger virtual address space process machine system using processor
This nullifies significant advantage virtual memory since single process use main memory amount virtual address space
Such system often use paging technique obtain secondary benefit The size cumulative total virtual address space still limited amount secondary storage available

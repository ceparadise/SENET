Portability relation software measure easily application transferred one computer environment another
A computer software application considered portable new environment effort required adapt new environment within reasonable limit
The meaning abstract term depends upon nature application often difficult express quantifiable unit
The phrase port mean modify software make adaptable work different computer system
For example port application Linux mean modify program run Linux environment
Portability refers ability application move across environment across platform
To clarify computer platform generally refers operating system computer hardware
A computer environment much broader may include hardware operating system interface software user programmer
Portability form reusability
Some kind software known le portable others
An example software portable would assembly code since assembly code specific processor type
No software perfectly portable software limitation
Some programming language fairly portable example C language
C compiler readily available majority operating system turn make C program portable
This portability C language program resulted programmer program recompiling C make much portable
Portability also used describe flexibility use data
Some file format le portable others
For example view file file format PDF JPEG format depend availability appropriate software application

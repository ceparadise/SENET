What characteristic multitasking operating system
What make multitasking
Are operating system
As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
What characteristic multitasking operating system
What make multitasking
Multitasking operating system allow one program run time
They support either preemptive multitasking OS dole time application virtually modern OSes cooperative multitasking OS wait program give back control Windows Mac OS earlier
Are operating system
Any OS allows one thing done time DOS instance
A multi tasking operating system An operating system give perception running time
It dividing system resource amongst
And switching executing fast
Yes non multi tasking operating system example commodore OS Commodore BASIC
Probably custom made software company
Perhaps like ATM machine movie theater stub ticket system
A multitasking OS able manage various process
One particular ability sharing CPU time among process
Yes plenty OSs
Back time rule MSDOS example
From dinosaur OS book Applied operating System Concepts logical extension multiprogramming
The CPU executes multiple job switching among switch occur frequently user interact program running
logical extension o allows multiple job executed simultaneously switching amoung CPU process one task time switcthing fast look like CPU executing multiple process time
I sure supposed ask homework question A multitasking OS allows run multiple process task simultaneously
They actually run time course since one CPU
What happens one process run OS break interrupt store away state context current process restores context another allows process run etcetera
example OS long playing Commander Keen task run computer including DOS shell
A preemptive multitasking OS able run one process simultaneously control process using CPU resource time opposed cooperative multitasking OS process voluntarily relinquish CPU leading hang crash
Usually modern multitasking OSs also provide memory isolation process support different security level allowing OS code thing user code
A Operating System would OS allows simultaneous execution multiple process
Operating Systems used like Unix Windows OSX operating system
An example operating system would
Although could get multiple process run simultaneously help Windows Windows OS
For information regarding Computer may want check wikipedia page pretty good lowdown multitasking
There popular OS listed yet PalmOS
It illusion user parallel working done exactly like
A allows user simultaneously run various task time
Actually one cpu
The concept behind time sharing
The operating system divide cpu time among various task time small nanosecond user feel program task running simultaneously

In concept performing multiple also known certain period time executing
New task start interrupt already started one reached completion instead executing task sequentially started task need reach end new one started
As result computer executes segment multiple task interleaved manner task share common processing resource CPUs
Multitasking necessarily mean multiple task executing exactly time simultaneously
In word multitasking imply mean one task execution time one task advancing given period time
Even computer multiple allowing one task executed physically one per CPU core multitasking allows many task run CPUs
In case computer single CPU one task said running point time meaning CPU actively executing instruction task
Multitasking solves problem task may one running given time another waiting task get turn
The act reassigning CPU one task another one called illusion parallelism achieved context switch occur frequently enough
Operating system may adopt one many different scheduling strategy generally fall following category The term multitasking become international term word used many language German Italian Dutch Danish Norwegian
In early day computing expensive slow
When computer ran program needed access peripheral central processing unit CPU would stop executing program instruction peripheral processed data
This usually inefficient
The first computer using multiprogramming system British owned During several different program loaded computer memory first one began run
When first program reached instruction waiting peripheral context program stored away second program memory given chance run
The process continued program finished running
The use multiprogramming enhanced arrival technology enabled individual program make use memory operating system resource concurrently running program practical purpose invisible
Multiprogramming give guarantee program run timely manner
Indeed first program may well run hour without needing access peripheral
As user waiting interactive terminal problem user handed deck punched card operator came back hour later printed result
Multiprogramming greatly reduced wait time multiple batch processed
The expression time sharing usually designated computer shared interactive user terminal IBM
The term longer commonly used replaced multitasking following advent personal computer workstation rather shared interactive system
Early multitasking system used application voluntarily ceded time one another
This approach eventually supported many computer known today cooperative multitasking
Although rarely used larger system except specific application subsystem cooperative multitasking scheduling scheme employed prior prior order enable multiple application run simultaneously
also used cooperative multitasking legacy application much way version Mac OS X used application
The network operating system used cooperative multitasking NetWare
Cooperative multitasking still used today system
As cooperatively multitasked system relies process regularly giving time process system one poorly designed program consume CPU time either performing extensive calculation would cause whole system
In server environment hazard make entire environment unacceptably fragile
Preemptive multitasking allows computer system reliably guarantee process regular slice operating time
It also allows system deal rapidly important external event like incoming data might require immediate attention one another process
Operating system developed take advantage hardware capability run multiple process preemptively
Preemptive multitasking implemented available computer small DEC core feature operating system well modern version Windows
At specific time process grouped two category waiting input output called fully utilizing CPU
In primitive system software would often waiting requested input disk keyboard network input
During time system performing useful work
With advent interrupt preemptive multitasking bound process could blocked put hold pending arrival necessary data allowing process utilize CPU
As arrival requested data would generate interrupt blocked process could guaranteed timely return execution
The earliest preemptive multitasking OS available home user released people bought machine
Commodore powerful released following year first commercially successful home computer use technology multimedia ability make clear ancestor contemporary multitasking personal computer
made preemptive multitasking core feature flagship operating system early developing
It later adopted Apple Macintosh operating system us preemptive multitasking native application
A similar model used native application multitasked preemptively legacy program multitasked cooperatively within single process although NT family possible force application run separate preemptively multitasked process
edition Windows architecture longer provide support legacy application thus provide preemptive multitasking supported application
Another reason multitasking design system number possibly unrelated external activity needed controlled single processor system
In system hierarchical interrupt system coupled process prioritization ensure key activity given greater share available
As multitasking greatly improved throughput computer programmer started implement application set cooperating process one process gathering input data one process processing input data one process writing result disk
This however required tool allow process efficiently exchange data
born idea efficient way cooperating process exchange data would share entire memory space
Thus thread effectively process run memory context share resource open file
Threads described switching thread involve changing memory context
While thread scheduled preemptively operating system provide variant thread named scheduled cooperatively
On operating system provide fiber application may implement fiber using repeated call worker function
Fibers even lightweight thread somewhat easier program although tend lose benefit thread
Some system directly support
Essential multitasking system safely effectively share access system resource
Access memory must strictly managed ensure process inadvertently deliberately read write memory location outside process address space
This done purpose general system stability data integrity well data security
In general memory access management responsibility operating system kernel combination hardware mechanism provide supporting functionality MMU
If process attempt access memory location outside memory space MMU denies request signal kernel take appropriate action usually result forcibly terminating offending process
Depending software kernel design specific error question user may receive access violation error message segmentation fault
In well designed correctly implemented multitasking system given process never directly access memory belongs another process
An exception rule case shared memory example communication mechanism kernel allocates memory mutually shared multiple process
Such feature often used database management software PostgreSQL
Inadequate memory protection mechanism either due flaw design poor implementation allow security vulnerability may potentially exploited malicious software
Use swap partition way operating system provide memory physically available keeping portion primary memory
While multitasking memory swapping two completely unrelated technique often used together swapping memory allows task loaded time
Typically multitasking system allows another process run running process hit point wait portion memory reloaded secondary storage
Processes entirely independent much trouble program multitasking environment
Most complexity multitasking system come need share computer resource task synchronize operation task
Various technique used avoid potential problem caused multiple task attempting access resource
Bigger system sometimes built central processor number kind asymmetric
Over year multitasking system refined
Modern operating system generally include detailed mechanism prioritizing process introduced new complexity capability

running two program set instruction one time
Multitasking used keep computer resource work much time possible
It controlled load program computer processing oversees execution finished
Multitasking involves overlapping interleaving execution several program
This often achieved capitalizing difference computer rapid processing capacity slower rate device
While computer reading data magnetic disk fairly limited rate example powerful central processor execute high speed another program involves extensive calculation little input
Operating system coordinate competing demand various program variety way
Two program executed small computer using system computer executes instruction one program time devotes running another program higher priority
Such system make use idle time task minute delay keyboard entry execute instruction background program
In many multitasking operation computer microprocessor switch attention back forth different program fraction second
known multiprocessing multitasking system today even single program may consist many separate computational activity called process
The system must keep track active queued process process must access secondary memory retrieve store rise multiprogramming several job reside computer simultaneously share example allocated fixed amount CPU time turn
More sophisticated hardware allowed one job reading data another wrote printer still another performed computation
time multiprogramming
With multiprogramming computer interleave several program allocating various computer resource memory storage input output program operating system
Atlas also first computer employ technique known virtual memory virtual storage detailed plan procedure solving problem computer specifically unambiguous ordered sequence computational instruction necessary achieve solution
The distinction computer program equipment often made referring former software latter hardware
Programs program manages computer resource especially allocation resource among program
Typical resource include central processing unit CPU computer memory file storage device network connection
Management task include scheduling resource use avoid conflict interference program

I little confused three term Multitasking Multithreading Multiprogramming Although every one mean executing different line code every one need something like Task State Segment context store data particular
I missing something anyone give basic difference actually executed processor Actually I guy Electronics background I poor OS related issue
The main thing I understood multiprogramming multithreading multiprogramming execute two separate program multithreading scheduler produce two different thread executed independently
I think form multitasking implementation
Am I correct
I really confused The Wikipedia article cover well
In summary Multitasking term mean computer system allowed multiple task
Multitasking nothing say actually implemented even implemented single threaded program
Multithreading multiprogramming form able execute multiple task
The difference multithreading multiprogramming level isolation thread program thread multithreaded system share common memory address space program multiprogram system independent communicate explicit IPC

In simply classification data tell programmer intends use data
Most programming language support various type data example
A data type provides set value
variable function may take value
The type defines operation done data meaning data way value type type value expression may take value Data type used within type system offer various way defining implementing using
Different type system ensure varying degree
Almost programming language explicitly include notion data type though different language may use different terminology
Common data type include For example type represents set ranging value well operation performed integer addition subtraction multiplication
Colors hand represented three denoting amount red green blue one string representing color name allowable operation include addition subtraction multiplication
Most programming language also allow programmer define additional data type usually combining multiple element type defining valid operation new data type
For example programmer might create new data type named would include real imaginary part
A data type also represents constraint placed upon interpretation data describing representation interpretation structure stored computer memory
The type system us data type information check access manipulate data
Most data type statistic comparable type computer programming vice versa shown following table identified five definition type literature
Types including behavior align closely model whereas model would tend include code called
The five type The definition term representation often done imperative language definition term value space behaviour used language
typically type basic language implementation
All data computer based digital electronics represented alternative lowest level
The smallest addressable unit data usually group bit called usually bit
The unit processed instruction called typically bit
Most instruction interpret word word represent unsigned integer value signed integer value
Because machine language machine need distinguish unsigned signed data type part
There specific set arithmetic instruction use different interpretation bit word number
Machine data type need made available allowing control hardware
The instance supply integer type various width
If corresponding native type exist target platform compiler break code using type exist
For instance integer requested bit platform compiler tacitly treat array two bit integer
Several language allow convenient manipulation machine data
In higher level programming machine data type often hidden implementation detail would render code le portable exposed
For instance generic type might supplied instead integer specific
The represents value
Although two value possible rarely implemented single binary digit efficiency reason
Many programming language explicit Boolean type instead interpreting instance false value true
Boolean data simply refers logical structure language interpreted machine language
In case Boolean refers logic False
True always non zero especially one known Boolean
Such derived one primitive type
This done number way
The way combined called
Composing primitive type compound type generally result new type
different type
Many others possible tend variation compound
The distinct value compared assigned necessarily particular concrete representation computer memory compiler interpreter represent arbitrarily
For example four suit deck playing card may four enumerator named belonging enumerated type named
If variable declared data type one assign four value
Some implementation allow programmer assign integer value enumeration value even treat integer
Such Character string type store sequence character character set
Since character set include possible numeric string
However many language treat belonging different type numeric value
Character string type different subtypes according required character width
The original wide ASCII found limited superseded set encode wide variety alphabet symbol
Strings may either fixed size even programming language
They may also subtyped maximum size
Note string primitive language instance C may composed array character
Types based derived basic type explained
In language C type derived type
The main derived type data type whose value refers directly point another value stored elsewhere using
It primitive kind
In everyday term page number book could considered piece data refers another one
Pointers often stored format similar integer however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To ameliorate potential problem pointer considered separate type type data point even underlying representation
Any type specify implementation
For instance abstract type implemented array contiguous block memory containing multiple value set memory block linked
Abstract type handled code know care underlying type contained
Programming agnostic concrete data type called
Arrays record also contain underlying type considered concrete specify content element laid memory
Examples include For convenience language may supply real world data type instance even language allows built primitive type
A associate type computed value
By examining flow value type system attempt prove occur
The type system question determines constitutes type error type system generally seek guarantee operation expecting certain kind value used value operation make sense
A may use static type value optimize storage need choice algorithm operation value
In many compiler data type example represented accord
They thus use value addition multiplication etc
The depth type constraint manner evaluation affect language
A may associate operation varying concrete algorithm type case
study type system although concrete type system programming language originate practical issue computer architecture compiler implementation language design
Type system may variously forth

During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


A computer science education sure ticket job today tech economy right
Hardly say one startup CEO lambasts school failing teach practical computer skill suggesting developer skip degree path first place
In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity

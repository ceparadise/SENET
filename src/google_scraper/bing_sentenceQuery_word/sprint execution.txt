This important easing concern Sergey team sprint condensed project timeline portion
Within sprint expectation smaller functional portion project work known fully developed tested
The expectation project work completed single sprint
The concept sprint heart Scrum
The goal produce tangible result receive feedback soon possible
This contrast traditional methodology development completed testing completed work reviewed
Breaking project work project timeline smaller piece allows goal accomplished
The sprint key though breaking work manageable piece loses value unless work completed shorter time frame well
After Sergey defines sprint team help understand purpose move execute sprint
Executing sprint successfully help team receive benefit
Sergey break execution sprint begin progress day sprint end
Each sprint begin meeting called meeting Sergey development team review user story assigns numeric point value estimate time effort complete
They commit completing user story estimate point total equal number point typically complete within sprint
User story kept prioritized order project whole
They move team take sprint remain prioritized order team work
The sprint planning meeting user story move product backlog sprint backlog set entire sprint
This important Sergey team take portion project work
The sprint progress two way
The first way completion project work
As user story completed sprint come closer completion
The second way sprint progress daily checkpoint meeting team known
This brief meeting Sergey team discus work completed remaining work progress issue impacting sprint
Once user story completed end two four week sprint come end
Any work incomplete considered carryover move next end sprint marked two meeting first known meeting
In meeting Sergey team review product user story requested project work stakeholder

The last discussion point Sergey team around sprint team use
Things like definition purpose execution provide solid foundation
Sergey must help team determine specific work best
The main determination team must make length sprint
Best practice would sprint longer four week
The typical sprint length two four week ultimately team
The key Sergey team collectively determine sprint length
In consider availability different resource like technology people choose realistic time frame work developed tested
Once team determines sprint length kept consistent
The team change length working change common occurrence
Consistency beneficial team stakeholder
When team make commitment user story complete given sprint accurately sprint length held constant one sprint next
Stakeholders looking estimate project complete use work completed sprint compared total amount work
Without dependable value work completed sprint stakeholder accurately estimate timeframes completion entire project
emphasizes producing tangible result receiving feedback adapting change faster
This made possible use
Sprints repeated interval completed
They typically week long duration determined team
A sprint begin acceptance user story meeting progress user story completed
Throughout sprint occurs brief checkpoint meeting team
At end sprint completed user story reviewed approved stakeholder meeting
This mark end sprint followed one additional meeting evaluates sprint target improvement next one

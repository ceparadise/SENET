If two set A B refer Cartesian Product A x B
This mean A B b c A x B
It set pair value first A second B
A relation A B subset A x B
A relation said connect value together way showing relationship
As example let take two set
A B
Because two set say relation A
Now consider relation described greater
We start looking A x B
Now relation R subset
One way work relation look value turn
So look first value
The first value second value relation greater
This true part relation
The true say greater say greater
But get see yes greater value relation
In end find relation subset A x B
We show digraph follows say b related R arrow going b
If related b relation R also say aRb
So case
There number different property relation
Let R subset A x R said reflexive true every possible value A true aRa
This mean everything map onto
On digraph shown fact every node loop attached point back
An example relation type could height Everything height still height thing
The key feature though aRa always true
R said transitive true every possible value b c A aRb true bRc true must case aRc true
An example kind relation smaller
If object smaller b object b smaller c obviously object must smaller object This hard spot digraph basically whenever arrow b arrow b c also arrow R said symmetric relation work backwards
For example two node relation b true aRb relation symmetric must also true bRa
height good example symmetric relation If height b obviously b height true object
On digraph shown fact wherever arrow two node another one going opposite direction
R said antisymmetric true b A aRb bRa must equal ie
relation work reverse two node
An equivalence relation relation reflexive symmetric transitive
To show look three feature show The idea equivalence relation aRb b sense
This usually divide set A seperate part
The idea part contains element equivalent b part aRb
So let assume A set natural number R relation state b equal mod
true true etc
true true etc
The digraph look like So see continued would partition odd number even number
The odd number equivalent relation even number equivalent relation
We say divided two class
We talk class set node equivalent
So case set set
This way see set natural number N consists element partition exactly
N
Similarly say conjunction always equal empty set value also appear
In fact equivalence relation following true A partition set subset make set
For example set partition make set There number operation possible relation set
Let relation A The union described set theory every pair thing either
For example family take union relation mother father get relation parent
The intersection described set theory every pair thing
For example intersection relation mother father empty nobody mother father child
The complement described R basically set pair A x A
For example inverse parent parent The inverse described R every pair backwards
For example relation true R
For example inverse parent child
If consider two relation parent mother define another relation grandmother combining finding value mother b b parent Then grandmother In general two relation A B B C relational composition described relation A C b B
For relation R property P say relation S P closure R S property P R another relation property P R subset R S subset R well
For example let assume P property transitivity
The P closure R transitive closure When P reflexivity known reflexive closure P symmetry known symmetric closure
The P closure constructed adding R minimum number pair b make new relation property For example let u consider relation consisting
The reflexive closure relation consisting
All added minimum pair required make reflexive
All rest left alone
The transitive closure harder find
But consider pair pair turn see way get straight
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
needed
needed already
And
The transitive closure relation
The symmetric closure much easier minimum pair ensure every pair work backwards
In case
We added
Another common type relation set relation share property le equal
Such relation called order relation
The simplest kind order relation called partial order follows A partial order relation R reflexive antisymmetric transitive
A partially ordered set poset additional property
Namely integer x either x le equal le equal x
We say two integer comparable relationship le equal
A partial order relation two element comparable called total order
Given ordering set define maximal minimal element
An element poset A partial order said least element element
An element poset A partial order said greatest element element
A minimal element partial order set A element b b
A maximal element partial order set A element b b
In basic term minimal element one another element smaller maximal element element another element bigger
That say minimal element smallest maximal element biggest two element may comparable partial order
A partial order lot minimal maximal element
In general poset A drawn partial order placing larger element top le large element
Draw minimum number line x le sequence line descending x
This called Hasse Diagram
And basically know relation
I recommend reading page note order relation minimal maximal element partial order stuff make tiny bit sense

I trying solve exercise inductive definition premiss Let relation A reflexive transitive closure defined following two rule The question The first question startle I view b c induction rule
Is complete answer
And I show reflexivity b
Here fully formal articulation language
First inductive rule correspond indexed family
Here data constructor corresponds first rule data constructor corresponds second rule
represents corresponds
The induction rule corresponds eliminator data type
roughly type though thing bit complicated dependently typed language
This say give binary relation P show P hold b P b R b c P c
P b R b c hold P c hold I provide proof P c whenever c hold reflexive transitive closure R
Question completely trivial
The formal proof statement
Question much harder
It asking show b b c c inductive rule give case b c single step
Obviously need recursively apply rule
This lead following code For purpose probably define equivalent term induction rule
term
I leave simple exercise
No
Induction rule case look like Let P binary relation A
To show P b hold whenever b enough prove something mention P
What
Namely premiss one corresponding reflective another step
Well first need prove b b hold b course ca
The puzzling thing proof utterly trivial
Does maybe say transitive instead
By posting answer agree

In ability examine modify structure behavior
The earliest computer programmed native inherently reflective original architecture could programmed defining instruction data using
As programming moved compiled language also many language reflective ability largely disappeared programming language reflection built type system appeared
doctoral dissertation introduced notion computational reflection procedural notion component
Reflection used observing modifying program execution runtime
A program component monitor execution enclosure code modify according desired goal related enclosure
This typically accomplished dynamically assigning program code runtime
In programming language reflection allows class interface field method runtime without knowing name interface field method compile time
It also allows new object method
Reflection used adapt given program different situation dynamically
programming almost always requires additional knowledge framework relational mapping object relevance order take advantage generic code execution
Reflection often used part runtime
Reflection also key strategy
In programming language reflection used override rule
For example reflection make possible change value field marked private library class
A language supporting reflection provides number feature available runtime would otherwise difficult accomplish language
Some feature ability These feature implemented different way
In reflection form natural part everyday programming idiom
When verb method called various variable name verb called object verb called populated give context call
Security typically managed accessing caller stack programmatically Since list method current verb eventually called performing test command invoked original user allows verb protect unauthorised use
Compiled language rely runtime system provide information source code
A compiled executable example record name method block executable providing table correspond underlying method selector method compiled program
In compiled language support runtime creation function runtime environment must include compiler interpreter
Reflection implemented language reflection facility using system define automated change
The following code snippet create invoke
For normal call sequence shown
The following example This example assumes class declared unit called This notable example since Delphi unmanaged fully natively compiled language unlike language support reflection
Its language architecture inherits strongly typed Pascal significant influence SmallTalk
Compare example many dynamic script language like Perl Python PHP language runtime like Java C

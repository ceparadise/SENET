Sites requesting create alphanumeric password asking u use combination number letter creates stronger password
We also use alphanumeric key create file name although symbol accepted part file name slash
That seem secret
The language part come play start talking alphanumeric character term actual computer programming
Since computer central processing unit specific use machine language form number communicate computer programmer need write instruction using number rather alphabet character

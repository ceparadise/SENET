This section teach format writing proof walk example proof
There standard method proving implication couple point apply proof
Now go basic method proving implication

Write Assume Show Q logically follows
So far good
But still replace seems like phrase solid logical argument
We get better handle part factoring without much difficulty x x x
Aha
For x term right side nonnegative
And product nonnegative term also nonnegative
We organize observation clean proof
Multiplying left side prof claimed

Prove contrapositive
Assume r rational
Then exist integer b Squaring side give Since integer r also rational
Many mathematical theorem assert two statement logically equivalent one hold

serf either support counter
Such evidence expected interpretation accordance
Standards scientific evidence vary according field inquiry strength scientific evidence generally based result strength
A person assumption belief relationship observation hypothesis affect whether person take observation evidence
These assumption belief also affect person utilizes observation evidence
For example Earth apparent lack motion may taken evidence geocentric cosmology
However sufficient evidence presented heliocentric cosmology apparent lack motion explained initial observation strongly discounted evidence
When rational observer different background belief may draw different conclusion scientific evidence
For example working explained observation decomposition using phlogiston
In contrast developing theory element explained observation reference oxygen
Note causal relationship observation hypothesis exist cause observation taken evidence rather causal relationship provided person seeking establish observation evidence
A formal method characterize effect background belief
In Bayesian inference belief expressed percentage indicating one confidence
One start initial probability update probability using observing evidence
As result two independent observer event rationally arrive different conclusion prior previous observation also relevant conclusion differ
However allowed communicate end agreement per
The importance background belief determination observation evidence illustrated using
If either proposition accepted true conclusion accepted either
Philosophers provided influential theory within scientific evidence play central role
In summary Popper provides scientist creatively develops theory may falsified testing theory evidence known fact
Popper theory present asymmetry evidence prove theory wrong establishing fact inconsistent theory
In contrast evidence prove theory correct evidence yet discovered may exist inconsistent theory
The philosophical community investigated logical requirement scientific evidence examination relationship evidence hypothesis contrast scientific approach focus candidate fact context

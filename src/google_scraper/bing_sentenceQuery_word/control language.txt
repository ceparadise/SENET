In order individual imperative evaluated
The emphasis explicit control flow distinguishes language language
Within imperative statement execution result choice made two path follow
For functional language function language construct exist achieve result usually termed control flow statement
A set statement turn generally structured addition grouping also defines
mechanism alter flow control way similar subroutine usually occur response external stimulus event occur rather execution control flow statement
At level control flow instruction usually work altering
For CPUs control flow instruction available conditional unconditional instruction also termed jump
The kind control flow statement supported different language vary categorized effect A explicit name number assigned fixed position within may referenced control flow statement appearing elsewhere source code
A label mark position within source code effect
alternative named label used language placed start line text source code
Languages use often impose constraint line number must increase value following line may require consecutive
For example BASIC In language label usually appearing start line immediately followed colon
For example C The language allowed whole number identifier label linked colon following statement variant allowed whole number
The statement combination English word pronounced accordingly basic form unconditional transfer control
Although may either upper lower case depending language usually written The effect goto statement cause next statement executed statement appearing immediately indicated label
Goto statement many computer scientist notably
The terminology varies may alternatively known routine procedure function especially return result method especially belong
In computer memory small current standard subroutine used mainly reduce program size
A piece code written used many time various place program
Today subroutine often used help make program structured isolating algorithm hiding data access method
If many programmer working one program subroutine one kind help divide work
In structured programming ordered sequencing successive command considered one basic control structure used building block program alongside iteration recursion choice
In May Böhm Jacopini published article showed program could transformed form involving choice IF THEN ELSE loop WHILE condition DO xxx possibly duplicated code addition Boolean variable flag
Later author showed choice replaced loop yet Boolean variable
That minimalism possible mean necessarily desirable computer theoretically need subtract one number another branch result negative practical computer dozen even hundred machine instruction
What Böhm Jacopini article showed program could
Other research showed control structure one entry one exit much easier understand form mainly could used anywhere statement without disrupting control flow
In word
Later development recently composable continued strategy making component program even freely composable
Some academic took purist approach result argued even instruction like middle loop bad practice needed proof thus advocated loop single exit point
This purist approach embodied language designed preferred tool teaching introductory programming academia
The direct application theorem may result additional local variable introduced structured chart may also result
The latter issue called context
Pascal affected problem according empirical study cited student programmer difficulty formulating correct solution Pascal several simple problem including writing function searching element array
A study Henry Shapiro cited Roberts found using control structure correct solution given subject subject wrote incorrect code problem allowed write return middle loop
Most programming language control structure initial keyword indicates type control structure involved
Languages divide whether control structure final keyword
Conditional expression conditional construct feature perform different computation action depending whether evaluates true false
Less common variation include compare given value specified constant take action according first constant match
There usually provision default action else otherwise taken match succeeds
Switch statement allow compiler optimization
In case may limited constant expression might extend example right implement default case matching string
Case logic also implemented functional form statement
A loop sequence statement specified may carried several time succession
The code inside loop loop shown obeyed specified number time collection item condition met
In language loop expressed using rather explicit looping construct
special case recursion easily transformed iteration
Most programming language construction repeating loop certain number time
In case counting go downwards instead upwards step size used
In example N body loop may execute I value depending programming language
In many programming language integer reliably used loop
number represented imprecisely due hardware constraint loop might repeated time depending rounding error hardware compiler version
Furthermore increment X occurs repeated addition accumulated rounding error may mean value X iteration differ quite significantly expected sequence
Most programming language construction repeating loop condition change
Some variation test condition start loop others test end
If test start body may skipped completely end body always executed least
A value change detection method used within ordinary loop trigger processing group value
Values monitored within loop change diverts program flow handling group event associated
Several programming language later special construct allow implicit looping element array member set collection
generalise loop also support us
comprehension together provide similar function Scala
General iteration construct C statement form used express sort loop others looping number collection parallel
Where specific looping construct used usually preferred general iteration construct since often make purpose expression clearer
used assure program segment loop forever exceptional condition arises error
For instance program loop forever handling event occur stopping process terminated operator
Infinite loop implemented using control flow construct
Most commonly unstructured programming jump back goto structured programming indefinite loop loop set never end either omitting condition explicitly setting true
Some language special construct infinite loop typically omitting condition indefinite loop
Examples include Ada Fortran Go Ruby
Often infinite loop unintentionally created programming error loop wherein loop condition us variable never change within loop
Sometimes within body loop desire skip remainder loop body continue next iteration loop
Some language provide statement language Perl Ruby
The effect prematurely terminate innermost loop body resume normal next iteration
If iteration last one loop effect terminate entire loop early
Some language like Perl Ruby statement restarts current iteration start
Ruby statement restarts entire loop initial iteration
When using loop search table might desirable stop searching soon required item found
Some programming language provide statement language Perl effect terminate current loop immediately transfer control statement immediately loop
The following example done support
Both feature similar comparing code snippet show difference must combined statement construct
support conditional execution code depending whether loop exited early statement using loop
For example The clause example linked statement inner statement
Both Python loop support else clause executed early exit loop occurred
Some language support breaking nested loop theory circle called break
One common use example searching table
This done either via multilevel break break level bash PHP via labeled break break continue given label Java Perl
Alternatives multilevel break include single break together state variable tested break another level exception caught level broken placing nested loop function using return effect termination entire nested loop using label goto statement
C include multilevel break usual alternative use goto implement labeled break
Python multilevel break continue proposed rejected basis added complexity worth rare legitimate use
The notion break interest give rise today called
In refined proving possible avoid adding additional variable structured programming long break loop allowed
Furthermore Kosaraju proved strict hierarchy program exists every integer exists program containing break depth rewritten program break depth le without introducing added variable
One also subroutine executing looped statement breaking nested loop subroutine
There multiple break generally implemented exception instead
In textbook us Tennent notion explain similarity break return statement
Watt note class sequencer known defined sequencer terminates execution textually enclosing command procedure encompasses break loop including break return statement
As commonly implemented however return sequencer may also carry return value whereas break sequencer implemented contemporary language usually
used express correctness loop
In practical term loop variant integer expression initial value
The variant value must decrease loop iteration must never become negative correct execution loop
Loop variant used guarantee loop terminate
A loop invariant assertion must true first loop iteration remain true iteration
This implies loop terminates correctly exit condition loop invariant satisfied
Loop invariant used monitor specific property loop successive iteration
Some programming language contain native support loop variant invariant
In case support specification
Some dialect provide extensive sublanguage describing Loops
An early example found Conversional Lisp
provides Loop macro implement sublanguage
Many programming language especially favoring dynamic style programming offer construct
These cause flow execution jump given context resume predeclared point
three common sort control construct exotic one also exist keyword
standard condition ZERODIVIDE SUBSCRIPTRANGE ENDFILE raised intercepted ON action Programmers also define use named condition
Like one statement specified many case GOTO needed decide flow control resume
Unfortunately implementation substantial overhead space time especially SUBSCRIPTRANGE many programmer tried avoid using condition
Common Syntax example Modern language specialized structured construct exception handling rely use break return
For example one write Any number variety clause used
If matching particular control percolate back subroutine call nested block matching found end main program reached point program forcibly stopped suitable error message
Via influence keyword reserved declaring exception handler language popular today like Java C
Some language like Ada use keyword introduce exception handler may even employ different keyword Ada pattern matching
A language like incorporate placeholder exception handler syntax automatically extract several piece information exception occurs
This approach exemplified construct AppleScript David Watt textbook also analyzes exception handling framework sequencer introduced article section early exit loop
Watt note abnormal situation generally exemplified arithmetic overflow failure like file found kind error detected program unit handler naturally located program unit
For example program might contain several call read file action perform file found depends meaning purpose file question program thus handling routine abnormal situation located system code
Watts note introducing status flag testing caller structured programming even return sequencer would entail result situation application code tends get cluttered test status flag programmer might forgetfully lazily omit test status flag
In fact abnormal situation represented status flag default ignored
Watt note contrast status flag testing exception opposite causing program terminate unless programmer explicitly deal exception way possibly adding explicit code ignore
Based argument Watt concludes jump sequencer escape sequencer suitable dedicated exception sequencer semantics discussed
In Object Pascal D Java C Python clause added construct
No matter control leaf code inside clause guaranteed execute
This useful writing code must relinquish expensive resource opened file database connection finished processing Since pattern fairly common C special syntax Upon leaving compiler guarantee object released effectively variable file stream abstracting side effect initializing releasing file
Python statement Ruby block argument used similar effect
All language mentioned define standard exception circumstance thrown
Users throw exception fact allows user throw catch almost type including basic type like whereas language like Java permissive
C introduced async keyword supporting direct style
also known semicoroutines allow control yielded consumer method temporarily typically using keyword
Like async keyword support programming direct style
function yield control form without thread
Coroutines implemented library programming language provides either continuation generator distinction coroutines generator practice technical detail
In spoof article Lawrence Clark suggested GOTO statement could replaced statement provides entertaining example
COMEFROM implemented one named
article Structured Programming go Statements identifies two situation covered control structure listed gave example control structure could handle situation
Despite utility construct yet found way mainstream programming language
The following proposed If omitted get loop test top
If omitted get loop test bottom
If omitted get infinite loop
Hence single construction replace several construction programming language
A possible variant allow one test within loop use see next section appears cover case better
Languages lacking construct generally emulate using equivalent idiom In loop construct represented using standard infinite loop clause middle confused statement following section
Naming loop like example optional permit leaving outer loop several nested loop
This proposed
A modified version presented
used specify event may occur within occurrence indicated using name event statement
When event occur relevant action carried control pass
This construction provides clear separation determining situation applies action taken situation
conceptually similar exception similar construct used purpose many language
The following simple example involves searching table particular item
One way attack piece software redirect flow execution program
A variety technique including shadow stack pointer verification used defend attack

The control structure allows program follow path execution
Iteration looping give computer much power
They repeat sequence step often necessary appropriate repetition quite simple step solve complex problem

In pseudocode used article indicates multiplication used assign value variable
The following programming fragment employ structure finding one root quadratic equation using quadratic formula
The quadratic formula assumes nonzero discriminant portion within sign negative order obtain root
Conditionals check assumption The function used fragment example subprogram also called procedure subroutine function
A subprogram like sauce recipe given used part many recipe
Subprograms take input quantity needed produce result sauce
Commonly used subprogram generally collection library provided language
Subprograms may call subprogram definition shown following routine ABS function

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

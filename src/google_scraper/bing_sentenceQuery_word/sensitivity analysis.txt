study output system numerical otherwise apportioned different source uncertainty input
A related practice greater focus ideally uncertainty sensitivity analysis run tandem
The process recalculating outcome alternative assumption determine impact variable sensitivity analysis useful range purpose including A example model engineering etc
highly complex result relationship input output may poorly understood
In case model viewed
output opaque function input
Quite often model input subject source including absence information poor partial understanding driving force mechanism
This uncertainty imposes limit response output model
Further model may cope natural intrinsic variability system aleatory occurrence event
Good modeling practice requires modeler provide evaluation confidence model
This requires first uncertainty model result second evaluation much input contributing output uncertainty
Sensitivity analysis address second issue although uncertainty analysis usually necessary precursor performing role ordering importance strength relevance input determining variation output
In model involving many input variable sensitivity analysis essential ingredient model building quality assurance
National international agency involved study included section devoted sensitivity analysis guideline
Examples see
guideline White House modelling guideline
The choice method sensitivity analysis typically dictated number problem constraint setting
Some common There large number approach performing sensitivity analysis many developed address one constraint discussed
They also distinguished type sensitivity measure based example
In general however procedure adhere following outline In case procedure repeated example problem user screen unimportant variable performing full sensitivity analysis
The various type core method discussed distinguished various sensitivity measure calculated
These category somehow overlap
Alternative way obtaining measure constraint problem given
One simplest common approach changing OAT see effect produce output
OAT customarily involves Sensitivity may measured monitoring change output

This appears logical approach change observed output unambiguously due single variable changed
Furthermore changing one variable time one keep variable fixed central baseline value
This increase comparability result computed reference central point space minimizes chance computer programme crash likely several input factor changed simultaneously
OAT frequently preferred modeller practical reason
In case model failure OAT analysis modeller immediately know input factor responsible failure
Despite simplicity however approach fully explore input space since take account simultaneous variation input variable
This mean OAT approach detect presence input variable
Local method involve taking output respect input factor subscript indicates derivative taken fixed point space input hence name class
Adjoint modelling Automated Differentiation method class
Similar local method attempt fully explore input space since examine small perturbation typically one variable time
A simple useful tool plot output variable individual input variable randomly sampling model input distribution
The advantage approach also deal given data
set data point give direct visual indication sensitivity
Quantitative measure also drawn example measuring even estimating measure
context sensitivity analysis involves fitting model response using direct measure sensitivity
The regression required linear respect data
hyperplane hence quadratic term regressors otherwise difficult interpret standardised coefficient
This method therefore suitable model response fact linear linearity confirmed instance large
The advantage regression analysis simple low computational cost
method class probabilistic approach quantify input output uncertainty decompose output variance part attributable input variable combination variable
The sensitivity output input variable therefore measured amount variance output caused input
These expressed conditional expectation
considering model measure sensitivity th variable given Var denote variance expected value operator respectively denotes set input variable except
This expression essentially measure contribution alone uncertainty variance averaged variation variable known
Importantly measure uncertainty caused interaction variable
A measure known give total variance caused interaction input variable
Both quantity typically standardised dividing Var
method allow full exploration input space accounting interaction nonlinear response
For reason widely used feasible calculate
Typically calculation involves use method since involve many thousand model run method emulator used reduce computational expense necessary
Note full variance decomposition meaningful input factor independent one another
One major shortcoming previous sensitivity analysis method none considers spatially ordered structure response model parameter space
By utilizing concept directional covariograms Variogram Analysis Response Surfaces VARS address weakness recognizing spatially continuous correlation structure value hence also value
Basically higher variability heterogeneous response surface along particular specific perturbation scale
Accordingly VARS framework value directional given perturbation scale considered comprehensive illustration sensitivity information linking variogram analysis direction perturbation scale concept
As result VARS framework account fact sensitivity concept thus overcomes scale issue traditional sensitivity analysis method
More importantly VARS able provide relatively stable statistically robust estimate parameter sensitivity much lower computational cost strategy two order magnitude efficient
Noteworthy shown theoretical link VARS framework approach
Screening particular instance method
The objective rather identify input variable contributing significantly output uncertainty model rather exactly quantifying sensitivity
term variance
Screening tends relatively low computational cost compared approach used preliminary analysis weed uninfluential variable applying informative analysis remaining set
One commonly used screening method
A number method developed overcome constraint discussed would otherwise make estimation sensitivity measure infeasible often due
Generally method focus efficiently calculating measure sensitivity
Emulators also known metamodels surrogate model response surface approach involve building relatively simple mathematical function known approximates behaviour model
In word concept modelling model hence name metamodel
The idea although computer model may complex series equation take long time solve always regarded function input
By running model number point input space may possible fit much simpler emulator within acceptable margin error
Then sensitivity measure calculated emulator either Monte Carlo analytically negligible additional computational cost
Importantly number model run required fit emulator order magnitude le number run required directly estimate sensitivity measure model
Clearly crux emulator approach find emulator sufficiently close approximation model
This requires following step Sampling model often done due mathematician although random design also used loss efficiency
The selection emulator type training intrinsically linked since training method dependent class emulator
Some type emulator used successfully sensitivity analysis include The use emulator introduces problem difficult response model highly
In case useful check accuracy emulator example using
A HDMR term due Rabitz essentially emulator approach involves decomposing function output linear combination input term interaction increasing dimensionality
The HDMR approach exploit fact model usually neglecting interaction second
The term truncated series approximated
polynomial spline REFS response expressed sum main effect interaction truncation order
From perspective HDMRs seen emulator neglect interaction advantage able emulate model higher dimensionality emulator
The Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test FAST us represent multivariate function model frequency domain using single frequency variable
Therefore integral required calculate sensitivity index become univariate resulting computational saving
Methods based Monte Carlo filtering
These also objective identify region space input factor corresponding particular value
high low output
In uncertainty sensitivity analysis crucial trade scrupulous analyst exploring input wide resulting may
The point well illustrated econometrician I proposed form organized sensitivity analysis I call sensitivity analysis neighborhood alternative assumption selected corresponding interval inference identified
Conclusions judged sturdy neighborhood assumption wide enough credible corresponding interval inference narrow enough useful
Note Leamer emphasis need selection assumption
The easiest way invalidate model demonstrate fragile respect uncertainty assumption show assumption taken enough
The concept expressed Jerome Ravetz bad modeling Some common difficulty sensitivity analysis include Some example sensitivity analysis performed various discipline follow
Environmental computer model increasingly used wide variety study application
For example used
Moreover computer model increasingly used environmental local scale example assessing impact waste water treatment plant river flow assessing behavior contaminated waste water
In case sensitivity analysis may help understand contribution various source uncertainty model output uncertainty system performance general
In case depending model complexity different sampling strategy may advisable traditional sensitivity index generalized cover multiple model output effect correlated input
In decision problem analyst may want identify cost driver well quantity need acquire better knowledge order make informed decision
On hand quantity influence prediction save resource loss accuracy relaxing condition

In modern econometrics use sensitivity analysis anticipate criticism subject one ten commandment applied econometrics Thou shall confess presence sensitivity
Corollary Thou shall anticipate criticism When reporting sensitivity analysis researcher explain fully specification search reader judge result may affected
This basically best policy approach advocated Leamer

This important task
In setting alternative described term set evaluative criterion
These criterion associated weight importance
Intuitively one may think larger weight criterion critical criterion
However may case
It important distinguish notion By mean criterion small change percentage weight may cause significant change final solution
It possible criterion rather small weight importance one important respect much critical given situation one larger weight
That sensitivity analysis may shed light issue anticipated beginning study
This turn may dramatically improve effectiveness initial study assist successful implementation final solution

This approach called auditing
It take inspiration NUSAP method used qualify worth quantitative information generation number

What Is Sensitivity Analysis
There many different way decision maker try predict future outcome decision
They many guess kinder term go gut
Some may consider past look similar decision outcome decision
If really clever look difference current condition historical example using consider may impact outcome
And right information understanding use sensitivity analysis
investigation certain variable impact single independent variable much change variable change independent variable
That complex idea let use example
Imagine business make case smartphones
Each month make many case sit around may even go waste new phone introduced
But make enough case selling many could maximizing profit
Thus beginning month faced decision many case make
The first step sensitivity analysis identify dependent variable want predict b many independent variable might impact dependent variable
In business case number case produce dependent variable
It dependent depends number factor
Those factor independent variable
So independent variable could impact many case sell thus many case need make
Your advertising budget one advertise extent sell
Let measure term advertising budget
What else
The price case impact
You noticed drop price sell raise price
Anything else
How day week since latest version specific popular smartphone announced
If customer think new phone coming going buy phone buy phone buying case
After considering independent variable would use data analysis package probably Microsoft Excel others exist use historical data regression analysis create
This equation put independent variable see outcome

But remember talking specifically demand analysis regression talking sensitivity analysis
So care equation
Because sensitivity analysis figuring sensitive demand variable
You looking coefficient variable tell increase variable demand
If remember algebra terminology variable value change
In example advertising price day since last version
Coefficients static number indicate much increase variable impact demand
In example coefficient advertising increasing advertising increase demand case
We measured advertising term budget increase budget could reasonably anticipate demand increasing case
We measured price dollar well increasing price would decrease demand case
You see would decrease negative sign coefficient price
Finally day since launch recent phone demand go case
This information give need consider sensitive demand product based certain variable
You change variable coefficient variable see expect happen demand
This allows answer question like would happen I invest advertising
would happen I cut price product
happen new phone announced next month
For decision maker especially working quantitative data understanding variable interact important
It often easy correctly guess directional correlation I increase price demand go
But finance manager production manager need information
Knowing direction impact small part decision making
Understanding significant change critical optimizing production profit
tool manager use get information

This view SA process highly consistent A conceptual difficulty theoretical framework using optimisation model outlined appendix
This version paper modified original journal article reduce emphasis economics since content relevant discipline simplify section Bayesian decision theory moving part Appendix

statistical measure performance also known statistic Another way understand context sensitivity extent true positive false negative specificity extent positive really represent condition interest condition mistaken false positive
Thus highly sensitive test rarely overlook positive example showing nothing bad despite something bad existing highly specific test rarely register positive anything target testing example finding one bacterial specie another closely related one true target test highly sensitive highly specific rarely overlook thing looking rarely mistake anything else thing
Because medical test sensitivity specificity value rarely equate
But practical reason test sensitivity specificity value high credibility albeit usually certainty
Sensitivity therefore quantifies avoiding specificity
For test usually measure instance since testing passenger potential threat safety scanner may set trigger alarm item like belt buckle key low specificity order increase probability identifying dangerous object minimize risk missing object pose threat high sensitivity
This represented graphically using curve
A perfect predictor would described sensitive meaning sick individual correctly identified sick specific meaning healthy individual incorrectly identified sick
In reality however predictor posse minimum known
Imagine study evaluating new test screen people disease
Each person taking test either disease
The test outcome positive classifying person disease negative classifying person disease
The test result subject may may match subject actual status
In setting In general Positive identified negative rejected
Therefore Let u consider group positive instance negative instance condition
The four outcome formulated follows Sensitivity refers test ability correctly detect ill patient condition
In example medical test used identify disease sensitivity test proportion people test positive disease among disease
Mathematically expressed A negative result test high sensitivity useful ruling disease
A high sensitivity test reliable result negative since rarely misdiagnoses disease
A test sensitivity recognize patient disease testing positive
A negative test result would definitively presence disease patient
A positive result test high sensitivity useful ruling disease
Suppose test kit designed show one reading positive
When used diseased patient patient test positive giving test sensitivity
However sensitivity definition take account false positive
The bogus test also return positive healthy patient giving false positive rate rendering useless detecting ruling disease
Sensitivity ratio true positive combined true false positive much statement proportion actual positive population tested test
The calculation sensitivity take account indeterminate test result
If test repeated indeterminate sample either excluded analysis number exclusion stated quoting sensitivity treated false negative give value sensitivity may therefore underestimate
Specificity relates test ability correctly reject healthy patient without condition
Consider example medical test diagnosing disease
Specificity test proportion healthy patient known disease test negative
Mathematically also written A positive result test high specificity useful ruling disease
The test rarely give positive result healthy patient
A test specificity read negative accurately exclude disease healthy patient
A positive result signifies high probability presence disease
A test higher specificity lower rate
High sensitivity low specificity Low sensitivity high specificity In test sensitivity ability test correctly identify disease true positive rate whereas test specificity ability test correctly identify without disease true negative rate
If patient known disease tested test positive test sensitivity
If disease tested return negative result test specificity
Sensitivity specificity test characteristic value intrinsic test depend disease prevalence population interest
Positive negative predictive value sensitivity specificity value influenced prevalence disease population tested
These concept illustrated graphically applet show positive negative predictive value function prevalence sensitivity specificity
It often claimed highly specific test effective ruling disease positive highly sensitive test deemed effective ruling disease negative
This led widely used mnemonic SPIN SNOUT according highly SPecific test Positive rule IN disease highly test Negative rule OUT disease
Both rule thumb however inferentially misleading diagnostic power test determined sensitivity specificity
The tradeoff Specificity Sensitivity explored trade TPR FPR Recall Fallout
Giving equal weight optimizes Informedness magnitude give probability informed decision two class represents appropriate use information represents performance represents perverse use information
The pronounced used signal
It provides separation mean signal noise distribution compared standard deviation noise distribution
For signal noise mean standard deviation respectively defined An estimate also found measurement hit rate rate
It calculated function inverse
statistic
A higher indicates signal readily detected
Hence large number false positive false negative positive screen test poor confirming disorder PPV investigation must undertaken however correctly identify case sensitivity
However screening test negative result good reassuring patient disorder NPV initial screen correctly identifies cancer specificity
Sensitivity specificity value alone may highly misleading
The sensitivity specificity must calculated order avoid reliance experiment result
For example particular test may easily show sensitivity tested gold standard four time single additional test gold standard gave poor result would imply sensitivity
A common way state often calculated using Wilson score interval
sensitivity specificity calculated giving range value within correct value lie given confidence level
In positive predictive value called sensitivity called
Unlike Specificity v Sensitivity tradeoff measure independent number true negative generally unknown much larger actual number relevant retrieved document
This assumption large number true negative versus positive rare application
The used single measure performance test positive class
The precision recall In traditional language sensitivity test called test although word context general usage applicable present context
A sensitive test fewer

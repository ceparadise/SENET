Logout Restart Shutdown self explanatory
What difference Suspend Hibernate shutdown menu
turn computer
It put computer peripheral low power consumption mode
If battery run computer turn reason current session unsaved change lost
save state computer hard disk completely power
When resuming saved state restored RAM
The script use term Bonne chance
Just like locking smartphone
Completely power system viz
PC laptop
Power start
Pur computer low power state screen everything else low power resume work left battery die loose unsaved data
suspend disk includes look like shutdown
Basically everything Ram copied swap memory system shutdown completely
start computer back everything copy back Ram continue left

In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within one process executing sharing resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share executable code value variable given time
Systems single processor generally implement multithreading CPU switch different
This generally happens often rapidly enough user perceive thread task running parallel
On system multiple thread execute every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously processor core separate software thread also executed concurrently separate hardware thread
Threads made early appearance MVT context called task
The term thread attributed
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Furthermore program threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort time slicing
Threads differ traditional operating system Systems said thread process operating system great difference except cost switch architecture notably result TLB flush
In one time
The opposite multithreading
While suggested term misleading term widely accepted within community
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context one process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied one process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread either cooperatively
On widely used approach finer grained control execution time via
However preemptive scheduling may context switch thread moment unanticipated programmer therefore causing
In contrast relies thread relinquish control execution thus ensuring thread
This create problem cooperatively multitasked thread waiting thread yielding control execution intensive computation
Until early desktop computer one CPU support although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
In added support processor name introduced processor introduced processor
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
Scheduling done kernel level user level multitasking done preemptively cooperatively
This yield variety related concept
At kernel level contains one share process resource memory file handle process unit resource thread unit scheduling execution
Kernel scheduling typically uniformly done preemptively le commonly cooperatively
At user level process schedule multiple thread execution
If share data Erlang usually analogously called process share data usually called particularly preemptively scheduled
Cooperatively scheduled user thread known different process may schedule user thread differently
User thread may executed kernel thread various way
The term variously refers user thread kernel mechanism scheduling user thread onto kernel thread
A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling creating destroying switching process relatively expensive
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory code data socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way see
Creating destroying process relatively expensive resource must acquired released
Processes typically preemptively multitasked process switching relatively expensive beyond basic cost due issue cache flushing
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including thus relatively cheap create destroy
Thread switching also relatively cheap requires context switch saving restoring register stack pointer change virtual memory thus leaving TLB valid
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor SMP system contend memory bus especially locking fine
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map one scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage used
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual processor
This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation support threading provide access native threading APIs operating system
Some usually programming language language expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
Several programming language language extension also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer fully MPI
Some language designed sequential parallelism instead especially using GPUs without requiring concurrency thread
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby Python support threading concurrency parallel execution thread due GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter simultaneously interpreting application code two thread effectively limit parallelism multiple core system
This limit performance mostly thread require processor much one
Other implementation interpreted programming language using Thread extension avoid GIL limit using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation Pthreads set library call
OS vendor free implement interface desired application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface multithreading like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
Multithreading library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free multithreading function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage set number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed array thread run parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel use GPU architecture

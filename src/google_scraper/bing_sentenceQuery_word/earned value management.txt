method combine scope resource schedule ass project progress performance
Earned value management requires baseline schedule financials scope
As project progress future earned value calculation compared baseline determine project health status
To understand earned value project manager basic understanding schedule budget
The also known baseline schedule used comparison judge project health
The also known baseline budget like baseline schedule used calculation determine health project
The first component needed determine health project authorized budget given scheduled work
This budget assigned activity planned work work breakdown structure
Planned value referred
Following PV project manager need know
This planned value activity work breakdown structure summed
Budget completion referred
The first calculation earned value method
Earned value measure work performed expressed term budget authorized work activity
Earned value used calculate percentage work completed
Project manager calculate earned value given interval end project determine current status performance trending
Earned value designated
While project manager monitor project budget forget see spent
The amount spent known
Actual cost realized cost work performed activity given time period
Unlike budget actual cost limit project depending organization allow PM dig deep hole regarding actual cost
Actual cost designated
As project progress project manager able determine activity starting finishing ahead behind schedule
The difference called
Schedule variance difference EV PV
Simply put calculation determines project behind ahead schedule given point time
Schedule variance designated
The formula straightforward SV EV PV The project manager evaluate project budget amount spent known
Cost variance calculated determine project ahead surplus behind deficit budget
Cost variance designated
The equation calculate CV CV EV AC Get FREE access day create account
Now project manager lot information gathered calculated project manager need determine health project
To determine project ahead behind schedule project manager need calculate
This expressed ratio earned planned value
This ratio express project team using time either efficiently inefficiently
Schedule performance index designated
To calculate SPI use following formula SPI EV PV The final calculation ratio EV AC
This important metric earned value method
Cost performance index designated
The CPI show much work completed much spent
To calculate CPI use following formula CPI EV AC After calculated SPI CPI every project manager must ask prepared answer project relation planned
The metric CPI SPI
If answer project well
If calculation yield project baseline
If calculation project issue
Let look example
We start project
Ted running generator install project duration month
In preparation review calculates CPI SPI
These result show Ted spending le money planned falling behind schedule
To meet schedule Ted need make change spend money either add personnel resource help recover schedule
Now let look second example
Steve completed valve replacement project
The baseline budget budget completion
The baseline schedule week completed week
His final review show CPI SPI
This project budget behind schedule
Steve good job noticing behind schedule budget
In lesson learned basic project manager us calculation determine health project
You learned component earned value management The important calculation earned value method cost performance metric
If SPI CPI equal project schedule budget
If project CPI SPI project ahead SPI CPI project behind
All project manager strive come budget ahead schedule

Earned Value Management Terms Formulas Project Managers How Assess Your Project Stakeholders Power Interest How Use Stakeholder Register Template How Gather Ideas Projects Handling Administrative Issues End Your Project The basic premise earned value management EVM piece work equal amount fund budgeted complete
As part EVM use following information ass schedule cost performance throughout project
The approved budget work scheduled completed specified date also referred BCWS
The total PV task equal task BAC total amount budgeted task
The approved budget work actually completed specified date also referred BCWP
The cost actually incurred work completed specified date also referred ACWP
Monitoring project performance involves determining whether ahead behind schedule budget
But comparing actual expenditure budget tell whether budget EVM come
To describe project schedule cost performance EVM use following indicator The difference amount budgeted work actually work planned
The SV show whether much work ahead behind approved schedule
The difference amount budgeted amount actually spent work performed
The CV show whether much approved budget
The ratio approved budget work performed approved budget work planned
The SPI reflects relative amount project ahead behind schedule sometimes referred project You use SPI date project schedule performance remainder task
The ratio approved budget work performed actually spent work
The CPI reflects relative value work done compared amount paid sometimes referred project You use CPI date project cost performance remainder task
You approximate amount time behind ahead approved schedule drawing line intersection EV assessment date line parallel PV line
Doing suggests project described graph one month behind schedule
Schedule cost variance performance indicator defined mathematically follows Schedule variance SV Earned value EV Planned value PV Cost variance CV Earned value EV Actual cost AC Schedule performance index SPI Earned value EV Planned value PV Cost performance index CPI Earned value EV Actual cost AC The final step assessing task performance date update expect total expenditure upon task completion
Specifically want determine following Your estimate today total cost task Your estimate amount fund required complete work still remaining done task You use following two approach calculate EAC Assume cost performance remainder task revert originally budgeted
EAC Approved budget entire task Cost variance work done date task Budget completion BAC Actual cost AC Earned value EV Assume cost performance remainder task work done date
EAC Budget completion BAC Cumulative cost performance index CPI Whether use Method Method calculate EAC ETC determined follows ETC Budget completion BAC Actual cost date AC

technique measuring project performance progress objective manner
Earned value management project management technique measuring project performance progress
It ability combine measurement In single integrated system Earned Value Management able provide accurate forecast project performance problem important contribution project management
Early EVM research showed area planning control significantly impacted use similarly using methodology improves scope definition well analysis overall project performance
More recent research study shown principle EVM positive predictor project success
Popularity EVM grown recent year beyond government contracting sector importance continues rise recent new rule part EVM also surface help substantiate contract dispute
Essential feature EVM implementation include EVM implementation large complex project include many feature indicator forecast cost performance budget budget schedule performance behind schedule ahead schedule
However basic requirement EVM system quantifies progress using PV EV
Project A approved duration year budget X
It also planned project spends approved budget first month
If month start project Project Manager would report spent budget one initially think project perfectly plan
However reality provided information sufficient come conclusion
The project spend budget whilst finishing work would mean project well project spend budget whilst completing work would mean project better planned
EVM meant address similar issue
EVM emerged specialty program since become significant branch
Project management investigating contribution EVM project success suggests moderately strong positive relationship
Implementations EVM scaled fit project size complexity
The genesis EVM occurred industrial manufacturing turn century based largely principle earned time popularized concept took root
The original concept called considered overly burdensome adaptable contractor mandated use many variation began proliferate among various procurement program
In established approach using set criterion called Control Systems Criteria
In early analysis grew technique often ignored even actively resisted government industry
often considered financial control tool could delegated analytical specialist
In EVM introduced architecture engineering industry Public Works Magazine article David Burstein project manager national engineering firm
This technique taught ever since part project management training program presented PSMJ Resources international training consulting firm specializes engineering architecture industry
In late early EVM emerged project management methodology understood used manager executive EVM specialist
In EVM leadership elevated Undersecretary Defense Acquisition thus making EVM element program management procurement
In canceled Navy Program performance problem detected EVM
This demonstrated conclusively EVM mattered leadership
In many eliminated streamlined
However EVM survived acquisition reform movement became strongly associated acquisition reform movement
Most notably ownership EVM criterion reduced transferred industry adoption ANSI EIA standard
The use EVM expanded beyond Department Defense
It adopted agency
Many industrialized nation also began utilize EVM procurement program
An overview EVM included first Guide expanded subsequent edition
In recent edition PMBOK guide EVM listed among general tool technique process control project cost
The construction industry early commercial adopter EVM
Closer integration EVM practice project management accelerated
In Performance Management Association merged become PMI first college College Performance Management
The began mandate use EVM across government agency first time certain internally managed project contractor
EVM also received greater attention publicly traded company response
In Australia EVM codified standard AS AS
It helpful see example project tracking include earned value performance management
Consider project planned detail including spend plan element work
show cumulative budget cost project function time blue line labeled PV
It also show cumulative actual cost project red line labeled AC week
To unfamiliar EVM might appear project budget week budget week week
However missing chart understanding much work accomplished project
If project actually completed week project would actually well budget well ahead schedule
If hand project complete week project significantly budget behind schedule
A method needed measure technical performance objectively quantitatively EVM accomplishes
Consider project except time project plan includes method quantifying accomplishment work
At end week identifies every detailed element work completed sum EV completed element
Earned value may accumulated monthly weekly progress made
show EV curve green along PV curve Figure
The chart indicates technical performance progress started rapidly planned slowed significantly fell behind schedule week
This chart illustrates schedule performance aspect EVM
It complementary schedule management
show EV curve green actual cost data Figure red
It seen project actually budget relative amount work accomplished since start project
This much better conclusion might derived Figure show three curve together typical EVM line chart
The best way read chart identify EV curve first compare PV schedule performance AC cost performance
It seen illustration true understanding cost performance schedule performance This EVM
EVM mentioned depend size complexity project
However EVM vary significantly depending circumstance
In many case organization establish threshold project threshold require complex EVM system project threshold exempted
Another approach gaining favor scale EVM implementation according project hand skill level project team
There many small simple project large complex one yet historically largest complex enjoyed benefit EVM
Still lightweight implementation EVM achievable person basic spreadsheet skill
In fact implementation excellent way learn basic EVM skill
The define work
This typically done hierarchical arrangement called WBS although simplest project may use simple list task
In either case important WBS list comprehensive
It also important element work easily categorized one one element work
The detailed element WBS hierarchy item list called activity task
The assign value called planned value PV activity
For large project PV almost always allocation total project budget may unit currency dollar euro naira labor hour
However simple project activity may assigned weighted point value might budget number
Assigning weighted value achieving consensus PV quantity yield important benefit EVM expose misunderstanding miscommunications scope project resolving difference always occur early possible
Some terminal element known planned great detail advance expected refined later time
The define earning rule activity
The simplest method apply one earning rule rule activity
Using rule credit earned element work finished
A related rule called rule mean credit earned element work started remaining earned upon completion
Other fixed earning rule rule rule gaining favor assign weight finishing work starting also motivate project team identify element work started improve awareness
These simple earning rule work well small simple project generally activity tends fairly short duration
These initial three step define minimal amount planning simplified EVM
The execute project according plan measure progress
When activity started finished EV accumulated according earning rule
This typically done regular interval weekly monthly reason EV accumulated near work element
In fact waiting update EV per month simply cost data available detracts primary benefit using EVM create technical performance project team
In lightweight implementation described project manager accumulated cost defined detailed project schedule network using critical path critical chain methodology
While omission inappropriate managing large project common reasonable occurrence many small simple project
Any project benefit using EV alone score progress
One useful result simple approach without schedule model actual cost accumulation compare EV curve similar project illustrated
In example progress three residential construction project compared aligning starting date
If three home construction project measured PV valuation schedule performance project easily compared
In many project schedule performance completing work time equal importance technical performance
For example project place high premium finishing quickly
It cost unimportant finishing work later competitor may cost great deal lost market share
It likely kind project use lightweight version EVM described previous section planned timescale measuring schedule performance
A second layer EVM skill helpful managing schedule performance intermediate project
The project manager may employ build
As lightweight implementation project manager must define work comprehensively typically WBS hierarchy
construct project schedule model describes precedence link element work
This schedule model used develop PV curve baseline shown
It noted measuring schedule performance using EVM replace need understand schedule performance versus project schedule model
However EVM schedule performance illustrated provides additional indicator one communicated single chart
Although theoretically possible detailed schedule analysis yield different conclusion broad schedule analysis practice tends high correlation two
Although EVM schedule measurement necessarily conclusive provide useful diagnostic information
Although intermediate implementation require unit currency dollar common practice use budgeted dollar scale PV EV
It also common practice track labor hour parallel currency
The following EVM formula schedule management require accumulation actual cost AC
This important common small intermediate size project true cost unknown unavailable
However Schedule Variance SV measured EVM method indicative
To know whether project really behind ahead schedule time completion Project Manager perform critical path analysis based precedence project activity
The actual critical path ultimately determining factor every project duration
Because earned value schedule metric take account critical path data big budget activity critical path potential dwarf impact performing small budget critical path activity
This lead gaming SV SPI metric ignoring critical path activity favor big budget activity may lot float
This sometimes even lead performing activity improve schedule tracking metric cause major problem quality
A simple process suggested fix
Create second earned value baseline strictly schedule weighted date backward pas critical path algorithm float

Allow earned value credit schedule metric taken earlier reporting period activity scheduled unless project current critical path
In way distorting aspect float would eliminated
There would benefit performing activity lot float due proper sequence
Also activity would generate negative schedule variance used float
Under method one way gaming schedule metric would eliminated
The way generating positive schedule variance SPI would completing work current critical path ahead schedule fact way project get ahead schedule
In addition managing technical schedule performance large complex project require cost performance monitored reviewed regular interval
To measure cost performance planned value BCWS earned value BCWP Budgeted Cost Work Performed must unit currency unit actual cost measured
In large implementation planned value curve commonly called Performance Measurement Baseline may arranged control account planning package planning package work package
In large project establishing control account primary method delegating responsibility authority various part performing organization
Control account cell intersection project WBS
Control account assigned Control Account Managers
Large project require elaborate process controlling baseline revision thorough integration subcontractor EVM system elaborate management procured material
In United States primary standard EVM system standard published May reaffirmed August
The standard defines criterion EVM system compliance
As year draft revision original available ANSI
Other country established similar standard
In addition using BCWS BCWP prior implementation often use term Actual Cost Work Performed instead AC
Additional acronym formula include In complex environment like software development iterative incremental Agile approach often used deliver complex product successfully
Agile EVM used trend graph make forecast progress towards completion date transparent
However EVM technique always used underlying calculation
Setting Agile EVM similar simple implementation EVM following preparation step Agile EVM executing project tracking accumulated EV according simple earning rule
Because Agile EVM evolving many year following practice Agile EVM based transparency therefore graphically used various trend chart
However EVM formula CPI SPI EAC etc
still used Agile EVM expressing input variable like EV PV AC Agile embrace change therefore scope considered variable
fixed
Instead using INITIAL estimate total number Story Points Agile EVM calculation always LATEST estimate total number Story Points used calculate CPI SPI EAC etc
The use SPI EVM rather limited forecasting schedule performance problem dependent completion earned value CTP
Because Agile EVM used complex environment earned value likely CTP
The latest estimate number fixed time interval calculated Agile EVM Proponents EVM note number issue implementing limitation may inherent concept
Because EVM requires quantification project plan often perceived inapplicable project
For example may impossible plan certain project far advance research uncovers opportunity research path actively eliminates others
However another school thought hold work planned even weekly short
Thus challenge create agile EVM principle simply reject notion measuring technical performance objectively
See lightweight implementation small project described
Applying EVM work environment fact area project management research
Traditional EVM intended continuous effort
In traditional EVM standard effort called level effort
If project plan contains significant portion LOE LOE intermixed discrete effort EVM result contaminated
This another area EVM research
Traditional definition EVM typically assume prerequisite achieving benefit EVM
Many small project satisfy either prerequisite benefit EVM described
Other project planned project network access true timely actual cost data
The system feed data required earned value management usually silo rather interfaced integrated
In practice collection true timely actual cost data difficult aspect EVM
Such project benefit EVM described
As mean overcoming objection EVM lack connection qualitative performance issue NAVAIR PEO A organization initiated project late integrate true technical achievement EVM projection utilizing risk profile
These risk profile anticipate opportunity may revealed possibly exploited development testing proceeds
The published research resulted Technical Performance Management TPM methodology software application still used many DoD agency informing EVM estimate technical achievement
The research recipient Defense Acquisition University Acquisition Research Symposium Acker Award excellence exchange information field acquisition research
There difficulty inherent periodic monitoring synchronizing data timing actual delivery actual invoicing date EVM analysis done independent item arrived invoicing time analysis delivered data likely week behind event
This may limit EVM le tactical le definitive role use combined form explain add recent news manage future expectation
There measurement limitation precisely EVM used stemming classic conflict mathematics calculate deceptively far beyond precision measurement data approximation plan
The limitation estimation commonly understood software visible
The limitation measurement largely form EVM measurement ultimately finer item may terminal element size scale reporting period typically end summary month mean delivery measure
The delivery measure may actual delivery may include estimate partial work done end month subject estimation limit typically include QC check risk offset

In House Excel Training MS Office Blog Earned value let evaluate performance project term schedule cost work
Earned value let effectively compare baseline actual value
Before analyse earned value need set baseline project
You probably know set one baseline project earned value calculation based one
To select baseline earned value calculation open Project option dialog FILE tab navigate advanced option look section titled select baseline dropdown indicated
You also notice option By default earned value based Complete field percentage task duration completed
If say making physical product may want measure completion term duration term much product completed
This field come play used tracking progress instead field
You switch default Physical Complete want measure earned value task using method switch method individual task opening task information dialog advanced tab changing option task shown
The status date reporting date
It date want earned value calculated
By default status date today date changed say want analyse earned value end month year
Also often gap gathering information time enter MS Project status date allows specify date collected data
The status date time changed Ribbon PROJECT tab Status group
There three earned value table titled Earned Value Earned Value Cost Indicators Earned Value Schedule Indicators
We going look Earned Value table contains majority information need analysis
By default table exist table menu need select view shown
The Earned Value table us abbreviated column heading appear quite daunting start definition
This cost task originally planned
The cost calculated status date
So example task x completed cost status date set half way task PV would
In example status date set exactly half way task
You see PV value exactly half Budgeted Completion BAC value baseline cost task completed
You may notice Earned Value EV Actual Cost AC value currently zero
This indicates work actually performed behind schedule
Earned value look percentage work actually completed tell u much work cost according baseline
The cost calculated status date
So half work completed status date set halfway task PV EV Actual Cost AC value assuming additional cost incurred
EV baseline cost task multiplied percentage task completed
In example status date exactly half way task
Half work recorded complete
PV say value work completed status date according baseline
The EV field also total cost task according baseline actual cost AC actually recorded spent
In another scenario status date set half way task say completed half work task
This thing would look
PV interested work actually done according baseline completed
Earned value calculates total cost task according baseline actual cost record actually spent EV AC still
Notice Schedule Variance SV value minus
SV calculates difference PV EV
So negative figure tell u spent le expected status date behind schedule
A positive number would tell u ahead schedule
Let take yet another scenario
This time status date still exactly half way task task completed
However increase resource cost hour
How look Earned Value table
Well PV tell u spent
EV fallen behind schedule actual cost
The Cost Variance CV value tell u overspent
CV calculates difference EV AC negative figure indicates overspend
The EAC field tell u estimated cost task completion
Put simply calculation look underspend status date project forward estimate task cost completion
It assumes constant rate expenditure based spent far fairly crude calculation
The formula used calculate EAC Cost Performance Index field come across yet
It inserted Earned Value table seen Earned Value Cost Indicators table
CPI calculated dividing EV AC
Let look scenario shown time showing CPI field Earned Values table
The CPI calculated CPI A value le indicates overspend
So understand CPI value let look EAC calculation detail
EAC AC example equal Now EAC value calculate difference baseline cost
This Variance Completion VAC field u
A negative figure tell u projected overspend

Exploring trend development project management today By Duncan Haughey Current performance best indicator future performance therefore using trend data possible forecast cost schedule overrun early stage project
The comprehensive trend analysis technique Earned Value method
In nutshell Earned Value approach monitor project plan actual work work completed value see project track
Earned Value show much budget time spent considering amount work done far
Here five definition Earned Value differs general budget versus actual cost incurred model requires cost work progress quantified
Earned Value allows project manager compare much work completed much expected finished given point time
The project manager need agree project scope create Work Breakdown assign budget work lowest level WBS
Next create schedule showing calendar time take complete work
This overall plan baselined planned value used measure performance throughout project
As work package completed earned compared planned value showing work achieved plan
A variance plan recorded time schedule deviation
It necessary get actual cost incurred project organisation accounting system
This cost compared Earned Value show overrun underrun
Earned Value provides project manager objective way measuring performance predicting future outcome
Earned Value enable report progress greater confidence highlight overrun earlier
This turn allows management team make cost time allocation decision sooner would otherwise case
It true past performance good indicator future performance
Earned Value useful tool predicting outcome project term time completion cost completion expected final cost
Earned Value sometimes known Performance Measurement Management Objectives Budgeted Cost Work Performed Cost Schedule Control Systems
A Work Breakdown Structure WBS hierarchical structure used organise task reporting schedule tracking cost
Work Packages small defined set task activity form part overall project scope usually lowest level Work Breakdown Structure

It mean provide measure cost schedule performance throughout project
It different simply looking planned versus actual spend data
The key purpose inform decision making highlight cost schedule issue early allowing time recovery action taken
The principle behind method represent best practice management
EVM first adopted today heart project control system example government UK USA Australia help manage performance contractor engaged major development contract
It also widely used industry Construction Oil Gas others UK elsewhere
In simple term Earned Value contract authorised budget work successfully accomplished project
Earned Value data expressed budget term using currency local environment one reason misunderstood past financial tool tool project management
So much EVM data expressed using budget value even schedule data
The data converted single unit measure planned actual cost schedule data compared literally side side example graphically
This inform understanding two primary goal project management
Traditional method representing project data simply comparing planned actual spend often contain aspect best significant weakness worst even completely misleading
It main reason big focus earned value world word cost schedule data structure etc critical making EV work
Earned Value Management EVM Status Chart common form graphical output used EVM
In chart task project behind schedule budget often expressed Cost Variance Earned Value le Actual Cost Schedule Variance Earned Value le Planned Value
This also expressed useful way described worked example
The following show basic EV work practice using simple one task example Imagine work package design new widget made number activity budget hour defined activity estimated effort
hour required
We expect work package take week
At end week planned completed workscope effort
total activity within work package sum hour activity planned completed end week hour
The hour also translated cost using average cost rate
This referred planned value BCWS end week
At end week could perhaps find In earned value language give u Planned Value hour Earned Value hour Actual cost hour
What derive
A number thing basic behind schedule earned le planned budget actual greater earned
We also number thing calculate cost schedule performance index cost performance index CPI schedule performance index SPI equal plan le le plan
In example CPI would SPI would
Such metric could produced across project say work package level
many way measuring progress calculating EV one example full discussion topic outside scope simple worked example favour method assure maximum
In past often mistakenly believed EV data produced financial reason reporting customer wrong
The important use data project team responsible managing work using EV data via structure work breakdown structure understand cost schedule performance throughout project lifecycle
The aim highlight cost schedule issue early thus providing maximum time minimise impact provide realistic opportunity develop recovery plan necessary
The second thing use data provide mean forecasting project commonly used dismiss history littered project displayed performance characteristic similar came budget schedule without significantly relaxing scope work know one please let u know
The production EV data requires performance measurement baseline drawn directly project plan comprising following EV developed simply report status customer may used way way seen huge degree value using method lost
The objective embed EV data practice daily management project leading improvement based upon informed analysis real status cost schedule goal working level project
For organisation implementing Earned Value Management challenge lie mechanic method often cultural change required underpin EV based project control system
Additionally organisation first attempt use EVM typically find highlight weakness gap project planning control process capability
For example The question raged environment many year
EV give objective measure status cost schedule goal project primary fundamental goal project management
Assuming organisation follows principle underpin good practice EVM system provides important data project team without team operate vacuum regarding performance even worse could operate environment false optimism see level challenge issue project late make real impact something occurs far often project
Earned Value worth fundamental tool control large scale risky development programme
Customers increasingly require contract controlled assure delivery time budget specification
Customers look confidence project status information supplied increasingly achieving defining contractual agreement require EV used supplier
The major consideration include The purpose IBR ass set EV process confirm completeness project Performance Measurement Baseline
Where important confidence early stage baseline plan project realistic Integrated Baseline Review may deployed
If required perform Integrated Baseline Review require preparation attention participate review
As minimum following agreed prepared review IBRs often preceded form readiness review given IBR held soon possible practical following contract award scheduling resourcing activity need considered urgently contract award onward

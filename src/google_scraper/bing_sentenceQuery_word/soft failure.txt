Enrollment undergraduate computer science course college nationwide
But trend hailed tech industry dark side disproportionate number student taking course caught cheating
More student caught cheating introductory computer science course course campus thanks automated tool professor use detect unauthorized code reuse excessive collaboration forbidden way completing homework assignment
Computer science professor say student dishonest student field likely get caught software available check plagiarism
Half academic dishonesty case University Washington involve computer science student
The truth every campus large proportion reported case academic dishonesty come introductory computer science course reason totally obvious use automated tool detect plagiarism explains Professor Ed Lazowska chair computer science engineering University Washington
We compare student submission compare previous student submission code may Web
These tool flag suspicious case manually examined
Stanford University disclosed February honor code violation involved computer science student although student represent student body
Of honor code violation investigated last year Stanford Judicial Panel involved computer science student
The tool employ make easy catch student cheating say Professor Mehran Sahami associate professor computer science Stanford University
I would say computer science student violate honor code often dishonest
Sahami say computer science student mistakenly believe writing software code similar solving mathematical proof one correct answer exists
What student realize software code akin writing essay significant amount creativity involved
One thing happens computer science contributes cheating rate student unaware dissimilar program task really look Sahami say
They tend think OK copy portion someone else program
But tool discover
As college student study computer science number cheating incident rise
At University Washington total enrollment two introductory computer science course highest ever approaching student last four quarter compared student year ago
In two course assignment identified involving academic dishonesty Lazowska say
The top computer science school country experiencing trend
We see cheating
It something working hard stop number mean say Professor Lenny Pitt director undergraduate program Department Computer Science University Illinois
Cheating gone across many field easier find tool today
Cheating introductory computer science class typically involves homework assignment rather exam
Students get frustrated code wo run tempted borrow solution someone else
Because computer science assignment complicated need debugging professor assign homework several year row
That mean student find code written someone already taken course
There lot infrastructure need built lot effort go creating homework problem
There disincentive professor change problem every semester
So tend reassign similar problem cause cheating past solution available Pitt say adding University Illinois check homework repository past solution
The common form cheating involves excessive
Many student like collaborate point copying
Pitt asks
The course policy need really clear
Some course allow work pair triple
If follow policy would call cheating
At Stanford student allowed discus strategy solving homework problem need write code
You looking someone else program sharing computer science student Sahami say
Sahami say introductory computer science course require student code program course allow teamwork
We want learn mechanic first open world collaboration add
Students often resort cheating feel excessive pressure peer family excel professor say
Anecdotally see larger incidence cheating among foreign student domestic student I think part extreme pressure well succeed Pitt say
That pressure contributes idea need well possible even mean taking shortcut
Computer science professor say much copying excess collaboration go college course
Does anyone right mind think cheating happening large introductory course field
If smoking something Lazowska say
There several case faculty discipline adapted tool detect plagiarism term paper found plagiarism rate far greater typically encountered computer science course
As college recruiter traipse across country seeking best computer science graduate Class need aware rising incident cheating computer science course
Ethics huge issue IT industry copyright licensing privacy say David Foote CEO Foote Partners research firm tracking IT workforce management
Foote sits advisory council Hiram College Center Study Ethics Values
We need looking idea breed people concerned naturally issue ethic morality
For CIOs issue whether copying code homework assignment could lead prospective employee ethical lapse job
Businesses want hire worker wo get trouble software licensing patent infringement intellectual property problem
There enough program American university looking ethic cheating Foote say
Do pick computer science people
Pick fact university enough general calling attention cheating
Foote point incident excess collaboration qualify cheating college campus would encouraged industry want employee reuse software improve efficiency cut cost
In real world people write code team given piece project work Foote say
The academic world mapping onto real handing assignment people coding
To encourage collaboration Georgia Tech changed approach cheating introductory computer science course
Instead trying catch punish student excessive collaboration Georgia Tech requires student disclose name student helped complete homework
Students sign collaboration agreement explains Cedric Stallworth assistant dean Undergraduate Enrollment Georgia Tech College Computing
We realize computing one subject best learned group
If student using somebody else code learning right
To ensure student mastering material Georgia Tech requires give oral demonstration software work one teaching assistant
We worry le catching cheater
We worry properly assessing student skill set Stallworth say
Less percentage grade homework percentage assessment assessment designed truly measure skill
Then cheat homework going help assessment count bulk grade
Computer science professor think cheating result student unprepared take course
They seeing rise failure rate drop grade
Instead say student qualified ever
We seen increase failure rate Stanford Sahami say adding le student typically fail introductory computer class
This student body accepts failure
For pas class important thing
Lazowska say rising enrollment computer science course important trend resulting increase plagiarism case
An range student recognizing even major something else preparation computational thinking essential Lazowska say
There reason believe computer science student anything better ever

Lone wolf computer science endangered specie
Modern computer scientist must practice persuasively clearly communicating idea
In smaller company whether programmer communicate idea management may make difference company success failure
Unfortunately something fixed addition single class although solid course technical communication hurt
More class need provide student opportunity present work defend idea oral presentation
I would recommend student master presentation tool like PowerPoint favorite Keynote
Sorry much I love presentation tool static
For producing beautiful mathematical documentation LaTeX equal
All written assignment technical course submitted LaTeX
Computer science quite engineering
But close enough
Computer scientist find working engineer
Computer scientist traditional engineer need speak language language rooted real analysis linear algebra probability physic
Computer scientist ought take physic electromagnetism
But need take multivariate calculus differential equation good measure
In constructing sound simulation command probability often time linear algebra invaluable
In interpreting result substitute solid understanding statistic
Computer scientist comfortable practiced Unix philosophy computing
The Unix philosophy opposed Unix one emphasizes linguistic abstraction composition order effect computation
In practice mean becoming comfortable notion computing configuration software development
Given prevalence Unix system computer scientist today fluent basic Unix including ability Students reject Unix philosophy unless understand power
Thus best challenge student complete useful task Unix comparative advantage Some computer scientist sneer system administration IT task
The thinking computer scientist teach anything technician
This true
In theory
Yet attitude misguided computer scientist must able competently securely administer system network
Many task software development efficiently executed without passing system administrator
Every modern computer scientist able Programming language rise fall solar cycle
A programmer career
While important teach language relevant employer equally important student learn teach new language
The best way learn learn progamming language learn multiple programming language programming paradigm
The difficulty learning th language half difficulty th
Yet understand programming language one must implement one
Ideally every computer science major would take compiler class
At minimum every computer science major implement interpreter
The following language provide reasonable mixture paradigm practical application Racket dialect Lisp aggressively simple syntax
For small fraction student syntax impediment
To blunt student fundamental mental barrier accepting alien syntactic regime even temporarily lack mental dexterity survive career computer science
Racket powerful macro system facility programming thoroughly erase line data code
If taught correctly Lisp liberates
C terse unforgiving abstraction silicon
C remains without rival programming embedded system
Learning C imparts deep understanding dominant von Neumann architecture way language
Given intimate role poor C programming play prevalence buffer overflow security vulnerability critical programmer learn program C properly
JavaScript good representative semantic model popular dynamic language Python Ruby Perl
As native language web pragmatic advantage unique
Squeak modern dialect Smalltalk purest language
It imparts essence
Java remain popular long ignore
Standard ML clean embodiment system
The type system one greatest yet achievement modern computing
Though exponential complexity type inference always fast program human interest
The type system rich enough allow expression complex structural invariant
It rich fact program often
Though niche application logic programming alternate paradigm computational thinking
It worth understanding logic programming instance programmer may need emulate within another paradigm
Another logic language worth learning
miniKanren stress pure cut allowed logic programming
This constraint evolved alternate style logic programming called relational programming grant property typically enjoyed Prolog program
Scala fusion functional programming language
Scala Java
Built atop Java Virtual Machine compatible existing Java codebases stand likely successor Java
Haskell crown jewel family language
Fully exploiting laziness Haskell come closest programming pure mathematics major programming language
necessary evil
But since must taught must taught full
In particular computer science major leave grasp even
Any assembly language
Since popular might well
Learning compiler best way learn assembly since give computer scientist intuitive sense code transformed
Computer scientist understand generative programming macro lexical dynamic scope closure continuation function dynamic dispatch subtyping module functors monad semantic concept distinct specific syntax
Computer scientist must solid grasp formal logic proof
Proof algebraic manipulation natural deduction engages reasoning common routine programming task
Proof induction engages reasoning used construction recursive function
Computer scientist must fluent formal mathematical notation reasoning rigorously basic discrete structure set tuples sequence function power set
For computer scientist important cover reasoning Students learn enough number theory study implement common cryptographic protocol
Students certainly see common rare yet unreasonably effective data structure algorithm
But important knowing specific algorithm data structure usually easy enough look computer scientist must understand design algorithm greedy dynamic strategy span gap algorithm ideal implementation
At minimum computer scientist seeking stable employment know following Computer scientist ready implement extend algorithm operates data structure including ability search element add element remove element
For completeness computer scientist know imperative functional version algorithm
A grasp theory prerequisite research graduate school
Theory invaluable provides hard boundary problem provides mean circumventing initially appear hard boundary
Computational complexity legitimately claim one truly predictive theory computer science
A computer scientist know boundary tractability computability lie
To ignore limit invite frustration best case failure worst
At undergraduate level theory cover least model computation computational complexity
Models computation cover automaton regular language regular expression pushdown automaton language formal grammar Turing machine lambda calculus undecidability
At undergraduate level student learn least enough complexity understand difference P NP
To avoid leaving wrong impression student solve large problem NP reduction SAT use modern SAT solver
There substitute solid understanding computer architecture
Computer scientist understand computer transistor
The understanding architecture encompass standard level abstraction transistor gate adder muxes flip flop ALUs control unit cache RAM
An understanding GPU model computing important foreseeable future
A good understanding cache bus hardware memory management essential achieving good performance modern system
To get good grasp machine architecture student design simulate small CPU
Any sufficiently large program eventually becomes operating system
As computer scientist aware kernel handle system call paging scheduling filesystems internal resource management
A good understanding operating system secondary understanding compiler architecture achieving performance
Understanding operating system I would interpret liberally include runtime system becomes especially important programming embedded system without one
It important student get hand dirty real operating system
With Linux virtualization easier ever
To get better understanding kernel student could Given ubiquity network computer scientist firm understanding network stack routing protocol within network
The mechanic building efficient reliable transmission protocol like TCP top unreliable transmission protocol like IP magic computer scientist
It core knowledge
Computer scientist must understand involved protocol design example choose TCP choose UDP
Programmers need understand larger social implication congestion use UDP large scale well
Given frequency modern programmer encounter network programming helpful know protocol existing standard Computer scientist understand exponential back packet collision resolution mechanism involved congestion control
Every computer scientist implement following No student ever pas intro neworking class without sniffing instructor Google query
It probably going far require student implement reliable transmission protocol scratch atop IP I say personally transformative experience student
The sad truth security majority security vulnerability come sloppy programming
The sadder truth many school poor job training programmer secure code
Computer scientist must aware mean program compromised
They need develop sense defensive programming mind thinking code might attacked
Security kind training best distributed throughout entire curriculum discipline warn student native vulnerability
At minimum every computer scientist need understand A reader pointed computer scientist also need aware basic IT security measure choose legitimately good password properly configure firewall iptables
Cryptography make much digital life possible
Computer scientist understand able implement following concept well common pitfall Since common fault implementation cryptosystems every computer scientist know acquire random number task hand
At least nearly every data breach shown computer scientist need know salt hash password storage
Every computer scientist pleasure breaking ciphertext using cryptosystems statistical tool
RSA everyone
Every student create digital certificate set http apache
It surprisingly arduous
Student also write console web client connects SSL
As strictly practical matter computer scientist know use GPG use authentication ssh encrypt directory hard disk
Software testing must distributed throughout entire curriculum
A course software engineering cover basic style testing substitute practicing art
Students graded test case turn
I use test case turned student student
Students seem care much developing defensive test case unleash hell come sandbagging classmate
Programmers often write software programmer worse
User interface design broadly user experience design might underappreciated aspect computer science
There misconception even among professor user experience soft skill ca taught
In reality modern user experience design anchored principle human factor engineering industrial design
If nothing else computer scientist know interface need make ease executing task proportional frequency task multiplied importance
As practicality every programmer comfortable designing usable web interface HTML CSS JavaScript
Good visualization rendering data fashion human perceive information
This easy thing
The modern world sea data exploiting local maximum human perception key making sense
Parallelism back uglier ever
The unfortunate truth harnessing parallelism requires deep knowledge architecture multicore cache bus GPUs etc
And practice
Lots practice
It clear final answer parallel programming solution emerged
For student learn CUDA OpenCL
Threads flimsy abstraction parallelism particularly cache cache coherency involved
But thread popular tricky worth learning
Pthreads reasonably portable thread library learn
For anyone interested parallelism MPI prerequisite
On principle side seem enduring
The principle software engineering change fast programming language
A good course practice team software construction provides working knowledge pitfall inherent endeavor
It recommended several reader student break team three role leader rotating three different project
Learning attack maneuver large existing codebase skill programmer master one best learned school instead job
All student need understand centralized version control system like svn distributed version control system like git
A working knowlege debugging tool like gdb valgrind go long way finally become necessary
As demand secure reliable software increase formal method may one day end mean delivering
At present formal modeling verification software remains challenging progress field steady get easier every year
There may even come day within lifetime computer science major formal software construction expected skill
Every computer scientist least moderately comfortable using one theorem prover
I think matter one
Learning use theorem prover immediately impact coding style
For example one feel instinctively allergic writing statement cover possibility
And writing recursive function user theorem provers strong urge eliminate
There discipline dominated clever graphic
The field driven toward even defined good enough
As better way teach clever programming solid appreciation optimizing effort graphic simulation
Over half coding hack I learned came study graphic
Simple ray tracer constructed line code
It good mental hygiene work transformation necessary perform perspective projection wireframe engine
Data structure like BSP tree algorithm like rendering great example clever design
In graphic simulation many
Robotics may one engaging way teach introductory programming
Moreover cost robotics continues fall threshold passed enable personal robotics revolution
For program unimaginable degree personal physical automation horizon
If reason outsized impact early history computing computer scientist study artificial intelligence
While original dream intelligent machine seems far artificial intelligence spurred number practical field machine learning data mining natural language processing
Aside outstanding technical merit sheer number job opening relevance engineer indicates every computer scientist grasp fundamental machine learning
Machine learning doubly emphasizes need understanding probability statistic
At undergraduate level core concept include Bayesian network clustering learning
Databases common useful ignore
It useful understand fundamental data structure algorithm power database engine since programmer often enough reimplement database system within larger software system
Relational algebra relational calculus stand exceptional success story model computation
Unlike UML modeling ER modeling seems reasonable mechanism visualing encoding design constraint upon software artifact
A computer scientist set operate LAMP stack one good idea lot hard work away running company
My suggestion limited blind spot knowledge
What I listed included

There two type soft error Contrast

branch applied hardware
The objective computer security includes protection information property theft corruption allowing information property remain accessible productive intended user
Such secret information could retrieved different way
This article focus retrieval data thanks misused hardware hardware failure
Hardware could misused exploited get secret data
This article collect main type attack lead data thief
Computer security comprised device keyboard monitor printer thanks electromagnetic acoustic emanation example component computer memory network card processor thanks time temperature analysis example
The monitor main device used access data computer
It shown monitor radiate reflect data environment potentially giving attacker access information displayed monitor
Video display unit radiate Known compromising emanation radiation code word government programme aimed attacking problem electromagnetic broadcast data significant concern sensitive computer application
Eavesdroppers reconstruct video screen content radio frequency emanation
Each radiated harmonic video signal show remarkable resemblance broadcast TV signal
It therefore possible reconstruct picture displayed video display unit radiated emission mean normal television receiver
If preventive measure taken eavesdropping video display unit possible distance several hundred meter using normal TV receiver directional antenna antenna amplifier
It even possible pick information type video display unit distance kilometer
If sophisticated receiving decoding equipment used maximum distance much greater
What displayed monitor reflected environment
The diffuse reflection light emitted CRT monitor exploited recover original monitor image
This eavesdropping technique spying distance data displayed arbitrary computer screen including currently prevalent LCD monitor
The technique exploit reflection screen optical emanation various object one commonly find close proximity screen us reflection recover original screen content
Such object include eyeglass tea pot spoon plastic bottle even eye user
This attack successfully mounted spy even small font using inexpensive equipment le dollar distance meter
Relying expensive equipment allowed conduct attack meter away demonstrating similar attack feasible side street building
Many object may found usual workplace exploited retrieve information computer display outsider
Particularly good result obtained reflection user eyeglass tea pot located desk next screen
Reflections stem eye user also provide good result
However eye harder spy distance object require high exposure time
Using expensive equipment lower exposure time help remedy problem
The reflection gathered curved surface object indeed pose substantial threat confidentiality data displayed screen
Fully invalidating threat without time hiding screen legitimate user seems difficult without using curtain window similar form strong optical shielding
Most user however aware risk may willing close curtain nice day
The reflection object computer display curved mirror creates virtual image located behind reflecting surface
For flat mirror virtual image size located behind mirror distance original object
For curved mirror however situation complex
Computer keyboard often used transmit confidential data password
Since contain electronic component keyboard emit electromagnetic wave
These emanation could reveal sensitive information keystroke
Electromagnetic emanation turned constitute security threat computer equipment
The figure present keystroke retrieved material necessary
The approach acquire raw signal directly antenna process entire captured electromagnetic spectrum
Thanks method four different kind compromising electromagnetic emanation detected generated keyboard
These emission lead full partial recovery keystroke
The best practical attack fully recovered keystroke keyboard distance meter even wall
Because keyboard specific fingerprint based clock frequency inconsistency determine source keyboard compromising emanation even multiple keyboard model used time
The four different kind way compromising electromagnetic emanation described
When key pressed released held keyboard sends packet information known scan code computer
The protocol used transmit scan code bidirectional serial communication based four wire Vcc volt ground data clock
Clock data signal identically generated
Hence compromising emanation detected combination signal
However edge data clock line superposed
Thus easily separated obtain independent signal
The Falling Edge Transition attack limited partial recovery keystroke
This significant limitation
The GTT falling edge transition attack improved recover almost keystroke
Indeed two trace exactly one data rising edge
If attacker able detect transition fully recover keystroke
Harmonics compromising electromagnetic emission come unintentional emanation radiation emitted clock element crosstalk ground pollution etc
Determining theoretically reason compromising radiation complex task
These harmonic correspond carrier approximately MHz likely internal clock inside keyboard
These harmonic correlated clock data signal describe modulated signal amplitude frequency full state clock data signal
This mean scan code completely recovered harmonic
Keyboard manufacturer arrange key matrix
The keyboard controller often processor par column recovers state key
This matrix scan process described key key may used instance modern keyboard use key arranged column row
These column continuously pulsed least
Thus lead may act antenna generate electromagnetic emanation
If attacker able capture emanation easily recover column pressed key
Even signal fully describe pressed key still give partial information transmitted scan code
column number
Note matrix scan routine loop continuously
When key pressed still signal composed multiple equidistant peak
These emanation may used remotely detect presence powered computer
Concerning wireless keyboard wireless data burst transmission used electromagnetic trigger detect exactly key pressed matrix scan emanation used determine column belongs
Some technique target keyboard
This table sum technique could used find keystroke different kind keyboard
In paper called Martin Vuagnoux Sylvain Pasini tested different keyboard model USB connector wireless communication different setup chamber small office adjacent office flat building
The table present result
Attacks emanation caused human typing attracted interest recent year
In particular work showed keyboard acoustic emanation leak information exploited reconstruct typed text
PC keyboard notebook keyboard vulnerable attack based differentiating sound emanated different key
This attack take input audio signal containing recording single word typed single person keyboard dictionary word
It assumed typed word present dictionary
The aim attack reconstruct original word signal
This attack taking input sound recording user typing English text using keyboard recovering typed character
This attack inexpensive hardware required parabolic microphone require physical intrusion system
The attack employ neural network recognize key pressed
It combine signal processing efficient data structure algorithm successfully reconstruct single word character recording click made typing keyboard
The sound click differ slightly key key key positioned different position keyboard plate although click different key sound similar human ear
On average incorrect recognition per click show exposure keyboard eavesdropping using attack
The attack efficient taking second per word standard PC
A better success rate finding correct word word character success rate word tested
In practice human attacker typically determine text random
An attacker also identify occasion user type user name password
Short audio signal containing single word seven character long considered
This mean signal second long
Such short word often chosen password
The dominant factor affecting attack success word length importantly number repeated character within word
This procedure make possible efficiently uncover word audio recording keyboard click sound
More recently extracting information type emanation demonstrated acoustic emanation mechanical device printer
While extracting private information watching somebody typing keyboard might seem easy task becomes extremely challenging automated
However automated tool needed case surveillance procedure long user activity human able reconstruct character per minute
The paper present novel approach automatically recovering text typed keyboard based solely video user typing
Automatically recognizing key pressed user hard problem requires sophisticated motion analysis
Experiments show human reconstructing sentence requires lengthy hour analysis video
The attacker might install surveillance device room victim might take control existing camera exploiting vulnerability camera control software might simply point mobile phone integrated camera laptop keyboard victim working public space
Balzarotti analysis divided two main phase figure
The analyzes video recorded camera using computer vision technique
For frame video computer vision analysis computes set key likely pressed set key certainly pressed position space character
Because result phase analysis noisy called text analysis required
The goal phase remove error using language technique
The result phase reconstructed text word represented list possible candidate ranked likelihood
With acoustic emanation attack recovers printer processing English text printing possible
It based record sound printer make microphone close enough
This attack recovers printed word knowledge text done microphone distance cm printer
After upfront training phase picture attack b picture fully automated us combination machine learning audio processing speech recognition technique including spectrum feature Hidden Markov Models linear classification
The fundamental reason reconstruction printed text work emitted sound becomes louder needle strike paper given time
There correlation number needle intensity acoustic emanation
A training phase conducted word dictionary printed characteristic sound feature word extracted stored database
The trained characteristic feature used recognize printed English text
But task trivial
Major challenge include Timing attack enable attacker extract secret maintained security system observing time take system respond various query
designed provide secure channel two host
Despite encryption authentication mechanism us SSH weakness
In interactive mode every individual keystroke user type sent remote machine separate IP packet immediately key pressed leak timing information user typing
Below picture represents command processed SSH connection
A simple statistical technique suffice reveal sensitive information length user password even root password
By using advanced statistical technique timing information collected network eavesdropper learn significant information user type SSH session
Because time take operating system send packet keypress general negligible comparing interkeystroke timing also enables eavesdropper learn precise interkeystroke timing user typing arrival time packet
Data remanence problem affect obvious area RAM memory cell also occur area device effect change characteristic semiconductor device various effect examined alongside obvious remanence problem
It possible analyse recover data cell semiconductor device general long theory vanished
Electromigration mean physically move atom new location physically alter device another type attack
It involves relocation metal atom due high current density phenomenon atom carried along electron wind opposite direction conventional current producing void negative electrode hillock whisker positive electrode
Void formation lead local increase current density Joule heating interaction electron metal ion produce thermal energy producing electromigration effect
When external stress removed disturbed system tends relax back original equilibrium state resulting backflow heals electromigration damage
In long term though cause device failure le extreme case simply serf alter device operating characteristic noticeable way
For example excavation void lead increased wiring resistance growth whisker lead contact formation current leakage
An example conductor exhibit whisker growth due electromigration shown figure One example exhibit void formation case severe enough led complete failure shown figure Contrary popular assumption DRAMs used modern computer retain content several second power lost even room temperature even removed motherboard
Many product cryptographic computation using secret key variable equipment operator must able read alter
The usual solution secret data kept volatile memory inside enclosure
Security processor typically store secret key material static RAM power removed device tampered
At temperature content SRAM frozen
It interesting know period time static RAM device retain data power removed
Low temperature increase data retention time SRAM many second even minute
Maximillian Dornseif presented technique let take control Apple computer thanks iPod
The attack needed first generic phase iPod software modified behaves master FireWire bus
Then iPod full access Apple Computer iPod plugged FireWire port
FireWire used audio device printer scanner camera gps etc
Generally device connected FireWire full access
Indeed OHCI Standard FireWire standard read So device connected FireWire read write data computer memory
For example device To increase computational power processor generally equipped decrease memory access latency
Below figure show hierarchy processor memory
First processor look data cache memory
When data processor looking called
Below picture show processor fetch data two cache level
Unfortunately cache contain small portion application data introduce additional latency memory transaction case miss
This involves also additional power consumption due activation memory device memory hierarchy
The miss penalty already used attack symmetric encryption algorithm like DES
The basic idea proposed paper force cache miss processor executing AES encryption algorithm known plain text
The attack allow unprivileged process attack process running parallel processor despite partitioning method memory protection sandboxing virtualization
By carefully measuring amount time required perform private key operation attacker may able find fixed factor key break cryptosystems
Against vulnerable system attack computationally inexpensive often requires known ciphertext
The attack treated signal detection problem
The signal consists timing variation due target exponent bit noise result measurement inaccuracy timing variation due unknown exponent bit
The property signal noise determine number timing measurement required attack
Timing attack potentially used cryptosystems including symmetric function
A simple generic processor backdoor used attacker mean privilege escalation get privilege equivalent given running operating system
Also process one invited domain running top virtual machine monitor get privilege equivalent virtual machine monitor
Loïc Duflot studied Intel processor paper explains processor defines four different privilege ring numbered privileged least privileged
Kernel code usually running ring whereas code generally running ring
The use assembly language instruction restricted ring code
In order escalate privilege backdoor attacker must The backdoor Loïc Duflot present simple modify behavior three assembly language instruction simple specific activation condition unlikely accidentally activated

To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing
Sorry link really provide lot help

In type signal datum wrong
Errors may caused usually understood either mistake design construction broken component
A soft error also signal datum wrong assumed imply mistake breakage
After observing soft error implication system le reliable
In spacecraft industry kind error called
In computer memory system soft error change instruction program data value
Soft error typically remedied computer
A soft error damage system hardware damage data processed
There two type soft error
soft error occur particle hit chip radioactive atom chip material decay release alpha particle chip
Because alpha particle contains positive charge kinetic energy particle hit cause cell change state different value
The atomic reaction example tiny damage physical structure chip
soft error occur data processed hit noise phenomenon typically data data bus
The computer try interpret noise data bit cause error addressing processing program code
The bad data bit even saved memory cause problem later time
If detected soft error may corrected rewriting correct data place erroneous data
Highly reliable system use correct soft error fly
However many system may impossible determine correct data even discover error present
In addition correction occur system may case must include
Soft error involve change storage circuit change physical circuit
If data rewritten circuit work perfectly
Soft error occur transmission line digital logic analog circuit magnetic storage elsewhere commonly known semiconductor storage
Whether circuit experience soft error depends energy incoming particle geometry impact location strike design logic circuit
Logic circuit higher higher logic voltage le likely suffer error
This combination capacitance voltage described parameter Q minimum electron charge disturbance needed change logic level
A higher Q mean fewer soft error
Unfortunately higher Q also mean slower logic gate higher power dissipation
Reduction chip feature size supply voltage desirable many reason decrease Q
Thus importance soft error increase chip technology advance
In logic circuit Q defined minimum amount induced charge required circuit node cause voltage pulse propagate node output sufficient duration magnitude reliably latched
Since logic circuit contains many node may struck node may unique capacitance distance output Q typically characterized basis
Soft error became widely known introduction
In early device chip packaging material contained small amount contaminant
Very low decay rate needed avoid excess soft error chip company occasionally suffered problem contamination ever since
It extremely hard maintain material purity needed
Controlling alpha particle emission rate critical packaging material le level count per hour per cm required reliable performance circuit
For comparison count rate typical shoe sole
Package radioactive decay usually cause soft error emission
The positive charged alpha particle travel semiconductor disturbs distribution electron
If disturbance large enough change vice versa
In effect transient perhaps lasting fraction nanosecond led challenge soft error combinational logic mostly going unnoticed
In sequential logic even transient upset become stored indefinite time read later
Thus designer usually much aware problem storage circuit

Many would probably attributable hardware problem could attributed alpha particle
received letter congratulating accidental prediction RAM error novel
Once electronics industry determined control package contaminant became clear cause also work
led program work culminated publication number paper Ziegler Lanford demonstrating also could cause soft error
Indeed modern device cosmic ray may predominant cause
Although primary particle cosmic ray generally reach Earth surface creates energetic secondary particle
At Earth surface approximately particle capable causing soft error energetic neutron remainder composed proton pion
IBM estimated one error per month per ram expected desktop computer
This flux energetic neutron typically referred cosmic ray soft error literature
Neutrons uncharged disturb circuit undergo nucleus atom chip
This process may result production charged secondary alpha particle oxygen nucleus cause soft error
Cosmic ray flux depends altitude
For common reference location N W sea level New York City NY USA flux approximately
Burying system cave reduces rate induced soft error negligible level
In lower level atmosphere flux increase factor every every ft increase altitude sea level
Computers operated top mountain experience order magnitude higher rate soft error compared sea level
The rate upset may time sea level upset rate
This contrast package decay induced soft error change location
As Intel expects error caused cosmic ray increase limiting factor design
The average rate soft error proportional sunspot activity
That average number soft error decrease active portion increase quiet portion
This counterintuitive result occurs two reason
The sun generally produce cosmic ray particle energy GeV capable penetrating Earth upper atmosphere creating particle shower change solar flux directly influence number error
Further increase solar flux active sun period effect reshaping Earth magnetic field providing additional shielding higher energy cosmic ray resulting decrease number particle creating shower
The effect fairly small case resulting modulation energetic neutron flux New York City
Other location similarly affected
Energetic neutron produced cosmic ray may lose kinetic energy reach thermal equilibrium surroundings scattered material
The resulting neutron simply referred average kinetic energy
Thermal neutron also produced environmental radiation source decay naturally occurring uranium thorium
The thermal neutron flux source shower may still noticeable underground location important contributor soft error circuit
Neutrons lost kinetic energy thermal equilibrium surroundings important cause soft error circuit
At low energy many reaction become much probable result fission certain material creating charged secondary fission byproduct
For circuit capture nucleus B particularly important
This nuclear reaction efficient producer nucleus
Either charged particle alpha Li may cause soft error produced close proximity approximately critical circuit node
The capture cross section B smaller contribute soft error
used insulator interconnection layer integrated circuit particularly lowest one
The inclusion boron lower melt temperature glass providing better planarization characteristic
In application glass formulated boron content weight
Naturally occurring boron B remainder B isotope
Soft error caused high level B critical lower layer older integrated circuit process
used low concentration dopant contribute soft error
Integrated circuit manufacturer eliminated borated dielectric time individual circuit component decreased size nm largely due problem
In critical design depleted almost entirely used avoid effect therefore reduce soft error rate

For application medical electronic device soft error mechanism may extremely important
Neutrons produced high energy cancer radiation therapy using photon beam energy MeV
These neutron moderated scattered equipment wall treatment room resulting thermal neutron flux higher normal environmental neutron flux
This high thermal neutron flux generally result high rate soft error consequent circuit upset
Soft error also caused problem inductive capacitive
However general source represent small contribution overall soft error rate compared radiation effect
One experiment measured soft error rate sea level FIT failure per billion hour per DRAM chip
When test setup moved underground vault shielded foot rock effectively eliminated cosmic ray zero soft error recorded
In test cause soft error small measured compared error rate caused cosmic ray
Some test conclude isolation memory cell circumvented unintended side effect specially crafted access adjacent cell
Thus accessing data stored DRAM cause Memory cell leak charge interact electrically result high cell density modern memory altering content nearby memory row actually addressed original memory access
This effect known also used computer security
A designer attempt minimize rate soft error judicious device design choosing right semiconductor package substrate material right device geometry
Often however limited need reduce device size voltage increase operating speed reduce power dissipation
The susceptibility device upset described industry using standard
One technique used reduce soft error rate digital circuit called
This involves increasing capacitance selected circuit node order increase effective Q value
This reduces range particle energy logic value node upset
Radiation hardening often accomplished increasing size transistor share region node
Since area power overhead radiation hardening restrictive design technique often applied selectively node predicted highest probability resulting soft error struck
Tools model predict node vulnerable subject past current research area soft error
There work addressing soft error processor memory resource using hardware software technique
Several research effort addressed soft error proposing error detection recovery via redundant
These approach used special hardware replicate application execution identify error output increased hardware design complexity cost including high performance overhead
soft error tolerant scheme hand flexible applied commercial microprocessor
Many work propose instruction replication result checking soft error detection
Designers choose accept soft error occur design system appropriate error detection correction recover gracefully
Typically semiconductor memory design might use incorporating redundant data create
Alternatively used detecting soft error rewriting correct data another source
This technique often used
Soft error sometimes detected corrected using technique design
These often include use redundant circuitry computation data typically come cost circuit area decreased performance higher power consumption
The concept TMR employed ensure high reliability logic circuit
In technique three identical copy circuit compute data parallel output fed returning value occurred least two three case
In way failure one circuit due soft error discarded assuming two circuit operated correctly
In practice however designer afford greater circuit area power overhead required usually selectively applied
Another common concept correct soft error logic circuit temporal time redundancy one circuit operates data multiple time compare subsequent evaluation consistency
This approach however often incurs performance overhead area overhead copy latch used store data power overhead though considerably modular redundancy
Traditionally attention quest reduce soft error due fact DRAM comprised susceptible device surface area desktop server computer system ref
prevalence ECC RAM server computer
Hard figure DRAM susceptibility hard come vary considerably across design fabrication process manufacturer
technology kilobit DRAMS could cluster five six bit flip single
Modern DRAMs much smaller feature size deposition similar amount charge could easily cause many bit flip
The design error detection correction circuit helped fact soft error usually localised small area chip
Usually one cell memory affected although high energy event cause upset
Conventional memory layout usually place one bit many different correction word adjacent chip
So even lead number separate multiple correction word rather single correction word
So error correcting code need cope single bit error correction word order cope likely soft error
The term used upset affecting multiple cell memory whatever correction word cell happen fall
used multiple bit single correction word error
The three natural masking effect determine whether SEU propagate become soft error
An SEU propagation blocked reaching output latch gate input prevent logical transition gate output
An SEU signal attenuated electrical property gate propagation path resulting pulse insufficient magnitude reliably latched
An SEU erroneous pulse reach output latch occur close enough latch actually triggered hold
If three masking effect fail occur propagated pulse becomes latched output logic circuit erroneous value
In context circuit operation erroneous output value may considered soft error event
However standpoint affected result may change output program
For instance erroneous data could overwritten use masked subsequent logic operation simply never used
If erroneous data affect output program considered example
Soft error rate SER rate device system encounter predicted encounter soft error
It typically expressed either number FIT MTBF
The unit adopted quantifying failure time called FIT equivalent one error per billion hour device operation
MTBF usually given year device operation put perspective one FIT equal approximately time MTBF
While many electronic system MTBF exceeds expected lifetime circuit SER may still unacceptable manufacturer customer
For instance many failure per million circuit due soft error expected field system adequate soft error protection
The failure even product field particularly catastrophic tarnish reputation product company designed
Also application cost system failure far outweighs cost system chance soft error failure per lifetime may high acceptable customer
Therefore advantageous design low SER manufacturing system requiring extremely high reliability

Many computer science program require two three calculus class
I wondering calculus used computer science
The CS content degree computer science tends focus algorithm operating system data structure artificial intelligence software engineering etc
Are time Calculus useful area Computer Science
We looking long answer provide explanation context
Do give answer explain answer right ideally citation
Answers include explanation may removed
I think course would need Calculus
I used bold face usually obligatory discipline Computer Science degree italic usually optional one
There may others top head
And besides one benefit Calculus course learning reason explain argument technical rigor
This valuable student usually think
This somewhat obscure calculus turn algebraic data type
For given type type context derivative type
See overview whole subject
This technical terminology let explain
You may come across tuples referred cartesian two type
We going take literally use notation b To represent tuple b type
Next may come across type either one type another known type kinda Haskell
We also going take one literally use notation b These named type value type b value type b value
These type look like normal algebraic expression fact manipulate point
In functional language common definition list given Haskell This say list either empty tuple value another list
Transforming algebraic notation get L L Where represents type one value aka unit type
By repeatedly inserting evaluate get definition L L L L L L L L L L Where meant sense repeated multiplication
This definition say list either unit tuple one item tuple two item three etc definition list
Now context context get value product type
Let give example For simple homogeneous take value get
But two different context type namely first second value tuple
So since either could write course
This differentiation come play
Let confirm another example Taking value give three different variant Depending put hole
This give u indeed derivative
There proof general
For final example let use list If take original expression list L L We rearrange get L On surface may seem like nonsense take taylor series result get definition derived earlier
Now differentiate get interesting result L L Thus one list become pair list
This fact make sense two list produced correspond element hole original list
Numerical Methods
There exist cumbersome calculus problem unique specific application need solution faster human practically solve without program
Someone design algorithm compute solution
Is thing separate programmer scientist
Similar robotics automation require quantifying lot human behavior
Finding solution proof often requires calculus
Utilizing advanced algorithm requires calculus co sine pi Especially calculating vector collision field meshing
Determining whether task possible risk involved possible rate success
Most security performed without calculus however many people want explanation prefer mathematical expression
The basic AI utilized without calculus however calculating advanced behavior swarm mind complex value based decision making
Visualizing health data requires calculus EKG reading
When working nearly scientific discipline requires calculus Aerospace Astrology Biology Chemistry Engineering
Many people programming go entire career without using calculus however prove invaluable willing work
For effective automation logistics visualization
By identifying specific pattern simply ignore pattern imitate pattern develop superior method together
The fact little chance ever use calculus
However virtually every scientific discipline DOES use calculus working science degree
There certain expectation university science degree supposed mean one thing know calculus
Even never use
It okay poorly calculus make sure put effort discrete mathematics
There lot programming problem discrete math come play ignorance principle embarrass front coder
Many people already provided application CS
But sometimes find Calculus least expect If know automaton pdf might worth reading
Some specific example To excellent answer I add point
In creating test case application I make use calculus predict expected running time memory size choose optimal parameter tuning data structure
This includes understanding expected rounding error etc
While statistic mentioned answer I would like specifically mention optimization algorithm based Mathematical principle include calculus
Specific industry I worked calculus required include Finance creating trading platform Insurance numerical integration insurance policy scenario compute expected policy loss Logistics optimizing consolidation transportation route Signal processing Calculus integral portion used directly CS foundation thinking summation
If work portion Knuth Concrete Mathematics section summation quickly recognize convention common calculus understanding continuous case give tool consider discrete
Many us CS study involve programming system monitor change case attempt predict future
The mathematics around system rooted differential equation linear algebra differential equation calculus
There teacher like Gibert Strang advocate moving quickly differential equation part still subset calculus
When change depends change system start unstable stable way well understood
To understand sensible linear system behaving nonlinear way either need tool calculus need problem space
And finally CS often requires reading understanding work others calculus first exposure lot shared vocabulary convention history

cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet
This layer called
used reasoning

Math important part computer science
But math important
An overview math topic useful CS outlined
This branch mathematics mainly concerned us set integer discrete separate object one another
The phrase coined math topic useful computer science student evolved study think problem solving real world using mathematical therefore computational model
Discrete math topic often concerned reasoning number many class begin logical statement mathematical proof induction important ability prove something true infinite amount data using two finite step
When designing program run potentially million machine around world help feel confident algorithm logic designed work correctly matter environment run
Discrete math certainly numerical topic well
The study summation closed algorithmic form help algorithmic optimization use notation working matrix vector give introduction logic needed work large set ordered data program
When company Google Yahoo first developing internet algorithm turned graph theory another major component discrete math
Graphs used model relationship object set object
They also used model practically algorithmic problem defined problem graph solve graph operation like traversal checking connectivity circularity
Discrete math broad term defined way group important topic math needed computer science
The exposure student topic better able handle challenge software engineering
If taken calculus class perhaps even advanced algebra class may exposed discrete math topic
Probability study odds particular event occur
This area math often grouped discrete math title strong presence outside computer world well
Probability play large role determining predict way computer program act
Consider algorithm sort number descending order
Predicting fast algorithm run depends multiple factor way algorithm designed could result different speed considering data set scenario
Probability help determine odds data coming algorithm best worst case ordering guide best solution
A good software engineer question everything come design probability theory excellent tool helping ask question
Probability covered high school statistic class many explore often using example
A computer state lowest level mass call yet computer much u daily life
How build website word processor video game
A computer combine compare number use Boolean algebra topic also help engineer build effective logic algorithm
There much value studying interplay binary number computer
What computer result addition multiplication fit value limited often space
Did know number infinite decimal number using binary number system like infinite everyday system
What mean programmer
Understanding limited precision computer model infinite precision real world give major leg professional world
This topic often touched early computer science class though basic book also serve great resource
A computer program often see core portion code approximately run time
This rule often referred lead certain function getting called often
It possible software engineer may use function get result pas result directly back function
They may even see function call
This concept known recursion mathematical representation called recurrence
The common example recurrence Tower Hanoi problem user must move pile disc one post another
The number step take move particular amount disc found directly applying simple algebra answer one le amount disc
In computer might solve computer call function get base case return simple solution would add
Recursion one first hard problem computer science student run understanding mathematical recurrence work help comprehend vital subject ultimately crucial understanding program flow
A discrete math book give exercise working summation recurrence though recursion best taught programming exercise like

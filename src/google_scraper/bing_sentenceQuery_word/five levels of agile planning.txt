One fundamental Agile value sometimes misintrepreted mean need plan Agile project
Nothing could truth
Related Vendor Content The reality adaptive Agile project much planning predictive project plan accommodate change certain arise
Adaptive project environment characterized uncertainty number area Adaptive project require adaptive approach development allows product evolve understanding unfolds life project
The Iterative Incremental way working Agile project provides needed feedback mechanism deliver adaptive project
Despite adaptive nature Agile project ecosystem reasonable realistic management want know much cost long take
Organizational resource need allocated project decision need made work undertake
This mean need provide feedback number level answer initial set question ongoing basis project ensure still delivering best value organization investment
To achieve need plan many level
There two broad category planning happens This selecting project get funded represented graphic Every organisation need mechanism get work pipeline idea generation need encouraged problem identified
At initial generation stage little filtering every member organisation able point something working effective way identify problem organisation need address change marketplace new legislation must comply propose completely new thing could done
After idea raised need initial filter worth considering
Frequently based quick analysis feasibility assessment idea
Some idea automatically pas first filter project compliance legislation change must done instance quickly discarded cost prohibitive completely alignment organisation strategic objective worth considering
Those get automatic approval worth considering feed Portfolio Planning process
Portfolio planning governance level activity selecting suite program project organisation fund given time
Inevitably work requested funded portfolio management process selects funded
Deciding work undertake based organisation mission goal work funded delivers strategy set highest level organisation
Portfolio planning based activity organisation risk management strategy help select piece work fund
Portfolio planning happen level functional group business ensure impact value selected work considered
At level project impact many functional area important avoid turf war jurisdiction
It likely significant piece work level impact require resource number functional area organisation instance launching new customer website solely IT project IT component marketing promote use website service department provide content knowledge engine etc
The portfolio process varies organisation organisation follow clearly understood process provide guideline Where work undertaken cross multiple functional area organisation break logical stream related independent activity manage set project Program work
A program requires additional coordination keep interrelated stream work synchronised advertising campaign need ready run software completed call centre staff need employed trained advertising campaign launch software need production server advertising campaign launch etc
The program manager dedicated role strategic view stream work must come together deliver overall program
The program manager provides unifying vision separate project team work different stream work
The program manager ultimate customer project team set overall priority milestone
Program management adaptive process program work need respond changing reality organisation actual delivery throughput separate project team
An overall program plan produced maintained thing change
Key element program plan include ref Manage IT chapter page Program management need provide direction stream work
This ideally conveyed Product Vision team fully understands commits
This making sure team working product deliver product vision
This adaptive Agile team delivers business value iterative incremental basis
This diagram show planning happens detailed level The product vision point move governance strategic decision making tactical delivery product result change way people organisation work
The product vision crucial tool need convey team working working key constraint must work within
The vision often conveyed Project Charter document
Ideally preparing project charter activity collaborative workshop
The project sponsor product owner present workshop responsible articulating project importance organisation key measure success delivery product
Sanjiv Augustine describes key question project vision What hope achieve organisation project The answer question guide work team undertakes project also tell team stop work
The overall definition done project conveyed product vision
Typical content project charter include There number simple tool used visioning workshop help participant articulate express product vision
A listed A one two sentence statement conveys goal objective project
The elevator statement something enable team member explain purpose project time take ride floor elevator imagine get elevator CEO company asked explain project working elevator get floor
During workshop one first thing produced written read provides focus rest workshop activity
A Vision Box present feature benefit project box cereal front name branding along list key benefit product convey buyer customer eventually use product internal organisation real paying customer
The back box contains operating instruction high level design decision list key feature product
Building vision box creative activity help team articulate thinking
It useful break smaller group group build vision box sell remainder team
After separate presentation shared vision box produced conveys idea whole team
A simple matrix articulates strategic value product intended provide
The matrix look like following table Primary Secondary Tertiary Increase Revenue revenue increase within month launch Costs Improve Service Increase customer satisfaction rating based quarterly satisfaction survey result Other Reduce staff turnover call centre customer satisfaction The goal project expressed strategic driver one primary driver might number secondary tertiary goal
Where one goal column need ranked avoid everything critical conflict
Preparing group activity help team understand clear explicit focus project
A tool showing priority team across multiple dimension
The slider range Fully On Fully Off element On strongest factor drive decision making project continues
No two slider set level slider On side grid higher risk catastrophic failure project accepts
Where little leeway project slider choice becomes deliver everything deliver nothing whereas leeway allows partial delivery contributes organisation goal
Rob Thomsett describes Slider tool book Radical Project Management
Mike Cohn provides online tool setting slider The list simple tool conveys clearly done part project done uncertainty deliverable
Where topic project team responsible delivery component
Where something explicitly scope team spend time effort component
If topic something broader program work dependent important responsibility undertaking work clearly defined project stream person taking responsibility ensuring delivered
Where uncertainty topic scope go Undecided area
The team work piece product owner project manager need investigate identify piece work scope
This tool also explained Radical Project Management Rob Thomsett
This convey level uncertainty surrounding estimate cost benefit organisation get project
Early project cost large Cone Uncertainty project progress get narrower narrower
It likely benefit also wide range uncertainty
Uncertainty cost benefit necessarily problem project provided range correct
Both cost benefit shown three level optimistic likely pessimistic
For example The figure cell net benefit minus cost
This project considered high risk distinct possibility organisation lose money
There might driver warrant investment reward profile thing go well significant
Undertaking analysis project primarily management level responsibility financial goal driver shared team
These tool help team gain clear understanding goal objective driven selection project worked
Preparing product vision important starting point project
This provides focus work team undertake project continues
The wallware artefact produced workshop form part team environment anyone working project see glance project driver goal
It may also valuable produce formal document summarises product vision
Remember value lie partly document shared understanding team achieved producing vision
If team work product distributed brought together production product vision help create one team culture help ongoing communication dispersed
Team member join vision created need walked project charter someone present workshop help understand driver behind work undertaken
Stewardship product vision responsibility product owner person brings business need project team
If execution project environment change vision longer achievable organisation change project longer delivers project stopped reassessed
Changes product vision frequencly evidence massive change organisation ecosystem
The product roadmap list key feature characteristic product need deliver order achieve vision
The product roadmap important project span number release product
If single release product roadmap release plan could thing
The product roadmap view anticipated delivery lifecycle product
It plan maintained product owner project manager expected change time
The product roadmap regularly validated product vision used convey team outside world likely release schedule component product
The product roadmap level feature epic user story included
A product roadmap expressed big visible chart show important milestone feature target release date
As change made item added moved removed roadmap
The picture example product roadmap real project showing two release six month period Image credit New Zealand This roadmap passage team environment act information radiator team working program work anyone else interested project
The product roadmap provides context team working single release
The release plan show feature delivered current release product
It contains currently agreed prioritised list feature level epic story
The release plan based around team anticipated velocity conveys shared understanding need included current release
The initial release planning activity undertaken team product owner providing goal current release
A release consists number iteration team undertake work deliver set feature deliver measurable value organisation
The set feature capability make release criterion subset overall product functionality capability delivered release
Stories epic need sized story point ideal day prioritised work allocated iteration
Release planning start product owner explaining goal release
The team discus needed deliver goal express factor need taken account delivering release
Other factor include risk dependency epic story
High value feature prioritised delivery early project adapt risk evolve problem eg technology actually anticipated would
Dependencies might impact sequence delivery piece first piece easier later
The team velocity used starting point release planning activity
If first release velocity need estimated subsequent release actual velocity previous release used unless team change significantly release
Identifying estimated velocity initially guess accurate guess need longer take come answer
The simplest approach ask team many story point think deliver iteration plan based number
It probably wrong could good enough starting point
To get better estimate team capacity deliver use thorough estimation technique understanding accuracy cost achieve may provide significant benefit cost incurred James King provides useful estimation toolkit downloadable Once estimated velocity used plan iteration follows This process seen flowchart The release plan adaptive plan WILL change project progress
Once release plan produced agreed used guide work iteration
The release plan also used produce initial target velocity graph project
At beginning every iteration team able completely replan project based learned work done far change broader project environement
The iteration planning session two primary activity The first activity examine current release plan update based change happened since last update
The beginning iteration Agile project adapts change made plan based around actuality project environment
Specific thing impact revised release plan The first part iteration planning meeting identify currently important set epic story team work iteration
The product owner explains current priority reason behind change ensure whole team clear understanding priority changed
Once list story epic reprioritised everyone team understands revised release plan team build detailed iteration plan work done iteration
The team estimate much able complete iteration based yesterday weather likely complete amount work next iteration previous iteration unless something significantly changed working environment team makeup common sense
They pick story worked iteration based capacity deliver work
Once set story epic worked identified team break work specific task team member task allocation ideally done pull basis whereby team member identify work able select task
Tasks small hour day discrete measurable activity
The iteration manager Scrum Master Scrum confirms task allocated performs sanity check work committed likely team able deliver committing given reality project environment
Once task identified team member sequence estimate
Estimation level hour work needed undertake single task
These task could written task card task card tracked storywall
Tasks linked story tracking story one state next storywall accompanied completion task activity
Tasks include every piece work needed complete story iteration start preparing next iteration
The Iteration Backlog list story epic tracked story wall iteration
An example partial list task shown Elaborate story acceptance criterion Bob Mary Peter Steve Build test case acceptance criterion Mary Design UI Peter Steve Bob Code UI Peter Steve Code Middleware Peter Steve Code Database Peter Steve Code Interface Furblesplong system Garth Integrate Furblesplong interface codebase Peter Steve Garth Execute system test Mary Exploratory testing system Mary Design acceptance test Bob Mary Write release note Peter Execute acceptance test Bob Story writing workshop expand Epic story next iteration Bob Mary Peter Steve During iteration team member report track work task
This individual daily commitment
A chart show initial estimate remaining effort iteration
The actual amount time taken task tracked used help team improve estimation next iteration planning meeting
This team member monitor progress report task committed
The Daily Standup primary communication tool communicating progress within iteration
Every working day project team get together report progress task committed
The Daily Standup simple rule An Agile project must safe fail environment team member punished meeting task commitment
It must safe tell truth task status learn actuality project environment
Sometimes estimate badly ESTIMATE quote something happen prevents someone working task environment must make OK report truth way team member adjust schedule sequence task adapt reality project
When task story completed story move Done state project velocity credited story point piece work
This table summarises level planning involvement planning process level Individual Team Extended Team Project Sponsor PMO Strategy Group Daily Commitment Individual task plan Iteration Plan Plan task work iteration Influence Release Plan Define release milestone Influence Product Vision Define articulate vision Program Review Overall program structure integration Portfolio Review Pick project driven strategic goal Influence Strategy Review Provide overall direction Planning pervades Agile project simple tool safe environment support adaptive planning honest reporting mean progress reported truthfully management information need make good decision enable delivery best outcome organisation team project
Agile planning take account system development undertaken complex often unpredictable environment flexibility ability respond change paramount
We use term predictive instead emotive waterfall
Predictive project one need likely change work done easily identified measured
An example predictive project would deployment new operating system across computer organisation amount time effort needed upgrading computer predictable certain extent putting people work result directly proportional reduction time needed
Adaptive project requirement likely change work largely creative high level uncertainty software development inherently adaptive process suite predictive project framework
Alistair Cockburn provides valuable discussion meaning Iterative Incremental iterative mean subject change incremental mean piece piece
Agile development iterative incremental
Manage IT Johanna Rothman Chapter p Agile Project Management Sanjiv Augustine Wallware refers flipcharts graph story card artifact prominently displayed around team space provide visual record project serving reminder key decision visible anyone interest project
Other commonly used term Information Radiators Big Visible Charts
Story point estimation tool based relative level effort complexity involved delivering product
Planning using story point take advantage power collaboration team member participates evaluation user story term complexity
Criteria difficulty implementation clarity understanding technical risk included estimate effort required implement particular story
This approach found much effective traditional one estimate beginning project

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I planning teach course mobile application development
I thinking best way structure course starting believe agile approach might merit
The idea The student senior junior one deliverable course end written mobile application make use web service location service graphical information display mobile database
Also student able use version control appropriate amount software design perform review others code incorporate automated manual testing project
Because nearing end study I believe showing real world agile project might work scope currently studying would good secondary goal
My question So look like based school calendar enough time introductory session four sprint final demo session two floating session available work
So two approach Assume product student knowledge mobile application development student select item generic backlog work sprint
Assume product mobile app must term functionality student define app produce user story
This seen Buffy noted
If done properly might case aim fill student knowledge gap
That need highly adaptive per student probably per topic area
If I product owner I get say whether met acceptance criterion know enough topic user story
If instead get another student product owner perhaps QA delegation PO idea pairing brought student come mutual understanding definition done
If product mobile application simplifies thing make agile approach closer software engineer would follow real work environment
Here I product owner I need understand possible apps student get choose app idea
Again might better delegated another student group student
Do subvert purpose essence agile development ability product owner project almost instantly make change adjustment backlog business condition dictate
The alternative specifying everything start failed repeatedly long running project make sense whatever follow initial plan
Some I write assumes future reader familiar terminology purpose various role task
To try complete would require
So You need separate developer group Devs product owner PO person group
I normally randomly thing might work
The PO control backlog release feature per iteration
The developer see whole thing overview form start
If want Devs estimation agile per iteration currently relevant card feature
Then give PO velocity determine many feature iteration
If project one term iteration short week
small
But even estimate time per task still give velocity seen feature desired
Otherwise frustrated much work little time
That lead burnout agile
The downside PO get develop
That may advantage depending makeup student group
I prefer PO I throw kink two along way
As say need prevent speculative development
You fierce rejecting attempt
Not showing entire backlog help simply rejecting feature produced speculatively needed
The problem student likely gotten one bad habit
They probably past given partly specified project assignment creativity valued
So try get creative definition ignoring need PO
In real world seldom work way Startups excepted need learn work someone else vision
So need make work class
The following speculative I tried
If really want every student experience every role Appoint PO somehow first iteration hold role throughout
Accepting rejecting guidance backlog item completed
Then end iteration rotate role old PO becomes developer student take PO role
They need time become familiar backlog however probably ca happen iteration end one day new PO take specifies next iteration immediately
A negative aspect old PO knowledge would reality may make eager speculate
I would also require skill sorry US baseball term Extreme Programming suggests

personal skill pairing test first etc
Pairing help teach one another build team skill
Another possibility course Agile Development though match stated requirement follows
I say others may benefit
Instead one large project bunch tiny project minute feature minute iteration
If run course hour segment made work
In fact I know one outfit sort thing real
large project maybe one hour iteration
With scheme person PO one project take different role next day
At point agile course trying realistic need throw sorry
Change fundamental way
Estimate current move usual
It really happens way experience also show word agile actually mean something
Trying make initial requirement precise also encourage speculation
Real agile project work way
The initial backlog pretty vague specification
It approach iteration feature appears becomes specific
You need guide PO sensible thing
You probably need project Coach
If need ease development could provide test unit test guide developer
After initially take
But need give advice coach quality test
Note I merged idea Scrum XP
Scrum work well overall management Backlogs acceptance XP day day task pairing testing
If require level skill student probably thrash
Agile requires discipline often missed especially reject
There say course
But bottom line need
The biggest issue I see taking curriculum trying approach using SCRUM term
The result lot almost SCRUM behavior could tremendously damaging
I seen many SCRUM team fail Product Owner Scrum Master forced almost SCRUM mentality team
Instead taking curriculum trying approach SCRUM term I recommend starting trying apply curriculum
The reason I think work better SCRUM designed produce product learning curriculum
Your curriculum necessarily designed operate SCRUM
Let SCRUM take charge good
One key aspect application going wear three hat Product Owner Scrum Master Manager
Manager actually SCRUM role essential stability
If real life SCRUM team refuse build sprint support Product Owner sufficiently That PO talk functional management team everyone receiving bad performance review year
The equivalent given bad grade
Thus support SCRUM process line item grade student
Maybe tell student first grade free unless disrupt SCRUM process enough force PO talk manager
If coach right think free A test something like
With ugly manager hat way look one
Product Owner interesting
Like industry PO obligation produce product customer administration child parent expect learning
Explain student wearing PO hat job deliver curriculum expectation customer
I would expect two major style behavior
If student curriculum PO operate like product owner would egging team produce product faster maybe giving freedom craft backlog way want see
However student falling behind
PO may able deliver learning customer student ameliorating sprint PO start tightening rein offering le agility instead picking way cover material probably boring talking Manager SCRUM grade
The student understand front
If start fall behind desire part resolve issue PO come take away freedom
It easy enough understand knowing game work key
Then Scrum Master
The SM known team
They facilitate team way needed make SCRUM team successful
Note different job description PO
You going need make clear acting SM acting PO
This might actually involve funny headgear might involve metacommunicating tell people acting
As example let recognize SCRUM effort experiment
It might actually fit well school model
What happens bad match
The first thing notice PO start get unhappy delivering learning
You falling behind schedule
The PO going push team produce
As SM need work try plan better sprint meet PO need
Now case looking case fails
Now PO extremely unhappy ready talk Manager bad team performing take away SCRUM support grade
At point might need metacommunication recover So I wanted try run class SCRUM setting
As seen email guy Product Owner I happy result
Your SCRUM effort simply working
At point real Product Owner real Scrum Master would sit talk going
They try identify root cause
So Scrum Master group I come table arguing team actually job task big
At point semester I Product Owner agree Scrum Master
You guy done job making SCRUM work best could
The curriculum fit
So Product Owner I deciding terminate SCRUM go back traditional teaching approach
Since clear guy job making work I going Manager try ding guy performance
You great
You get SCRUM support point
But instead part scrum going like Test
It like test study got A
Congratulations
Now back regularly scheduled classroom
Can see murky would blurred hat
It need clear process least person corner Scrum Master
If ca see may rebel idea
Now sprint planning last major challenge I think
There issue
One many people team
SCRUM team work best small number
A classroom likely many
You probably adapt sprint planning process fit reality
The challenge planning student expert
You
They really know enough break backlog item task fit sprint
As result may help
As part Product Backlog may want provide suggestion approach curriculum item Lecture Problem set A Problem set B Research along way estimating long task take
Let assign story point essential learning process SCRUM
If want try learn curriculum different way provided may need introduce concept Sprint Goal explain use provide cohesion
Also remember flexibility
As PO going demonstrate customer student learned material
That
If work find clever way demonstrate learning need learn always let deviate obvious curriculum
If teaching socket really need backlog item Learn use
Or add new item use asynchronous thread add functionality awesome product produced last sprint
The answer really depends much freedom curriculum
The main problem probably
Some pupil see product backlog start working ahead time This good far probably work time AHHH
Therefore release backlog start
Insure teach Work In ProgressÂ bad keep releasing
There may learning dependency mean item delivered early
If pupil chose would problem
Therefore carefully choose initial set backlog contains item suitable early stage
But later dependency considered student could mark invisible one backlog aware
You could Give agile A Bad Name
Ensure know Agile well
I worked many developer say work I tried They tried someone heard Agile good relabelled bad practice Or learn properly made something
By posting answer agree

Stephen worked Project Manager PMP certified well certified Scrum Alliance
Want watch later
Roberta software company considering making change
They used traditional project methodology year felt constraint limitation associated
They looking transitioning Agile would significant
In thinking decision Roberta need clear definition Agile understanding training available team implement
approach project seek provide alternative sequential approach traditional methodology
It focus incremental breaking project work smaller manageable piece well iterative breaking project timeline repeated cycle
While alternative traditional methodology Agile methodology includes various methodology used implement
Since Agile specific methodology training extremely important
There single way Agile predetermined set process
It formally defined little statement value principle
The goal change way people approach think project influence way actually manage project
Agile adaptable evolves people learn find success failure
The shared practice attempting implement Agile provides basis training
As Roberta start explore training option find training based popular methodology used implement Agile
Given number resource available Roberta opts methodology
She find seek training company whole opportunity training individual
The starting point Agile training often company whole
This typically done early company looking adopt Agile need learn basic
This training involves project team stakeholder anyone company could involved project capacity
It actually involves coaching training distinction emphasis organization Agile best applies rather formal process standard company conform
The formal aspect training individual
These typically done outside company organization specialize Agile training accompanied certification
The focus training based around primary role Scrum team including Scrum Master Product Owner developer role engages Scrum process
One common Agile training area Scrum Master role
The responsible enabling development team effective possible managing Scrum process whole
This includes facilitating various Scrum meeting managing communication expectation team
The primary focus Scrum Master training understanding makeup Scrum process empower team member
Beyond Scrum Master training also Product Owner training
In Scrum project requirement primary stakeholder
In Agile project requirement take form description user functionality
The training Product Owners focus writing user story well keeping prioritized ready state
The final Scrum role developer one creates software produced project
Like role training course developer well
The focus training understand principle approaching project incremental iterative way done development testing
It also involves understand tool technique necessary approach
Once Roberta clear picture Agile training benefit obvious
Her company board transitioning Agile using Scrum methodology
Roberta want well belief investing training way
Get FREE access day create account
The benefit training twofold
The first able reach common understanding expectation role process
Agile flexible difference flexibility ambiguity
Flexibility allows definition standard restrict limit based
Ambiguity lack definition lead confusion
The second benefit understanding expectation reached based shared experience
Agile learning go seeking improvement training offered allows individual company share lesson learned others
The final question Roberta company involves source training pursue
The two primary option Scrum Alliance
Each offer similar certification approach philosophy vary two
Scrum Alliance place emphasis team work environment offer training coursework seminar well examination focus shared experience
focus professional development industry standard
Training focused shared knowledge offered online coursework examination
provides approach project based statement value principle
Because leaf room interpretation training extremely valuable
The training available Agile primarily methodology used implementation
For company training option involve coaching basic Agile best apply company
For individual training option organization specialize Agile training offer certification
These include certification primarily train Agile process certification focus developer training applies Agile principle development testing
Investing training provides common understanding expectation shared experience
The primary source training Scrum Alliance

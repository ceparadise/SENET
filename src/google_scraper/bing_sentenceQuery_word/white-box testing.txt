The tester chooses input exercise path code determine expected output
This analogous testing node circuit
ICT
testing applied level process
Although traditional tester tended think testing done unit level used integration system testing frequently today
It test path within unit path unit integration subsystem test
Though method test design uncover many error problem potential miss unimplemented part specification missing requirement
test design technique include following criterion testing method testing application level source code
These test case derived use design technique mentioned testing data flow testing branch testing path testing statement coverage decision coverage well modified coverage
testing use technique guideline create environment examining fragile code
These testing technique building block testing whose essence careful testing application source code level prevent hidden error later
These different technique exercise every visible path source code minimize error create environment
The whole point testing ability know line code executed able identify correct output
testing basic procedure require tester knowledge source code tested
The programmer must deep understanding application know kind test case create every visible path exercised testing
Once source code understood source code analyzed test case created
The following three basic step testing take order create test case testing one two biggest testing methodology used today
It several major advantage Although testing great advantage perfect contains disadvantage A modern view dichotomy testing testing blurred becoming le relevant
Whereas originally meant using source code meant using requirement test derived many document various level abstraction
The real point test usually designed abstract structure input space graph logical predicate question level abstraction derive abstract structure
That source code requirement input space description one dozen type design model
Therefore distinction le important term le relevant
In testing refers methodology full knowledge system attacked

Testing important activity checking correctness system implementation
We need find bug system unit level well integration system level testing
At unit level use white box testing approach find bug developed code whereas integration system level use black box testing approach validate system functionality
In paper focus two widely used black box white box approach software testing
We compare various feature approach find approach useful different stage testing find bug software
Software testing important component software engineering field important technique improving software quality
There two main technique software testing white box testing black box testing
Black box testing deal functionality system based software requirement
Black box testing performed user perspective giving input data getting valid output
White box testing concerned inner design structure system
White box testing helpful find bug software initial level testing
A couple paper describe black box white box testing technique highlighting different feature technique
These paper also tell advantage disadvantage approach explained stage approach used
The paper also mentioned testing cost tester skill testing type
In paper look detail black box white box testing
We highlight main technique different feature approach
Based feature take comparison technique analyze technique feasible testing certain stage software testing
As white box testing used unit level black box testing used integration system level testing
So using white box black box testing sufficient find bug software
Both approach importance testing software finding bug different level software testing
This paper organized follows
Section paper describes black box testing method detail
Section includes detail white box testing approach used test software project
Section describes comparison testing approach white box black box testing
Section concludes paper
Black box testing treat system explicitly use Knowledge internal structure code
Therefore black box testing performed giving input getting expected output
Black box testing verifies correctness software behaviour referred behaviour coverage
The focus black box testing functionality system
Black box testing requirement includes software requirement us case executable program data
These requirement usually met middle phase development lifecycle large piece code begin operate together
Black box testing performed source code
As programming completes packaged larger component code
This package built compiling linking binding executable code demonstrate collective code execution behaviour input output
Here Black box testing diagram
Diagram Black box Testing Developers usually focus positive testing validating expected behaviour code
Tester add value black box testing executing positive negative testing tester know defect found unexpected behaviour
Here technique Black box testing
Equivalence class technique In technique software data divided partition data test case derived
This technique ensures test case derived cover partitioned data
According method one test case enough partition check behaviour program
By using equivalence class technique test case reduced test case partition find new fault program
The recommended black box approach selecting equivalence class value includes value beginning middle end data range
We understand technique help example
Let u assume security system validate log IDs production
Now tester validate logon IDs hand tester know three category IDs clerk supervisor manager
Now sample category sufficient validation
Let u consider logon IDs category
During validation logon IDs given category accepted increase sample size logon ID category continue testing
If initial sample IDs three category correctly accepted tester achieved desired test result using possible test data
Boundary Value Analysis technique In technique analysis extended beginning ending input value possibility equivalence class
The boundary value around beginning ending portion functional error input output data occurs around boundary
The boundary analysis begin identifying smallest value increment specific equivalence class
This increment smallest value called boundary value epsilon
It used calculate value around beginning ending value equivalence class
If take example boundary value category would value equivalence value
Equivalence class remain smaller even addition boundary test value
Expected result coverage Technique The expected result coverage technique focus output test value related input value
To get expected result need find business rule application requirement
The difference expected result actual result combination input cause analysis determine difference faulty test design unclear ambiguous rule program error
Error Guessing In technique Tester judge bug error hidden
Tester test application past experience creates test case validate different task
There specific tool used technique
Advantages Black Box testing Here advantage black box testing Ease Use Black Box testing involved inner functionality application easy tester create test case simple working application
Black box tester need high skill programming rather low skilled person black box testing
Quicker Test Case Development Test case developed quickly tester concern user interface
There need identify internal path may involves specific process
The tester cover UI path user may take make quicker test development
Simplicity Using black box testing even complex application tested focus valid invalid input ensuring correct put received
Issues Black box testing The Followings issue black box testing approach
Fragility User interface interaction make script fragile
The reason UI may rendered constantly time time different platform
Unless tool capable dealing difference UI rendering likely test case fail execute properly
Lack introspection One drawback black box testing look inner logic application unlike white box testing
Therefore black box testing never test application fully
Failure reason Another issue black box testing found reason failure
It tell cause failure system
So pure black box testing guarantee coverage tested component
The white box testing involves inner logic program test case constructed source code program
It based knowledge system implemented
White box testing includes analysis data flow control flow information flow coding practice exception error handling within system test intended unintended behaviour system
White box testing requires access source code
When code developed white box testing performed time life cycle good practice perform white box testing unit level testing
The first step white box testing analyze available design documentation source code knowing make software secure fundamental requirement
Second create test exploit software
Third thing perform testing effectively tester need know technique tool used white box testing
White box testing normally developer extension code debugging activity
The developer usually focus making code work give tendency debug code know work
Software tester add value developer debugging activity helping developer plan debug code usual
The logic test coverage attain debugging fewer defect discovered later kind testing
The earlier defect discovered le expensive correct
Research yet produced white box approach guarantee logic test coverage situation
Here diagram white box testing
Static Analysis Manual Automated Inspection Walkthrough Symbolic Execution Static Verification Diagram White Box Testing White box testing verifies correctness software statement code path condition loop data flow
The prerequisite white box testing include software requirement use case executable program data source code
Here technique used white box testing
Statement Coverage Technique This technique focus determining percentage source code line program executed
If line source code program determine manually tool executed line source code achieved statement coverage
A hypothesis context higher source code test coverage fewer defect found later
The practical conclusion new unexecuted code line software time bomb waiting explode inopportune moment production
The question explode question
Branch coverage technique This technique focus determining percentage source code branch logic program executed
Suppose source code branch point program determine manually tool executed branch counting true false branch execution separately achieved branch point coverage
The unexecuted branch unexecuted statement found often untested error recovery logic
Testing simple condition branch compound condition branch requires fewer initial test action
The developer need choose test value force true branch test value force false branch two test value per branch
Compound Condition Coverage Technique This technique extends branch coverage technique branch compound condition one contain combination Boolean operator AND OR NOT along pair parenthesis possible nested
In technique challenge identify test value combination evaluate true false every simple condition every Boolean combination simple condition
Path Coverage Technique This technique focus determining percentage source code path program traversed completely
A source code path sequence program statement first executable statement series arithmetic replacement branch looping statement statement
If different path program determine manually tool executed achieved path coverage
The underlying hypothesis higher path test coverage fewer defect found later
Loop Coverage Technique This technique focus determining percentage source code loop program cycled completely
In programming language several loop like DO FOR WHILE UNTIL
Some loop clever construct IF statement subsequent return IF statement
The objective loop testing force program loop zero time one time time n terminal loop value n time time
The loop loop loop validate expected loop response beginning middle end longest loop
The time loop test unexpected inappropriate looping condition
Here list common advantage white box testing
Introspection Introspection ability look inside application tester identify object programmatically
It helpful UI change frequently UI yet known It allows testing proceed
In situation decrease fragility test script provided name object change
Stability White box testing delivers greater stability reusability test case object include application never change
Thoroughness White box testing helpful technique essential know every path thoroughly tested every possible internal interaction examined
This technique give tester ability thorough term much application test
The issue white box testing listed Complexity The tester must detailed programmatic knowledge application order test white box testing technique
White box testing involves internal logic application code complexity requires highly skilled tester develop test case
Fragility Although introspection overcomes issue application change breaking test script reality often name object change product development
White box testing requires test script tightly tied underlying code application mean change code often cause white box test script break
Then introduces high degree script maintenance testing process
Integration Due highly integrated nature white box testing tool many provide support one platform usually window
In company company application run platform either need use different tool need test manually
Black box testing based requirement therefore also called behavioral functional testing technique whereas white box testing based internal logic structure project therefore also called structural testing
Black box testing creates test data without aspect software structure technique consider test object implemented requirement
On hand white box testing test derived structure tested object test based actual implementation
Black box testing methodology used integration level system level need look source code need execute system using input data output result
On hand white box testing used logical analytic test unit test level
Black box tester le technical programming bond code tester perception simple white box tester need programming skill identify test path software
In black box testing test case designed soon functional specification complete whereas white box testing test designed program code developed
Black box tester used verify contradiction actual system specification whereas white box tester chooses test case input exercise path code determines appropriate output
It reveals error hidden code
Black box testing focus result user experience whereas white box testing focus internal working making sure application work efficiently possible
White box testing time consuming especially applied whole system directly identifies bug software
In black box testing input need large sample space find expected result
There bug found using black box white box testing
In black box difficult identify possible input limited testing time writing test case slow difficult
In white box testing possible test every path loop program exhaustive testing impossible large system
In black box testing code may reachable without extraordinary measure whereas white box testing tell functionality implemented program
The comprehensive test coverage may achieved black box white box testing technique combined methodology include various benefit application testing
As discussed Black box testing validates functionality software ensures system working correctly according user requirement
Black box testing le expensive compare white box testing performed le technical individual Black box approach cover comprehensive testing system
On hand White box testing check internal structure inner loop condition logic code verify working code
White box testing expensive performed skilled technical individual software size getting huge difficult check part source code integration system level testing
As testing method pro con applied certain level testing
So using one testing approach guarantee bug free software
In conclusion say comprehensive testing system may achieved using technique software testing
White box testing used black box testing improve overall test effectiveness

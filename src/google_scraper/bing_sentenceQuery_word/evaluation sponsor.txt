This course introduce field computer science fundamental computer programming
Introduction Computer Science I specifically designed student prior programming experience taking course require background Computer Science
This course touch upon variety fundamental topic within field Computer Science use Java portable computer programming language developed Sun Microsystems Oracle demonstrate principle
We begin overview course topic well brief history software development
We cover basic programming terminology concept object class inheritance polymorphism well fundamental Java primitive data type relational operator control statement exception handling file input
By end course strong understanding fundamental Computer Science Java programming language
This course lay groundwork strong educational Computer Science successful career devoted implementing principle learn progress CS discipline
We begin course identifying motivation learning fundamental programming concept learning history programming language general
We discus hardware physical device make computer software Operating Systems application run computer computer
We conclude brief discussion Java programming language use throughout rest course
By end unit strong understanding history programming well prepared learn programming concept greater detail
Java programming language
Since programming OO currently one popular programming paradigm need learn fundamental concept order build career Computer Science
This unit begin discussion make OO programming unique advantage made paradigm newly designed program
We discus fundamental concept OO relate back Java
By end unit strong understanding programming relates Java employed
Now basic understanding OO programming move fundamental concept programming language studying semester Java
The concept learn unit many case directly transferable number language
We begin learning Hello World basic software application simply print Hello World In unit discus relational logical operator Java provide foundation topic like control structure discus Unit
In unit start taking look operator notation
We discus relational operator apply numeric operand object operand concluding unit introduction logical operator
By end unit able perform comparison logic function Java fundamental understanding employed
Control structure dictate behavior program circumstance
Control structure belong one two family test value determine code executed based value loop performing identical operation multiple time
Control structure like switch program behave differently based data fed
The loop allow repeat block code often needed
As see functionality useful designing complex program
This unit introduce control structure way used moving discus switch loop
We also discus advanced topic nesting scope
By end unit able draw information learned previous unit create control structure allow create complex useful program
In addition method predefined Java write method
In unit discus name method declare parameter list specify return type
This unit introduces scope variable well
By end unit strong understanding define call method
This unit discus Arrays
An Array data structure allows element data type stored
Each array element unique index associated value store
Arrays commonly used loop structure loop
In addition unit introduces array application
In unit discus two important programming concept Java input output well exception handling
Input output technique allow programmer design complex useful program
For reason must fully understand use programming language functionality
In unit discus function Java moving file writing reading data file
Each unit contain discussion applicable Java class part standard programming language FileWriter PrintWriter FileReader BufferedReader IOException
We identify common pitfall design concept keep mind programmer
By end unit strong understanding write read file write Java program performs function
Exception handling mechanism allows program continue executing even error occurs program instead terminating abruptly

From creating state art video game conducting cutting edge research growing number job require computer science education
However many program available challenging decide best college computer science
Therefore important know goal program offer
While research may take little bit extra time payoff big term satisfaction chosen program
Computer science degree available associate bachelor graduate level
Many people begin career degree earn graduate degree find niche chosen field
Becoming computer scientist requires PhD interested line work may complete doctoral study beginning career
Graduate degree computer science typically take two five year complete usually culminate original research project
After earning formal degree continual educational development within IT field almost always required order keep abreast advance technology
Degrees computer science designed student acquire core set skill
This includes gaining understanding contemporary computer topic applying computing fundamental mathematical principle solve computer science problem
You also likely required learn one computing platform programming language
Throughout program may asked design test increasingly complex software system within team environment
Most program expect computer science student understanding computing within global context including professional ethical social responsibility
According best college computer science Massachusetts Institute Technology MIT Stanford University Carnegie Mellon University CMU University California Berkeley UCB Harvard University
However school tend extremely competitive
Depending career aspiration always necessary enroll top tier university
There many excellent school available different school might better suit need provide opportunity engage specific niche seeking
From type curriculum offered experience faculty selecting computer science program number factor keep mind
A strong program smaller school might allow individualized attention instructor build meaningful relationship classmate
Some student concerned school facility whether forefront research others focus tuition rate location option convenient course scheduling
Pursuing program online component provide flexibility already working looking improve credential change career
Before deciding school important determine criterion important select program best help achieve goal
After completing degree computer science might find skill high demand
Many job within computer IT field tend pay quite well
For example median annual wage earned earned whopping
According position software developer predicted grow much faster average rate also claim employment computer scientist expected grow coming decade rate fast average
However employer report difficulty filling computer scientist position limited number computer science PhD graduate year making job prospect excellent role
If excited career opportunity computer science field consider taking look best college computer science finding degree program meet need
It might top ranked university might lesser known school program reputation require particular interest
Only determine school right fit

A chemical indicator substance undergoes distinct observable change condition change
This could color change precipitate formation bubble formation temperature change measurable quality
Another type indicator may encountered chemistry science pointer light device instrument may show pressure volume temperature etc
condition piece equipment power available memory space
The term indicator come Medieval Latin word indicate suffix
To useful chemical indicator must sensitive easily detectable
It need however show visible change
The type indicator depends used
For example sample analyzed spectroscopy may employ indicator would visible naked eye test calcium aquarium would need produce obvious color change
Another important quality indicator change condition sample
For example methyl yellow add yellow color alkaline solution acid added solution color remains yellow pH neutral
At point color change yellow red
At low level methyl yellow change acidity sample
Typically methyl yellow used extremely low concentration part per million range
This small amount sufficient see visible change color enough change sample
But If enormous amount methyl yellow added specimen
Not might color change invisible addition much methyl yellow would change chemical composition sample
In case small sample separated larger volume tested using indicator produce significant chemical change

Litmus commonly used indicator laboratory
Indicators substance change color added acidic alkaline solution
The litmus indicator turn red acidic solution blue alkaline solution
Universal indicator mixture several different indicator
Universal indicator exactly determine strongly acidic alkaline particular solution
In strongly acidic solution universal indicator turn red whereas strongly alkaline solution universal indicator turn dark purple
In neutral solution universal indicator turn green
An indicator used titration determine endpoint reaction
Titration laboratory technique used determine unknown concentration reactant
As titration delicate process indicator must chosen carefully taking consideration pH equivalence point titration
Methyl orange indicator whose color change red orange acidic pH range
Phenolphthalein indicator whose color change colorless pink alkaline pH range

A pH indicator indicator change color narrow range value
Only small amount indicator compound needed produce visible color change
When used dilute solution pH indicator significant impact acidity alkalinity chemical solution
The principle behind function indicator reacts water form hydrogen cation H hydronium ion H O
The reaction change color indicator molecule
Some indicator change one color another others change colored colorless state
pH indicator usually
Many molecule occur naturally
For example anthocyanins found flower fruit vegetable pH indicator
Plants containing molecule include red cabbage leaf rose petal flower blueberry rhubarb stem hydrangea flower poppy flower
natural pH indicator derived mixture lichen
For weak acid formula HIn equilibrium chemical equation would HIn aq H O l H O aq In aq At low pH concentration hydronium ion high equilibrium position lie left
The solution color indicator HIn
At high pH concentration hydronium low equilibrium right solution color conjugate base In
In addition pH indicator two type indicator used chemistry
Redox indicator used titration involving oxidation reduction reaction
Complexometric indicator used quantify metal cation
Because indicator change color different pH range may sometimes combined offer color change wider pH range
For example contains thymol blue methyl red bromothymol blue thymol blue phenolphthalein
It cover pH range le red greater violet
Intermediate color include pH green pH neutral blue pH
pH indicator used give rough value pH chemical solution
For precise measurement pH meter used
Alternatively absorbance spectroscopy may used pH indicator calculate pH using Beer law
Spectroscopic pH measurement using single indicator accurate within one pKa value
Combining two indicator increase accuracy measurement
Indicators used titration show completion reaction

When acid dissolved water get solution alkali make solution
If solution neither acidic alkaline call
Pure water neutral paraffin
Indicators substance change colour added acidic alkaline solution
You prepare homemade indicator red cabbage beetroot juice help see solution acidic alkaline
Litmus universal indicator two indicator commonly used laboratory
Litmus indicator solution turn red acidic solution blue alkaline solution turn purple neutral solution
usually reliable come red litmus paper blue litmus paper
The table show colour change make
Notice say red
This better saying tell u colour actually see
Acids turn blue litmus paper red Alkalis turn red litmus paper blue Universal indicator mixture several different indicator
Unlike litmus universal indicator show u strongly acidic alkaline solution
This measured using pH scale
The pH scale run pH pH
Universal indicator many different colour change red strong acid dark purple strong base
In middle neutral pH indicated green
Universal indicator show acidic alkaline solution These important point pH scale Activity Handle care

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

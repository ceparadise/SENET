In computing standard needed build program software work different system
Standards de jure de facto
They also open proprietary
In computing agreed way thing
Standards make easier people build program work different system different country
Standards affect many area computing eg software file format hardware
Some common standard include There advantage using standard creating program product
For instance program product popular widely compatible
Also easier work people work standard

In computing standard needed build program software work different system
Standards de jure de facto
They also open proprietary
Which following reason standard used computing
Standards used ensure right people use certain system Standards used make sure software hardware able work together Standards obsolete change industry happen quickly What de facto standard
Standards closely controlled independent organisation Standards applicable hardware Standards accepted best purpose Which statement true de jure standard
They closely controlled independent organisation ensure standard always followed They standard use technology They optional standard choose ignore want Which statement true open standard
The file specification often closed rather open They usually controlled creative common licence unlicensed They created controlled licence agreement owned organisation individual Which word best describes different type file software hardware able work together
Compatibility Accessibility Usability Who responsible maintaining many open standard used internet
Github IBM The World Wide Web Consortium What accurate description Bluetooth USB
They type mobile phone memory stick They method used transmit data two device They exclusive Apple Microsoft product Why computer programmer use standard
They allow computer programmer work alone without interference creative To allow programmer choose programming language suit best So programmer adhere strict professional standard design coding testing software What advantage new standard
It supported modern internet browser It capable handling interactivity web application within web browser It available tablet smartphones What term shelf mean

From standpoint standard extremely important industry allow combination product different manufacturer create customized
Without standard company could used together
In addition standard make much easier learn use new
Most official computer standard set one following organization IEEE set standard type electrical interface
Its famous standard probably defines interface communication
This interface used number including
IEEE also responsible designing data format
While IEEE generally concerned hardware ANSI primarily concerned software
ANSI defined standard number programming language including
ITU defines international standard particularly communication protocol
It defined number standard including specify transmitting data telephone line
In addition standard approved organization also de facto standard
These format become standard simply large number company agreed use
They formally approved standard standard nonetheless

These program designed help student develop practical applicable skill need enter work force particularly software industry software engineer
While many academia may disagree strong consensus among professional industry education program emphasize applied computer science provide student valuable education focus primarily theory
While computer science becoming driving force economy many school include computer science class part core curriculum
However slowly changing
Fourteen state include computer science core academic curriculum set computer science competency standard must met graduation
Many college traditionally offered computer science specific major include computer science class part undergraduate core curriculum
See nation
If trying figure degree computer science get started important first understand difference associate degree bachelor degree computer science
While degree undergraduate degree prepare career position different coursework graduate requirement
An associate degree bachelor degree computer science also vary dramatically near career option salary possibility provide
One key difference associate degree bachelor degree computer science time required complete degree program
On average associate degree computer science completed two year take four year complete bachelor degree
But additional two year required complete bachelor degree nothing
A bachelor degree computer science provides student much comprehensive education
Probably one important difference associate bachelor degree computer science especially recent graduate type job salary level provide
It probably go without saying earning bachelor degree computer science qualifies student better position associate degree
An associate degree computer science typically requires student complete semester hour bachelor degree computer science usually requires semester hour
Both associate bachelor degree similar general education requirement bachelor degree substantially major course requirement provide study computer science associate degree
The Bachelor Computer Science typically take four year complete today several accelerated program student earn degree three year

In based another object class using implementation
Inheritance language mechanism one object acquires property behaviour parent object
Inheritance allows programmer create class built upon existing class specify new implementation maintain behaviour realizing interface independently extend original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise
An inherited class called parent class super class
The term inheritance loosely used programming narrow use reserved programming one class another corresponding technique programming instead called one object another
Inheritance
In language inheritance subtyping agree whereas others differ general subtyping establishes relationship whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship necessarily semantic relationship inheritance ensure
To distinguish concept subtyping also known whereas inheritance defined known
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship
Inheritance contrasted one object another object object one class contain object another class see
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
Inheritance invented
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language
Multiple Inheritance programming widely supposed difficult implement efficiently
For example summary book actually claimed adding Multiple inheritance impossible
Thus multiple inheritance seemed challenge
Since I considered multiple inheritance early found simple efficient implementation technique
I could resist challenge
I suspect case fashion affected sequence event
In JDK Java support multiple inheritance
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level
A derived class derivative class inherits one entity one class called
The semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits superclass
The general form defining derived class Some language support construct also
For example define specification class also inherited heir
The superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality specialized subclass inherit modify supplement
The software inherited subclass considered subclass
A reference instance class may actually referring one subclass
The actual class object referenced impossible predict
A uniform interface used invoke member function object number different class
Subclass may replace superclass function entirely new function must share
In language class may declared adding certain class declaration
Examples include final keyword onwards sealed keyword
Such modifier added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration
Such sealed class restrict particularly developer access precompiled
The sealed class subclass easily deduced reference pointer object class actually referencing instance class instance subclass exist instance superclass reference type violates type system

Because exact type object referenced known execution used instead also called requires one lookup depending whether supported programming language used
Just class may method declaration may contain method modifier prevent method overridden
replaced new function name type signature subclass
A method unoverridable simply accessible class class member function true though
A sealed method frozen feature overridden
If superclass method invocation superclass method
Some language require method specifically declared virtual
others method virtual

An invocation method always statically dispatched
address function call determined
Static dispatch faster dynamic dispatch allows optimisation
Inheritance used two class
Many permit class object replace implementation inherited
This process usually called
Overriding introduces complication version behavior instance inherited class one part class one parent base class
The answer varies programming language language provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class
For instance base method property overridden subclass marked virtual abstract override modifier
An alternative overriding inherited code
Implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass code base class
By default subclass retains operation base class subclass may operation replacing implementation
In following Python example subclass override method base class
The base class comprises operation compute sum two integer
The subclass functionality base class exception operation transforms number square replacing operation transforms number respectively
The subclass therefore compute sum two integer
In quarter class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor
The primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance instance reusing class necessarily substituted instance inherited class
An alternative technique explicit requires programming effort avoids substitutability issue
In private inheritance used form without substitutability
Whereas public inheritance represents relationship delegation represents relationship private protected inheritance thought implemented term relationship
Another frequent use inheritance guarantee class maintain certain common interface implement method
The parent class combination implemented operation operation implemented child class
Often interface change supertype child implement behavior described instead parent class
Inheritance similar distinct
Subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction said establish relationship subtype existing abstraction either implicitly explicitly depending language support
The relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance language support inheritance subtyping mechanism
For example following code establishes explicit inheritance relationship class subclass subtype used wherever specified via reference pointer object
In programming language support inheritance relationship base class derived class relationship implementation mechanism code reuse compared relationship
Inheritance even programming language support inheritance subtyping mechanism necessarily entail
It entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected see
Compare
In OOP language notion code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another
Using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraint
For example consider class contains person name date birth address phone number
We define subclass called contains person grade point average class taken another subclass called contains person employer salary
In defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restriction desirable The alternative inheritance
This technique support polymorphism code reuse separating behavior primary class hierarchy including specific behavior class required business domain class
This approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modification run time allows one class implement behavior instead restricted behavior ancestor class
Implementation inheritance controversial among programmer theoretician programming since least
Among author advocate interface inheritance instead favor
For example mentioned proposed overcome static nature inheritance class
As fundamental solution problem introduces distinct relationship combining property inheritance composition new concept
According main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary form modification base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral change subclass
Using interface avoids problem implementation shared API
Another way stating inheritance break
The problem surface clearly open system client code expected inherit class substituted system class algorithm
Reportedly Java inventor spoken implementation inheritance stating would include redesign Java
Language design decouple inheritance subtyping interface inheritance appeared early modern example programming language
Complex inheritance inheritance used within insufficiently mature design may lead
Another issue inheritance subclass must defined code mean program user add new subclass
Other design pattern allow program user define variation entity runtime

technique efficiently sampling complicated probability distribution
No matter discrete probability distribution set markov chain distribution distribution wish sample
You approximate distribution simulating random walk markov chain
If happens small empirical distribution simulation quickly converge steady state distribution giving efficient algorithm sampling
An important application essentially assume underlying random distribution follows Markov chain
One exiting application HMMs bioinformatics
The task consume long million symbol DNA sequence predict important part gene located
One approach using Hidden Markov Model trained model certain distribution
A related concise problem detecting unfair die used casino
Assume game master switch fair unfair dice certain probability p every roll
This modelled like States probability die roll state every number emitted probability state something different happens
All probability trained either using observed relative count access roll history die used using instance
For given sequence die roll used obtain likely underlying path emits sequence path read unfair die likely used
If online guess unfair die used exploit knowledge
Markov chain appear everywhere
Why
Because model general You interested large set object handle local manipulation object eg
modifying object slightly get new one
You want study global property set object approximate size
This natural problem abstraction problem many field modeled random walk graph node object interest
Starting arbitrary node elementary step move neighboring node certain say uniform neighbor probability
This simple elementary step applied many time result wonderful distribution node converges limiting distribution depending structure graph arbitrary node started
This limiting distribution tell u lot global property set object interest size structure graph
The time take convergence mixing time thus crucial importance algorithmic modeling application
One active field probability theoretical computer science analysis Markov chain various application
Many clever beautiful mathematical tool developed analyze mixing time various case
In nutshell Markov chain used model correlated stochastic process broad class signal
If value signal moment well approximated function signal value limited number preceding moment Markov model appropriate

I currently reading paper Markov chain lumping I failing see difference Markov chain plain directed weighted graph
For example article provide following definition CTMC continuous time Markov chain We consider finite CTMC S Q state space S transition rate matrix Q S S R
They mention Markov property fact weight edge represents probability I believe Markov property trivially hold since probability depends current state chain path lead
In article Markov chain defined similarly A Markov chain M represented triplet S P S finite set state M P transition probability matrix indicating probability getting one state another initial probability distribution representing likelyhood system start certain state
Again mention past future independence
There third paper never state weight edge probability even say In many application value W
We make assumption however also application W deliberately chosen S making usually negative
Moreover stated lumping way reduce number state maintaining Markov property aggregating equivalent state bigger state
Yet look like simply summing probability even guarantee resulting peobabilities transition aggregated state range
What lumping actually preserve
So two possibility I see Could someone clarify situation
It really look like different community using term mean widely different thing
From article I considering look like Markov property either trivial useless looking different kind paper look fundamental
A represented directed graph constant edge weight
An equivalent representation constant directed graph N node N N matrix
The future state depend current state constant edge weight constant entry matrix
mean
Mathematicians use euphemism meaning prove
But first paper defines notation consistent Markov Chain sometimes called second paper defines notation consistent Markov Chain
They say P indicating probability getting one state another representing likelihood system start certain state
emphasis added They assuming matrix constant time thus implying Markov property
Implicit term fact constant range entry every column P sum sum entry sum
I ca read third paper paywalled
If entry every column matrix required sum probability talking Markov Chains
If entry every column sum arbitrary number entry represent probability talking Markov Chains
Markov Chains Markov Chains
In Markov Chain edge weight represent probability rather
The edge weight must arbitrarily large weight sum number
The sum required
With Markov Chains Markov property implied constant edge weight equivalently constant entry transition matrix
Markov Chains come two flavor continuous time discrete time
Both continuous time markov chain CTMC discrete time markov chain DTMC represented directed weighted graph
For DTMC transition always take one unit time
As result choice weight arc put probability going j given
For CTMC transition time two state necessarily given exponential random variable
This key difference CTMC DTMC DTMC always unit transition time
CTMC random transition time
For CTMC convention generally put weight arc according rate exponential random variable going source destination
That convention put arc probability
Although CTMC I recall represented positive rate edge negative rate come CTMC analysis
Say standing state A connected B C D
A B rate A B negative A C rate A C negative D A rate A D positive This likely quite paper referring I bring show negative weight necessarily ridiculous someone working suitable convention
For right
The markov property satisfied trivially
For CTMC markov property satisfied transition given exponential random variable memoryless
If transition given exponential random variable say instead uniform would talking Chains Processes
By posting answer agree

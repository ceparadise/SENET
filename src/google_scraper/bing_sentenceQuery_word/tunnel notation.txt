I know Big O notation used ass efficient algorithm I understand read Big O notation exactly efficient algorithm
Can somebody perhaps explain basic Big O notation
Thanks
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
good explanation notation use
page look explain pretty clearly
Essentially convenient way quickly accurately assessing performance characteristic algorithm
Be quickly worst case average case algorithm run
How much space worst average case us
Sometimes useful algorithm performs number item known amortized analysis
The fundamental characteristic notation leaf term become irrelevant get large
For example get large becomes irrelevant
This would
describes limiting behavior function
For computer science typically use show algorithm scale well get larger set data
For example lookup collection typically vary described using notation based type collection
A Framework property documented follows Getting setting value property approach O operation That basically say matter many item add collection getting item done constant time
A hand describes follows This method performs linear search therefore method O n operation n Count
This basically say algorithm get slower linear time add item
If put item take approximately long average list containing item etc

This first three post series
The second post talk
The third article talk
notation used really scary concept
I thought real programmer talked code
It scary academic description made little sense
This frustrating underlying concept actually hard
Simply put notation programmer talk algorithm
Algorithms another scary topic I cover another post purpose let say algorithm mean function program far
A function notation determined responds different input
How much slower give list thing work instead list thing
Consider code So call function like pretty quick
We loop thing list find first argument function return True
If get end find return False
The complexity function
I explain mean second let break mathematical syntax
read Order N function also known Order function
I think approximation deal order magnitude
Orders magnitude mathematical term basically tell difference class number
Think difference
If picture closest friend people really big difference
Similarly difference pretty big fact difference junker car lightly used one
It turn approximation long within order magnitude pretty close
If guess number gumballs machine within order magnitude said gumballs
gumballs would
A gumball machine whose number gumballs probably within order magnitude
Back dissecting say graph time take run function different sized input
array item item item etc see approximately corresponds number item array
This called linear graph
This mean line basically straight graph
Some may caught code sample item always first item list code would really fast
This true approximate performance something
The worst case code thing searching list
Note The math term upper bound mean talking mathematic limit awfulness
If wanted see graph function ignore function change variable
You type Wolfram Alpha plot x show diagonal line
The reason swap n x graphing program want variable name corresponds x axis
The getting bigger left right corresponds giving bigger bigger array function
The represents time higher line slower
Runtime characteristic O n function So example
Consider function This bit silly example bear
This function called called constant time
What mean matter big input always take amount time compute thing
If go back Wolfram see always stay matter far right go
If pas list million integer take time going pas list integer
Constant time considered best case scenario function
Runtime characteristic O function Consider function This match every item list every item list
If gave array get back
This part field mathematical field study combination thing
This function algorithm want sound fancy considered
This every item list aka input size operation
So
Below comparison graph reference
You see function get slow quickly something operates constant time much better
This particularly useful come data structure I post soon
Comparison O n v O n v O function This pretty high level overview notation hopefully get acquainted topic
There give depth view topic warned hop mathematic notation quickly
If anything make sense send
I also written
I thinking writing book topic
If something like see please express interest

So computer science CS major sitting see book
It assigned course required choice
Still chose institution major
Maybe instructor made good choice
Let hope
Okay computer science major perhaps even student picked book
Maybe title intrigued
Will able read learn
We think
We try interest
Or teaching course might use book maybe discrete math maybe including logic formal language
If want CS student see applicability mathematical reasoning field math student see usefulness field outside student mind
If CS major already noticed course different others taken far
It introduction computing programming problem solving data structure
No book something called language knowledge
It also formal method
You know something model built seen model airplane
In Kitty Hawk North Carolina see wind tunnel Wright brother built test lift capability various wing shape
A model help u simplify think clearly complex problem powered flight selecting part wing focusing aspect aerodynamics
The temporarily ignored part aspect must ultimately addressed course original problem solved
The model book simplification material object like airplane
For computer scientist object study lie mainly world symbol
In book computer software especially programming language software written draw model apply
A model collection precisely stated interacting idea focus particular aspect part subject matter
A good model simplify topic essence stripping away detail understand topic better reason precisely
The model keep part process interest
We reason formally informally
Informal method draw analogy knowledge thing world general common sense typically expressed human language like English perhaps diagram
Formal method use abstract famous high school clearly stated rule manipulate
A formal method based simple precise model situation enable u got thing right least reflected model
If concern precision proof make think theory book partly right
If think mean practical value ask think
It often said experience best teacher
However learning experience mean transferring idea across situation seeing essential similarity nonidentical situation
This abstracted essence learn history mistake informal model
Formalizing model reasoning carefully scientist engineer path knowledge action real world
So theorize
We chosen focus language crucial link hardware software
Programming language permit software written language interpreter hardware run software
Sometimes model prof interesting widely applicable becomes object study right
That case logic language model book
Two key aspect language structure meaning
We study model
The structure language arrangement symbol permitted human language statement programming language
This topic usually called formal model language
It underlies key aspect compiler study computer efficiently processing human language translation easy interaction people computer
Symbol arrangement interest right also express idea meaning computation
Expressing meaning done various way including logic
Of many logic simplest propositional logic
It find tiny hardware component called condition branching loop programming language mathematical rule proof applied via software throughout engineering science
Predicate logic build propositional logic permit knowledge representation database system artificial intelligence work program correctness software engineering
Computer science student may notice several phrase prior paragraph name upper division course computer science
To emphasize practical value two major topic book introduce important programming language based
Lex based formal language tool building key component compiler
Prolog programming language whose core based predicate logic support rapid prototyping intelligent system
Formalisms language logic ancient root India language Greece logic
Each field enjoyed renewed attention recent time starting nineteenth century logic early twentieth century language
These latter thrust formal yet still independent computing
The venerable history logic linguistics suggest inherent fascination held human mind
Building motivation book stress relationship computer science
The two field also related various way emerge text

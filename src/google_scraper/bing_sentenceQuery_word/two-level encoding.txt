And answer related able read data external source like database many employ different encoding scheme

Python default ASCII encoding Java relies underlying database Most people like work text
However computer storage work byte
Encoding process converting text byte
Over past decade many different encoding scheme developed different purpose brevity compatibility internationalization
Today everything simply use
sadly everything yet Programmer user interact simple plain text format form English human readable language computer know deal deal byte Encoding decoding necessary
In computer encoding process putting sequence character letter number punctuation certain symbol specialized format efficient transmission storage
Decoding opposite process conversion encoded format back original sequence character

Do computer actually speak English
Do store information sentence could understand
No
Computers transmit store information encoding combination digit two choice per spot
Most people think choice zero one like movie The Matrix
In reality information encoded many way
Hard Disk Drives image use combination magnetic positive magnetic negative
CDs DVDs Image use laser light either reflects reflect back
Other storage device may use option method still binary Computers today use binary system represent information
It called binary two different digit used
It also known base two human normally use base
Each zero one called bit binary digit
A bit usually represented computer main memory transistor switched capacitor charged discharged
Image When data must transmitted telephone line radio link high tone used one zero
On gnetic disk floppy disk hard disk tape bit represented direction magnetic field coated surface either
Image Audio CDs DVDs store bit part surface corresponding bit either reflect light
Image One bit represent much usually grouped together group eight represent number
A group eight bit called byte
The speed computer depends number bit process
For example computer process number one operation computer must break number smaller piece making slower
Ultimately bit byte computer us store transmit number text information
Now need binary clear time practice encoding simple data like letter

This noob question I wan na know different encoding type difference ie
ASCII etc
Reasons many I believe main point How many character need display encode
If live US example could go pretty far ASCII
But many county need character like etc
If SO ASCII try read text ASCII encoded text see weird character place
Think also China Japan Thailand exotic countires
Those weird figure photo may seen around world might letter pretty picture
As difference different encoding type need see specification
Here something
I familiar
Here information difference
used need encode binary data need stored transferred medium designed deal textual data
If ever made somesort email system PHP probably encountered
Is short To support computer program user interface localization many different language
Programming language still mainly consist character found ASCII encoding althought possible example Java use encoding variable name source code file usually stored something else ASCII encoded text example encoding
In short Always different people trying solve problem specific point view even without point view even possible result may quite different
Quote Joel unicode article link Because byte room eight bit lot people got thinking gosh use code purpose
The trouble lot people idea time idea go space
Thanks Joachim tchrist info discussion
Here two article I read
Both link page I linked earlier
I forgotten stuff Joel article since I last read year back
Good introduction subject I hope
Mark Davis go little deeper
The real reason many variant came along late
In The Beginning memory storage expensive using sometimes bit memory store single character considered excessive
Thus pretty much text stored using bit per character
Clearly bit enough memory represent character human language
It barely enough represent character used language even possible
Therefore many different character encoding designed allow different language English German Greek Russian encode text bit per character
After single text file usually even single computer system ever used single language right
This led situation single mapping character number kind
Many different incompatible solution produced real central control existed
Some computer system used others used precisely one many variation EBCDIC one many derivative big list encoding hardly heard
Finally Unicode Consortium stepped task produce single mapping together auxiliary data useful outside bound answer
When Unicode consortium finally produced comprehensive list character computer might represent together number encoding scheme encode binary data depending concrete need character encoding scheme already widely used
This slowed adoption Unicode encoding considerably
These day want represent text best bet use one encoding represent Unicode character
together suffice use case cover almost others
And clear encoding encode valid Unicode character
But due fact encoding might ideal use case
Unless need able interact legacy system handle encoding rarely reason choose anything else day
The main reason able show character
When internet infancy noone really planned ahead thinking one day would people using country language around world
So small character set good enough
Gradually revealed limited thus demand bigger character set

Digital audio video sample rate bit depth bit rate
They usually compressed reduce file size stream efficiently network
Compression lossy lossless
program encode data usable file whether
codecs designed remove data without losing quality possible
work data removed reduce file size
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
Google software engineer Diana Gorea explains video encoding algorithm work One simplest example compression
RLE basic form data compression convert consecutive identical value code consisting character number marking length run
The similar value value compressed
The sequence data stored single value count
For example minute scene filmed beach would similar colour screen duration shot blue sky sea yellow sand
Each frame would contain similar data file need record colour time
Compression software understands seeing colour recycle data captured rather storing every detail every frame

In computing used represent repertoire kind system
Depending context corresponding resulting code space may regarded natural electrical etc
A character encoding used transmission textual
Character set character map codeset related identical term
Early character code associated optical electrical could represent subset character used written language sometimes restricted upper case letter numeral punctuation
The low cost digital representation data modern computer system allows elaborate character code represent character used many written language
Character encoding using internationally accepted standard permit worldwide interchange text electronic form
Early binary repertoire include encoding Chinese character
Common example character encoding system include American Standard Code Information Interchange
introduced used encode letter character via series long short press
Representations character encoded using Morse code varied length
The encoding created patented modified Donald Murray standardized CCITT International Telegraph Alphabet No
code introduced Army Signal Corps late
encoding scheme used IBM early computer example computer well associated peripheral
BCD extended existing simple numeric encoding include alphabetic special character mapping easily encoding already widespread use
It precursor EBCDIC
introduced encoding scheme used encode letter numeral symbol device code using
usually abbreviated EBCDIC encoding scheme developed
The limitation set soon became apparent number method developed extend
The need support different language including family East Asian script required support far larger number character demanded systematic approach character encoding rather previous ad hoc approach
In trying develop universally interchangeable character encoding researcher faced dilemma one hand seemed necessary add bit accommodate additional character hand user relatively small character set Latin alphabet still constituted majority computer user additional bit colossal waste expensive computing resource would always zeroed user
The compromise solution eventually found developed Unicode break assumption dating back telegraph code character always directly correspond particular sequence bit
Instead character would first mapped universal intermediate representation form abstract number called
Code point would represented variety way various default number bit per character code unit depending context
To encode code point higher length code unit unit solution implement escape sequence would signal subsequent bit parsed higher code point
Terminology related code unit The Latin character set used English European language though Greek character set used Greek language
The character repertoire abstract set one million character found wide variety script including
Other symbol musical notation also included character repertoire
Both Unicode standard character repertoire
As new character added one standard standard also add character maintain parity
The code unit size equivalent bit measurement particular encoding Consider letter abc followed represented
That string contains To express character Unicode hexadecimal value prefixed string
The range valid code point Unicode standard inclusive divided identified number
Characters range plane called BMP
This plane contains character
Characters range plane called
The following table show example code point value A code point represented sequence code unit
The mapping defined encoding
Thus number code unit required represent code point depends encoding parallel standard together constitute modern unified character encoding
Rather mapping character directly octet separately define character available corresponding natural number number encoded series natural number code unit finally unit encoded stream octet
The purpose decomposition establish universal set character encoded variety way
To describe model correctly requires precise term character set character encoding
The term used modern model follow A full set abstract character system support
The repertoire may closed
addition allowed without creating new standard case ASCII series may open allowing addition case Unicode limited extent
The character given repertoire reflect decision made divide writing system basic information unit
The basic variant alphabet broken letter digit punctuation space arranged simple linear sequence displayed order read
But even alphabet pose complication regarded either part single character containing letter diacritic known precomposed character separate character
The former allows far simpler text handling system latter allows combination used text
pose similar problem
Other writing system Arabic Hebrew represented complex character repertoire due need accommodate thing like bidirectional text joined together different way different situation
A CCS map character code point represents one character
For example given repertoire capital letter A Latin alphabet might represented code point character B
Multiple coded character set may share repertoire example IBM code page cover repertoire map different code point
A CEF mapping code point facilitate storage system represents number bit sequence fixed length
practically computer system
For example system store numeric information unit directly represent code point unit larger code point say million could represented using multiple unit
This correspondence defined CEF
Next CES mapping code unit sequence octet facilitate storage file system transmission network
Simple character encoding scheme include compound character encoding scheme switch several simple scheme using compressing scheme try minimise number byte used per code unit
Although simpler CES system working Unicode use either ASCII map Unicode code point sequence octet map Unicode code point sequence word
See detailed discussion
Finally may supply additional information select particular variant character particularly regional variant Unicode character
An example attribute xml lang
The Unicode model us term historical system directly assign sequence character sequence byte covering CCS CEF CES layer
Historically term character encoding character map character set synonymous standard would specify repertoire character encoded stream code unit usually single character per code unit
But term related distinct meaning due effort standard body use precise terminology writing unifying many different encoding system
Regardless term still used interchangeably nearly ubiquitous
A usually mean encoding regard suite encoding covering different script many character share code page
code page suite Windows based IBM DOS based see detail
Most encoding referred code page encoding see byte size
IBM Character Data Representation Architecture CDRA designates coded character set identifier variously called charset character set code page CHARMAP
The term code page occur Unix Linux charmap preferred usually larger context locale
Contrasted character encoding map abstract character
A character set parlance character encoding CCS
encoding term sometimes used characterize old character encoding ambiguity sense
Most use context refers encoding fail cover Unicode code point generally using somewhat different character repertoire several code point representing one Unicode character versa see

Some source refer encoding preceded Unicode
All Windows code page usually referred legacy antedate Unicode unable represent possible Unicode code point
As result many character encoding method use need backward compatibility archived data many computer program developed translate data encoding scheme form data

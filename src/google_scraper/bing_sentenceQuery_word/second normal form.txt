simply process organizing attribute relation reduce improve
Normalization also process simplifying design database achieves optimal structure composed atomic element
It first proposed integral part
Normalization involves arranging attribute based attribute ensuring dependency properly enforced database integrity constraint
Normalization accomplished applying formal rule either process synthesis decomposition
Synthesis creates normalized database design based known set dependency
Decomposition take existing insufficiently normalized database design improves based known set dependency
Edgar Codd inventor relational model RM introduced concept normalization known
Codd went define Codd defined BCNF
Informally relational database relation often described normalized meet third normal form
Most relation free insertion update deletion anomaly
A basic objective first normal form defined Codd permit data queried manipulated using universal data grounded
example data albeit one Codd regarded seriously flawed
The objective normalization beyond first normal form stated follows Codd When attempt made modify update insert delete relation following undesirable may arise relation sufficiently normalized When fully normalized database structure extended allow accommodate new type data aspect database structure remain largely entirely unchanged
As result application interacting database minimally affected
Normalized relation relationship one normalized relation another mirror concept interrelationship
Querying manipulating data within data structure normalized following representation customer credit card transaction involves complexity really necessary To customer corresponds group transaction
The automated evaluation query relating customer transaction therefore would broadly involve two stage For example order find monetary sum transaction occurred October customer system would know must first unpack group customer sum transaction thus obtained transaction fall October
One Codd important insight structural complexity reduced leading much greater power flexibility way query could formulated evaluated
A normalized equivalent structure might look like In modified structure key Cust
ID first relation Cust
ID Tr ID second relation
Now row represents individual credit card transaction DBMS obtain answer interest simply finding row Date falling October summing Amounts
The data structure place value equal footing exposing DBMS directly potentially participate directly query whereas previous situation value embedded structure handled specially
Accordingly normalized design lends query processing whereas unnormalized design
The normalized version also allows user change customer name one place guard error arise customer name misspelled record

Over past month looked several aspect normalizing database table
First discussed basic principle database normalization
Last time explored basic requirement laid first normal form
Now let continue journey cover principle second normal form
Recall general requirement These rule summarized simple statement attempt reduce amount redundant data table extracting placing new table table
Let look example
Imagine online store maintains customer information database
They might single table called Customers following element A brief look table reveals small amount redundant data
We storing Sea Cliff NY Miami FL entry twice
Now might seem like much added storage simple example imagine wasted space thousand row table
Additionally ZIP code Sea Cliff change need make change many place throughout database
In database structure redundant information extracted stored separate table
Our new table let call ZIPs might following field If want even fill table advance post office provides directory valid ZIP code relationship
Surely encountered situation type database utilized
Someone taking order might asked ZIP code first knew city state calling
This type arrangement reduces operator error increase efficiency
Now removed duplicative data Customers table satisfied first rule second normal form
We still need use tie two table together
We use primary key ZIPs table create relationship
Here new Customers table We minimized amount redundant information stored database structure second normal form
If like ensure database normalized explore article series There error

In normal form composite attribute converted individual attribute

A table many side one many many many relationship must
Tables second normal form
ofthe following statement normal form FALSE

Functional Dependencies type constraint based
Which approach database design design examining relationship attribute
Which form simplifies ensures minimal data aggregate repetitive group
Which form relation posse data individual entity
Which form based concept functional dependency
empcode name street city state pincode
For pincode one city state
Also given street city state one pincode
In normalization term relation Answer Option A Explanation First Answer Option D Explanation Have composite key Answer Option A Explanation Eliminate hidden dependency Answer Option C Explanation Loss le dependency preserving decomposition BCNF always possible Answer Option A Explanation Key

First normal form set fundamental rule database normalization relates single table within relational database system
Normalization follows three basic step building last
The first first normal form
The first normal form state The first step confirming modifying multivalued column make sure column table take one entry
Searching record duplicate entry complex
To overcome situation record involved relational database table identified unique value seperate column attribute
This unique key called index key used locate data retrieval manipulation
Having unique key resolve requirement
According rule multiple entry single field
For example data table customer information single field could allowed store multiple entry customer mulutiple telephone number
This violation rule
This particular problem example resolved creating customer ID index main table adding separate table column telephone number another column customer ID
This allows proper use relational query extract data relational database
Null multiple entry field cause issue data manipulation extraction normalizing process remove ambiguity
Removing repeating value table next step toward first normalized form
Repeating value moved new table
The final step implementing first normal form maintaining atomicity data
Each individual field hold smallest data element possible facilitate easy sorting searching
For instance date column separated day month year
Tables satisfying first normal form also contain functionally dependent field
Functional dependency exists two field value field determines value field one value field
In case field functionally dependent field
Tables satisfying higher normal form second third fourth necessarily follow first normal form reverse true
All table complying first normal form may follow higher normal form higher normal form include even stringent rule

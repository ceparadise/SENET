I see term come often programming reading
The current book I reading Programming C Stephen Koching used time throughout book
One example chapter looping say When developing program sometimes becomes desirable test made end loop rather beginning
Naturally C language provides special language handle situation
This looping statement known statement
In case term mean word relation object language
In case replace word
word relation object language
No
These two term different
There nothing like constructor C It generic term normally refers particular syntax included language perform task like loop condition end
It relation constructor
word relation object language
The sentence us noun verb meaning word construct something idea theory formed people mind
In case construct refers abstract way describing something namely loop term syntax particular language
Language construct mean way something language
A simply concept implementation mechanism used given programming language language syntax
In case concept loop construct manner implemented C programming language
Programming language provide construct various programming concept define programming concept implemented language
Does word relation object language
The two term different constructor used Object Oriented Languages java available C programming language

I learning C
Though author careful beginning confuse student jargon occasionally used term without explaining meaning
I figured meaning many term help internet
However I could understand exactly meaning phrase construct unfortunately web provide good explanation
Considering I beginner construct mean
First need understand
All programming language constructed language read reference
You may read little bit including well
Going back question consider The English language natural language token use build use build sentence word
So English language construct build token
Consider example Imagine set build house basic material might use sand iron wood cement water four simplicity
Anything build item would CONSTRUCT turn help build house
I intentionally omitted detail simplify answer hope helpful
A language construct piece language syntax
For example following language construct C let control flow program They usually use term part programming language may written differently depending language
For example similar language construct would The function construct however way written bit different
Hope help
If need detail may want bit research
As one comment suggests Wikipedia may helpful
Without seeing context phrase used I sure generally phrase construct mean combination keywords grammar structure coding language
Basically piece code
definition A language construct syntactically allowable part program may formed one lexical token accordance rule programming language
The term Language Constructs often used synonym control structure confused function
They base unit language built
They ca used function rollback
They directly called parser
It includes syntax semantics coding style language
For clarification may refer
Let say want create class containing method property Construct architecture class create
The architecture class consists method property created using predefined utility etc That take construct
In reference programming language C structural language compiling code everything thing go statement statement
Thus becomes necessary place statement properly
This placing
putting statement correctly language construct else may syntax error logical error

When designing algorithm important make sure step presented correct order
This known sequencing displayed pseudocode flowchart
An plan set instruction solve problem
There three basic building block construct use designing algorithm These building block help describe solution form ready
You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
An explanation sequencing used algorithm programming Algorithms consist instruction carried performed one another
For example simple algorithm brushing teeth might consist step Each step instruction performed
Sequencing order step carried
Suppose step algorithm sequence A toothbrush would still used clean teeth toothpaste would still put brush
But step wrong sequence teeth get cleaned toothpaste toothpaste would wasted
A human would realise forgotten add toothpaste start process computer would know anything wrong
A computer programmed
If step programmed wrong sequence computer perform task sequence even incorrect

In feature perform different computation action depending whether evaluates true false
Apart case always achieved selectively altering based condition
In language term conditional usually used whereas term conditional conditional construct preferred term distinct meaning
A conditional sometimes colloquially referred especially perceived simple one specific form irrelevant unknown
Although usually classified conditional construct another way select alternative
The construct sometimes called common across many programming language
Although syntax varies language language basic structure form look like In example code part represented constitutes conditional intrinsic value may substituted either value intrinsic meaning
In contrast combination expression surrounding consequent follows afterward constitute conditional intrinsic meaning expressing coherent logical rule intrinsic value
When find expects condition example mean variable x contains number greater zero evaluates condition
If condition statement following executed
Otherwise execution continues following branch either usually optional branch
After either branch executed return point
In early programming language especially dialect statement could contain statement
This led style programming known program style called
As result allows virtually arbitrary statement put statement block inside statement gained popularity became norm even BASIC programming circle
Such mechanism principle based older advanced family language language influenced modern BASIC variant many year
While possible using statement statement write program spaghetti code well structured readable program written structured programming language structured programming make easier enforces
Structured statement like example one key element structured programming present popular programming language
A subtlety optional else clause found many language mean since conditionals parsed multiple way
Specifically parsed depending whether associated first second
This known problem resolved various way depending language
By using possible combine several condition
Only statement following first condition found true executed
All statement skipped
The statement simply followed
In Ada difference one needed one us instead followed
This similar provides keyword avoid large number brace would required multiple statement also us special keyword structure denoted indentation rather brace repeated use would require increased indentation every condition
Similarly earlier UNIX shell later gathered POSIX shell syntax use elif giving choice delimiting space line break
However many language directly descended Algol special syntax construct present present many syntactical derivative C PHP
This work language statement case follow conditional without enclosed block
This design choice slight cost code branch effectively adding extra nesting level complicating job compiler implementors analyse implement arbitrarily long chain recursively
If term sequence conditionals testing value single expression alternative also called
Conversely language switch statement produced sequence statement
Many language support similar statement return value result
Thus true expression evaluate value statement change program state perform kind action
member family allow expression In dialect first inspired great extent ALGOL In part compulsory every expression must value
Logic would expressed conditionals language usually expressed recursive function
Because Haskell possible write control structure ordinary expression lazy evaluation mean evaluate condition proper branch strict language would evaluate three
It written like language special conditional expression function may described template like This mean inlined expression unlike language compared expression similar Ruby Scala among others
To accomplish using would take one line code typical layout convention Some argue explicit statement easier read may compile efficient code ternary operator others argue concise expression easier read statement spread several line
First user run program cursor appears waiting reader type number
If number greater text My variable named
displayed screen
If number smaller message My variable named
printed screen
In language function called provided used conditional expression
However behave like true conditional expression true false branch always evaluated result one thrown away result returned IIf function
Up language Fortran arithmetic statement halfway computed IF case statement based This earliest conditional statement Fortran Where e numeric expression necessarily integer equivalent Because equivalent multiple statement could jump anywhere considered unstructured control statement used structured statement used
In practice observed arithmetic statement referenced following statement one two label
This conditional control statement original implementation Fortran computer
On computer three address three state
Other computer would flag register positive zero negative even overflow carry associated last arithmetic operation would use instruction accumulator negative accumulator zero similar
Note expression evaluated case integer arithmetic overflow may occur overflow carry flag would considered also
In contrast language conditional statement defined class abstract method take two parameter
two subclass define method executing first closure executing second closure
In concept conditional expressed using expression ifThenElse passed two function left right conditionals also pas empty tuple result ifThenElse order actually call chosen function otherwise ifThenElse return function object without getting called
In system number used without definition like Lisp Traditional paper math expressed single closure Here true false ifThenElse bound respective definition passed scope end block
A working JavaScript analogy using function single variable rigor The code multivariable function look like another version earlier example without system number assumed
First example show first branch taken second example show second branch taken
Smalltalk us similar idea true false representation True False singleton object respond message differently
Haskell used use exact model Boolean type time writing Haskell program use syntactic sugar b else c construct unlike ifThenElse compose unless either wrapped another function shown The Haskell section page
language multiway branch compare given value specified constant take action according first constant match
There usually provision default action taken match succeeds
Switch statement allow compiler optimization
In dynamic language case may limited constant expression might extend example right implement default case matching string
may seen sophisticated alternative statement
It available many programming language functional programming feature many others
Here simple example written language The power pattern matching ability match action also pattern data
Here example written illustrates feature This code defines function applies first argument function element second argument list return resulting list
The two line two definition function two kind argument possible case one list empty return empty list case list empty
Pattern matching strictly speaking choice construct possible Haskell write one alternative guaranteed always matched situation used choice construct simply way bind name value
However frequently used choice construct language available
In programming language comparable data structure idiomatic use implement conditional assignment
In language allow programmer assign named function variable reference conditional flow implemented using hash
An alternative conditional branch instruction
Predication feature enables instruction conditionally executed instead modifying
This table refers recent language specification language
For language specification latest officially released implementation referred

All programming language utilise program construct
In imperative language used control order flow statement executed executed
There number recognised basic programming construct classified follows A sequence construct tell processor statement executed next
By default imperative language statement following current statement first statement program
If wish jump statement use goto statement
This popular early day computer programming early
Example goto statement This tell processor jump line continue processing point program
The use goto statement also encouraged language
Goto statement make difficult trace program execution determine state variable given point processing
As result error often obscure difficult locate
For reason modern post mid imperative language example abandoned goto statement together
However legitimate reason goto may desirable example facilitate error handling terminate deeply nested sequence loop
Both Ada C support goto statement best avoided
A selection statement provides selection alternative
We identify three type selection construct However imperative language generally make much use pattern matching logic modern functional language thus limit following discussion case form selection
An statement sometimes referred conditional used two form Where Boolean expression sequence Boolean expression program statement description
We also identify number variation particular individual programming language
For example Ada Input value
Input value
Generally speaking else statement support selection two alternative course nest statement usually succinct use statement
Case statement allow selection many alternative alternative linked predicate referred evaluated true cause associated program statement statement executed
Selections may made according Selectors must typically integer character enumerated type
C support selection distinct value default
Ada also support selection distinct value default well selection according Also note selection distinct value case must presented correct numeric order case C
Format Usage Input value
Format Usage Input value
Note C requires selector presented according numeric order
Note also neither Ada C support selection using expression involving selector
conditional expression arithmetic expression
This supported language Pascal
A repetition construct cause group one program statement invoked repeatedly end condition met
Typically construct used step array linked list
We identify two main form repetition To could add recursion routine call
Recursion used much imperative language although principal program construct used achieve repetition logic functional language thus confine following discussion fixed variable count loop
Both fixed variable count loop classified according whether loop
In case pretest loop also referred end condition tested prior repetition case posttest loop also referred end condition tested repetition
Fixed count loop sometimes referred allow statement repeated fixed number time specified entry loop
Fixed count loop tend pretest loop
end condition tested prior repetition
Issues The following example program initialise element array process output array using fixed count loop construct
Format Usage processing array Note control variable declared initialised program second loop process array reverse
Format Usage processing array Note way C loop construct used fixed count construct could equally well used implement variable count loop
Sometimes need terminate loop somewhere middle
Many language therefore support C Ada statement
Ada actually supply two type exit statement
Variable count loop allow statement repeated indeterminate number time
The repetition continues control condition usually boolean expression longer fulfilled
As variable count loop feature control variable incremented tested end condition loop
Variable count loop may pretest posttest loop
Pretest variable count loop sometimes referred Ada C Pascal posttest variable count loop C Pascal loop Ada feature posttest variable count loop construct
Enter number inclusive
Enter number inclusive
Routine procedure invocation particular imperative language
When sequence statement form conceptual unit possible useful think reason isolation convenient encapsulate sequence named routine procedure replace procedure call original code
Unlike goto statement routine invocation guarantee flow control eventually return point routine called procedure call

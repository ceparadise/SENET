In mean group element data memory array file accessed predetermined ordered
Sequential access sometimes way accessing data example tape
It may also access method choice example wanted process sequence data element order
However consistent definition sequential access sequentiality
In fact different sequentiality definition lead different sequentiality quantification result
In spatial dimension request size strided distance backward access affect sequentiality
For temporal sequentiality characteristic time threshold impact definition sequentiality
In data structure said sequential access one visit value contains one particular order
The canonical example
Indexing list sequential access requires time index
As result many algorithm degenerate bad algorithm even le efficient naive alternative algorithm impractical without
On hand algorithm typically index require sequential access face penalty

When designing algorithm important make sure step presented correct order

An explanation sequencing used algorithm programming Algorithms consist instruction carried performed one another
For example simple algorithm brushing teeth might consist step Each step instruction performed
Sequencing order step carried
Suppose step algorithm sequence A toothbrush would still used clean teeth toothpaste would still put brush
But step wrong sequence teeth get cleaned toothpaste toothpaste would wasted
A human would realise forgotten add toothpaste start process computer would know anything wrong
A computer programmed
If step programmed wrong sequence computer perform task sequence even incorrect

One three basic logic structure computer
The two logic structure
In structure action lead next ordered action predetermined order
The sequence contain number action action skipped sequence
The program run must perform action order possibility skipping action branching another action

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

become popular introduction recursion Computer Science student strong argument persist within nature
For reason many u familiar
They also exist within Computer Science elsewhere surprisingly efficient data structure algorithm based upon sequence
There two main example come mind Is special property number give advantage numerical sequence
Is spatial quality
What possible application could
It seems strange many natural number sequence occur recursive problem I never seen heap
The Fibonacci number sort really nice mathematical property make excellent computer science
Here I sure reason I sure reason main factor
Hope help
another magic see many magic
But Fibonacci number easy calculate also specific name
For example natural number many logic prime within sum computable one produce one one take care One important thing I forgot important impact real life example like wide monitor If algorithm successfully explained simple concise mannor understandable example CS nature better teaching tool could someone come
Fibonacci sequence indeed found everywhere
They useful modeling growth animal population plant cell growth snowflake shape plant shape cryptography course computer science
I heard referred DNA pattern nature
Fibonacci heap already mentioned number child node heap log n
Also subtree starting node child least th fibonacci number
Torrent like protocol use system node supernodes use fibonacci decide new super node needed many subnodes manage
They node management based fibonacci spiral golden ratio
See photo node partitioned one large square smaller one vice versa
See photo I think definitive answer one possibility operation dividing set S two partition one divided one size likely approach many algorithm sometimes numerically described Fibonacci sequence
Let add another data structure Fibonacci tree
They interesting calculation next position tree done mere addition previous node It tie well discussion templatetypedef AVL tree worst fibonacci structure
I also seen buffer extended rather power two case
Just add trivia Fibonacci number describe breading rabbit
You start two rabbit population grows exponentially
Their computation power matrix considered primitive problem Operational Research sort like Prisoner Dilemma primitive problem Game Theory

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I new discrete mathematics theory computation I trying learn understand terminology
I difficult time understanding difference set sequence
I understand unlike set sequence order repetition matter sequence contain object rather element member
However I see sequence logically applied real world
Can someone please give clear simple example sequence would used opposed set explain sequence different set
I appreciate clarification
This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
Your question us number word might require clarification
In order answer I start preliminary definition
Consider universe object
The object different property
We know yet object identified
We say object share certain property form statement related notion Set Theory
For instance order set sand particle need able identify particle sand
You need able distinguish object sand particle
So set either empty set set object universe share common property
Two set A B considered equal element x belongs A x belongs B
statement known
It follows removal duplicate change set
In order define sequence need introduce natural number universe
Now set natural number set object
That number associated unique object
You need able identify individual object order define sequence
A sequence also considered set element special form
For example sequence represented set Now example sequence used opposed set
Suppose universe consists colored grain sand
Assume grain either green red
Then could four different set universe many higher order set However could form many infinite sequence without using set In programming language basic data structure array list sequence refer element sequence number
Using structure model set requires additional processing identifying duplicate keeping sorted state
A natural data structure model set hash table
This model handle duplicate efficiently however computing hash table represents union two hash table may complexity proportional size hash table
Hope clarifies difference sequence set
Unlike set element appear multiple time sequence
give enough information

An explanation selection used algorithm programming Selection decision question
At point algorithm may need question algorithm reached step one option available
Depending answer given algorithm follow certain step ignore others
Without selection different path would included algorithm
This mean solution created would realistic

Many programming task done one way one way might much faster another
Designing fast program part art science computer programming
We look couple example exercise
The fascinating simple sequence number
You start two number
Then rule
Therefore next number
This give first three term fourth term forth The Fibonacci sequence originally invented talk rabbit population fantastic connection architecture plant
Here part awesome video series Fibonacci number The definition Fibonacci number lends naturally recursive function
The next exercise defines function give th item list starting
However recursive function becomes slow compute entry sequence
Press type
When test get Time Limit Exceeded
Why going slowly
The function complicated instruction loop addition
So slowness turn related number total call function
If call recursive function called three time total initial call two recursive call
If call recursive function called five time initial call three time mentioned one recursive call
Computing make total nine call make total call
The number call get large quickly grows
As rough estimate requires least twice many total recursive call since call directly another time indirectly recursive call
So computing time proportional least large
This slow
requires recursive call
This argument even outline exact conceptual problem calling twice answer scratch second time wasteful
We come approach waste time thing
Let try something Python similar introduction
We started writing
Then kept extending sequence adding last two element together
Here code look like unscramble
There still little room improvement since need whole array new call good enough since run quickly even large value n
Our second example checking whether number important cryptography computer security
A number prime exactly two factor
The first prime number
For example prime factor well
How test whether number prime Python
We saw test divisibility So testing possible divisor arrive following program
It work
But also slow large number
Pick type
It run time
Try value prime greater code always run time grader execute loop million time per second
If want check larger number need efficient idea
Let make code work even number big trillion
Do really need check number check prime
If read hint experimented might noticed prime program usually found pretty small factor compared
For example run pretty quickly even though input gigantic finding divisor
Maybe actually need check possible factor
Is small limit number factor need check sure prime
Thankfully yes
In fact argue
Why
Well prime divisor
Being divisor mean number Let continue argument
If happy found factor small like wanted
But actually possibility otherwise get impossible contradiction Great
So let implement new idea Python
The easiest way change old approach add test within loop equivalently loop stop testing
The program work gigantic prime
In exercise combine prime second half lesson approach first half
Your code fill table length equal prime composite one million

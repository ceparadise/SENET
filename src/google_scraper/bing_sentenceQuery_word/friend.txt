The game set dystopian future city controlled artificial intelligence construct called also known Computer information including game rule restricted
Players initially enforcer The Computer authority known mainly fact shoot trouble given mission seek eliminate threat The Computer control
The player also part prohibited underground movement mean player character usually among aforementioned threat secret objective including theft murder player
Several edition game published since original version franchise spawned several novel comic book based game
A new edition successfully funded
Delivery backer began March humorous set similar however tone game rife frequently rather dark heavy
Most game humor derived player usually futile attempt complete assignment simultaneously adhering The Computer arbitrary contradictory often nonsensical security directive
The game main setting immense futuristic city called Alpha Complex
Alpha Complex controlled The Computer construct literal realization schizophrenic fear
The Computer serf game principal fear number threat society The Outdoors especially
To deal threat The Computer employ whose job go find trouble shoot
usually Troubleshooters although later game supplement allowed player take role Alpha Complex
The player character frequently receive mission instruction Computer incomprehensible obviously fatal adhered Mandatory Bonus Duties conflict main mission
They issued equipment uniformly dangerous faulty experimental almost certainly dangerous faulty
Additionally player character generally unregistered mutant secret society member termination offense Alpha Complex hidden agenda separate group goal often involving stealing killing teammate
Thus mission often turn comedy error everyone team seek everyone else keeping secret
The game manual encourages suspicion player offering several tip make gameplay paranoid possible
Every player character assigned six clone known used replace preceding clone upon death
The game lack conventional health system wound player character suffer assumed fatal
As result allows character routinely killed yet player continue instead leaving game
This easy spending clone tends lead frequent firefights gruesome slapstick horrible yet humorous demise player character clone family
Additional clone purchased one gain sufficient favour Computer
The rulebook unusual number way demonstrating knowledge rule forbidden rulebook written easy conversational tone often make fun player character occasionally taking dig notable game
feature security clearance system based color heavily restricts player legally everything corridor food equipment security restriction
The lowest rating Infrared lowest playable security clearance Red game usually begin character promoted Red grade
Interfering anything player clearance carry significant risk
The full order clearance lowest highest Infrared visually represented Black Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet Ultraviolet visually represented White Think ROY G BIV Ultraviolet Infrared
Within game citizen live dull life mindless drudgery heavily medicated higher clearance character may allowed demote even summarily execute lower rank Ultraviolet clearance almost completely unrestricted great deal access The Computer citizen may legally access modify Computer programming thus Ultraviolet citizen also referred High Programmers
Security clearance related competence even authority clearance instead measure The Computer trust citizen
In game tend based sketchy spurious knowledge historical matter
For example previous edition included society Seal Club idolizes Outdoors unsure plant animal actually look like
Other society include Knights Circular Object based Trekkies First Church Christ Computer Programmer
In keeping theme paranoia many secret society spy double agent organization
The edition also included secret society Programs Groups personal agent spy High Programmers apex Alpha Complex society Spy For Another Alpha Complex
The actual society would encountered game depends play style society suited game lighter end Classic whereas others represent serious threat Alpha Complex therefore suitable Straight dark sort Classic game

This edition seen response natural development line towards fast entertaining play style
Here humorous possibility life paranoid dystopia emphasised rule simplified considerably first edition
magazine issue gave initial edition release glowing review discussing perceived shortcoming first edition The first edition promised hilarious fun combat system get bogged tedious mechanic
It soon found following among gamers looking something different adventure
Still close inspection combat system revealed slow moving cumbersome
The mechanic hard grasp place making difficult get freewheeling fun
Now changed
The game treated revamp time rule slick
All tricky stuff made combat system pain run shelved optional rule
If want extra complication welcome people anyway simply ignore
The review offer one common reservation game It lend easily campaign play
This game best treated succession short adventure session player get enjoy despicable thing would spoil game
However conclusion review stated As game one hard beat
Many supplement released Second edition fall story arc set new writer line editor intended freshen game broaden roleplay possibility
While undoubtedly giving roleplayers opportunity transcend time space play Computerless Alpha Complex play Alpha Complex Computer battled control faction many fan felt new setting ran counter spirit game
In particular many felt removal Computer thus power structure associated greater freedom given player character effectively wrecked premise game required player character little freedom appease demand Computer presented insane situation arose ludicrous rule Alpha Complex society
Second edition supplement generally divided four era published West End Games fact third edition game released
The game skipped two edition joke possibly also reference two major revision game released lifetime Second Edition Crash Course Manual Paranoia Sourcebook

Keller You might uncertain computer science CS use every day
When use Google smartphone watch movie special effect lot CS
When order product Internet CS web site cryptography used keep credit card number secure way FedEx route delivery vehicle get order quickly possible
Nonetheless even computer scientist struggle answer question What CS Many science try understand thing work physic try understand physical world chemistry try understand composition matter biology try understand life
So computer science trying understand
Computers
Probably computer designed built human inner working known least people
Perhaps programming
Programming indeed important computer scientist grammar important writer telescope important astronomer
But nobody would argue writing grammar astronomy telescope
Similarly programming important piece computer science CS
If turn origin computer science root disparate field include engineering mathematics cognitive science among others
Some computer scientist design thing much like engineer
Others seek new way solve computational problem analyze solution prove correct much like mathematician
Still others think human interact computer software closely related cognitive science psychology
All piece part computer science
One theme unifies nearly computer scientist interested ranging rtificial intelligence oogenesis
Put another way computer scientist interested finding solution wide variety computational problem
They analyze solution determine goodness implement good solution create useful software people work
This diversity endeavor part make CS much fun
There several important concept heart computer science chosen emphasize six data problem solving algorithm programming abstraction creativity
When Google word pie recipe Google report find approximately million page ranked order estimated relevance usefulness
Facebook approximately billion active user generate billion comment Likes day
GenBank national database DNA sequence used biologist medical researcher studying genetic disease million genetic sequence billion DNA base pair
According International Data Corporation size Digital Universe reached zettabyte
How much
Jeffrey Heer computer scientist specializes managing visualizing large amount data put way A stack DVDs reached moon back would store approximately zettabyte data
Without computer science data would junk
Searching recipe Google friend Facebook gene GenBank would impossible without idea tool computer science
Doing meaningful thing data challenging even dealing million billion thing
In book interesting thing smaller set data
But much applicable large amount data
When presented computational problem first objective find computational solution algorithm solve
An precise sequence step carrying task ranking web page Google searching friend Facebook finding closely related gene Genbank
In case single good algorithm enough launch successful company Google initial success due Page Rank algorithm
Algorithms commonly compared recipe act ingredient data
For example imagine alien come Earth distant planet hankering pumpkin pie
The alien Google search pumpkin pie find following Assuming know perform basic cooking step measuring ingredient cracking egg stirring licking spoon etc
could make tasty pie following step precisely
Out respect gastronomical computer scientist rarely write recipe algorithm anything food
As computer scientist would likely write algorithm calculate precisely would write algorithm make pie
Let consider algorithm Take dart one time dart When thrown dart divide number landed inside circle total number n dart threw multiply
This give estimate
Figure show scenario
Figure Using dartboard approximate That description algorithm work
Here The area circle π case made radius board
The area square
Since assuming dart equally likely end anywhere square expect proportion land circle ratio area circle area square
Therefore throw n dart determine number k land inside circle approximately
So multiplying ratio give u approximation
Happily computer robotically throw physical dart instead simulate dart throwing process computer generating random coordinate describe dart land
The computer throw million virtual dart fraction second never miss thing considerably safer roommate
Although noted earlier computer science exclusively programming ultimately usually want implement algorithm operate data
Learning program bit like learning speak write new language
The good news programming vocabulary nearly complicated spoken language
In book program language called Python whose syntax particularly easy learn
But fooled thinking real programming real language used real programmer write real software
Moreover idea learn transferable learning language later
While data algorithm programming might seem like whole story truth important idea behind scene
Software often immensely complex difficult even impossible single person keep interacting piece mind
To deal complex system computer scientist use notion idea designing one part program ignore inessential detail part program long high level understanding
For example car engine drivetrain electrical system component
These component designed individually assembled work together
The designer drivetrain need understand every aspect engine work enough know drivetrain engine connected
To drivetrain designer engine In fact engine divided component engine block distributor others
These part viewed abstract entity interact one another
When designing engine block need think every detail distributor work
Software system even complicated car
Designing software requires think abstraction order ensure many people contribute project without everyone needing understand everything order test software methodically order able update future simply replacing one component new improved component
Abstraction therefore key idea design large system software particular
This book strives prepare write program interesting thing data
In process hope convey computer science enormously creative endeavor requires innovative exploration even experimentation
Often time one way solve problem
In case even clear best way solve problem
Different solution different merit
While Google Facebook GenBank wonderfully easy use many challenge continue design continual updating system
These challenge often lead group computer scientist working together find different solution evaluate relative merit
While challenge confront book modest scope hope share sense problem solving creativity heart computer science

Auden The best way get feel computer science jump right start solving computer science problem
So let
In section examine solution important problem How make sure never least room
To solve problem use simple programming language named Picobot control robot loosely based Roomba vacuum cleaner robot
You probably wondering happened Python programming language said would using throughout book
Why sweeping Python carpet brushing aside language plan use remainder book
The answer although Python simple powerful
programming language easy learn Picobot language learn
The entire language take minute learn yet allows powerful interesting computation
So able start serious computer science get sucked discussion programming language
This new whether programmed offer Eureka experience
So dust browser join u
It humblest turned killer app household robot
Imagine Roomba vacuum named Picobot goal suck debris free space around ideally without missing nook cranny
The robotics community call task ensuring grass mown surface receives paint Martian soil surveyed
At first problem might seem pretty easy
After parent gave vacuum cleaner told vacuum room without missing spot probably pretty great job without even thinking much
Shouldn straightforward convey strategy robot
Unfortunately couple obstacle make Picobot job considerably difficult
First Picobot limited sight sense directly around
Second Picobot totally unfamiliar environment supposed clean
While could probably walk around room blindfolded without crashing thing Picobot lucky
Third Picobot limited memory
In fact even remember part room seen part
While challenge make Picobot job job programming Picobot difficult also make coverage problem interesting computer science problem worth serious study
Our first task solving problem represent way computer handle
In word need define data working solve problem
For example represent obstacle room
Where Picobot
We could represent room plane list coordinate object corner coordinate Picobot location
While representation reasonable actually use slightly simpler approach
Whether lawn sand environment simpler cover discretized cell shown Figure
This first example abstraction ignoring detail environment simplifying something easily work
You Picobot similarly simplified occupy one grid square green one travel one step time one four compass direction north east west south
Picobot travel onto obstacle blue also wall mentioned know position obstacle ahead time
What Picobot sense immediate surroundings four cell directly north east west south
The surroundings always reported string four letter order meaning first see neighboring cell orth next ast est finally outh
If cell north empty letter first position
If cell north occupied letter first position The second letter indicates whether eastern neighbor empty occupied third west fourth south
At position corner Figure example Picobot sensor would report surroundings
There sixteen possible surroundings Picobot shown Figure textual representation
Figure There four type cell Picobot environment map green Picobot blue cell wall gray cell free space
Picobot sense whether empty cell visited dark light gray sense whether four immediate neighbor free space obstacle
Figure There sixteen possible surroundings string Picobot
The one Picobot completely enclosed occur simulator
As seen Picobot sense immediate surroundings
This important process
For example Picobot process moving north sens cell north wall try continue moving north
In fact simulator allow
But Picobot know whether moving north direction
Picobot innate sense direction
Instead make use powerful concept called
The state computer person almost thing simply current condition happy sad underwater outer space etc
In computer science often use state refer internal information describes computer
Picobot state extremely simple single number range
Somewhat surprisingly enough give Picobot pretty complex behavior
Although Picobot state numeric helpful think English term
For example might think state meaning I heading north I go However important note none state number special meaning u make decision
Moreover Picobot actually sense direction pointing
But define conception direction Picobot pointing defining appropriate set state
For example imagine Picobot want perform task continually moving north get wall
We might decide state mean I heading north I go I get wall north I consider next
When Picobot get wall might want enter new state I heading west I go I get wall west I think
We might choose call state state entirely u
Figure The five part two Picobot rule
One useful way interpret idea state attribute distinct intention state
With two rule Picobot initial state state represents go west far As see next job Picobot programmer define state meaning control Picobot make interesting thing
Now know represent Picobot surroundings represent state
But make Picobot anything
Picobot move following set rule specify action possibly state change
Which rule Picobot chooses follow depends current state current surroundings
Thus Picobot complete thought process follows Picobot us rule express thought process
Figure show two example rule
The first rule English say If I state western neighbor contains obstacle take one step east change state The second rule say If I state obstacle around move one step west stay state Taken together two rule use local information direct Picobot across open area westward boundary
Figure The result running Picobot section four rule
At step Picobot examines list rule written looking rule applies
A rule applies state part rule match Picobot current state surroundings part rule match current surroundings
What happens NO rule match Picobot current state surroundings
The Picobot simulator let know box robot stop running
Similarly one rule applies Picobot also complain
Figure show Picobot follows first rule match current state surroundings time step
But state
No rule specify Picobot action state
Just state represents go west task specify two rule make state go east task These rule transition back state creating infinite loop back forth across open row
Try
Note Picobot website start Picobot randomly selected empty cell
Note also Picobot start along top bottom wall rule match move
We remedy defect next section
Table Two equivalent formulation general behavior Picobot
Both set rule use two state wildcard character allows much succinct representation left right
By way sometimes might want Picobot move result applying rule
Rather specifying move direction E W N S may use letter X indicate stay
For example rule saying I state wall north move enter state The problem previous example rule specific
When going west really care whether wall present north south east
Similarly going east care neighboring cell north south west
The wildcard character indicates care surroundings given position N E W S
Table rule use wildcard direct Picobot forever visit vacuum row start
So far looked write rule make Picobot move
But trying solve problem Picobot usually helpful take global view Picobot accomplishing task translate approach rule
In word want develop algorithm allows Picobot accomplish desired task task usually cover entire room
In previous section Picobot modest goal simply moving back forth empty room
The algorithm accomplishing task following Now question becomes translate algorithm rule previous section As written difficult see connection step algorithm Picobot rule
We see Picobot need two state keep track direction moving step step still exactly clear algorithm translates precise rule
Essentially Picobot rule applies fashion
In word Picobot particular state see particular environment take certain action potentially enters new state
With minor modification rewrite algorithm follow Picobot rule structure directly Repeat following step forever Now see clearly direct translation step algorithm Picobot rule step algorithm translates directly rule Picobot state represents Picobot movingWest state represents Picobot moving East
Formulating algorithm way key writing successful program Picobot
Table rule direct Picobot visit entirety starting row
This section challenge develop set rule direct Picobot cover entirety empty rectangular room room Figure
The set work regardless big room regardless Picobot initially begin
Because Picobot distinguish unvisited cell may know visited every cell
The online simulator however detect report successful complete traversal environment
Try
You might find helpful simply play around modifying rule given
For example might start altering rule Figure neighboring row clearing current one
However idea might solve problem encourage plan algorithm express algorithm way easily translatable Picobot rule
Once developed Picobot program completely traverse empty room try write program complex environment
You see MAP option Picobot Web page scroll forward backward collection map created
You also edit map clicking cell mouse clicking empty cell turn wall clicking wall turn empty cell
Figure Picobot maze
One environment particularly interesting maze shown Figure
Notice maze wall connected outer boundary empty cell adjacent wall
A smaller maze property shown Figure
Any maze property completely explored simple algorithm called prefer
Imagine moment maze rather Picobot
In contrast Picobot clear sense direction pointing two hand
You start facing north right hand touching wall
Now visit every empty cell simply walking maze making sure right hand always touching wall
Pause moment convince true
Notice also algorithm visit every cell wall connected outer boundary shown maze Figure b empty cell adjacent wall shown Figure c
Figure A maze wall connected outer boundary empty cell adjacent wall
b A maze wall connected outer boundary
c A maze empty cell adjacent wall
Converting rule set Picobot rule interesting computational challenge
After sense direction right hand guiding around wall whereas Picobot neither hand sense orientation
To teach Picobot rule need use state represent direction Picobot pointing
It may seem impossibly large number situation must considered fact number situation finite actually quite small make possible program Picobot task
To get started seems pretty natural use four state represent Picobot pointing north south east west
Now need introduce rule allow Picobot behave right hand touch wall
Assume state arbitrarily choose correspond representing Picobot pointing north
Picobot imaginary right hand pointing east
If wall east none north rule would tell u take step north keep pointing north
Taking step north problem
Keep pointing north mean stay state On hand state wall east Picobot take step east think pointing east
Pointing east mean changing another state intended encode information
This fun challenge encourage stop try
Remember program work regardless Picobot start maze property wall connected outer boundary empty cell adjacent wall
Is possible write Picobot program fully explore room give
Surprisingly answer possible prove fact mathematically
Picobot computational capability enough guarantee coverage environment
However adding one simple feature Picobot programmed fully explore room
That feature ability drop sense pick marker along way
The fact computational challenge elementary Picobot lead u suggests computation computer far omnipotent
And time done reading book learned prove certain problem beyond limit computer solve

Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

A type malicious software program executed modifying inserting code
Infected computer program include well data
When replication succeeds affected area said infected computer virus
Virus writer use exploit detailed knowledge initially infect system spread virus
The vast majority virus target system running employing variety mechanism infect new host often using complex strategy evade
Motives creating virus include seeking desire send political message personal amusement demonstrate vulnerability exists software simply wish explore issue
Computer virus currently cause billion dollar worth economic damage year due causing system failure wasting computer resource corrupting data increasing maintenance cost etc
In response antivirus tool developed industry cropped selling freely distributing virus protection user various
As even though currently existing antivirus software able uncover computer virus especially new one computer security researcher actively searching new way enable antivirus solution effectively detect emerging virus already become widely distributed
The term virus also commonly erroneously used refer type
Malware encompasses computer virus along many form malicious software malicious BHOs malicious software
The majority active malware threat actually trojan horse program computer worm rather computer virus
The term computer virus coined misnomer
Viruses often perform type harmful activity infected host computer acquisition space CPU time accessing private information number corrupting data displaying political humorous message user screen contact even rendering computer useless
However virus carry destructive payload attempt hide defining characteristic virus computer program modify software without user consent

A viable computer virus must contain locates new file new disk worthwhile target infection
Secondly every computer virus must contain routine copy program search routine locates
The three main virus part Infection mechanism also called vector virus spread propagates
A virus typically search routine locates new file new disk infection
The trigger also known could activated time virus run determines event condition malicious activated delivered particular date particular time particular presence another program capacity disk exceeding limit open particular file
The actual body data perform actual malicious purpose virus
Payload activity might noticeable cause system slow freeze time payload harmful activity time distributive called
Virus phase computer virus described using analogy
This life cycle divided four phase The virus program idle stage
The virus program managed access target user computer software stage virus take action
The virus eventually activated trigger state event execute virus date presence another program file capacity disk exceeding limit user taking certain action certain icon opening etc
Not virus stage
The virus start propagating multiplying replicating
The virus place copy program certain system area disk
The copy may identical propagating version virus often morph change evade detection IT professional software
Each infected program contain virus enter propagation phase
A dormant virus move phase activated perform function intended
The triggering phase caused variety system event including count number time copy virus made copy
This actual work virus payload released
It destructive deleting file disk crashing system corrupting file relatively harmless popping humorous political message screen
Computer virus infect variety different subsystem host computer software
One manner classifying virus analyze whether reside data file document host combination
A simply resident virus installs part executed remains time computer booted shut
Resident virus overwrite code operating system attempt access target file disk sector virus code intercept request redirects replication module infecting target
In contrast virus executed scan disk target infects exit
remain memory done executing
Many common application allow program embedded document email program may run automatically document opened
A document virus virus written embedded document user open file virus code executed infect user computer
This one reason dangerous open unexpected suspicious
While opening attachment unknown person organization help reduce likelihood contracting virus case virus designed appears reputable organization major bank credit card company
specifically target MBR host removable storage medium etc
Email virus A virus intentionally rather accidentally us email system spread
While virus infected file may accidentally sent email virus aware email system function
They generally target specific type email system Microsoft Outlook commonly used harvest email address various source may append copy email sent may generate email message containing copy attachment
In order avoid detection user virus employ different kind
Some old virus especially platform make sure last modified date host file stay file infected virus
This approach fool antivirus software however especially maintain date file change
Some virus infect file without increasing size damaging file
They accomplish overwriting unused area executable file
These called
For example Chernobyl Virus infects file
Because file many empty gap virus length add size file
Some virus try avoid detection killing task associated antivirus software detect example
In computer operating system grow larger complex old hiding technique need updated replaced
Defending computer virus may demand file system migrate towards detailed explicit permission every kind file access
While kind antivirus software employ various technique counter stealth mechanism infection occurs recourse clean system unreliable
In Microsoft Windows operating system proprietary
This leaf antivirus software little alternative send read request Windows OS file handle request
Some virus trick antivirus software intercepting request OS
A virus hide intercepting request read infected file handling request returning uninfected version file antivirus software
The interception occur actual operating system file would handle read request
Thus antivirus software attempting detect virus either given permission read infected file read request served uninfected version file
The reliable method avoid stealth virus reboot medium known clear
Security software used check dormant operating system file
Most security software relies virus signature employ
Security software may also use database file Windows OS file security software identify altered file request Windows installation medium replace authentic version
In older version Windows file Windows OS file stored allow file overwritten would report altered system file authentic using file hash scan altered file would always guarantee finding infection
Most modern antivirus program try find inside ordinary program scanning
Unfortunately term misleading virus posse unique signature way human being
Such virus signature merely sequence byte antivirus program look known part virus
A better term would search
Different antivirus program employ different search string indeed different search method identifying virus
If virus scanner find pattern file perform check make sure found virus merely coincidental sequence innocent file notifies user file infected
The user delete case clean heal infected file
Some virus employ technique make detection mean signature difficult probably impossible
These virus modify code infection
That infected file contains different variant virus
One method evading signature detection use simple encipher encode body virus leaving encryption module static change one infection next
In case virus consists small decrypting module encrypted copy virus code
If virus encrypted different key infected file part virus remains constant decrypting module would example appended end
In case virus scanner directly detect virus using signature still detect decrypting module still make indirect detection virus possible
Since would symmetric key stored infected host entirely possible decrypt final virus probably required since rarity may reason virus scanner least flag file suspicious
An old compact way use arithmetic operation like addition subtraction use logical condition byte virus constant operation repeated decryption
It suspicious code modify code may part signature many virus definition
A simpler older approach use key encryption consisted operation parameter like incrementing decrementing bitwise rotation arithmetic negation logical NOT
Some virus employ mean encryption inside executable virus encrypted certain event virus scanner disabled update computer
This called
At said time executable decrypt virus execute hidden infecting computer sometimes disabling antivirus software
first technique posed serious virus scanner
Just like regular encrypted virus polymorphic virus infects file encrypted copy decoded module
In case polymorphic virus however decryption module also modified infection
A polymorphic virus therefore part remain identical infection making difficult detect directly using signature
Antivirus software detect decrypting virus using encrypted virus body
To enable polymorphic code virus also called mutating engine engine somewhere encrypted body
See technical detail engine operate
Some virus employ polymorphic code way constrains mutation rate virus significantly
For example virus programmed mutate slightly time programmed refrain mutating infects file computer already contains copy virus
The advantage using slow polymorphic code make difficult antivirus professional investigator obtain representative sample virus bait file infected one run typically contain identical similar sample virus
This make likely detection virus scanner unreliable instance virus may able avoid detection
To avoid detected emulation virus rewrite completely time infect new executables
Viruses utilize technique said
To enable metamorphism metamorphic engine needed
A metamorphic virus usually large complex
For example consisted line code part metamorphic engine
As software often designed security feature prevent unauthorized use system resource many virus must exploit manipulate system application software spread infect computer
strategy produce large number bug generally also produce potential hole entrance virus
In order replicate virus must permitted execute code write memory
For reason many virus attach may part legitimate program see
If user attempt launch infected program virus code may executed simultaneously
In operating system use determine program association Microsoft Windows extension may hidden user default
This make possible create file different type appears user
For example executable may created named user see therefore assumes file likely safe yet opened run executable client machine
The vast majority virus target system running
This due Microsoft large market share user
The diversity software system network limit destructive potential virus malware
operating system allow user choose variety packaging tool mean malicious code targeting system affect subset user
Many Windows user running set application enabling virus rapidly spread among Microsoft Windows system targeting exploit large number host
While Linux Unix general always natively prevented normal user making change environment without permission Windows user generally prevented making change meaning virus easily gain control entire system Windows host
This difference continued partly due widespread use account contemporary version like
In researcher created released virus
Bliss however requires user run explicitly infect program user access modify
Unlike Windows user Unix user administrator except install configure software result even user ran virus could harm operating system
The Bliss virus never became widespread remains chiefly research curiosity
Its creator later posted source code allowing researcher see worked
Many user install detect eliminate known virus computer attempt run executable file may distributed email attachment example
Some antivirus software block known malicious website attempt install malware
Antivirus software change underlying capability host transmit virus
Users must update software regularly hole
Antivirus software also need regularly updated order recognize latest
This malicious individual always creating new virus
The German Institute publishes evaluation antivirus software Windows Android
Examples Microsoft Windows software include optional Windows XP Vista Windows protection included second Tuesday month optional download case Windows XP

deception malicious individual pretend friend computer security expert benevolent individual goal convincing targeted individual reveal personal information
Other commonly used preventative measure include timely operating system update software update careful Internet browsing avoiding shady website installation trusted software
Certain browser flag site reported Google confirmed hosting malware Google
There two common method antivirus software application us detect virus described article
The first far common method virus detection using list definition
This work examining content computer memory RAM file stored fixed removable drive hard drive floppy drive USB flash drive comparing file known virus signature
Virus signature string code used identify individual virus virus antivirus designer try choose unique signature string found legitimate program
Different antivirus program use different signature identify virus
The disadvantage detection method user protected virus detected signature recent virus definition update protected new virus see
A second method find virus use based common virus behavior
This method ability detect new virus antivirus security firm yet define signature also give rise using signature
False positive disruptive especially commercial environment may lead company instructing staff use company computer system IT service checked system virus
This slow productivity regular worker
One may reduce damage done virus making regular data operating system different medium either kept unconnected system time hard drive accessible reason using different
This way data lost virus one start using backup hopefully recent
If backup session like closed becomes longer affected virus long virus infected file copied onto
Likewise operating system CD used start computer installed operating system become unusable
Backups removable medium must carefully inspected restoration
The Gammima virus example propagates via removable
Many website run antivirus software company provide free online virus scanning limited cleaning facility purpose website sell antivirus product service
Some subsidiary user upload one suspicious file scanned checked one antivirus program one operation
Additionally several capable antivirus software program available free download Internet usually restricted use
Microsoft offer optional free antivirus utility called updated part regular Windows update regime older optional malware removal tool upgraded antivirus product Windows
Some virus disable important Windows tool
An example virus CiaDoor
Many virus removed computer entering Windows networking using system tool
restore critical system file previous checkpoint
Often virus cause system hang freeze subsequent hard reboot render system restore point day corrupted
Restore point previous day work provided virus designed corrupt restore file exist previous restore point
Microsoft improved Windows later used check repair corrupted system file
Restoring earlier clean copy entire partition copy one earlier backup disk image relatively simple usually remove malware may faster disinfecting reinstalling reconfiguring operating system program scratch described restoring user preference
Reinstalling operating system another approach virus removal
It may possible recover copy essential user data booting connecting hard drive another computer booting second computer operating system taking great care infect computer executing infected program original drive
The original hard drive reformatted OS program installed original medium
Once system restored precaution must taken avoid reinfection restored
Before computer network became widespread virus spread particularly
In early day many user regularly exchanged information program floppy
Some virus spread infecting program stored disk others installed disk ensuring would run user booted computer disk usually inadvertently
Personal computer era would attempt boot first floppy one left drive
Until floppy disk fell use successful infection strategy boot sector virus common wild many year
Traditional computer virus emerged driven spread personal computer resultant increase BBS use software sharing
software sharing contributed directly spread program virus written infect popularly traded software
software equally common virus BBSs
Viruses increase chance spreading computer infecting file file system accessed computer
become common since
Most virus written scripting language Microsoft program spread throughout infecting document
Since Word Excel also available could also spread
Although virus ability send infected virus take advantage COM interface
Some old version Microsoft Word allow macro replicate additional blank line
If two macro virus simultaneously infect document combination two also appear mating two would likely detected virus unique parent
A virus may also send contact friend colleague address stored infected machine
If recipient thinking link friend trusted source follows link website virus hosted site may able infect new computer continue propagating

In Greek many much form shape provision single entity different
A one whose operation also applied value type type
There several fundamentally different kind polymorphism The interaction parametric polymorphism subtyping lead concept
Ad hoc polymorphism parametric polymorphism originally described set lecture note written British computer scientist
In paper introduced term model subtypes
However implementation subtyping inheritance predate term inclusion polymorphism appeared chose term refer polymorphic function applied argument different type behave differently depending type argument applied also known
The term context intended pejorative refers simply fact type polymorphism fundamental feature type system
In example function seem work generically various type looking invocation considered two entirely distinct function compiler intent purpose In language situation complex correct function need invoked might determinable run time
Implicit type conversion also defined form polymorphism referred coercion polymorphism
allows function data type written generically handle value without depending type
Parametric polymorphism way make language expressive still maintaining full static
The concept parametric polymorphism applies
A function evaluate applied value different type known A data type appear generalized type
element arbitrary type designated like generalized type specialization made
Parametric polymorphism ubiquitous functional programming often simply referred polymorphism
The following example show parametrized list data type two parametrically polymorphic function Parametric polymorphism also available several language
For instance D name C Java later formally developed notion polymorphism extension lambda calculus called polymorphic lambda calculus
Any parametrically polymorphic function necessarily restricted working shape data instead value leading concept
Some language employ idea also called restrict range type used particular case polymorphism
In language subtyping allows function written take object certain type also work correctly passed object belongs type subtype according
This type relation sometimes written
Conversely said
Subtype polymorphism usually resolved dynamically see
In following example make cat dog subtypes animal
The procedure accepts animal also work correctly subtype passed In another example type function written take work equally well passed passed
The actual type object hidden client accessed via object
In fact type may even possible get hand object whose type see
This particular kind type hierarchy context usually contains many type
offer subtype polymorphism using also known
In typical implementation class contains called table function implement polymorphic part class object contains pointer vtable class consulted whenever polymorphic method called
This mechanism example The go popular object system
Some however provide method call polymorphic argument
Row Polymorphism similar distinct concept subtyping
It deal
It allows usage value whose type certain property without losing remaining type information
A related concept
A polytypic function general polymorphic function though one provide fixed ad hoc case specific data type ad hoc combinator absent
Polymorphism distinguished implementation selected statically compile time dynamically run time typically via
This known respectively corresponding form polymorphism accordingly called
Static polymorphism executes faster dynamic dispatch overhead requires additional compiler support
Further static polymorphism allows greater static analysis compiler notably optimization source code analysis tool human reader programmer
Dynamic polymorphism flexible example dynamic polymorphism allows duck typing dynamically linked library may operate object without knowing full type
Static polymorphism typically occurs ad hoc polymorphism parametric polymorphism whereas dynamic polymorphism usual subtype polymorphism
However possible achieve static polymorphism subtyping sophisticated use namely

concept design system one existing
A known system communicable unforgeable authority
It refers value along associated set
A must use capability access object
security refers principle designing user program directly share capability according operating system infrastructure necessary make transaction efficient secure
security contrasted approach us
Although operating system implement facility resembles capability typically provide enough support allow exchange capability among possibly mutually untrusting entity primary mean granting distributing access right throughout system
A system contrast designed goal mind
Capabilities discussed article confused
The latter privilege transferred process
Capabilities achieve objective improving system security used place forgeable
A forgeable reference example identifies object specify access right appropriate object user program hold reference
Consequently attempt access referenced object must validated operating system based requesting program typically via use ACL
Instead system capability mere fact user program posse capability entitles use referenced object accordance right specified capability
In theory system capability remove need access control list similar mechanism giving entity capability actually need
A capability typically implemented consists section specifies access right section uniquely identifies object accessed
The user access data structure object directly instead via
In practice used much like traditional operating system traditional handle access every object system
Capabilities typically stored operating system list mechanism place prevent program directly modifying content capability forge access right change object point
Some system also based hardware support capability
Programs possessing capability perform function passing program converting version deleting
The operating system must ensure specific operation occur capability system order maintain integrity security policy
A defined protected reference virtue possession user process grant process capability hence name interact object certain way
Those way might include reading data associated object modifying object executing data object process conceivable access right
The capability logically consists reference uniquely identifies particular object set one right
Suppose user process memory space exists following string Although identifies unique object system specify access right hence capability
Suppose instead following two value This identifies object along set access right
It however still capability user process value say nothing whether access would actually legitimate
Now suppose user program successfully executes following statement The variable contains index file descriptor process file descriptor table
This file descriptor capability
Its existence process file descriptor table sufficient know process indeed legitimate access object
A key feature arrangement file descriptor table directly manipulated user program
In traditional operating system program often communicate storage using reference like first two example
Path name often passed parameter sent via socket stored disk
These reference capability must validated used
In system central question whose given reference evaluated
This becomes critical issue especially process must act behalf two different entity
They become susceptible programming error known frequently resulting
In system capability passed process storage using mechanism known operating system maintain integrity capability
One novel approach solving problem involves use operating system
This realised
See
In system need entity discarded capability invalidated hence require mechanism restore capability later time
The operating system maintains integrity security capability contained within storage volatile nonvolatile time part performing task rather requiring user program case operating system
Because user program relieved responsibility need trust reproduce legal capability validate request access using mechanism
POSIX draft specifies concept permission called capability
However POSIX capability differ capability capability associated object process capability listen TCP port
In contrast Capsicum capability FreeBSD Linux hybridize true model UNIX design POSIX API
Capsicum capability refined form file descriptor delegable right process additional object type beyond classic POSIX process referenced via capability
In Capsicum capability mode process unable utilize global namespaces filesystem namespace look object must instead inherit delegated
Research commercial system employing security include following currently used POSIX capability Linux

This service advanced JavaScript available learn Due increasing system decentralization component heterogeneity interface complexity many trustworthiness challenge become complicated intertwined
Moreover lack common understanding software trustworthiness related development methodology
This paper report preliminary result ongoing collaborative research project among international research unit aim exploring theory method enhancing existing software process technique trustworthy software development
The result consist two part proposal new concept Process Trustworthiness capability indicator measure relative degree confidence certain software process deliver trustworthy software introduction architecture Trustworthy Process Management Framework TPMF toolkit process runtime support measuring improving process trustworthiness order ass assure software trustworthiness

San Jose State University

University California Berkeley University Washington Stanford University The evaluation computer science engineering faculty promotion tenure generally followed dictate publish perish publish standard academic meaning publish archival journal Academic Careers
Relying journal publication sole demonstration scholarly achievement especially counting publication determine whether exceed prescribed threshold ignores significant evidence accomplishment computer science engineering
For example conference publication preferred field computational artifact chip etc
tangible mean conveying idea insight
Obligating faculty evaluated traditional standard handicap career indirectly harm field
This document describes appropriate evidence academic achievement computer science engineering
Computation synthetic sense many phenomenon computer scientist engineer study created human rather occurring naturally physical world
As Professor Fred Brooks University North Carolina Chapel Hill observed Academic Careers When one discovers fact nature contribution per se matter small
Since anyone create something new synthetic field alone establish contribution
Rather one must show creation better
Accordingly research computer science engineering largely devoted establishing better property
The computer science engineering field academe composed faculty apply one two basic research paradigm theory experimentation
Generalizing theoretician tend conduct research resembles mathematics
The phenomenon abstract intellectual contribution usually expressed form theorem proof
Though conference publication highly regarded theoretical community long tradition completing revising extending conference paper submission publication archival journal
Accordingly faculty pursue theoretical work often easily evaluated traditional academic mechanism
Nevertheless discussion regarding impact apply theoretical work
As second generalization experimentalists tend conduct research involves creating computational artifact assessing
The idea embodied artifact could chip circuit computer network software robot etc
Artifacts compared lab apparatus physical science engineering medium experimentation
Unlike lab apparatus however computational artifact embody idea concept well mean measure observe
Researchers test measure performance artifact evaluating effectiveness solving target problem
A key research tradition share artifact researcher greatest extent possible
Allowing one colleague examine use one creation intimate way conveying one idea journal publishing seen effective
For experimentalists conference publication preferred journal publication premier conference generally selective premier journal Academic Careers
In way experimental research variance conventional academic publication tradition
The reason conference publication preferred journal publication least experimentalists shorter time print month v year opportunity describe work one peer public presentation complete level review evaluation per paper compared archival journal Academic Careers
Publication prestige conference inferior prestige journal significant page limitation little time polish paper
In dimension count conference superior
Brooks noted researcher synthetic field must establish creation better
Better mean many thing including solves problem le time solves larger class problem efficient resource expressive criterion visually appealing case graphic present totally new capability etc
A key point type research better property simply observation
Rather research postulate new idea mechanism process algorithm representation protocol data structure methodology language optimization simplification model etc
lead better result
For researcher field making connection idea improvement important quantifying much improvement
The contribution idea generally component larger computational system
The fundamental basis academic achievement impact one idea scholarship field
What group affected form impact vary considerably
Often beneficiary research researcher
The contribution may used directly foundation artifact may change others conduct research may affect question ask topic choose study etc
It may even indicate impossibility certain goal kill line research
Clearly much number researcher affected fundamentally influence work
Users another group might feel impact research
For purpose evaluating faculty member promotion tenure two critical objective evaluation Both aspect documented complicated simply counting archival publication
Standard publication seek validate two objective indirectly arguing editor reviewer publication must satisfied claim novelty ownership true significance high enough meet journal standard
There obvious justification view standard publication acceptable albeit indirect mean assessing impact
But challenged two count
First rationale applied conference proceeding provided carefully reviewed prestige conference computer science engineering field
Second measure impact embodied quality publication
publication standard high significance presumed high
Not paper high quality publication great significance high quality paper appear lower quality venue
Publication indirect approach assessing impact implies useful definitive
The primary direct mean assessing impact document item b letter evaluation peer
Peers understand contribution well significance
Though institution demand peer letter writer selected maximize peer stature field
membership National Academy rational basis used
From point view documenting item connection faculty member contribution effect evaluator may selected faculty member collaborator competitor industrial colleague user etc
sharpest knowledge contribution impact
If artifact involved expected letter writer familiar well candidate publication record
These writer may biased course cost collecting primary data
The promotion tenure committee take bias consideration perhaps seeking additional advice
The letter writer need familiar artifact well publication
The artifact embodiment idea
Though publication necessary obvious reason contribution relating idea previous work presenting measurement experimental result etc
artifact encapsulates information captured paper
Most artifact run allowing evaluator acquire dynamic information
Further artifact complex impossible explain characteristic better observe
Artifacts essential research enterprise essential evaluation
Some school prohibit letter evaluation writer academic affiliation
This serious handicap experimental computer scientist engineer field best researcher work industrial research lab occasionally advanced development center
collaboration occur regularly based common interest advantage company resource bring implementation complex artifact
Letters researcher le informed thoughtful insightful writer return address company
In term assessing item b significance impact letter writer generally address significance quantitative data often offered well
Examples include number downloads software artifact number user number hit Web page etc
Such measure sound indicator significance influence especially indicate peer use research popularity equivalent impact
Specifically possible write valuable widely used piece software inducing large number downloads make academically significant contribution
Developers IBM Microsoft Sun etc
every day
In case software literally new might expected synthetic field created within known
It better embodying new idea technique Brooks requires
It may improved anyone schooled art would achieve similar result
Quantitative data may imply claimed manipulated
Downloads imply software actually used Web hit imply interest
There technique Googol approach http may produce objective information Web usage example caution using number always advised
Computer science engineering synthetic field creating something new part problem creation must also shown Though standard publication one indicator academic achievement form publication specifically conference publication dissemination artifact also transmit idea
Conference publication rigorous prestigious
Assessing artifact requires evaluation knowledgeable peer
Quantitative measure impact possible may tell implied story

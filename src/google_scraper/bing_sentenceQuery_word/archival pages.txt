study theory building collection
To build curate archive one must acquire evaluate recorded material able access later
To end archival science seek improve method storing recorded material
An archival record preserve intended change
In order value society archive must trustworthy
Therefore archivist responsibility authenticate archival material ensure reliability integrity usability
Archival record must claim accurately represent activity created present coherent picture array content usable condition accessible location
An archive curator called curation archive called
Archival science emerged critical analysis
In Jacob von Rammingen wrote manuscript earliest known archival manual
He expert German word later became known
Rammingen elaborated registry city council
However since could attend council meeting described structure management archive writing
Although first work archival science Rammingen refers earlier literature earlier manual usually published
Archival science formal beginning
Jacob von Rammingen manual printed
Traditionally archival science involved study method preserving item storage facility
It also study retrieval safe handling
The advent document along development electronic caused field mean end
While generally associated field also pertain individual maintain private collection business archive
Archival Science taught college university usually umbrella paired History program
A list foundational thinker archival study could include American archivist British archivist
Some important archival thinker past century include Canadian archivist scholar South African archivist Australian archival scholar UCLA faculty archival scholar Anne Gilliland University Michigan faculty archival scholar American archival scholar University Pittsburgh faculty member Richard Cox Italian archival scholar faculty University British Columbia American museum archival scholar David Bearman
There universal set law standard governs form mission archival institution
The form function mandate archival program institution tend differ based geographical location language nature society exist objective control archive
Instead current standard provided widely followed ICA standard ISO standard standard act working guideline archive follow adapt way would best suit respective need
Following introduction computer technology archival repository beginning archivist increasingly recognized need develop common standard descriptive practice order facilitate dissemination archival descriptive information
The standard developed archivist Canada also known RAD first published
As standard RAD aim provide archivist consistent common foundation description archival material within based traditional archival principle
A comparable standard used United States also known DACS
These standard place provide archivist tool describing making accessible archival material public
comprises contextual data pertaining record aggregate record
In order compile metadata consistently enhance discoverability archival material user well support care preservation material archival institution archivist look standard appropriate various kind metadata different purpose including administration description preservation digital storage retrieval
For example common standard used archivist structuring descriptive metadata conveys information form extent content archival material include MARC format EAD
archival science refers origin source something information regarding origin custody ownership item collection
As fundamental principle archive provenance refers individual family organization created received item collection
In practice provenance dictate record different origin kept separate preserve context
As methodology provenance becomes mean describing series level
Describing record series level ensure record different origin kept separate provided alternative manuscript cataloguing
The practice provenance two major concept
rose conviction record entering essential connection person office generated used archivist consider record originating particular administrative unit whether former still existing separate archival grouping seek preserve describe record accordingly close attention evidence organized maintained time created
Original order refers keeping record nearly possible order classification obtained office origin give additional credibility preserved record originating
Records must kept order placed course official activity agency concerned record artificially reorganized
Records kept original order likely reveal nature organization created importantly order activity emerged
Not infrequently practical consideration storage mean impossible maintain original order record physically
In case however original order still respected intellectually structure arrangement
Following newfound appreciation historical record emerged French society
Records began acquir e dignity national monument care entrusted scholar trained
The emphasis historical research seemed obvious time record arranged catalogued manner would facilitate every kind scholarly use
To support research artificial systematic collection often arranged topic established record scheme
With archival document approached perspective record organized according original context creation frequently lost obscured
This form archival arrangement come known historical manuscript tradition
The principle original order adopted spread throughout following decade
Following rise France rising volume modern record entering archive made adherence manuscript tradition impossible enough resource organize classify record
Provenance received pointed expression Manual Arrangement Description Archives text published written three Dutch archivist Samuel Muller Johan Feith Robert Fruin
This text provided first description principle argued original order essential trait archival arrangement description
Complementing work Dutch archivist supporting concept provenance historian era
Though classification aided research began concern objectivity source material
For advocate provenance provided objective alternative generally subjective classification scheme borrowed
Historians increasingly felt record maintained original order better reflect activity emerged
Although original order generally accepted principle debate surrounding theory regard
It argued original order always ideal personal archive far complex organizational archive
However others prefer remain loyal principle original order maintain personal record created maintained much reason organizational archive therefore follow principle
defined Society American Archivists SAA act protecting material physical deterioration loss information ideally noninvasive way
The goal preservation maintain much originality possible maintaining information material offer
Both scientific principle professional practice applied technique obtain maximum effectiveness
In archival sense preservation refers care within collection
included practice often two definition overlap
Preservation emerged establishment first central archive
In established later transformed central archive
This first independent national archive goal preserve store document record
This trend gained popularity soon country began establishing national archive reason maintain preserve record created received
Cultural scientific change also helped bring idea practice preservation
In late eighteenth century many museum national library national archive established Europe therefore ensuring preservation
Preservation like provenance concerned proper representation archival material
Archivists primarily concerned maintaining record along context produced making information accessible user
definition relating preservation
This definition encompasses idea context importance maintaining context
When record removed fellow record loses meaning
In order preserve record must preserved original entirety else may lose significance
This definition relates principle provenance similarly emphasizes idea original record
Metadata key preservation context within archival science
Metadata defined SAA data This data help archivist locate specific record variety record within certain category
By assigning appropriate metadata record record aggregate archivist successfully preserve entirety record context created
This allows better accessibility improves authenticity record
Physical maintenance another key feature preservation
There many strategy place preserve archive properly rehousing item container storing item climate controlled area copying deteriorating item
These preservation technique carried respect provenance
Digital preservation involves implementation policy strategy action order ensure digitized document remain accurate accessible time
Due emerging technology archive began expand require new form preservation
Archival collection spread include new medium digital document
Many new type medium suffer shorter life expectancy paper
With quick advancement technological society old medium becoming obsolete
Therefore migration old format new format necessary preservation digital medias remain accurate accessible
Metadata important part digital preservation preserve context usage migration digital record
Similarly traditional preservation metadata required preserve context authenticity accessibility record
Professional archivist association seek foster study professional development Smaller professional regional association also provide local professional development In Society American Archivists published guideline archival study guideline adopted many university
Practitioners archival science might come academic background

The Smithsonian Institution Archives receives dozen inquiry every year student recent graduate archive profession become archivist
Since popular topic decided make response common question available wider audience
While response intended address archival profession general ultimately reflect experience immediate colleague
Archivists perform wide variety task
In smaller archive individual may everything larger archive archivist may specialize specific aspect work
Traditionally archivist work donor staff parent institution acquire new collection organizes rehouses collection also known processing describes collection writes finding aid assist researcher using collection
Some archivist specialize acquisition management description preservation photographic audiovisual material electronic record
Other aspect job may include digitization public outreach writing teaching
I enjoy learning wide variety topic within collection I process
I also enjoy going behind scene exploring museum research center inside

Many employer require equivalent
A Master Library Science common degree new archivist traditional library school program evolved many university renamed degree often combining term library information created separate degree archive record information management often called Master Information Studies
A limited number university even created degree specifically archival study
Employers generally recognize degree tend similar
When deciding graduate school look type course included curriculum name degree offered
Other common graduate degree held archivist include public history museum study
Some position may require undergraduate degree graduate degree likely preferred
I frequently asked question good answer
I like spent career federal government require certification archivist
I familiar enough requirement preferred qualification organization advise certification
Certainly certification advantageous job hunt obtaining maintaining certification also requires significant time dedication
Whether beginning archival training looking job soon periodically check job listing
Take note requirement preferred qualification position interest
More advice listing give good idea skill knowledge need acquire order reach ultimate goal
Also limit specialty
Taking specialized course make competitive certain type job addition sure take fundamental course aspect archival work meet minimum requirement largest number job
Finally whenever possible take course adjunct professor also work archive
From professor often learn make decision priority setting budget staff limited

At RJI working improve share information reader
So I going talking today Yasmin AlNoamany work
So ask difficult question I going deflect answer far away Berkeley postdoc
So I want talk utilizing storytelling technique enrich archival collection
All right
So really work
And aware subscription service allows member build themed collection
So home page stats probably always date
Lots collection thousand collection many institution literally billion archived page call memento
We go particular collection Boston Marathon bombing see metadata
Some coming creator collection well
Up top description
Here middle seed URIs creator collection decided important put collection
And also creator collection topic descriptive metadata describes expect find collection
But one issue number collection proliferate
We weird scenario larger collection harder explore find collection
And different collection pop hard differentiate one collection another one
So Yasmin Egypt Egyptian revolution happened Norfolk Virginia
So almost example going themed around creating collection exploring web archive son young really understand happening time
There least three collection something Arab Spring Egyptian revolution
And screenshots
So explore collection
How differentiate collection
Even worse manner speaking one seven human right collection
I think might actually becomes really difficult understand collection
So one coming Columbia University
So still descriptive metadata still topical information scroll even descriptive metadata seed URIs
And decide one seed URIs interesting get essentially listing many time crawled
Now already familiar collection maybe need create collection know
Right
This like stuff attic basement
You put time sort lose track exactly
Sort ski boot get thrown away right
So tried earlier attempt standard visualization technique get better understanding differentiate one collection another
So tree map timeline lot pretty picture look great graph
They make great demo really help understand difference one collection
And problem focused trying visualize everything
This work small collection thousand seed URIs potentially thousand memento one seed URIs let go idea going try visualize everything
What really need sample come small sprinkling important collection use summarization
So one idea became fascinated idea storytelling
Now sound cool mean lot different thing
So library
We probably humanity people
Storytelling mean great character go journey encounter conflict resolution learn something end
That great
That talking
Storytelling social medium basically arranging page time
Right
And see Facebook Look Back Year Review Twitter story
There application like anyone use Second Everyday
Where idea sample small bit large personal collection try create summary
So based
We going mostly talk Storify really nice interface realize storytelling idea represented across lot social medium tool
So going look Storify Storify go business God forbid Apple buy Storify kill like Topsy could probably shift another interface
So great
We storytelling
We archival collection
What right
Why use Storify
Well limitation
Yasmin went found story Storify Egyptian revolution course know coming right
Click first thing
So Storify thing really nice kind fancy way arrange bookmark actual preservation behind course nobody think preservation
So really want take collection place like combine storytelling interface
And idea I going try tell Storify best available interface interface people already know use
And one lesson I learned computer science point give trying convince people right way let use whatever tool adapt tool use
So example email stupidest way move file around right
But time
I send slide email
That terrible terrible thing OK I send email right
I stop trying convince Now get better Dropbox thing right know I talking
So trying come story exploratory interface social medium storytelling environment user already familiar
So basically work consider collection consider sample much larger web
So somebody pick seed URIs conduct crawl decides I want build collection
Really story going generate essentially thing sampling collection
So continuum going large small go left right
These story Yasmin handcrafted Egyptian revolution sampling collection
And come back
So basically different kind story explored URLs I post slide later gain access
But story created
And I appealing intuitively better interface exploring collection interface
Now everything collection allow differentiate one collection another
So generating hand difficult
Yasmin motivated collection collection
How automatically
So first want discus collection really two dimension
So time clock time right
Then different URIs would seed URIs kind sampling time
Now sometimes page stay basically sometimes page change
So lot variety basically two dimension
If take cross product two dimension high rough level basically four kind story tell
The first one exists really focus
Basically could page time vary based thing like mobile versus desktop GOYP something like
So exists kind story going create collection
Another kind story fix page sliding time could pick BBC CNN sample track story reported
And give idea especially something like Egyptian revolution happening time
Then sliding page fixed time
So idea pick time interesting
January Mubarak step
And talk news story reported different venue
So BBC page CNN page thing get different perspective thing reported
And sort probably thought standard way sliding page sliding time
Basically sampling different seed URIs different time basically using summarize
So progression story also multiple point view
So storytelling need name framework
Obviously call archive framework
Laughter
I glad laughed
I explain Yasmin
She grow Snoopy
Laughter
So basically first thing going top really try understand social medium collection try understand collection
And going review set method go thousand million page trying get handful page push Storify
All right
So first thing figuring baseline people put Storify
What social medium look like
So bunch question ask
What length story
So story someone created Boston Marathon bombing
If scroll find thing resource
Then try figure kind resource
So add text
You post video tweet webpage forth trying get feel kind multimedia resource people want include
Then look domain distribution
And probably surprise find Twitter sort dominant domain people using Storify people go tweet storm tweet topic somebody arrange story clustered grouped together
We downloaded using Storify API downloaded whole bunch story ran analysis top domain
Basically Twitter dominant percent domain
Then fall pretty rapidly still basically social medium Instagram YouTube Facebook Flickr stuff Blogspot WordPress variety blogging social medium platform
And long tale basically everything else
So wanted understand constitutes popular story define popular story top percent view normalized time available web
This story shooting southwest Virginia Roanoke
It almost view
And story view
How tell apart
We analyzed bunch characteristic story
Basically punch line could tell difference
The popular story median resource
They typically would resource instead resource editing time people spent putting story together significantly longer
And also looked related link rot element story significantly versus percent popular versus unpopular story
So basically popular story reflect somebody performing curatorial activity adding stuff continuing edit perhaps replacing broken link link perhaps choosing better link begin
So one takeaway operationalize future give u target
If going automatically create story start look like human story
And median number popular story
So give u target
If going create story automatically let shoot
Too element story get good summarization many resource story get long read
So sweet spot number thing
Then also baseline collection
And collection Egyptian revolution
And example seed URIs
And looked mean median memento seed URIs example one got resource
Then looked frequently used domain
In collection Boston Marathon ABC News blogspot top seed URIs collection
Skipping bunch data takeaway message top host really look nothing like Storify top host
So number one slot publication government Canada
Now member obviously archiving material
So percent content found
Now really span four collection obviously government publication super popular outside Canada might imagine
We skip Twitter number
So really archiving bunch tweet thing
Twitter show collection
So basically one percent total collection although spread collection
So lot collection random tweet thrown dominant force find Storify
So takeaway message archive remember essentially professional librarian people archivist people idea We collecting resource posterity
What archive share social medium completely different
So seed share thing bunch publication kind find result
But archiving viewing social medium different
So create collection one thing focused detecting page something happen
give really nice tool performing crawl understanding happens crawl basically data get back HTTP event
You many host many many MIME type forth
It give idea content
So Yasmin went one collection candidate one first Egyptian election
This home page seed URI collection
Then shortly database error detectable
And ran money apparently Arabic say ran money I trust telling truth came back line say OK gone topic topic That oscillates back forth time
Then hacked English say hacked Arabic
And lost domain sale
So show collection
Now talking removing collection going create story summarizes content point good candidate show story
We really want detect focus representative collection hold
We automatically hand automatically detect page
So one way use suite textual method
Here one version page changed use cosign similarity
You use Jaccard term frequency intersection
It really matter detail basically intuitively look score sort reflect
And sort empirically determine threshold
When compare obviously number term case fall zero
So use method figure subsequent change still somehow similar original page
But sometimes page still topic straight lexical comparison term find
So noun page Mubarak hear square violence army Egypt protest Morsi Cairo President
This clearly stuff even though word overlap
Then technique submit query Google
You get snippet like cheap easy way term expansion
Then really counting term appearing snippet apply textual result overlap decide still le topic
It turn actually simpler way
We look change size either number term number byte come back
So one version page
Here another version page
Visually look different roughly size page
Legitimate page target page size
In case say database error notice significantly smaller
The page greatly shrunk term number term byte sent back page clue something gone wrong
So really mean Yasmin worked really hard created gold standard data set three collection Occupy Egypt revolution Columbia Human Rights collection went manually labeled momentos
So seed URIs total momentos
So basically went went manually labeled
Then combined individual method combination method basically came best approach figuring gold standard data set could automatically tune detect page
Then ran collection tried discover momentos collection
We got pretty good result
We tell one missed examine one flagged
Then went manually determined truly topic
Now collection page could detect
So great
Some small number top know Southern California wildfire web archive really badly one
So flagged actually
Mostly thing collection uniform across
So remember trying pick
Now exclude page get u lot way
We thought would find distribution like time seed URIs highly regular crawl schedule
Turns case
We wildly irregular crawl schedule
This get tricky try pick dimension dimension going skip lot detail clustering
But basically figured way try get
To try pick candidate page want pay attention quality page
There lot dimension quality consider
One looking amount resource missed crawled weighted toward sometimes miss important resource sometimes
Justin Brunello leveraged work straight percentage I got nine If one main video middle page important damage greater percent
So basically want prefer page page one visually le damaged figure dynamically
And kind say thing given choice prefer one
Since headed towards Storify actually prefer page generate attractive snippet
So look top see snippet Storify automatically get image prettier actually going matter interface
Even though kind say thing want choose page right
Basically operationalized choosing deep link collection actually likely get attractive meaningful snippet metadata specifically page snippet come high level page even though story might dominate whatever metadata BBC great news source something like help distinguish one page another
As footnote turn social medium snippet social medium page often generate good snippet
We many collection anyway matter
So go pick push Storify handcrafted story saw earlier
If zoom kind hard tell Favicons say come even though originally crawled different location always nice image title nice
So basically get Storify user interface API overwrite Favicon add date title modify metadata essentially get attractive story
Here Favicons saying come National Post BBC New York Times etc
essentially image
We date title
We created attractive interface get copying pasting
How evaluate
How know story good
So evaluation tricky
There test
I Los Angeles
I mention Blade So basically idea going use Mechanical Turk going compare automatically generated story expert Mechanical Turk worker tell difference automatically generated version human generated version consider good otherwise picking million page way pick equally good summarization
So gave criterion people
You read later
They created story story different collection
Now lot basically collection
This important distinction
I mean obviously important venue clear technique work state government website aspect show
But guy care good
Then different kind story
This sliding page sliding time fixed page sliding time
Now collection got certain kind story full story essence intuitively interesting kind story want examine
So page generated Boston Marathon bombing expert
This look good good Favicons good title forth
Then process I skip detail lot clustering throwing duplicate forth
This page
This clearly different intuitively kind look
You really tell generated
We generated random story basically picked thing randomly collection bad
You get stuff get Welcome city Boston forth actually get bad stuff thrown well
Then control generated bad story basically memento picked time
If Turker said I like story said OK like Then ran comparison three different kind hit compared human versus automatic human versus poor page forth
We used story threw picked poor story required le seven second clearly enough time
The median time actually seven minute spent lot time cent hit actually pretty generous hit amount
So hit would look like
They would left right
It talk human versus automatic
We said We generated story
Which one like best And scrollable independently scrollable
They would pick
The punchline preference automatic human story basically indistinguishable
They tell difference human automatic story could tell difference human random story automatically generated random story
So random equally good expert versus automatic equally good
Now different kind story sliding page sliding time etc
basically came
This also hold versus random automatic versus random
So basically see distinction different kind story
They easily identifiable
So punchline automatically generated story good human story
Now prove story useful anything
It could equally bad I get least indistinguishable start
And summarization return original slide taking Storify interface people already know use sampling collection using create summary collection
I reference bunch data set code paper slide basically everything available right
And I think

adequate discussion I think I
However I confused article repeated use term
I thought frame page different thing
Could someone please clarify difference
Short version page mean virtual page
chunk virtual address space page frame mean physical page
chunk physical memory
That pretty much
It important keep two concept distinct given time page may backed page frame could page accessed paged secondary memory page frame may back multiple page sometimes different address space
shared memory file
Physical memory organized frame virtual memory page
The page frame term bit confusing opinion wikipedia use
What really mean page frame physical memory equivalent frame
So instead use term frame page frame
In short remember That use
A storage unit within main memory content frame

In context database cardinality refers uniqueness data value contained column
High cardinality mean column contains large percentage totally unique value
Low cardinality mean column contains lot repeat data range
It common cardinality also sometimes refers relationship table
Cardinality table
High cardinality column unique uncommon data value
For example database table store bank account number Account Number column high cardinality definition every item data column totally unique
Normal cardinality column somewhat unique percentage data value
For instance table hold customer information Last Name column would normal cardinality
Not every last name unique example likely several occurrence Smith whole data fairly
Low cardinality column unique value
In customer table low cardinality column would Gender column
This column likely M F range value choose thousand million record table pick one two value column
Cardinality relationship table take form whose reversal
These term simply refer relationship data table
For example relationship Customers table Bank Accounts table one customer several account one account belong one customer
That course assuming bank never heard joint account

In database design fundamental principle one data aspect respect another critical feature
The relationship one must precise exact order explain aspect link together
In table related
This said given table relation another
For example consider database designed keep track hospital record
Such database could many table like In model A relationship mostly used split table two order provide information concisely make understandable
In hospital example relationship could used keep apart doctor unique professional information administrative detail
In collection data element grouped data table contain group data field name called database attribute
Tables linked key field
A primary key assigns field special order table
For example Doctor Last Name field might assigned primary key Doctor table people last name organized alphabetically according first three letter first name
A table also indicates field linked primary key another table
A complex data model involve hundred related table
A renowned computer scientist created systematic method decompose organize
Codd step organizing database table key called avoids certain hidden database design error
In real life process database normalization end breaking table larger number smaller table
In real world data modeling critical data grows voluminous table linked key must used speed programmed retrieval data
If data model poorly crafted even computer application system million record give unacceptable response time delay
For reason data modeling keystone skill needed modern software developer
The proposes technique produce diagram ERDs employed capture information data model entity type relationship cardinality
A show relationship
Alternatively single line represents relationship
In application programming paradigm decidedly marginal database structure design may used modeling subsequently mapped proper data modeling method
In case object relationship modeled using UML association multiplicity used association denote

What cardinality set regular grammar
The caveat I interested grammar different
Sorry I know talk formal way I mean actual symbol arbitrary
So example grammar x Is equivalent grammar Hopefully I understood
I believe set countable every N finite number production rule formulated
For example x The unique set production rule There least one regular grammar per regular language pairwise inequivalent meaningful equivalence relation
Since least countably infinite number regular lower bound number regular grammar well
Without loss write every regular grammar finite string finite alphabet
Therefore many regular grammar binary string countably infinitely many
Combine bound get answer

MySQL Using mysqldump back MySQL database This chapter describes explains several way optimize MySQL provide example
To understand optimize entire system required understanding knowledge optimization complex task
Although perform local optimization require lot knowledge better optimization system user want optimize user need understand
The fast speed important factor basic design system
User must understand kind processing system bottleneck
System bottleneck cause reason Disk seek need time search data
With latest disk average time usually lower theory time seeking second This time increase slowly new disk difficult single table optimization
The way improve search time distribute data multiple disk
Disk reading writing need read data disc right position
With latest disk single disk delivers throughput least
Â This easier optimize rather search read multiple disk parallel
CPU cycle When data primary memory need process get result
Having small table face limiting factor speed fast compare large table large table use memory space
Memory bandwidth bandwidth primary memory become bottleneck need data fit CPU cache
Although common issue still need aware
MySQL Transactional table work MySQL
MySQL follow following rule make table efficient work All column default value If incorrect range value insert column MySQL report error instead set column best possible value
All calculated expression return value instead present error message MySQL Due implement various part standard SQL SQL server user need write portable database application
It simple achieve portability using insert select
But thorough implementation portability knowledge required
If user want create application work fast several database parallel become difficult
All system weakness including database system
That different design database lead different behavior
In order make complex application achieve portability user need understand SQL server must work together determine feature support server
User use program search type restriction function database server
Although wo check every possible feature still reasonable use
If user intend design database independency user need understand SQL server bottleneck
MySQL fast retrieve update line MYISAM table deal writing reading time table slow performance
In general transactional database system good generating summary table log table row locking become useless case
So case user implement specific feature given database system user also code feature alternative method SQL server
Although alternative method slow performance least allow server perform task
If high performance importance feature web application user create application layer cache output give user higher performance
Users keep refreshing cache let old result expire
This method provide way handle high load spike
Users randomly increase size cache manage higher expiration timeout everything get back normal
MySQL provide application called MySQL Benchmark Suite
This application use tell user operation provide SQL implementation performs good worst
Users get better idea contribute code result referring benchmark suite
Benchmark run single threaded measure performed operation minimum time
There following requirement must exist use benchmark suite Users must download MySQL Benchmark suite provided MySQL source distribution
DBI must installed script MySQL Benchmark written PERL use Perl DBI access database server
MySQL MySQL Server Benchmarking Optimizing SQL Statement The complexity permission setup user use overhead user get
To overcome problem using simpler permission overcome high overhead reducing client run statement
For example permission server need check table content
The following statement mostly use reduce overhead Speed Select Statement To increase speed statement add index possible
Index use reference different table
Range Optimization There optimization
First range access method index another one index
For single part corresponding condition WHERE clause representing index value interval talk range condition interval
For index extension range condition
For index index index line restricted within scope condition one several key tuple interval
A set key tuples define key tuple interval using sorting index
Index merge Optimization method Index Merge merge result one get row several range scan
This method produce union intersection
This method access single table
LIMIT Optimization Normally MySQL perform full table full scan
But LIMIT MySQL end scan found first row sorted result
It efficient
MySQL MYSQL SELECT statement Optimization Indexes Column Indexes All MySQL data type indexed
index column best way improve performance SELECT operation
The maximum index length maximum number index table represent per storage engine
All storage engine support total index length le byte le index table
MySQL Simple Automation Examining Your MySQL Index Usage Indexes Composite index created via MySQL
An index include column
For data type user index prefix column
A index consider sorted array index contains column value connecting create value
The benefit using even user specify value column query also perform fast user specify known quantity column index WHERE clause
MySQL Simple Automation Examining Your MySQL index Usage Index Statistics Collection For optimize index storage engine collect statistic table
Table statistic based value group set row key prefix value
What optimizer concern important statistic average value group size
But usage index become useless average value group size increase better optimization way best index value targeting small number row table
MySQL Simple Automation Examining Your MySQL Index Usage Optimizing Database Structure To nice database structure priority design table minimize space disc possible
This greatly improve performance reduce large number data write read disc
Smaller table always use le primary memory space perform task
It result faster process speed reduction table data
MySQL provide quite lot table type row format
For table type row format user select different indexing method use
By choosing appropriate table format greatly improve performance application system
There technique making data small possible show Use appropriate data type
For example use MEDUIMINT always better use INT MEDIUMINT reduce almost space usage
If possible try declare column NULL
But encourage user use NULL
If really needed use
With NULL increase perform speed save one bit column
For MyISAM table use row format column
It increase performance speed waste space
Try make main index table small possible
It increase identification row faster easier
Create index need
Index good retrieve data bad perform fast storing data
Try avoid create many table database
Too many MYISAM table database cause open close create operation become slow
It make overhead execute operation like SELECT many different table cache become full
It solve increasing number entry permitted table cache
MySQL Cardinality MySQL Data Modeling Optimizing MySQL server After I research various journal internet I found testing optimize MySQL server based Linux MySQL Benchmark introduce last chapter
In linux always choose PGCC compile server
You need memory space compile make function inline need PGCC PGCC require quite lot memory
To optimize MySQL server various way
Way show System Factors Startup Parameter Tuning We start factor earlier made decision higher performance boost achieve
In case long sufficient meet quick look
However always good choice feel upgraded system performance changing factor How MySQL us Memory MyISAM key buffer sharable thread
Key buffer determined variable
Server use buffer needed
Threads use control client connection using space
A base memory share thread
When longer needed thread memory allocated released returned back system unless thread remain thread cache
In case memory still use
To understand way MySQL use memory able optimize usage without waste
Disk Issues Disc seek alway big bottleneck optimization
When amount data begin grow large become obvious
To minimize problem always use low seek time multiple disc seek read write
To increase disk spindle time either symbolic link file striping disc
Using RAID achieve reliability finance adequate
But better option changing RAID level adaptively according critical type data
Some OS architecture support memory page
This kind Large Page Support depending hardware OS architecture
By using Large Page improve performance application manages lot memory access
It help reduced Translation Lookaside Buffer lost
But currently Large Page support Linux
But Linux kernel must support Large Page use configure Huge TBL memory pool
MySQL We discus following writing rule SQL element using MySQL Identifier row column database Reserved word
System variable variable Schema Object Names In MySQL identifier table index database alias view partition stored procedure column
We going discus usage verify identifier
Identifier could referenced
If identifier reserved word special character user refer whenever need use
Identifier Qualifiers MySQL allows name implement one identifier
Part name must period
character separate
As limited impact environment making final interpretation multiple component identified initial part name Identifier Case Sensitivity within MySQL database directory corresponding inside data directory
Each table database corresponds one file depending storage engine within database directory
Therefore underlying operating system play case sensitivity table name database
It mean window responsible table name database case sensitive Unix responsible case sensitive example Mac OS X
Function Name Parsing Resolution MySQL provide native function stored function function
Now learn server understands name declaring identifier function call server know function need call different type function exit given name
Function Name Parsing default rule used parser parsing name function
These rule changed active mode
When parser meet word name function define name whether function call reference refer identifier column table name
b
Function Name Resolution rule function name resolution function function function stored function function stored function
For function create UDF function name function UDF invoked
It parser refer function
For function stored function create stored function name function qualify database name wanted invoke
For function stored function function share namespace name UDF stored function
MySQL Reserved Words In MySQL reserved word DELECT SELECT INSERT using identifier column name table
Exception word qualified name identifier even reserved word also need quote
Identifier name function may use care
For example column name accepted count
However default allow space function following character
This requirement identify name parser used function call aspect
The following table consists reserved word MySQL Variables User refer variable another statement store value variable one statement
This enables user pas value one statement another statement
A variable create one user view another user
The variable release client automatically client online
Example variable using set variable also use statement
For example Value assigned variable limited set data type decimal integer binary string floating point binary NULL actual value decimal value assigned retain accuracy scale
A value type convert allowable type
If variable assigning character string value string characteristic set collation
We use CAST assign bit value number variable As common rule user never assign value variable reading value statement
You may get desired result guaranteed
variable involved calculation order expression uncertain may change statement given based included element
MySQL Data Type Overview MySQL support several type data date time type character string type numeric type
Int chapter I describe data type overview information particular data type numeric date time string
MySQL MySQL A visual quickstart guide
Numeric Date Time String Types Standard SQL numeric data type support MySQL
Types included INTEGER DECIMAL NUMERIC DECIMAL
MySQl also support REAL DOUBLEPERCISION FLOAT
This following table show range integer type MySQL MySQL A visual quickstart guide Types date time DATA DATETIME TIME YEAR TIMESTAM
Each type range legal value example zero value used user specify invalid value cause MySQL could represent
The following table show format zero value type MySQL MySQL A visual quickstart guide String type VARCHAR CHAR VARBINARY BINARY TEXT ENUM SET BLOB
For char varchar similar
The following table describe different type string MySQL MySQL A visual quickstart guide For binary varbinary also similar char varchar
But different char varchar consist binary string
For blob text characteristic large object carry large amount data
Each type
For blob mediumblob blob longblob tinyblob
For text mediumtext longtext tinytext text
For enum list value allowed list create table column specification explicitly chosen value string object
For set string object contain zero value must created fomr specified table allowing value list
Set column value set specified number member separate comma
MySQL SQL statement use expression several point WHERE clause SELECT statement ORDER BY HAVING clause SELECT DELETE UPDATE statement
Operators function stored function function NULL column value literal value use write expression
Operator Function reference The following table show function Operators MySQL Control Flow Function The following table show Flow Control Operator MySQL String numeric date time function The following table show String Function MySQL The following table show date time function MySQL The following table show numeric function MySQL Encryption Compression function Most encryption compression function return string result contain arbitrary byte value
To store result column VARBINARY BLOB needed
The following table show Encryption Compression function MySQL Microsoft Access Database le stable slower database compare MySQL Database
MySQl free use
Create database web application security stability MySQL almost unbeatable
The response time benchmarked mySQL query unparalleled
MySQL database popular always first choice web application rather choosing Microsoft Access Database
Due high security MySQL database harder hack hacker compare Microsoft Access Database
Therefore MySQL suitable Online Banking system online shopping system various different system concern money trading
MySQl also provide several nice free GUI Frontend tool use MySQL database
The nice GUI PHP myAdmin another one MySQL control center also call MySQLCC
MySQLCC easier use intuition use PHP due different people favorite
It fast simple install different type operating system make first choice web developer
How currently using Microsoft Access Database wish change MySQL database
Web develop migrate database table structure data MySQL database
To migration Microsoft Access Database MySQL Database web developer need ODBC Open Database Connectivity tool frequently use open connection application Microsoft Access Database
An interpreter act ODBC transfer table column MySQL database right format MySQL Open Source standard format Microsoft Access Database MySQL Database
Why MySQl Database better Microsoft Access Database
In nowadays business looking database ease use reliable flexibility fast database performance speed importance inexpensive costless
MySQL database provide advantage Microsoft Access Database
MySQL Database one database market need put much investment
All advantage make MySQL Database become best choice web developer rather choosing Microsoft Access Database
By seminar I understand MySQL powerful database management system
It boost dynamically served website heavy traffic frequently visited public
MySQL rely web application web page storing data content read web server develop webpage visitor read dymanically
Once web page visited visitor MySQL database server assembly manufacture service website least one time next reader
So MySQL server performance quality speed importance
If slow reader might get information web site
The performance become critical especially peak overload web host
Optimization become importance feature improve MySQL database system
Therefore Optimize MySQL skill needed
MySQL Database System prove help business save cost
It mainly save cost Total Cost Ownership software license cost reduce downtime system low expenditure hardware support cost web developer administration administration reducing
It hardly make business team choose due advantage
The widely advantage advantage provided MySQL low cost also include ease deploy installation easy administer manage great performance high reliability availability availability embedded library independent platform support various OS Unix window
Finally I want say MySQL Database System best choice matter business financial banking customer service government application web service

You may use hour credit total semester hour long course major course including four year language high school
The computer science major Bachelor Arts designed student would like gain considerable knowledge computer science flexibility choosing elective
Students preparing career computing field encouraged supplement base requirement additional computer science course
The program flexibility make suitable combination major
The Bachelor Science major computer science requires minimum including least
work major
The BS program rigorous BA designed provide training student would like acquire strength math science order enhance skill job prospect
It also appropriate plan pursue graduate work computer science although required graduate study university
BS student complete requirement BA major computer science
They also complete additional mathematics course course computation theory additional computer science elective two technical elective natural science requirement
Work major may taken
All One One One Calculus I Calculus II One Engineering Mathematics III Matrix Algebra Engineering Mathematics IV Differential Equation together used satisfy linear algebra requirement
Bachelor Arts student must earn least

The natural science sequence intended enhance student perspective providing deeper understanding scientific method
Typically consists sequence course taken science department
Students often choose course also fulfill Natural Sciences requirement
Some possible choice listed department chair may approve others
credit may used satisfy part natural science requirement appropriate science department The University Iowa accepts credit equivalent one specific course listed
Introduction Geology MacLean Hall Iowa City IA The University Iowa

The External Specialization involves nine credit hour level
Absolutely CS course allowed
The three course must related
Frequently three course department OR IE Optimization I OR IE Optimization II OR IE Discrete Models
However great strength Cornell multitude interdisciplinary thread cut across departmental boundary
Thus Psychology Concepts Categories Word Meanings Philosophy Philosophy Language Linguistics Representation Structure Vision Language define acceptable Specialization
Not field created equal may challenge finding level course field others
Careful planning creative course selection especially important find field limited offering level
A student specializing Fine Arts example might find two level course offered department qualified take
That student must find third course perhaps one another field fill specialization
Another common example found field neurobiology much junior level work numbered level
Regardless departmental variance level course counted toward External Specialization
Finally mention course used External Specialization technical nature explicit connection CS
It arena wherein tap great intellectual resource University
The major elective course course approved CS major advisor
This elective requirement met multiple course totalling credit one course credit hour
Phys Ed course numbered ROTC course qualify academic credit used toward degree requirement CS
Six credit coursework academic program Cornell
mean justified selection advisor advisor approved selection
It make good sense use elective introductory course may required prerequisite technical elective course course used satisfy Specialization
Phys Ed course numbered ROTC course qualify academic credit used toward degree requirement CS
Up credit advisor approved elective may allowed ROTC course
Fifteen credit hour course outside CS
The course used category used fulfill degree requirement
Note It make good sense use Arts elective qualify course category
For example Psych Psychology Visual Communications Psych prerequisite
Psych could used fulfill credit Arts Electives Psych could used Psych Specialization

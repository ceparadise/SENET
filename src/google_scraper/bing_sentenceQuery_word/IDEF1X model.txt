Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville shown
It perform trillion calculation per second
That ability help run computer model complex dynamic system Earth changing climate
Computers use math data computer instruction create representation event
They also predict happening could happen complex situation climate system spread rumor throughout town
And computer spit result without people wait year take big risk
The scientist build computer model start important feature whatever event hope represent
Those feature may weight football someone kick
Or might degree cloud cover typical region seasonal climate
Features change vary known
Next computer modeler identify rule control feature relationship
The researcher express rule math
The math built model rather simple mostly addition subtraction multiplication logarithm note Jon Lizaso
He work Technical University Madrid Spain
Logarithms express number power number help simplify calculation working big number
Even still much work one person
We talking probably thousand equation explains
mathematical expression use number relate two thing equal
But usually look complicated x z Solving even equation might take whole day rate one equation every second
And single mistake might throw answer way
More difficult math might bump time needed solve equation average minute
At rate solving equation could take nearly three week took time eat sleep
And one mistake might throw everything
In contrast common laptop computer perform billion operation per second
And one second Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory Tennessee trillion calculation
How much trillion
That many second would come million year
A computer model also need algorithm data
set instruction
They tell computer make decision calculation
Data fact statistic something
With calculation computer model make prediction specific situation
For instance might show simulate result particular football player kick
Computer model also deal dynamic situation changing variable
For example likely rain Friday
A weather model would run calculation changing factor one one various combination
After would compare finding run
After adjusting likely factor would issue prediction
The model would also rerun calculation Friday got closer
To measure model reliability scientist might computer run calculation thousand even million time
Researchers also could compare model prediction answer already know
If prediction closely match answer good sign
If researcher must work find missed
It could include enough variable relied much wrong one
Computer modeling deal
Scientists always learning experiment event real world
Researchers use knowledge improve computer model
The better computer model useful become
A group rule procedure solving problem series step
Algorithms used mathematics computer program figuring solution
The weather condition prevailing area general long period
An electronic device process information based rule stored device
A program run computer creates model simulation feature phenomenon event
A set instruction computer us perform analysis computation
The writing instruction known Facts statistic collected together analysis necessarily organized way give meaning
For digital information type stored computer data typically number stored binary code portrayed string zero one
In mathematics statement two quantity equal
In geometry equation often used determine shape curve surface
The power exponent one base number must multiplied produce another number
For instance base system must multiplied produce
So logarithm base system
In base logarithm would would
computing To try imitate condition function appearance something
Computer program referred
mathematics A letter used mathematical expression may take one different value
experiment A factor changed especially one allowed change scientific experiment
For instance measuring much insecticide might take kill fly researcher might change dose age insect exposed
Both dose age would variable experiment
Being almost like something
An object concept virtually real would almost true real quite
The term often used refer something modeled accomplished computer using number using part
So virtual motor would one could seen computer screen tested computer programming device made metal

Manufacturing system complex involve multiple software application containing internal representation manufacturing system form database data file
Each database instantiation data model developed abstract representation environment tool
The model therefore defines application database influenced user application view system
These view influenced product manufacturing system life cycle software used functional area use software detail system modeled
Early attempt integration focused overcoming communication difficulty computer
This paper present framework integrating CIM software application developing unified system view
In effect developing common language tool map representation
Finding common data becomes function identifying data overlap
This view identifies software application contain duplicate possibly inconsistent data
These overlap data characterized formal property used maintain consistency
These formal property establish precedence whether data constraint exact value estimated value
Duplicate data used establish constraint one software system place system
Duplicate data also shared system

The model basic element scientific method
Everything done science done model
A model simplification substitute actually studying trying predict
Models used convenient substitute way recipe convenient aid cooking
This section book dedicated explaining model used
Models common
The ingredient list bottle ketchup model content margarine model butter
A box score baseball game model actual event
A trial automobile accident model actual accident
A history exam model designed test knowledge history
A model substitute also similar represents
Thus ingredient list fairly accurate guide content ketchup bottle
Margarine look spread like butter substitute many recipe
The box score contains critical information baseball game winner final score pitcher
Similarly trial history exam contain essence event model
In fact model common ubiquitous
Nearly everything encounter model
To drive home point list Table several object idea model
Table Everyday Models Cake recipe Process making cake Wedding picture The wedding Chapter title Chapter content News article Chicago Cubs latest loss The game Home video police arresting motorist Police conduct general Road map Madison Wisconsin Paths transit Madison Household budget Household expense income Political candidate campaign promise Candidate performance elected statistical average something close expected Scientific model fundamentally model outside science introduced
Many people think mistakenly scientific model always complicated impenetrable mathematical equation
But truth many scientific model understandable model found outside science
The USDA food pyramid recommends proportion different kind food healthy diet model thousand scientific study undertaken relation among cancer heart disease diet
The figure summarizes study picture recommends healthy diet

As second example scientist use rat determine whether food additive cause cancer rat become model human
Rats convenient relatively easy raise lab least compared human one perform experiment relatively quickly matter month rather year
Moreover people find ethical experiment rat rather human
We heard hypothesis theory especially physic chemistry
Theories usually comprise idea scientist nature work totally sure
Hypotheses theory merely particular kind model refer abstract model
Even rudimentary science course contains grand model scientist discovered
The periodic table element model chemist use predicting property element
Physicists use Newton law predict object interact planet spaceship
In geology continental drift model predicts past position continent
But three model atypical immensely successful
Most model used nowhere near powerful widely useful
But scientist use one anyway
Models used every turn scientific study

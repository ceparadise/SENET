technique imposes interpreter hardware architectural level computer
As microcode layer instruction implement instruction internal sequencing many element
Microcode used well specialized processor hardware
Microcode typically resides special memory translates machine instruction data input sequence detailed operation
It separate machine instruction underlying instruction designed altered freely
It also facilitates building complex instruction reducing complexity computer circuit
Writing microcode often called microcode particular processor implementation sometimes called
More extensive microcoding allows small simple powerful architecture wider relatively simple way achieve software compatibility different product processor family
Some hardware vendor especially use term synonym
In way code within device termed regardless microcode example said microcode updated though typically contain microcode firmware
When compared normal application program element composing microprogram exist lower conceptual level
To avoid confusion element differentiated prefix microinstruction microassembler microprogrammer etc
Engineers normally write microcode design phase processor storing ROM PLA structure combination
However machine also exist microcode stored
This traditionally denoted context computer either
In latter case CPU initialization process load microcode control store another storage medium possibility altering microcode correct bug instruction set implement new machine instruction
Complex digital processor may also employ one possibly order delegate must performed essentially asynchronously parallel
A programmer even programmer normally see change microcode
Unlike machine code often retains among different processor family microcode run exact designed constitutes inherent part particular processor design
Microprograms consist series microinstructions control CPU fundamental level hardware circuitry
For example single typical microinstruction might specify following operation To simultaneously control processor feature one cycle microinstruction often wider bit bit emulator feature
Microprograms carefully designed optimized fastest possible execution slow microprogram would result slow machine instruction degraded performance related application program use instruction
Microcode originally developed simpler method developing control logic computer
Initially CPU
Each step needed fetch decode execute machine instruction including operand address calculation read writes controlled directly rather minimal state machine circuitry
While efficient need powerful instruction set addressing complex operation made processor difficult design debug highly encoded instruction contribute well especially irregular encoding used
Microcode simplified job allowing much processor behaviour programming model defined via microprogram routine rather dedicated circuitry
Even late design process microcode could easily changed whereas CPU design cumbersome change
Thus greatly facilitated CPU design
From late large portion programming done instruction mean greater programmer productivity important advantage microcode relative ease powerful machine instruction defined
The ultimate extension Directly Executable High Level Language design statement language entirely directly executed microcode without compilation
The Fountainhead Processor example
During CPU speed grew quickly memory speed numerous technique used alleviate
machine instruction made possible microcode helped fewer complex machine instruction require le memory bandwidth
For example operation character string done single machine instruction thus avoiding multiple instruction fetch
Architectures instruction set implemented complex microprograms included
The approach increasingly complex instruction set later called
An alternate approach used many use instead combinational logic mainly instruction decoding let simple state machine without much microcode sequencing
The example microprocessor using PLA instruction decode sequencing
The PLA visible photomicrograph chip operation seen simulation
Microprogramming still used modern CPU design
In case microcode debugged simulation logic function substituted control store
Logic function often faster le expensive equivalent microprogram memory
A processor microprograms operate primitive totally different much architecture assembly instruction visible normal programmer
In coordination hardware microcode implement architecture
The underlying hardware need fixed relationship visible architecture
This make easier implement given instruction set architecture wide variety underlying hardware
The IBM architecture register implementation actually use hardware implemented much simpler underlying microarchitecture example data path arithmetic logic unit ALU main memory implemented register special unit data path ALU data path main memory also implemented register special unit core memory
The full data path implement register special unit core memory
The Model Model larger data path implement register faster transistor circuit
In way microprogramming enabled IBM design many model substantially different hardware spanning wide range cost performance making architecturally compatible
This dramatically reduces number unique system software program must written model
A similar approach used Digital Equipment Corporation DEC VAX family computer
As result different VAX processor use different microarchitectures yet architecture change
Microprogramming also reduces cost field change correct defect processor bug often fixed replacing portion microprogram rather change made wiring
In design introduced concept control store way simplify computer design move beyond method
The control store lattice one dimension accepts control time pulse CPU internal clock connects control signal gate circuit
A pulse distributor take pulse generated CPU clock break eight separate time pulse activates different row lattice
When row activated activates control signal connected
Described another way signal transmitted control store played much like roll
That controlled sequence wide word constructed played sequentially
In control store however song short repeated continuously
In enhanced concept adding concept akin computer software
His initial implementation consisted pair matrix first one generated signal manner Whirlwind control store second matrix selected row signal microprogram instruction word speak invoke next cycle
Conditionals implemented providing way single line control store could choose alternative second matrix
This made control signal conditional detected internal signal
Wilkes coined term describe feature distinguish simple control store
Each microinstruction microprogram provides bit control functional element internally compose CPU
The advantage CPU internal CPU control becomes specialized form computer program
Microcode thus transforms complex electronic design challenge control CPU le complex programming challenge
To take advantage CPU divided several part There may also used access main
Together element form
Most modern several execution unit
Even simple computer usually one unit read write memory another execute user code
These element could often brought together single chip
This chip come fixed width would form slice execution unit
These known chip
The family one best known example bit slice element
The part execution unit execution unit interconnected bundle wire called
Programmers develop microprograms using basic software tool
A allows programmer define table bit symbolically
Because close relationship underlying architecture microcode several property make difficult generate using compiler
A program intended execute bit way electronics allows much freedom debug microprogram
After microprogram finalized extensively tested sometimes used input computer program construct logic produce data
This program similar used optimize
No known computer program produce optimal logic even good logic vastly reduce number transistor number required ROM control store
This reduces cost producing electricity consumed CPU
Microcode characterized referring primarily whether microinstruction control CPU element little decoding horizontal microcode requires extensive decoding vertical microcode
Consequently horizontal microinstruction wider contains bit occupies storage space vertical microinstruction
Horizontal microcode several discrete combined single microinstruction simultaneous operation
Horizontal microcode typically contained fairly wide control store uncommon word bit
On tick sequencer clock microcode word read decoded used control functional element make CPU
In typical implementation horizontal microprogram word comprises fairly tightly defined group bit
For example one simple arrangement might For type micromachine implement JUMP instruction address following opcode microcode might require two clock tick
The engineer designing would write microassembler source code looking something like For tick common find portion CPU used remaining group bit microinstruction
With careful design hardware microcode property exploited parallelise operation use different area CPU example case ALU required first tick could potentially used complete earlier arithmetic instruction
In vertical microcode microinstruction significantly encoded bit field generally pas intermediate combinatory logic turn generates actual control sequencing signal internal CPU element ALU register etc
This contrast horizontal microcode bit field either directly produce control sequencing signal minimally encoded
Consequently vertical microcode requires smaller instruction length le storage requires time decode resulting slower CPU clock
Some vertical microcode assembly language simple conventional computer emulating complex computer
Some processor processor CMOS microprocessor later IBM mainframe mainframe term used Alpha processor term used IBM mainframe microprocessor
This form machine code access special register hardware resource available regular machine code used implement instruction function page table walk Alpha processor
Another form vertical microcode two field The selects part CPU controlled word control store
The actually control part CPU
With type microcode designer explicitly chooses make slower CPU save money reducing unused bit control store however reduced complexity may increase CPU clock frequency lessens effect increased number cycle per instruction
As transistor became cheaper horizontal microcode came dominate design CPUs using microcode vertical microcode used le often
When vertical horizontal microcode used horizontal microcode may referred
A computer built using writable microcode
In design rather storing microcode ROM logic microcode stored RAM called
Such computer sometimes called
Many experimental prototype computer use writable control store also commercial machine use writable microcode early workstation Nautilus family number IBM implementation DEC machine
Many machine offer writable control store option including DEC series
The IBM includes facility called invoked console part another processor complex
Some commercial machine example IBM storage writable control store microcode
WCS offer several advantage including ease patching microprogram certain hardware generation faster access ROMs provide
WCS allows user optimize machine specific purpose
Starting several Intel CPUs writable microcode
This example allowed bug Intel microcode fixed patching microprograms rather requiring entire chip replaced
The design trend toward heavily microcoded processor complex instruction began early continued roughly
At point design philosophy started becoming prominent
A CPU us microcode generally take several clock cycle execute single instruction one clock cycle step microprogram instruction
Some processor include instruction take long time execute
Such variation interfere far important modern system
When designing new processor RISC following advantage microcoded CISC There counterpoint well Many RISC processor designed execute every instruction long cache single cycle
This similar way CPUs microcode execute one microinstruction per cycle
VLIW processor instruction behave similarly wide horizontal microcode although typically without control hardware provided microcode
RISC instruction sometimes similar narrow vertical microcode

In pragmatic specifies process input
Directives part may vary compiler compiler
They processed specify compiler behavior function form parameterization
In case directive specify global behavior case affect local section block programming code
In case C program directive optional compiler hint may ignored normally prescriptive must followed
However directive perform action language rather change behavior compiler
This term could used refer proprietary third party tag command markup embedded code result additional executable processing extend existing compiler assembler language construct present development environment
The term directive also applied variety way similar term
In language support simple
Source line handled preprocessor referred
Another C construct directive used instruct compiler use pragmatic feature
Two notable user directive
Syntactic construct similar C preprocessor directive also typically called directive although case may real preprocessing phase involved
All preprocessor command begin hash symbol
Directives date known pragmatic denoted newer language notably C abbreviated pragma
A common use pragmats ALGOL specifying regime meaning keywords indicated
Various directive follow specifying POINT UPPER RES reserved quote regime
Note use stropping keyword abbreviated either POINT quote regime Today directive best known C language early vintage continued current standard either instruction form directive compiler

What us C example
compiler directive
tell compiler something set option take action override default etc
may may apply machine operating system
See info
used something C
pragmatic current context rather ideologically dogmatic
The one I regularly use I trying squeeze memory space embedded solution array structure would otherwise end byte alignment
Pity yet
That would fun I would generally try avoid use pragmas possible since extremely
If want use portable fashion surround every pragma endif pair
GCC discourages use pragmas really support compatibility compiler GCC way thing compiler use pragmas
For example ensure structure packed tightly
padding member MSVC Here thing GCC The GCC code portable want compile compiler Whereas want port MSVC code surround pragma endif pair
Not pretty
Putting top header file ensure included
Note standard supported modern compiler
An alternative use include guard
feel directive want code location specific situation want program counter read specific address ISR written specify ISR location using followd interrupt rotines name description My best advice look compiler documentation pragmas definition
For instance embedded project I used locate code data different section declare interrupt handler

This preprocessor directive used turn certain feature
It two type
allows u specify function called upon program startup
allows u specify function called upon program exit
tell computer suppress warning
Many style used control compiler
To sum tell compiler stuff
Here couple way I use used ignore compiler warning
For example make GCC shut implicit function declaration write An older version
written top header file cause said header file included
pragma support
All answer make nice explanation I wanted add small example I want explain demonstrate us work OpenMp implementation parallel programming say let go example output let tell tell OS run block code thread one little sorry outside sample directive used call function main function call another function main function
Here run run afterwards
NOTE This code work compiler

What scope pragma directive
For example I say header file A included different file B also disable warning inside B
Or I enable warning end file A
It till end translation unit
Informally TU source file include file
The usual pattern example Pragmas specific compiler platform use
So best bet look compiler documentation
For IBM compiler example Many pragma directive specified point within source code compilation unit others must specified directive source code statement
In individual description pragma Usage section describes constraint placement
In general specify pragma directive code source program applies entire compilation unit including header file included
For directive appear anywhere source code applies point specified end compilation unit
You restrict scope pragma application using complementary pair pragma directive around selected section code
For example using pragma option source pragma option nosource directive follows request selected part source code included compiler listing Many pragmas provide pop reset suboptions allow enable disable pragma setting fashion example provided relevant pragma description
Generally pragma effect right declaration matter header come end translation unit
However pragmas affect whole program
For example link pragma add dependency library translation unit user
Yes also disable warning inside B
A translation unit file included file expanded one great big file
That pragma last end translation unit another pragma warning change setting
Or compiler support pragma push pragma pop last next pragma pop
pragma push pragma pop allow create scope
pragma warning within scope apply end scope

What practical value putting filename parameter couple source cpp file
Note clear mud
I asking article link seem recommend
But I understand benefit pch file compilation unit
The answer original question purpose pragma hdrstop file neither set ignored set build configuration build without precompiled header build configuration build WITH precompiled header need change code header included
More detail
The note MSDN say The hdrstop pragma give additional control precompilation file name location compilation state saved
true especially obvious exactly useful
In nutshell
The trick using without optional header file name check radio button leave header edit box blank edit project file
So file possibly called includes header want include precompiled header pragma hdrstop end list include file
This ONE file compiled
You cpp file pragma hdrstop include file precompiled header
These file compiled
This result building example single pch file file using single pch file
The advantage NONE file need include precompiled header building header file whatever
This mean set build configuration build WITHOUT precompiled header pragma hdrstop line simply ignored
This good mean single precomp build configuration let develop quickly change single header NOT force world rebuild normal configuration DO use precompiled header
All code part precompiled header
If filename parameter given name header base name source file extension mentioned The name precompiled header file determined according following rule order precedence The argument compiler option The filename argument pragma hdrstop The base name source file extension So file named produce file named
If using project muse dedicated file source file created
If using file wish create file file useful content line
When firstly compile file compilation option get file file
When You alter file recompile compilation option compiler replaces content befor line file recompile part line create new file saving compilation time
It useful project one source file
For source file using precompile head file landmark compiler part replaced file need indicate header file name compilation option

Hi I new programming PIC MCUs I MCU
I done program working fine
I got code UART Microchips website easily understandable
But I confused I mean config bit used
I little bit google searching found found I really know use
Now let say I would I know I need include
I find good explanation google
Can PIC expert explain
Thanks
These configure setting live section flash memory outside program code
They available soon PIC get power regardless written code
This important sometimes needed program executed
For example setting select clock source convert actual clock PIC
This ca done program code clock must correctly configured code run
Another example code protection setting
If enabled possible read program memory PIC programmer
This discourages others copying program memory code
This ca done program code possible put PIC programming mode program code executes bypassing anything enables code protection
In way essential allow configuration set code executes
Not setting set needed code executes
Some convenience
For example possible use set pin digital analog input startup
This could easily done program code
So setting set
Are still
They special
They compiler directive
Compiler directive start
Compiler directive first thing compiler handle
You know instructs compiler paste file foo right
The compiler interprets time even look C code
This give compiler chance ensure written appropriate location separate program code
About know configs set As know configs exist read list configs get idea
You need know hard need know task working may affected
The configs list question entirely
To understand understand clock generation distribution work
Have look show graph
This selects source clock PLL used convert clock
You may also choosen NOT use PLL
Or another source like secondary oscillator internal oscillator etc
Here select connected primary oscillator pin
usually connect clean signal oscillator module EC connect crystal resonator XT HS
Note resonator need additional circuit provided selected setting
Now initial clock usually want PIC run different frequency
The PLL allows multiply clock frequency certain factor accepts limited input frequency document
So divide frequency passing PLL crystal
let PLL multiply frequency resulting
Divide The output frequency PLL divided get lower intermediate frequency
But divide
So get final frequency PIC run
This look bit weird allows lot input option system frequency
The final frequency used system clock
This look bit weird allows run PIC many different frequency
The system clock divided obtain clock frequency peripheral like UART
I know comment say division code say division My datasheet also show reference clock SPI also note PICs feature
Finally look oscillator section actual PIC setting available

When object atomic mean read written memory atomically
The compiler generate atomic instruction memory barrier accessing object For example following code atomic object misunderstood The compiler allowed Standard generate atomic increment instruction directly increment update memory variable
This code generated compiler As seen atomic increment instruction opcode generated
Like programming language specific instruction required program must written explicitly using machine code insertion
The code snippet equivalent following code code sequence generates exactly object code temporary variable Thus incorrect modify atomic variable time multiple task
For example two task incrementing counter parallel
Even uniprocessor Ada tasking feature like protected object used instead
In multiprocessor depending using various atomic volatile variable task communication surprising consequence
Therefore extreme care taken using atomic object task data sharing synchronization specially multiprocessor
Volatile standard pragma since Ada defined Systems Programming Annex Annex C
This specialized need annex therefore pragma available compiler implementing annex
This pragma portable different architecture operating system
In qualifier equivalent pragma
However C qualifier used volatile atomic data even atomic access required
Therefore interfacing existing C code programmer must read code understand whether data need atomic load store
If needed data marked Ada side pragma pragma Volatile otherwise
In many case volatile object used interfacing hardware device address clause

It language support extremely strong typing explicit concurrency offering task synchronous message passing protected object
Ada improves code safety maintainability using compiler find error favor runtime error
Ada international standard current version known Ada defined
Ada originally designed team led contract DoD supersede programming language used DoD time
Ada named credited first computer programmer
Ada originally targeted system
The Ada revision designed improved support system numerical financial OOP
Features Ada include package synchronous nondeterministic
Ada added support including
The syntax Ada minimizes choice way perform basic operation prefers English keywords else symbol
Ada us basic arithmetical operator avoids using symbol
Code block delimited word declare begin end end case followed identifier block close
In case conditional block avoids could pair wrong nested language like C Java
Ada designed development large software system
Ada package compiled separately
Ada package specification package interface also compiled separately without implementation check consistency
This make possible detect problem early design phase implementation start
A large number check supported help avoid bug would detectable language would require explicit check added source code
For example syntax requires explicitly named closing block prevent error due mismatched end token
The adherence strong typing allows detection many common software error wrong parameter range violation invalid reference mismatched type etc
either otherwise
As concurrency part language specification compiler case detect potential deadlock
Compilers also commonly check misspelled identifier visibility package redundant declaration etc
provide warning useful suggestion fix error
Ada also support check protect access unallocated memory error range violation array access error detectable bug
These check disabled interest runtime efficiency often compiled efficiently
It also includes facility help program verification
For reason Ada widely used critical system might lead serious consequence accidental death injury severe financial loss
Examples system Ada used include railway banking military space technology
Ada dynamic
Ada generic untyped implicitly declare pointer type
Instead dynamic memory allocation deallocation must take place explicitly declared
Each access type associated handle detail memory management programmer either use default storage pool define new one particularly relevant
It even possible declare several different access type designate type use different storage pool
Also language provides compile time run time ensures outlive type object point
Though semantics language allow automatic inaccessible object implementation support default would cause unpredictable behaviour system
Ada support limited form also creative use storage pool provide limited form automatic garbage collection since destroying storage pool also destroys object pool
Ada designed resemble English language syntax resembling denotes comment text
Comments stop end line danger unclosed comment accidentally voiding whole section source code
Prefixing line column skip code clearly denoted column repeated page
There limit nesting comment thereby allowing prior code section even larger section
All character allowed comment symbolic formula E

Ada programming language featuring control structure reserved word
However Ada also many data structuring facility abstraction included original
Such construct part inherited inspired
A common example language This program compiled using freely available open source compiler executing Ada type system based set predefined allows user declare type
This declaration turn based internal representation type describing goal achieved
This allows compiler determine suitable memory size type check violation type definition compile time run time range violation buffer overrun type consistency etc
Ada support numerical type defined range modulo type aggregate type record array enumeration type
Access type define reference instance specified type untyped pointer permitted
Special type provided language task type protected type
For example date might represented Types refined declaring subtypes Types modifier etc
Private type accessed limited type modified copied within scope package defines
Ada add additional feature extension type
Ada language meaning flow control structured standard statement
All standard construct deep level early exit supported use also supported command seldom needed
Among part Ada program package procedure function
Example Package specification Package body This program compiled using freely available open source compiler executing Packages procedure function nest depth also logical outermost block
Each package procedure function declaration constant type variable procedure function package declared order
Ada language support concurrency
The fundamental concurrent unit Ada limited type
Tasks specified two part task declaration defines task interface similar type declaration task body specifies implementation task
Depending implementation Ada task either mapped operating system thread process scheduled internally Ada runtime
Tasks entry synchronisation form
Task entry declared task specification
Each task entry one statement within task body
If control flow task reach accept statement task blocked corresponding entry called another task similarly calling task blocked called task reach corresponding accept statement
Task entry parameter similar procedure allowing task synchronously exchange data
In conjunction statement possible define accept statement similar Dijkstra
Ada also offer
Protected object construct use guard instead conditional variable signaling similar conditional critical region
Protected object combine data encapsulation safe mutual exclusion monitor entry guard conditional critical region
The main advantage classical monitor conditional variable required signaling avoiding potential deadlock due incorrect locking semantics
Like task protected object limited type also declaration part body
A protected object consists encapsulated private data accessed within protected object procedure function entry guaranteed mutually exclusive exception function required side effect free therefore run concurrently function
A task calling protected object blocked another task currently executing inside protected object released task leaf protected object
Blocked task queued protected object ordered time arrival
Protected object entry similar procedure additionally
If guard evaluates false calling task blocked added queue entry another task admitted protected object task currently executing inside protected object
Guards whenever task leaf protected object time evaluation guard changed
Calls entry entry signature
A task requeued blocked added queue target entry mean protected object released allows admission another task
The statement Ada used implement entry call accepts selection entry also guard abort
The following example illustrates concept concurrent programming Ada
A pragma conveys information compiler allow specific manipulation compiled output
Certain pragmas built language

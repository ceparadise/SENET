In ability computer system cope error execution cope erroneous input
Robustness encompass many area computer science
Formal technique essential showing robustness since type testing involves invalid unexpected input
Alternatively used test robustness
Various commercial product perform robustness testing software analysis
In general building robust system encompass every point possible failure difficult vast quantity possible input input combination
Since input input combination would require much time test developer run case exhaustively
Instead developer try generalize case
For example imagine inputting
Some selected input might consist negative number zero positive number
When using number test software way developer generalizes set real three number
This efficient manageable method prone failure
Generalizing test case example one technique deal failure due invalid user input
Systems generally may also fail due reason well disconnecting network
Regardless complex system still handle error encountered gracefully
There many example successful system
Some robust system evolvable easily adapted new situation
Programs software tool focused specific task thus generalized flexible
However observation system demonstrate adaptation environment
One way biological system adapt environment use redundancy
Many organ redundant human
The one example
generally need one kidney second kidney allows room failure
This principle may taken apply software challenge
When applying principle redundancy computer science blindly adding code suggested
Blindly adding code introduces error make system complex render harder understand
Code provide reinforcement already existing code unwanted
The new code must instead posse equivalent function broken another providing function replace
To new code must know accommodate failure point
This mean need added system
But system add logic increase size becomes complex
Thus making redundant system system also becomes complex developer must consider balancing redundancy complexity
Currently computer science practice focus building robust system
Rather tend focus
One main reason focus robustness today hard general way
Robust programming style programming focus handling unexpected termination unexpected action
It requires code handle termination action gracefully displaying accurate unambiguous
These error message allow user easily debug program
When building software programmer assumes user break code
The programmer also assumes written code may fail work incorrectly
The programmer assumes user try incorrect bogus malformed input
As consequence programmer return user unambiguous intuitive error message require looking error code
The error message try accurate possible without misleading user problem fixed ease
Users gain access data structure
This information hidden user user accidentally modify introduce bug code
When correctly built user use without finding loophole modify interface
The interface already correctly implemented user need make modification
The user therefore focus solely code
Very often code modified may introduce possibility impossible case occurs
Impossible case therefore assumed highly unlikely instead
The developer think handle case highly unlikely implement handling accordingly
Robust machine learning typically refers robustness machine learning algorithm
For machine learning algorithm considered robust either testing error consistent training error performance stable adding noise dataset
Robust network design study network design face variable uncertain demand
In sense robustness network design broad like robustness software design vast possibility change input

Then considers one currently definition might appropriate robustness web design Failure Modes Effects Analysis identify measure robustness web system based Jacobson analysis method model component web design system
Keywords Robustness Jacobson analysis web design Failure Modes Effects Analysis FMEA
Introduction Along information technology especially rapid development computer technology tremendous change network era brought website emerged
Meanwhile many reason may lead web site work
Systemically make difficult check problem
However web site designed use measure analysis variety problem may lead crash web site important
Not improve robustness web site also ability cope unexpected situation order make web site stable robust
In computer science clear definition robustness easy given especially noted reliability
But ability deal error execution system
It regarded measurement criterion apart basic property safety stability functionality robustness overall web site also important
In process web design robustness measure discussed order enhance overall web site word still could keep stable execution component web site work unexpected circumstance

Main Part What robustness
There explanation robustness need discussed first
When word used computer science advert computer application show usual condition also uncommon condition emphasis expectation designer
Productions made computer web site typically buggy
include error fragile therefore robust
It difficult programmer find fix error
Second one elegant way distinguish reliability robustness way look type error
From perspective web design reliability problem often caused internal error website component
Robustness problem often caused external error unexpected input
After making clear two concept feature error robustness developed corresponding measure
Definitions measure robustness The success criterion case system crash hang robust
Fuzz testing Fuzz testing simple technology effect quality code
In fuzz testing generates bad data randomly attack application programmer observes break
The technique fuzz testing illogical automatic test speculate data lead damaged like manual testing
Instead test clutter application data deeply much possible
The result maybe lead programmer shock logical thinking person would think kind error
It simple announce important bug application
How work
Realization fuzz testing simple process

Prepare correct file insert program

Generate random data replace part file

Observe break
Disadvantages First generally fuzz testing find simple error
Second bug found severe sometimes fuzz testing popular world real attacker use tool develop destructive program
Third randomly input catch boundary value condition difficult
Ballista Ballista approach make operating system crash get exceptional parameter parameter used system call make software get irregular termination instead denoting error gracefully
It box testing
The goal Ballista test robustness existing component
The result apply class wide range software component
But generally best situation work module take input parameter list
How work
Ballista approach start bombard application module combination exceptional unexceptional input value
The response system measured operating system failure task task
OS failure generally form machine reboot detected watchdog timer detected inspecting irregular termination child process
Ballista us list test case run large number input
Disadvantage Ballista successful testing approach often used operating system web design
It also need specific drive workload call kernel function
Therefore easy expanded
Another disadvantage Ballista difficult generate test case valid invalid test data must generated input generator
JCrasher JCrasher approach test robustness Java program
It inspects type java class construct code fragment create instance different type test public method random test data
It used examine bug caused program program crash throw undeclared runtime exception
It require regulation except offline testing case caused crash
Disadvantage The rewrite class could exist separate compile phase instead load time
It disadvantage JCrasher support dynamic loading
FMEA Failure mode effect analysis Failure mode effect analysis FMEA procedure analysis potential failure mode within system classification severity likelihood failure
It developed three main phase severity occurrence detection
They determined grade robustness system
Before starting use EMEA important work need done first confirms robustness included analysis
Advantages
Analysis improves safety reliability robustness product

Reduces potential robustness concern

Detects identifies eliminates potential problem early
New idea web design Robustness concern unexpected domain
To improve robustness measure taken either enlarge scope specification make sure stability system unexpected situation
FMEA might appropriate measuring robustness web design
Because used robustness analysis specification web design result outlined therefore designer clearly understand problem find corresponding solution
On hand fuzz testing JCrasher widely used large software development programming language web design JSP Java service page JCrasher used measuring robustness java part web developing
Ballista normally strongly used operating system
The robustness web site important
Because web system assessed HTTP protocol difficult control input user
The web system must tolerance unexpected error user input
Preparatory work Before applying FMEA two essential work needed
First model robustness component web design
Second design worksheet
Model robustness component One best case diagram method Jacobson analysis
To design robust web model process web system develop code important
Here used analysis formed web product diagram robustness diagram design
The diagram combined class diagram activity diagram
The part gap robustness diagram
There several feature
It used help developer ensure correctness use case
It used ensure use case contain necessary branch process thereby providing correctness check
It used reduce gap analysis design ultimately complete preliminary design
The Jacobson use case diagram us three stereotype element
Entity object usually real world class domain model

Boundary object used interactive user system
Normally contains frame diagonal menu typically screen web page

Control object used connect boundary object boundary object
Boundary object entity object noun object controller verb action
And four interactive rule three stereotype element design robustness diagram

Nouns connect verb vice versa
Nouns connect noun

Verbs connect verb
According rule component web design designed robustness diagram
For example component web design web login system developer draw diagram analysis working processing existing component system
Generally hard find page login page boundary object according analysis text use case
And system provides input checking branch process thus controller object
System display error message therefore another controller object
System search database find information form user information form information entity object user information controller object
Finally robustness case shown
Once developer finished robustness analysis need Preliminary Design Review
The session Preliminary Design Review help developer ensure robustness diagram domain model use case text match
After robustness analysis developer could continue next step detailed design writing code
Design worksheet When robustness diagram analysis developer could create worksheet continue analysis measure worksheet contains important information system
All item function worksheet listed logical manner
The purpose FMEA explore possible failure mode control object model external operating environment
user input likelihood detection possibility severity impact robustness requirement web system
It also used control object
Results usually introduced specially designed worksheet
Example FMEA Worksheet login part Control object Failure mode System Effect S Severity rating Possible Cause O occurrence rating D detection rating CRIT critical characteristic RPN risk priority number Recommended action Login control No response produced Fail respond user interaction
Prevent use system
Error user database contains data N Control user input prevent serious error object
Understand parameter table
Severity rating crash effect stand risk stand critical
occurrence rating similarly range based web design specification detection rating value mean ability detect failure
risk priority Numbers calculated formula RPN S x O x The highest severity failure mode might necessarily treated firstly rather highest RPN treated
RPN regarded metric robustness system robustness improved developer solve highest RPN
There several goal achieved
Classify robustness critical element part application logic easy failure crash external error abnormal situation

Rank priority possible reason cause failure robustness

Establish prevention measure either eliminate possible cause reduce effect web robustness

Conclusion Seldom method analysis measure robustness web design
FMEA could establish requirement minimize possibility failure order improve robustness web system
And measure component web system might fail failure affect system function
But cost much time analysis web product component web product need analysis
But ensures potential error affect whole web system
Although method based basis practical application often apply real development process
The mathematical evaluation system robustness could make result clear
FMEA used process web design formed web product
For large web product development FMEA might appropriate measure analysis product

In priority assignment algorithm used RTOS scheduling class
The static priority assigned according cycle duration job shorter cycle duration result higher job priority
These operating system generally deterministic guarantee regard response time
Rate monotonic analysis used conjunction system provide scheduling guarantee particular application
A simple version analysis assumes thread following property It mathematical model contains calculated simulation period closed system scheduler fail meet scheduling need otherwise
Rate monotonic scheduling look run modeling thread system determines much time needed meet guarantee set thread question
proved set periodic task unique period feasible schedule always meet deadline exists utilization specific bound depending number task
The schedulability test RMS computation time release period deadline one period later number process scheduled
For example two process
When number process tends towards expression tend towards Therefore rough estimate RMS meet deadline CPU utilization le
The CPU dedicated non task
It known randomly generated periodic task system meet deadline utilization le however fact depends knowing exact task statistic period deadline guaranteed task set
The hyperbolic bound tighter sufficient condition schedulability one presented Liu Layland CPU utilization task
The priority assignment meaning scheduling algorithm meet deadline algorithm
The algorithm also optimal equal period deadline fact case algorithm identical addition deadline monotonic scheduling optimal deadline le period
For task model deadline greater period Audsley algorithm endowed exact schedulability test model find optimal priority assignment
In many practical application resource shared unmodified subject hazard
In practice solved disabling preemption
Alternative method use avoid sharing across thread different priority
This resource conflict result first place
Priority inheritance algorithm characterized two parameter
First inheritance lazy essential immediate boost priority conflict
Second inheritance optimistic boost minimum amount pessimistic boost minimum amount In practice mathematical difference term system utilization bound lazy immediate algorithm immediate algorithm efficient implement one used practical system
An example usage basic priority inheritance related reset bug fixed Mars changing creation flag semaphore enable priority inheritance
The utilization The sufficient condition process conclude system schedulable Since system surely schedulable
But remember condition necessary one
So say system higher utilization schedulable scheduling algorithm

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue
rate monotonic available

learn share knowledge build career
I reading AI textbook I curious difference monotonicity admissibility heuristic I know mutually exclusive
As far I tell admissible heuristic simply mean ensured get shortest path solution one exists
What I struggling concept monotonic property
Can someone describe way I might understand
Similarly I determine given heuristic
One example given book Sliding Puzzle
One heuristic I considering place tile intuitively I say I know admissible I formal way showing
say The second solution ensure optimal path repeated state always first one followed case search
This property hold impose extra requirement namely requirement also called
When talking function monotone mean function increase decrease
In word ordering range stay throughout domain
For reason problem solution maintains shortest path matter step start
The property heuristic mean page
Admissibility A search algorithm admissible guaranteed find minimal path solution whenever solution exists
Breadth first search admissible look every state level n considering state level
Monotonicity This property asks algorithm locally admissible always underestimate cost two state search space
Recall require g n n
A heuristic function h monotone state ni nj nj descendant ni h ni h nj cost ni nj
heuristic evaluation goal state h Goal agent may learn knowledge contradicts already know
For example may replace statement negation
Thus knowledge base may grow new fact monotonic fashion
The advantage monotonic learning simplified choice learning strategy agent may learn knowledge contradicts already know
So may replace old knowledge new belief sufficient reason
The advantage learning applicability real domain freedom order thing learned A related property consistency knowledge
If architecture must maintain consistent knowledge base learning strategy us must monotonic

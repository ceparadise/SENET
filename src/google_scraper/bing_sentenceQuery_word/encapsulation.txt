In used refer one two related distinct notion sometimes combination thereof Some programming language researcher academic use first meaning alone combination second distinguishing feature programming language provide view encapsulation feature language object orientation
The second definition motivated fact many OOP language hiding component automatic overridden thus defined separate notion prefer second definition
The feature encapsulation supported using class programming language although alternative also exist
Encapsulation OOP
It refers bundling data method operate data
Encapsulation preventing unauthorized party direct access
Publicly accessible method generally provided class access value client class call method retrieve modify value within object
This mechanism unique programming
Implementations
offer similar form encapsulation
This similarity stem fact notion rely mathematical fundamental
Under definition encapsulation mean internal representation generally hidden view outside object definition
Typically object method directly inspect manipulate field
Some language like allow access via object method others
offer programmer degree control hidden typically via keywords like
It noted ISO standard refers hide information
Information hiding accomplished furnishing compiled version source code interfaced via header file
Hiding internals object protects integrity preventing user setting internal data component invalid inconsistent state
A supposed benefit encapsulation reduce system complexity thus increase allowing developer limit software component
Almost always way override protection usually via API Ruby Java C etc
sometimes mechanism like special keyword usage like
Below example show access data field restricted use keyword Below example Java Below example PHP Encapsulation also possible language
In C example structure declared public API header file set function operate item data containing data member accessible client API Clients call API function allocate operate deallocate object
The content type known accessible implementation API function client directly access content
The source code function defines actual content structure The author Design Patterns discus tension inheritance encapsulation length state experience designer overuse inheritance
The danger stated follows Because inheritance expose subclass detail parent implementation often said inheritance break encapsulation

My good friend Sam Stokes introduction Encapsulation long ago
Not I competitive mind I thought I could better
And since I vacation time think write I given try
I let judge I succeed
So
Encapsulation important part object oriented programming
It part make OOP safer easy use
Briefly stated Encapsulation hiding implementation detail class
Specifically include data storage private data create method interact data
The implementation method visible programmer us class
Nor internal representation data
Everything software capsule black box work
One fun example die class Die singular dice case
Nothing first person shooter action Of several benefit encapsulation data directly manipulated code object way method work changed without negative impact code us
Let take look code first part simple Die class This example Visual Basic concept programming language In example allow user get change protected fashion face value Die
The property FaceValue read want user code changing value choosing
In fact way change value call Roll us random value theoretically least outside user control
The ToString method likewise way get face value
In example way retrieve number side Die fixing would probably good edition
Like FaceValue would done Property
In example could substitute algorithm changing face value Die wanted long returned Integer value within range expected user code
While probably going write random number routine could would require change code used Class
In application able change algorithm used method without change code us could valuable option
It would allow u test various algorithm performance accuracy value quickly easily
In payroll program could make change calculation bonus overtime number thing within single class without negative impact program used class
That big win ease testing debugging
It made possible encapsulation

In programming process combining element create new entity
For example type encapsulation combine series computer instruction
Likewise complex relies encapsulation
rely heavily encapsulation create
Encapsulation closely related

What instance
Instances actual object built accordance quality class
What abstract data type
A set object operation object
What encapsulation
Encapsulation mean name variable method stored location accessed called namespaces
What data hiding
Data hiding make data invisible user object requiring accessed via object method
What function subclass use
Subclasses use function superclass
They also use function defined within subclass however subclass us name function also used superclass use subclass definition function

Encapsulation programming process combining element create new entity purpose hiding protecting information
In programming encapsulation attribute design
It mean object data contained hidden object access restricted member class
quite strict allow differing level access object data
support encapsulation data hiding type called class
A class combine data function single unit
The method hiding detail class called abstraction
Classes contain private protected public member
Although item class private default programmer change access level needed
Three level access available C additional two
They The main advantage using encapsulation security data
Benefits encapsulation include For best encapsulation data almost always restricted private protected
If choose set access level public make sure understand ramification choice
There error

A change request important document part change management process state data reason change application system
A change request declarative document meaning clear concise information need achieved change implemented well related information
Change management creates set standard rule need followed change request document
For every major change respect scope project change request must completed
Sometimes certain change management allows minor change carried without requirement change request document
In organization change request document mostly follows standard template created change management
This ensures streamlined standard process change request document respect information filled
Change request minimum need approved concerned change control supervisor designated charge change request approval
Change request initiated internally example case software hardware upgrade
However change request mostly initiated user case identification defect bug problem management event patch development application system modification standard application need senior management
Once change request created necessary step need undertaken per process defined change control ensure request completed satisfied according requirement change initiator
All information related change request must documented clearly concisely

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
As requested single question There big time complexity difference I also interested
Conversion done faster radix even done parallel every digit group decoded independently rest
For example binary number converted hexadecimal nibble nibble vice versa
every parsed bit independently rest conversion decimal radix easy digit affect
I seen time complexity math operation also related question saying time complexity conversion arbitrary digit length O M n log n I interested general time complexity bound base conversion I would like know big difference time complexity conversion v base conversion
It could general fact conversion done faster done number base power among base base
Is known proof material around
Conversion base base done reading original number chunk length lcm k l converting chunk lcm l k digit new base
For b k l linear time
There algorithm base conversion time O M n n M n time take multiply two n number n length number digit two base fixed
See example page Brent
The question asking fixed written form whether exists linear time algorithm converting base base
One possible approach show impossible might reducing multiplication equivalent operation division base conversion clear fact possible build reduction
I believe question asked literature
To make conversion natural number Representation A base n digit Representation B base digit As number A B Representations forced length filling zero shorter
That method solving conversion complexity base conversion related solving equation either unknown variable depending base conversion
On hand case power related base equation get simpler taking common factor So zero name constant Solving product division constant factor Q every So comparing second one clearly simpler
To speed technique moment I found reduce operation solving polynomial
This I found answer By posting answer agree

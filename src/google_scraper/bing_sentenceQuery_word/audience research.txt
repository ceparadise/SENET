This page index page describing current research computer science
It intended improve communication different prevent researcher unnecessarily duplicating work
The early section page contain resource span area computer science
At end collection pointer specialized resource individual
Please send suggestion improving page Margaret Fleck mfleck
These page central collection point list researcher research group data software technical information list relevant professional society sundry resource
Ideally page specialized need computer science researcher page
The ideal page cover entire coherent research area focus one several rival research group theory professional society
It attempt merge together research area become distinct longer function unit
Professional society SIG TC home page listed satisfy requirement
This likely case research area served precisely one professional organization organization primary mandate distribution scientific information
When seems central collection point research area page containing partial information
list active researcher society page included
If general umbrella page created research area direct pointer constituent page deleted
In case multiple page research area offer different perspective area contain different type information
A certain amount competition healthy
On hand extensive duplication waste everyone time
Since central organization computer science disjointed good organization within subfield essential

Glasgow Interactive Systems Group GIST Department Computer Science Glasgow University Glasgow
Tel Fax EMail This paper argues expanding scope science make difficult sustain traditional scientific engineering model research
In particular recent work formal method abandoned traditional empirical method
Similarly research requirement engineering human computer interaction challenged proponent formal method
These tension stem fact Science misnoma
Topics currently considered part discipline computing science technology rather theory driven
This creates problem academic department impose scientific criterion assessment PhDs
It therefore important people ask Research Computing Science starting higher degree
This paper intended high level introduction first year research student student advanced MSc course
It read conjunction research skill computing science
Good research practice suggests begin defining term
The Oxford Concise dictionary defines research However many reason approach unsatisfactory model research
The main objection carry high risk
For example artefact may fail long learn anything conclusion seeking support
Indeed often case approach ignores formation clear hypothesis conclusion artefact built
This may lead artefact become important researcher idea intended establish
The lack clear hypothesis need barrier might seem
The proof demonstration approach much common current engineering practice
Iterative refinement used move implementation gradually towards desired solution
The evidence elicited previous failed attempt used better define goal research work progress
The key problem iterative development artefact turn requires method structure
Engineers need carefully plan way fault found one iteration fed back subsequent development
This typically done testing technique based upon model scientific argument
This close relationship engineering scientific method surprising There many problem standard approach scientific empiricism applied computing science
The principle objection many aspect computing defy use probabilistic measure analysing result empirical test
For example many statistical measure rely upon independence test hypothesis
Such technique clearly used attempting measure performance system attempt optimise performance time rule load balancing algorithm etc
Secondly difficult impose standard experimental condition upon product computer science
For example program behaves one way one set operating condition guarantee behave way another set condition
These condition might go level alpha particle hitting memory chip
Thirdly difficult generalise result tightly controlled empirical experiment
For example user find system easy use evaluation guarantee another user able use product amidst distraction everyday working environment
Finally difficult determine sufficient number trial conducted support many hypothesis
For example attempt prove program always satisfies property almost certainly doomed failure using standard experimental technique The number potential execution path even simple code make impossible test property every possible execution path
The field mathematical reasoning research area right
It however possible identify two different approach use formal proof research technique computing science The first incredible care need made interpretation result mathematical proof
Formal method nothing system argumentation mistake expected
Problems arise mistake difficult detect given complex nature mathematics often used
Recall central feature empirical approach open peer review used check method correct
The second problem formal reasoning scope limited
Interactive time critical system pose specially challenge application mathematics
These issue addressed many problem remain
The third problem relates cost applying formal technique
It take long time acquire necessary skill
Similarly take several month conduct relatively simple proof medium large scale application
Finally argued inadequate discussion failure formal method
Again important recall failure prove hypothesis valuable result empirical technique
Exaggerated claim made formal reasoning typically researcher many claim falsified
As result error application mathematical reasoning seen source shame rather learning opportunity one colleague peer

The last decade I supervised significant amount PhD student served numerous PhD committee reviewed countless number paper
During occasion I always best give constructive remark lot young someteimes even young researcher acknowledged indeed help becoming better researcher
However year I got nagging feeling I often repeating sometimes wondering whether I sounding like old grumpy grandfather instead active enthusiastic researcher
Worse I often giving tidbit advice noticed overall picture speak lacking
My advice sometimes misunderstood neglected otherwise ignored I often wondered I could nail
During sabbatacil leave University Zürich August January research group I finally presented opportunity develop reference framework
I awfull lot reading several brainstorm end created tutorial entitled Research method Computer Science
This collect material related resource regarding tutorial
Below find recent copy slide used tutorial
This version presented Conference
This tutorial explores role research method computer science drawing upon practical example empirical approach software engineering
After tutorial participant able
This tutorial aimed PhD student want improve research skill
In particular concerned The tutorial Research Methods Computer Science concrete result sabbatical leave University Züurich research group SEAL
Below short chronological overview tutorial evolved current incarnation
After incarnation tutorial I hold little questionnaire among participant
Below analysis response

In ADT whose instance collection object
In word store object organized way follows specific access rule
The size container depends number object element contains
Underlying inherited implementation various container type may vary size complexity provide flexibility choosing right implementation given scenario
Containers characterized following three property Container class expected implement method following Containers sometimes implemented conjunction
Containers may classified either
container store object independently
Objects may accessed directly
An associative container us map dictionary composed pair key appears container
The key used find value object stored container
used programming language class template
also use container special group widget
Apart graphical property type behavior container class keep list child allow adding removing retrieving among child

Point clarification Docker based container fact around Linux Containers sometimes called LXC
Linux container virtualization higher level operating system
In short operating system virtualized mean allowing u optimize overall usage computing resource
Dedicated hardware case sat largely idle every day occasional usage spike peaked use
As result run many virtualized operating system one physical host
Now year line still dealing need pull existing infrastructure spend
Containers virtualize application process way eliminates lot associated full OS stack file kernel dependency driver etc
needed support single application process
Containers JUST install needed support application process pas rest underlying host
Docker put wrapper around whole thing make much easier user friendly manage I oversimplifying certainly largely correct
In order get knowledge container look back history firstly I would suggest go Containers step ahead Virtualization
The process running multiple isolated component sharing host machine kernel utilizing UFS Cgroups Namespaces called kind virtualization software level OS virtualization mostly done hardware level resulting virtual machine OS Kernel
Docker company provides Docker resposible creating container host machine

I little confused difference container collection
I read Wikipedia I
Collections Stores variable number object
Ex
list set
Containers DataStructures
Ex
dequeue
But I thought collection like list tree etc data structure container
Also Data structure implement container include array list map queue set stack table tree vector
Java really use term container except context AWT GUI component represents GUI component contain component
used Java data structure contain object describe
Computer science general tends treat le
take read article good understand Container Collection concept
The ISO standard really establish clear distinction
It provide formal definition container Containers object store object
yet provides formal definition us term bit generally
It describes tuple example object even though definition also
Collections Stores variable number object
Ex
list set
Containers DataStructures
Ex
dequeue
But I thought collection like list tree etc data structure container
Also As far I see standard specify anything contrary collection container
They also happen data structure structure general computer science term kind aggregate organizes data way
With find useful distinction concept original STL conceived Stephanov defined
A Sequence Container whose element arranged strict linear order
It support insertion removal element
The describes container like
A Sorted Associative Container type Associative Container
Sorted Associative Containers use ordering relation key two key considered equivalent neither one le
If ordering relation string comparison example key abcde aBcDe equivalent
The describes container like
A Pair Associative Container Associative Container associate key object
The value type Pair Associative Container pair
The describes container like
As reading subject respect slight semantic difference The difference taste substance feeling I listening two terminology This clearly subjective considering container implemented value semantics Java colloection behave polymorphism object Java variable technically autodereferenced pointer probably due semantics
A container polymorphic value homomorphic pointer polymorphic value choose container want concretize strict java correspondence

I currently studying Abstract Data Types ADT I get concept
Can someone please explain actually
Also collection bag List ADT
simple term
Abstract Data Type ADT data type behavior defined implementation
Opposite ADT Concrete Data Type CDT contains implementation ADT
ADTs
Each ADTs many implementation
CDT
Container ADT ADTs
Book Abstract Telephone Book implementation The Wikipedia article lot say
In computer science abstract data type ADT mathematical model certain class data structure similar behavior certain data type one programming language similar semantics
An abstract data type defined indirectly operation may performed mathematical constraint effect possibly cost operation
In slightly concrete term take Java interface example
The interface explicitly define behavior concrete class
The interface defines set method class
must implement order considered
A another abstract data type
In case Java interface even abstract since The interface place additional stipulation beyond specified interface contract method
A also known
In mathematics notion multiset bag generalization notion set member allowed appear
For example unique set contains element b others many multisets property multiset contains two copy one b multiset contains three copy b
In Java Bag would collection implement simple interface
You need able add item bag check size iterate item contains
See example implementation Sedgewick Wayne
A truly abstract data type describes property instance without commitment representation particular operation
For example abstract mathematical type Integer discrete unlimited linearly ordered set instance
A concrete type give specific representation instance implement specific set operation
ADT set data value associated operation precisely independent paticular implementaition
The strength ADT implementaion hidden interface declared mean ADT various way Simply Abstract Data Type nothing set operation set data used storing data efficiently machine
There need perticular type declaration
It require implementation ADT
Abstract Data type mathematical module includes data various operation
Implementation detail hidden called abstract
Abstraction allowed organise complexity task focusing logical property data action
In programming language type data associated operation
An ADT user defined data aggregate operation data characterized data operation represented list declared single syntactic unit relevant operation visible user ADT ADT way normal data type programming language
It abstraction internal representation data implementation operation concern ADT user
An abstract data type could defined mathematical model collection operation defined
A simple example set integer together operation union intersection defined set
The generalization primitive data type integer char etc encapsulate data type sense definition type operation type localized one section program
They treated primitive data type outside section operation defined
An implementation translation statement programming language declaration defines variable plus procedure language operation
The implementation ADT chooses data structure represent
A useful tool specifying logical property data type abstract data type
Fundamentally data type collection value set operation value
That collection operation form mathematical construct may implemented using particular hardware software data structure
The term refers basic mathematical concept defines data type
In defining abstract data type mathamatical concept concerned space time efficinecy
Those implementation issue
Infact defination concerned implementaion detail
It may even possible implement particular particular piece hardware using particular software system
For example already seen integer universally implementable
To illustrate concept specification method consider corresponds mathematical concept rational number
A rational number number expressed quotient two integer
The operation rational number define creation rational number two integer addition multiplication testing equality
The following initial specification
An consists two part The value definition defines collection value ADT consists two part For example value definition RATIONAL state RATIONAL value consists two integer second equal
The keyword abstract typedef introduces value definition keyword condition used specify condition newly defined data type
In definition condition specifies denominator may
The definition clause required condition may necessary every
Each operator defined abstract junction three part
For example operator definition ADT RATIONAL includes operation creation makerational addition add multiplication mult well test equality equal
Let u consider specification multiplication first since simplest
It contains header
The header definition first two line like C function header
The keyword abstract indicates C function ADT operator definition
The specifies operation
In name function case mult used denote result operation
Thus mult represents numerator result mult represents denominator result
That specifies condition become true operation executed
In example specifies neumerator result rational multiplication equal integer product numerator two input denominator equal th einteger product two denominator
InÂ computer science aÂ listÂ orÂ sequenceÂ anÂ abstract data typeÂ represents countable number orderedÂ value value may occur
An instance list computer representation theÂ mathematicalÂ concept finiteÂ sequence potentially infinite analog list aÂ Lists basic example ofÂ container contain value
If value occurs multiple time occurrence considered distinct item The name list also used several concrete data structure used implement abstract list especially linked list
Image List A bag collection object keep adding object bag remove added bag
So bag data structure collect object iterate
You bag normally program Java
Image Bag A collection Java sense refers class implement Collection interface
A collection generic sense group object
Image collection Before defining let u considers different view data type
We know default primitive data type int float etc
support basic operation addition subtraction
The system provides implementation primitive data type
For data type also need define operation
The implementation operation done want actually use
That mean general data type defined along operation
To simplify process solving problem combine data structure operation call
ADT
Commonly used include Linked List Stacks Queues Binary Tree Dictionaries Disjoint Sets Union find Hash Tables many others
consist two type To solve problem combine data structure operation
An ADT consists two part Commonly used ADT Linked Lists Stacks Queues Priority Queues Trees etc
While defining ADTs need worry implementation detals
They come picture want use
like user defined data type perform function without knowing inside datatype operation performed
As information exposed abstracted
eg
List Array Stack Queue
On Stack perform function like Push Pop sure implemented behind curtain
ADT set object operation definition mention set operation implemented
Programmers use collection need know instantiate access data manner without concern detail collection implementation
In word perspective collection abstraction reason computer science collection referred abstract data type ADTs
The user concern learning interface set operation performs By posting answer agree

There history CS run one operating system top another
VirtualBox VMware emulated
That allows control application environment playing virtual OS provisioned make application immune change parent OS
running Windows Windows get old application run
Since running entire OS get environment right single application pretty inefficient slow set use instead
The application provides controlled environment application look like OS application really API layer OS running container
A container part memory virtually separated rest system miniature version parent operating system operating system system support
similar file system pretty much everything give feel like entire new tiny system within system
Inside container whatever program install modification wo affect outer system
Also form image simply take system use inside system
So save effort going entire process development
So kind equivalent virtualization except actually virtualizing reserving part memory similar functionality
A data structure store data item simple like integer complex like phone book entry even complex like full medical record person way care much data item stored
The data item also called element constraint representation
Examples vector queue list map hash map
There others

In enables programmer traverse particularly
Various type iterators often provided via container
Though interface semantics given iterator fixed iterators often implemented term structure underlying container implementation often tightly coupled container enable operational semantics iterator
Note iterator performs traversal also give access data element container perform without significant liberty taken concept trivial use terminology
An iterator behaviorally similar
Iterators date programming language
Internal iterators often taking implementing traversal across container applying given function every element turn
An external iterator may thought type two primary operation referencing one particular element object collection called modifying point next element called
There must also way create iterator point first element well way determine iterator exhausted element container
Depending language intended use iterators may also provide additional operation exhibit different behavior
The primary purpose iterator allow user process every element container isolating user internal structure container
This allows container store element manner wish allowing user treat simple sequence list
An iterator class usually designed tight coordination corresponding container class
Usually container provides method creating iterators
Note sometimes also referred loop iterator
A however provides traversal functionality element access functionality
One way implementing iterators use restricted form known
By contrast generator coroutine value caller multiple time instead returning
Most iterators naturally expressible generator generator preserve local state invocation particularly complicated stateful iterators
There subtle difference distinction use term generator iterator vary author language
In generator iterator function return iterator
An example Python generator returning iterator using Python statement follows Some language later version later version later version provide way iterating element container object without introduction explicit iterator object
An actual iterator object may exist reality exposed within source code language
Implicit iterators often manifested statement equivalent following Python example In Python iterable object converted iterator iterated loop done implicitly
Or time may created collection object Ruby example This iteration style sometimes called internal iteration code fully executes within context iterable object control aspect iteration programmer provides operation execute step using
Languages support similar construct may also make use implicit iterators construction result list Python Sometimes implicit hidden nature partial
The language function template implicit iteration
These function still require explicit iterator object initial input subsequent iteration expose iterator object user
Iterators useful abstraction provide potentially infinite iterable necessarily indexable object
Several language Perl Python implement stream iterators
Alternative implementation stream include language
In procedural language common use subscript operator loop element sequence array
Although indexing may also used container use iterators may advantage The ability container modified iterating element become necessary modern programming interrelationship object effect operation may obvious
By using iterator one isolated sort consequence
This assertion must however taken grain salt often efficiency reason iterator implementation tightly bound container preclude modification underlying container without invalidating
For container may move around data memory way invalidate iterator container somehow keep track currently alive iterators update fly
Since number iterators given time may arbitrarily large comparison size tied container updating drastically impair complexity guarantee container operation
An alternative way keep number update bound relatively container size would use kind handle mechanism collection indirect pointer container element must updated container let iterators point handle instead directly data element
But approach negatively impact iterator performance since must effectuate double pointer following access actual data element
This usually desirable many algorithm using iterators invoke iterators data access operation often advance method
It therefore especially important iterators efficient data access
All always security iterators remain always valid efficiency
Most time added security worth efficiency price pay
Using alternative container example singly linked list instead vector would better choice globally efficient stability iterators needed
Iterators categorised according functionality
Here list iterator category Different language library used language define iterator type
Some Iterators called enumerator represented interface
provides method advance next element indicates whether end collection reached property obtain value element currently pointed optional method rewind enumerator back initial position
The enumerator initially point special value first element call required begin iterating
Enumerators typically obtained calling method object implementing interface
Container class typically implement interface
However statement operate object providing method even implement
Both interface expanded version
The following show simple use iterators C C also support method declared returning us statement produce sequence element instead returning object instance transformed compiler new class implementing appropriate interface
The language make wide use iterators provides several different kind iterators including
All standard container template type provide rich consistent set iterator type
The syntax standard iterators designed resemble ordinary operator used reference element iterator point pointer arithmetic operator like used advance iterator next element
Iterators usually used pair one used actual iteration second serf mark end collection
The iterators created corresponding container class using standard method
The iterator returned point first element iterator returned special value reference element
When iterator advanced beyond last element definition equal special end iterator value
The following example show typical use iterator
There many variety iterators slightly different behavior including forward reverse bidirectional iterators iterators input output iterators const iterators protect container element modification
However every type container support every type iterator
It possible user create iterator type deriving subclass standard class template
Iterator safety defined separately different type standard container case iterator permissive allowing container change iterating
Implicit iteration also partially supported use standard function template
When used must initialized existing iterators usually define range iteration occurs
But explicit iterator object subsequently exposed iteration proceeds
This example show use
The achieved using A limitation technique allow body loop declared inline requiring declared elsewhere passed argument
This partially compensated using library using lambda implicitly generate function object familiar infix operator syntax
However Boost implemented library level rather intrinsically language certain operation done via workarounds
The current standard natively support syntax allowing function template body declared inline
Here example iteration using lambda function Introduced JDK release interface allows iteration container class
Each provides method may optionally support method
Iterators created corresponding container class typically method named
The method advance iterator return value pointed iterator
The first element obtained upon first call
To determine element container visited test method used
The following example show simple use iterators To show called repeatedly use insert comma element last element
Note approach properly separate advance operation actual data access
If data element must used advance need stored temporary variable
When advance needed without data access
skip given data element access nonetheless performed though returned value ignored case
For collection type support method iterator remove recently visited element container keeping iterator usable
Adding removing element calling method container also make iterator unusable
An attempt get next element throw exception
An exception also thrown element remaining previously returned false
Additionally similar API allows forward backward iteration provides current index list allows setting list element position
The release Java introduced interface support enhanced loop iterating collection array
defines method return
Using enhanced loop preceding example rewritten Some container also use older since class
It provides method method modify container
In iterators rich set method similar collection used directly loop
Indeed iterators collection inherit common base trait
However rich set method available Scala collection library map collect filter often necessary deal iterators directly programming Scala
Java iterators collection automatically converted Scala iterators collection respectively simply adding single line file
The JavaConversions object provides implicit conversion
Implicit conversion feature Scala method visible current scope automatically insert call relevant expression appropriate place make typecheck otherwise would
support external internal implicit iteration using either native array array
In case external iteration onus user advance traversal request next element one define set element within array storage structure traverse element using construct
For example traverse array integer using keyword
In case internal iteration user supply operation iterator perform every element collection many operator MATLAB function overloaded execute every element array return corresponding output array implicitly
Furthermore function leveraged performing custom user defined operation native array array respectively
For example defines primary function implicitly applies custom subfunction element array using function
Alternatively may desirable abstract mechanism array storage container user defining custom MATLAB implementation Iterator Pattern
Such implementation supporting external iteration demonstrated MATLAB Central File Exchange item
This written new syntax introduced MATLAB software version feature array realization ADT mechanism storing heterogeneous data type set element
It provides functionality explicit forward traversal method use
introduced version made compatible object value Beta
However support iterators added PHP introduction internal interface
The two main interface implementation PHP script enable object iterated via foreach loop
The latter require implementing class declare required method instead implement method return instance
The provides several class work special iterators
PHP also support since
The simplest implementation wrapping array useful
All method example class used execution complete foreach loop
The iterator method executed following order The next example illustrates PHP class implement interface could wrapped class act upon data returned foreach loop
The usage together constant allows PHP script iterate result set billion row little memory usage
These feature exclusive PHP MySQL class implementation
class implement interface well
Iterators fundamental part language many case go unseen implicitly used statement
All Python standard type support iteration well many class part standard library
The following example show typical implicit iteration sequence Python dictionary form also directly iterated dictionary key returned method dictionary iterated yield corresponding key value pair tuple Iterators however used defined explicitly
For iterable sequence type class function used create iterator object
The iterator object iterated function us method internally return next element container
The previous statement applies Python
In Python method equivalent
A exception raised element left
The following example show equivalent iteration sequence using explicit iterators Any class support standard iteration either implicit explicit defining method return iterator object
The iterator object need define method return next element
Python implement iteration
Ruby implement iterators quite differently iteration done mean passing callback closure container method way Ruby implement basic iteration also several pattern iteration like function mapping filter reducing
Ruby also support alternative syntax basic iterating method following three example equivalent even shorter Ruby also iterate fixed list using Enumerators either calling next method

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

In two stable state used store state information
A
The circuit made change state applied one control input one two output
It basic storage element
latch fundamental building block system used computer communication many type system
latch used data storage element
A store single binary digit data one two state represents one represents zero
Such data storage used storage circuit described
When used output next state depend current input also current state hence previous input
It also used counting pulse synchronizing input signal reference timing signal
either simple transparent opaque
Although term historically referred generically simple clocked circuit modern usage common reserve term exclusively discussing clocked circuit simple one commonly called
Using terminology latch whereas
That latch enabled becomes transparent flip flop output change single type positive going negative going clock edge
The first electronic invented British physicist
It initially called consisted two active element
The design used British circuit transistorized version common computer even introduction though made also common
Early known variously trigger circuit
According Lindley engineer US type detailed SR D T JK first discussed course computer design Montgomery Phister appeared book Lindley time working Hughes Aircraft Eldred Nelson coined term JK changed state input logical one
The name coined Phister
They differ slightly definition given
Lindley explains heard story JK Eldred Nelson responsible coining term working

In designing logical system Nelson assigned letter input follows A B C D E F G H J Nelson used notation patent application filed
either simple transparent asynchronous clocked synchronous
The simple one commonly described clocked one described
Simple built around single pair inverting element inverting used practical circuit
Clocked device specially designed synchronous system device ignore input except transition dedicated clock signal known clocking pulsing strobing
Clocking cause either change retain output signal based upon value input signal transition
Some change output rising clock others falling edge
Since elementary amplifying stage inverting two stage connected succession cascade form needed amplifier
In configuration amplifier may considered active inverting feedback network inverting amplifier
Thus two stage connected loop although circuit diagram usually drawn symmetric pair initially introduced patent
divided common type data delay toggle
The behavior particular type described termed characteristic equation derives next next clock pulse output term input signal current output
When using static gate building block fundamental latch simple S R stand
It constructed pair
The stored bit present output marked Q
While R S input low maintains Q output constant state complement Q
If S pulsed high R held low Q output forced high stay high S return low similarly R pulsed high S held low Q output forced low stay low R return low
care The R S combination called NOR gate output zero break logical equation Q
The combination also inappropriate circuit input may go low
transition
The output would lock either depending propagation time relation gate
To overcome restricted combination one add gate input would convert one combination
That This done nearly every
Alternatively restricted combination made output
The result
Characteristic R R Q S
This alternate model simple SR latch built
become active low signal denoted respectively
Otherwise operation identical SR latch
Historically predominant despite notational inconvenience input
From teaching point view SR latch realised pair component transistor gate tube etc
rather hard understand beginner
A didactically easier understand model us single feedback loop instead
The following SR latch built gate one input gate
The JK latch much le frequently used JK
The JK latch follows following state table Hence JK latch SR latch made output oscillate passed input combination
Unlike JK input combination JK latch useful clock directs toggling
Latches designed That input signal change cause immediate change output
Additional logic added simple transparent latch make another input enable input asserted
When several latch follow using enable signal signal propagate
However following latch latch implemented
A sometimes made adding second level NAND gate inverted SR latch second level AND gate direct SR latch
The extra NAND gate invert input simple latch becomes gated SR latch simple SR latch would transform gated latch inverted enable
With E high true signal pas input gate encapsulated latch signal combination except immediately reproduce Q output
latch
With E low false latch remains state left last time E high
The input sometimes often read write strobe
This latch exploit fact two active input combination gated SR latch R complement The input NAND stage convert two D input state two input combination next latch inverting data input signal
The low state signal produce inactive combination
Thus gated may considered
This configuration prevents application restricted input combination
It also known simply
It input signal sometimes named
The word come fact enable input signal propagates directly circuit input D output Transparent latch typically used port asynchronous system synchronous system use two latch operating different clock phase prevent data transparency
Latches available usually multiple latch per chip
For example quadruple transparent latch
The truth table show lock input D input effect output
When high output equal The classic gated latch design undesirable characteristic
They require logic inverter
The propagation may take three gate delay
The propagation constant output take two gate delay others take three
Designers looked alternative
A successful alternative Earle latch
It requires single data input output take constant two gate delay
In addition two gate level Earle latch case merged last two gate level circuit driving latch many common computational circuit OR layer followed AND layer last two level
Merging latch function implement latch additional gate delay
The merge commonly exploited design pipelined computer fact originally developed Earle used purpose
The Earle latch hazard free
If middle NAND gate omitted one get commonly used demand le logic
However susceptible
Intentionally skewing clock signal avoid hazard
The D widely used
It also known data delay
The D capture value definite portion clock cycle rising edge clock
That captured value becomes Q output
At time output Q change
The D viewed memory cell
Truth table denotes condition meaning signal irrelevant Most ICs capability forced set reset state ignores D clock input much like SR
Usually illegal S R condition resolved
By setting S R used described
Here truth table others S R possible configuration These useful form basis essential part many electronic device
The advantage D transparent latch signal D input pin captured moment clocked subsequent change D input ignored next clock event
An exception reset signal input reset Q zero may either asynchronous synchronous clock
The circuit shift content register right one bit position active transition clock
The input X shifted leftmost bit position
This circuit consists two stage implemented
The input stage two latch left process clock data signal ensure correct input signal output stage single latch right
If clock low output signal input stage high regardless data input output latch unaffected store previous state
When clock signal change low high one output voltage depending data signal go low output latch D lower output becomes low D upper output becomes low
If clock signal continues staying high output keep state regardless data input force output latch stay corresponding state input logical zero output stage remains active clock high
Hence role output latch store data clock low
The circuit closely related circuit convert two D input state two input combination output latch inverting data input signal circuit split single D signal two complementary signal
The difference gated D latch simple NAND logical gate used D NAND latch used purpose
The role latch lock active output producing low voltage logical zero thus D also thought gated D latch latched input gate
A D created connecting two series inverting input one
It called second latch series change response change first master latch
For triggered D clock signal low logical enable seen first master D latch inverted clock signal high logical
This allows master latch store input value clock signal transition low high
As clock signal go high inverted enable first latch go low value seen input master latch locked
Nearly simultaneously twice inverted enable second slave D latch transition low high clock signal
This allows signal captured rising edge clock locked master latch pas slave latch
When clock signal return low output slave latch locked value seen last rising edge clock held master latch begin accept new value preparation next rising clock edge
By removing leftmost inverter circuit side strobe clock signal obtained
This truth table like An efficient functional alternative D made dynamic circuit information stored capacitance long clocked often enough true still called functional role
While D element triggered edge clock component triggered clock level
The D called even though true property
D often implemented integrated operation using
This mean digital output stored parasitic device capacitance device transitioning
This design dynamic flip flop also enables simple resetting since reset operation performed simply discharging one internal node
A common dynamic variety true clock TSPC type performs operation little power high speed
However dynamic typically work static low clock speed given enough time leakage path may discharge parasitic capacitance enough cause enter invalid state
If T input high T change state toggle whenever clock input strobed
If T input low hold previous value
This behavior described characteristic described When T held high toggle divide clock frequency two clock frequency MHz output frequency obtained MHz
This divide feature application various type digital
A T also built using JK J K pin connected together act T D T input XOR Q drive D input
The JK augments behavior SR interpreting J K condition flip toggle command
Specifically combination J K command set combination J K command reset combination J K command toggle change output logical complement current value
Setting J K maintains current state
To synthesize D simply set K equal complement J
Similarly synthesize T set K equal J
The JK therefore universal configured work SR D T
The characteristic equation JK corresponding truth table The input must held steady period around rising edge clock known aperture
Imagine taking picture frog
Suppose frog jump water
If take picture frog jump water get blurry picture frog jumping clear state frog
But take picture frog sits steadily pad steadily water get clear picture
In way input must held steady
minimum amount time data input held steady clock event data reliably sampled clock
minimum amount time data input held steady clock event data reliably sampled clock
sum setup hold time
The data input held steady throughout time period
minimum amount time asynchronous set reset input inactive clock event data reliably sampled clock
The recovery time asynchronous set reset input thereby similar setup time data input
minimum amount time asynchronous set reset input inactive clock event data reliably sampled clock
The removal time asynchronous set reset input thereby similar hold time data input
Short impulse applied asynchronous input set reset applied completely within period else becomes entirely indeterminable whether transition appropriate state
In another case asynchronous signal simply make one transition happens fall time eventually transition appropriate state short glitch may may appear output dependent synchronous input signal
This second situation may may significance circuit design
Set Reset signal may either synchronous asynchronous therefore may characterized either time synchronicity dependent design
Differentiation time often necessary verifying timing larger circuit asynchronous signal may found le critical synchronous signal
The differentiation offer circuit designer ability define verification condition type signal independently
subject problem called happen two input data clock clock reset changing time
When order clear within appropriate timing constraint result output may behave unpredictably taking many time longer normal settle one state even oscillating several time settling
Theoretically time settle bounded
In system metastability cause corruption data program crash state stable another circuit us value particular two different logical path use output one path interpret resolved stable state putting machine inconsistent state
The metastability avoided ensuring data control input held valid constant specified period clock pulse called respectively
These time specified data sheet device typically nanosecond hundred picosecond modern device
Depending upon internal organization possible build device zero even negative setup hold time requirement simultaneously
Unfortunately always possible meet setup hold criterion may connected signal could change time outside control designer
In case best designer reduce probability error certain level depending required reliability circuit
One technique suppressing metastability connect two chain output one feed data input next device share common clock
With method probability metastable event reduced negligible value never zero
The probability metastability get closer closer zero number connected series increased
The number cascaded referred ranking flip flop two series common situation
available work reducing setup hold time much possible even eliminate problem entirely
This metastability simply matter circuit design
When transition clock data close together time forced decide event happened first
However fast device made always possibility input event close together detect one happened first
It therefore logically impossible build perfectly
sometimes characterized maximum settling time maximum time remain metastable specified condition
In case clocked slower maximum allowed metastability time provide proper conditioning asynchronous external signal
Another important timing value delay common symbol data sheet time take change output clock edge
The time transition sometimes different time transition
When cascading share clock important ensure preceding longer hold time following data present input succeeding properly shifted following active edge clock
This relationship normally guaranteed physically identical
Furthermore correct operation easy verify clock period greater sum
generalized least two way making instead adapting logic two state
In special case encoding element may referred
In conventional exactly one two complementary output high
This generalized memory element N output exactly one high alternatively exactly one N low
The output therefore always respectively representation
The construction similar conventional output high inhibits output
Alternatively le conventional used one per output additional circuitry make sure one time true
Another generalization conventional memory element
In case memory element retains exactly one logic state control input induce change
In addition clock also used leading new possible clock transition

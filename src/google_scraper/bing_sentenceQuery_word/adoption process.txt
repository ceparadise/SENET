Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

It Computer Science Education Week better way celebrate drawing attention program come subject matter entirely new direction
Lila Finch PhD student lab University Colorado Boulder designed set learning experience teach computer science alongside art biology
Lila Finch teach Luminous Science class
These activity collectively called Luminous Science guide middle high school student process designing building dynamic sculpture visualize biochemical process live data streamed sensor nearby hydroponic classroom garden
Finch began work building hydroponic garden sculpture beautiful art meet practical function
In curriculum student build paint wire paper sculpture design illuminate within using string LED light connected tiny microbit microcontrollers
They wirelessly link microcontrollers data stream nearby garden program LEDs artfully reflect biochemistry plant garden
For example plenty light plant photosynthesizing student might program part sculpture twinkle white light
When water low thirsty plant might depicted red purple
When water temperature light optimal sculpture might display vibrant blue green pulse two
Recent research Burning Glass Oracle Academy show computer science skill software engineer
Yet computer science art biology usually taught separate discipline student developing separate skillsets identity participation Finch say
I believe learning subject enhanced integrating three say
Lila Finch built illuminated tree sculpture help visualize biochemical process
The rationale go something like Coming experience student may identify art science vice versa succeed program need perform across three domain
Artists must understand related biochemistry programming skill achieve aesthetic budding biologist must master necessary code artistry sculpture exhibit nuanced understanding biochemical process play
It still early day Finch research She collaborating six different teacher implement Luminous Science science art computing class
Since project kickoff fall hundred student two different school produced range beautiful creation anecdotal evidence suggests offering different avenue computer science engagement help extend participation passion field among girl underrepresented population
As Finch gather empirical data part doctoral research lens tightly focused student bring idea life learn process

Waiting certainly difficult especially waiting family
These waiting child experienced thing like abandoned living orphanage malnutrition
Many child older grown orphanage emotional cognitive physical special need need adopted sibling
Many child given chance thrive adopted loving family
Can find place heart love one child
What power one seemingly powerless child
Benjamin charisma said adoptive father Dennis
There something draw people challenge assumption disability chance experience Benjamin influence rippled neighborhood school international circle discussion shaping future orphan care China
But people radically transformed boy Down syndrome adoptive parent Dennis Sarah
In early daughter Emily tow Dennis Sarah commenced process international adoption
Based lengthy experience working people developmental disability two social worker decided adopt child Down syndrome
In looking Bethany information saw Benjamin Dennis said
He leaped page u I thought son
Late couple went Hong Kong returned Benjamin
Hong Kong social agency network
But Dennis began wonder Benjamin born mainland China condition much different
What would life like child Down syndrome
That question search answer drove Dennis undertake graduate study University Louisville
Then framing doctoral dissertation Dennis met Bethany international director
This profound impact Dennis understanding orphan care
He come believe substitute family life child
In addition difficulty attachment emotional development severe neglect often experienced child institutional setting linked adverse physical change
Research shown brain child orphanage literally shrink resulting cognitive deficit behavioral issue
Kids get need family Dennis insists
Families uniquely designed provide child emotional input physical input safety protection attachment thing occur Yet like many country China poured resource developing orphanage
Is Dennis wondered another far beneficial approach
Late Dennis went China research answer dissertation
After return brought consultant Bethany applied million USAID grant change way orphan care done China
Bethany received grant subsequently invited Dennis join international team
Bethany orphan care vies institutional approach China
But pretty amazing stuff happening
Bethany hoping evidence produced work help drive discussion It started one small boy Down syndrome
And ultimately come full circle back Benjamin family shaped way fully understand
Adopting Benjamin phenomenal event ever happened life
It opened new world u many different way Dennis said

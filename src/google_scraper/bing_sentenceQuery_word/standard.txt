Sadly turn increasingly poor match marketplace
Consider employer big stack clearly specified problem solved
That stack problem ideal handing programmer country side globe
Top graduate standard Computer Science undergraduate program go graduate school Computer Science ultimately become professor Computer Science
In word academic fine job replicating
But majority graduate looking job software engineer focus article best prepare people job
Graduates done much group work
Universities spend billion facility student sleep together facility student work together
We society least judge prescription written pediatric psychiatrist suffering epidemic Attention Deficit Disorder
We student watched MTV cradle
Yet structure learning student take homework back dorm room try work problem fighting distraction dormmates unrelated major TV DVDs video game instant message email Web
Students come university excellent study habit still get excellent education
Students managed hop low hurdle junior high high school despite poor study habit may get minimal benefit college
Graduates good taking vague goal person turning concrete specification implemented within fixed budget time resource
Graduates good communicating writing presentation asking question user customer
Lack experience user interface design testing experience handling real user suggestion complaint
Lack professionalism graduate dedicated completing something value
Students learn feel good solve problem get something usually good grade
Students learn value generated first accomplishes task new information system
Consequently CS graduate happy draw salary building system percent finished never installed used
Lack focus big picture graduate ca understand work relates larger organizational goal
Graduates experienced quickly making sense large commercial tool library writing small piece code control extend library
The result tendency start scratch rewrite code fully understood rather reuse
Many early Web application plagued bug database management system written computer science graduate interested writing C code learning apply standard relational database management system
The news article correct complete
While true employment software development shrunk hundred thousand people fired also true hundred thousand people hired
The newspaper correct number people hired smaller number fired
The question journalist asked Who getting fired
For nimble employer first people get pink slip older programmer whose performance average whose salary benefit cost high
Who getting hired
New college graduate thanks youth high energy level low employment cost
Among desirable young relatively cheap worker one get hired first whose education match current employer need
For foreseeable future every young person graduating Computer Science get job United States owe career firing older worker
It cruel marketplace task document improve computer science education help young people reduce cruelty American employment market
Thus goal computer science bachelor program ought give young energetic person project group work experience best older programmer
Second want graduate satisfying career autonomy responsibility job security
Consider typical computer programmer take specification subsystem manager unthinkingly produce program meet spec hand resulting code back testing integration evaluation department
This really factory job hand get dirty
What wrong
Sociologists tracked substantial loss worker satisfaction craft job replaced factory job
A craftsman build complete product delivers directly hand customer seeing hearing satisfaction new product delivered
A factory worker contrast build small component product typically several distribution layer removed customer
A craftsman responsible whether product go door customer
In classical factory totally separate part bureaucracy quality control department decides whether product shipped
A craftsman listens customer need adapts resulting product accordingly
Factory worker never talk customer separate marketing department ass customer need determines change product design
Not job code factory satisfying neither secure
There abstraction barrier manager programmer spec code
One thing student learn computer science undergraduate virtue abstraction barrier
You replace Module A expensive programmer Module B cheap programmer another country never notice long Modules A B present interface outside world email spec source code
What actual skill graduate need order get job
To get satisfying job
To keep job face pressure younger cheaper worker
A professional programmer ought able pick worthwhile problem attack
Engineering art building solution problem society regard significant
A person blindly told without independently figuring context significance problem engineering
A professional programmer need able sit meeting decision maker prepared substantial domain knowledge make significant contribution discussion
A professional programmer need skilled design
Our student able study week per year perhaps four quarter finish bachelor degree calendar month
Most university operate respect copy Ivy League school
In many way make sense copy leader Harvard Yale calendar one
Top university United States session week
It make sense customer wealthy family
There need long summer break kid free join family yacht Mediterranean
And need long winter break kid come beach house Caribbean
And fun spring skiing Aspen Biff Muffy ca take week school
Computer science however commonly chosen major child American aristocracy
For middle class parent traditional university calendar mean pay tuition also pay spring break trip South Padre Island world summer job scarce support kid long summer winter break
Why Johnny school basis graduate family payroll age
Students graduate portfolio work credential show employer
Nearly programmer think average talent achievement
Precious concrete evidence support belief
The curriculum need include enough project time producing good presentation every student graduate portfolio showing problem attacked design produced extent complete solution implemented
The curriculum also provide opportunity achieving recognized national certification
As date writing common certification standard Cisco Microsoft Oracle closely tied company product taste
Unless consortium university employer develops competing set standard probably worth helping student meet currently recognized standard
Grade inflation rampant good school transcript longer meaningful
Students graded exclusively outsider
In case computer scanning result Microsoft certification test
In case external client student team built project
In case might professional engineer academic foreign country applying written standard
But case teacher whose salary paid student tuition
The potential conflict interest therefore grade inflation high furthermore want faculty regarded coach rather evaluator
All student work character engineering project client talk problem student team prepares written plan solving problem student team discus plan client student team build prototype student team test prototype client user student team refines prototype response testing student team document result
Everything standard engineering curriculum taught process
For example student building flight simulation game might need refer Physics textbook practice Physics problem order learn enough build prototype
This make bit tough faculty need clever enough weave course Physics Calculus Biology engineering project
The payoff time student graduate completely comfortable engineering process listen design discus implement test refine write
Weaving subject literature history curriculum present challenge left exercise reader

A definition approved recognized standard organization accepted industry
Standards exist format electrical
From standpoint standard extremely important industry allow combination product different manufacturer create customized
Without standard company could used together
In addition standard make much easier learn use new
Most official computer standard set one following organization IEEE set standard type electrical interface
Its famous standard probably defines interface communication
This interface used number including
IEEE also responsible designing data format
While IEEE generally concerned hardware ANSI primarily concerned software
ANSI defined standard number programming language including
ITU defines international standard particularly communication protocol
It defined number standard including specify transmitting data telephone line
In addition standard approved organization also de facto standard
These format become standard simply large number company agreed use
They formally approved standard standard nonetheless

learn share knowledge build career
What concept Computer Science think made better programmer
My degree Mechanical Engineering ended programmer I bit lacking basic
There standard CS concept I learnt recently given much deeper understanding I specifically Obviously list little short moment I hoping suggestion As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing
Sorry link really provide lot help

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Is citation style within computer science field
By citation style I referring three general method Browsing show roughly split option occasional
So I really two question The answer may I imagine something like Everyone us even though clearly easier read
Regarding Both ACM IEEE use citation style safe say reader academic article CS familiar style
Therefore use style paper look similar conference journal article CS
Regarding experience citation style Smith effective reader
This opinion shaped department Computational Social Science I read mix paper CS Statistics Social Science Economics others
My reason favoring make easier read paper line
Having read many paper given field I familiar cited seminal work
If I see Padgett Powell I immediately know reference I guess
But I see tell nothing
I go look reference list memorize stand Padgett Powell every time I see
But nature discipline nature paper lead difference role citation serve text
In Social Sciences general citation structural discourse field
Citations often mark school thought line argument research lens
In contrast Computer Science citation much utilitarian function point paper provide theoretical foundation attempted approach problem solved
In way intellectual bill material research behind CS paper
The numbered reference sufficient giving anyone pointer bill material need
Another justification citation style shorten page count paper
In opinion le le justified era people read paper electronically print
A computer science paper go either IEEE ACM use one standard citation style feel like computer science paper many reader
Author guideline including found
By posting answer agree

In collection used often
These may include configuration data documentation help data message template specification
In referred
A also collection implementation behavior written term language interface behavior invoked
For instance people want write higher level program use library make instead implementing system call
In addition behavior provided reuse multiple independent program
A program invokes behavior via mechanism language
For example simple C behavior library invoked using C normal
What distinguishes call library function versus another function program way code organized system
Library code organized way used multiple program connection code part program organized used within one program
This distinction gain hierarchical notion program grows large program
In case may internal library reused independent large program
The distinguishing feature library organized purpose reused independent program user need know interface internal detail library
The value library lie reuse behavior
When program invokes library gain behavior implemented inside library without implement behavior
Libraries encourage sharing code fashion ease distribution code
The behavior implemented library connected invoking program different
If code library accessed build invoking program library called
An alternative build executable invoking program distribute independently library implementation
The library behavior connected executable invoked executed either part process starting execution middle execution
In case library called loaded
A dynamic library loaded linked preparing program execution
Alternatively middle execution application may explicitly request module
Most although programmer also create custom library
Most modern provide library implement majority system service
Such library service modern application requires
As code used modern application provided system library
The earliest programming concept analogous library intended separate definition program
brought COMPOOL Communication Pool concept popular attention although adopted idea software
Following computer science principle Comm Pool purpose permit sharing System Data among many program providing centralized data description
also included primitive capability library system described inadequate library facility retrospect
Another major contributor modern library concept came form innovation
FORTRAN subprogram compiled independently compiler lacked
So prior introduction module FORTRAN subprogram impossible
Finally historian concept remember influential
Simula first language nearly identical modern concept used
The concept Simula also progenitor
Even developed originally Simula class could included library file added compile time
Libraries important program process resolve reference known library module
The linking process usually automatically done program search set library module given order
Usually considered error link target found multiple time given set library
Linking may done executable file created whenever program used
The reference resolved may address jump routine call
They may main program one module depending upon another
They resolved fixed relocatable address common base allocating runtime memory module referenced
Some programming language may use feature called whereby linker aware integrated compiler linker know external reference used code library never actually even though internally referenced discarded compiled application
For example program us integer arithmetic arithmetic operation exclude library routine
This feature lead smaller application file size reduced memory usage
Some reference program library module stored relative symbolic form resolved code library assigned final static address
process adjusting reference done either linker
In general relocation done individual library address memory may vary depending program using library combined
avoids reference absolute address therefore require relocation
When linking performed creation executable another object file known
In case linking usually done may also done
A also known one intended statically linked
Originally static library existed
Static linking must performed module recompiled
All module required program sometimes statically linked copied executable file
This process resulting file known program
A static build may need used desired
A file intended shared shared object file
Modules used program loaded individual shared object memory rather copied linker creates single monolithic executable file program
Shared library statically linked meaning reference library module resolved module allocated memory executable file created
But often linking shared library postponed loaded
Most modern shared library file format executable file
This offer two main advantage first requires making one loader rather two single loader considered well worth added complexity
Secondly allows executables also used shared library
Typical combined executable shared library format Unix Windows
In older environment stack based data local allowed shared library code significant restriction placed shared library code
Library code may shared memory multiple well disk
If virtual memory used process would execute physical page RAM mapped different address space process
This advantage
For instance system application often hundred kilobyte size loaded quickly majority code located library already loaded purpose operating system
Programs accomplish RAM sharing using lead complex flexible architecture using common virtual address Windows
These system make sure various trick like address space reserving slot shared library code great probability shared
A third alternative used successor
This allows code place significant restriction code placed shared
In case different version shared library cause problem especially library different version file name different application installed system require specific version
Such scenario known named Windows
Most modern operating system method eliminate situation use application specific private library
Dynamic linking linking performed program loaded executed rather executable file created
A dynamically linked library DLL dynamic shared object DSO system library intended dynamic linking
Only minimum amount work done executable file created record library routine program need index name number routine library
The majority work linking done time application loaded load time execution run time
Usually necessary linking program called dynamic linker linking loader actually part underlying
However possible exceedingly difficult write program us dynamic linking includes dynamic linker even operating system provides support dynamic linking
Programmers originally developed dynamic linking operating system starting MTS built late
Since shared library system change often system compute likely load address shared library system needed store information library executables
If every shared library loaded undergone process load predetermined address speed process dynamic linking
This optimization known macOS Linux
Disadvantages technique include time required precompute address every time shared library change inability use requirement sufficient virtual address space use problem alleviated adoption architecture least time
Loaders shared library vary widely functionality
Some depend executable storing explicit path library
Any change library naming layout file system cause system fail
More commonly name library path stored executable operating system supplying method find library based algorithm
If shared library executable depends deleted moved renamed incompatible version library copied place earlier search executable would fail load
This called existing many platform
The infamous Windows variant commonly known
This problem occur version library uniquely identified program reference library full unique identifier
The DLL hell problem earlier Windows version arose using name library guaranteed unique resolve dynamic link program
To avoid DLL hell later version Windows rely largely option program install private partial retreat use shared mechanism prevent replacement shared system DLLs earlier version
check determine proper place load DLLs implement DLLs check directory defined order
First Windows check directory loaded program directory set calling function System Windows directory current working directory finally directory specified PATH
Applications written framework since also check primary store shared dll file remove issue
used flexible system collecting list library number known location similar PATH concept system first start
Moving library around cause problem although user incur time cost first starting system
Most system search path specifying file system look dynamic library
Some system specify default path others dynamic loader
Some format specify additional directory search library particular program
This usually overridden although disabled setgid program user ca force program run arbitrary code root permission
Developers library encouraged place dynamic library place default search path
On downside make installation new library problematic known location quickly become home increasing number library file making management complex
Dynamic loading subset dynamic linking involves dynamically linked library loading unloading request
Such request may made implicitly explicitly run time
Implicit request made compile time linker add library reference include file path simply file name
Explicit request made application make direct call operating system API run time
Most operating system support dynamically linked library also support dynamically loading library via linker
For instance us API function based system including UNIX system use
Some development system automate process
Although originally pioneered dynamic linking reach used consumer late
It generally available form operating system early
During period OOP becoming significant part programming landscape
OOP runtime binding requires additional information traditional library supply
In addition name entry point code located within also require list object depend
This one OOP main advantage inheritance mean part complete definition method may different place
This simply listing one library requires service another true OOP system library may known vary system system
At time many developer worked idea program display running desktop computer would use service data storage processing
For instance program computer would send message minicomputer return small sample huge dataset display
RPC already handled task standard RPC system
Soon majority minicomputer mainframe vendor instigated project combine two producing OOP library format could used anywhere
Such system known supported remote access
Microsoft COM example system local use DCOM modified version support remote access
For time object library held status next big thing programming world
There number effort create system would run across platform company competed try get developer locked system
Examples include DOE PDO Microsoft number system
After inevitable cooling marketing hype object library continue used programming distributed information system
rough OOP equivalent older type code library
They contain describe characteristic define action involve object
Class library used create object characteristic set specific value
In OOP language like distinction clear class often contained library file like Java instantiated object residing memory although potentially able made separate file
In others like class library merely starting point includes entire state environment class instantiated object
Another solution library issue come using completely separate executables often lightweight form calling using RPC network another computer
This approach maximizes operating system code needed support library code used provide application support security every program
Additionally system require library exist machine forward request network
However approach mean every library call requires considerable amount overhead
RPC call much expensive calling shared library already loaded machine
This approach commonly used make heavy use remote call notably system
Code generation library generate transform
They used data access framework testing generate dynamic proxy object
They also used intercept field access
The system store file directory
The filename always start end suffix static library shared object dynamically linked library
Some system might multiple name dynamically linked library name name remaining name name might include major version library full version number example system would filename second major interface revision dynamically linked library
The file sometimes found library directory archive usable system
The system inherits static library convention library stored file use dynamically linked library suffix instead
Most library macOS however consist framework placed inside special directory called wrap library required file metadata
For example framework called would implemented bundle called either dynamically linked library file symlink dynamically linked library file
usually suffix although file name extension may identify dynamically linked library
library
The interface revision either encoded file name abstracted away using interface
Depending compiled file either static library representation dynamically linkable library needed compilation known
Unlike world us different file extension linking file one must first know regular static library import library
In latter case file must present run time

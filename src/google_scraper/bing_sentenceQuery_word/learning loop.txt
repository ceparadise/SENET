Computer program make use data control flow program
There several main primitive data type
Data value variable constant
A program could made programming avoid hazard
For example robot vehicle cm edge table tell move forward cm drive edge table
To stop happening might write like loop used add high degree intelligence computer system
loop also called
A WHILE loop code repeated based certain condition
The condition could
The WHILE loop condition true
Whether condition met checked beginning loop
If condition repeat code executed
For example stop robot driving edge table might write WHILE loop like Python statement included programming language
This example parrot keep repeating type type bye A similar loop DO WHILE loop
This method differs WHILE loop condition checked end loop
If condition true loop repeat
Thus code loop executed least
Checking condition end loop may situation generate different result using WHILE LOOP
For example consider simple program If program run would get output
We would get output used simple DO WHILE example However initial value count two example produce different outcome
With WHILE loop condition checked beginning count code executed nothing output
With DO WHILE loop would get output condition checked print statement executed
REPEAT UNTIL loop loop found older language BASIC PASCAL
The principal DO WHILE loop condition checked end loop thus behaviour
Consider example Using REPEAT UNTIL example similar would generate output DO WHILE example used previously
However note example condition slightly different loop continues condition met
loop result intentional unintentional infinite loop
If wanted loop indefinitely could set condition would never met thus iterating infinitely
The following example would result infinite loop It important check condition set met wish
Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

So far learned basic programming command
assigning value printing way control statement executed using statement
In lesson introduce sometimes called way make computer thing similar thing
For example word document would done loop
We describe two kind Python loop lesson loop loop
A statement repeat section code long condition true
Here example Here general structure So example keep repeating loop body greater
There another kind loop Python called loop
In many situation either kind loop used one simpler another useful know use
A loop built order easily loop range number see later lesson list data
Here example loop
The general structure numerical loop Here example loop inside another loop
The statement like emergency escape loop cause immediate jump command end loop body
Here example using read line input find one say
The statement make rest loop repeat body next round usually called next iteration
Here visualized example combine

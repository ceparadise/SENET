Systems Development Life Cycle available

There different model software development
Testing major phase developing software
It important use test plan carry different type test
The general guide phase needed develop
There different variation model including
If work software development project need think best approach team
This version cycle
Each phase must complete move onto next
It easy follow process easy manage
However flexible model
In theory need return previous phase completed
A final piece software produced end process
This similar Waterfall testing introduced implementation phase
It usually requires introduced first phase phase undergoes rigorous test make sure possible move onto next stage
In model one version software worked time
This produce working product early even basic
However mean need go back code go development cycle several time build get final product
Agile similar Incremental
A basic version product produced quickly revised updated several time
There great emphasis getting feedback audience user refine improve product
Work broken sprint could couple day two week try achieve new version product end sprint

The system life cycle broken five stage Analysis Design Implementation Operation Maintenance
Gathering data essential analysis stage gain clear insight problem
If problem identified correctly poor solution guaranteed follow
A requirement specification contains system able done
This include A feasibility report produced analysis design stage
It include There number different way problem solved without using computer
One consideration must take account input output solution
The software could one three type Systems usually go several stage testing
Alpha testing first stage asmall group qualified individual examine early version program
Beta testing program fully featured released wider audience testing
Test data also used make sure program output expected data
We test program A new system implemented one following three way Proper maintenance system essential clear documentation begin help progress programmer need work hard understand design decision explained documentation
This reduces cost maintanence
Periodic review performance review use data collection technique seen analysis section indicate whether improvement modification needed

learn share knowledge build career
What concept Computer Science think made better programmer
My degree Mechanical Engineering ended programmer I bit lacking basic
There standard CS concept I learnt recently given much deeper understanding I specifically Obviously list little short moment I hoping suggestion As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing
Sorry link really provide lot help

Tara taught Psychology master degree evolutionary psychology
mean making reasoned judgment logical
It way thinking simply accept argument conclusion exposed rather attitude involving questioning argument conclusion
It requires wanting see evidence involved support particular argument conclusion
People use critical thinking one say thing know
Is conclusion based evidence gut feeling
alternative possibility given new piece information
Additionally critical thinking divided following three core skill Many people decide make change daily life based story one person experience
For example let say aunt told take vitamin C supplement every day
Additionally told one morning running late work forgot take vitamin C supplement
That afternoon developed cold
She insists take vitamin C every day get sick like story
Many people hearing story would accept think avoid getting sick I take vitamin Although type logic common lack skill
If examine anecdote little carefully able understand
For starter know idea vitamin C stopping illness even came
Why aunt decide take vitamin C rather vitamin D vitamin
Get FREE access day create account
Also never indication given exists direct link taking vitamin C developing cold
At first glance may seem way
However could many variable involved nothing vitamin Maybe already developing cold particular day happened manifest
Maybe sick person sneezed elevator morning
Any number possibility could happened story simply enough information
All speculation validity particular observation considered skepticism
Let say thought skepticism inspired curiosity
After would fair simply dismiss new idea either
As result looked article relationship vitamin C cold prevention
After reading several report found scientific study whether vitamin C prevents common cold conducted result inconsistent
The overall conclusion found study vitamin C necessary maintaining overall body function held responsible preventing people getting cold treating cold someone already one
After investigative reporting decide show aunt belief vitamin C erroneous presenting result research
If aunt like people hear evidence still insist idea cold prevention vitamin C correct based personal experience
Part critical thinking demonstrating humility many people case aunt trouble
However big part science testing idea finding idea right
This good allows u tweak idea test one get closer finding right way world work
Critical thinking making informed decision based logic
It requires question investigate validity new information instead blindly believing everything hear
The three main skill involved critical thinking curiosity desire passion learn new information open new idea skepticism questioning new information rather blindly believing humility ability change idea logically proven wrong
If use critical thinking able make better decision le gullible

Ashley attorney
She taught written various introductory law course
How society influenced today
Did watch morning news
Spend time Internet
Have conversation friend
You might influenced society realize
study development structure functioning human society social problem
Sociologists observe examine analyze society society influence
They research societal problem development society way human interact
When sociologist study society use one several different method
You think method different lens
Each lens different way view society give different perspective
Two main sociological research method Let take closer look two research method
Let start
This research method focus understanding subjective experience rather simply observing fact
As term suggests interpretive researcher seek explain understand sociological data
They interpret life society human experience
Before development interpretive sociology sociological research concentrated gathering objective fact drawing conclusion
For example let say sociologist research find American racial minority likely experience poverty white Americans
They gathered fact sociological data
Sociologists using interpretive method seek decode data
Interpretivists recognize many different point view
Interpretive researcher seek understand meaning data considering different subject point view
For instance Bob black man living poverty Georgia
Helen Hispanic woman living poverty California
Their personal perspective poverty different one another
They differing opinion minority likely live poverty
Bob interpret understand explain data differently Helen
They draw opinion personal experience poverty
Interpretive sociology us different perspective give meaning data
Interpretive sociology asks people interpret world around people react interpretation
It focus human intent meaning
This type research used understand interpretation poverty shape societal view interpretation race ethnicity shape societal view
Specifically interpretive researcher might ask Bob Helen qualifies poverty define minority status
The researcher need know subject view categorize item order interpret data
Now let look
Critical sociology us critical thought effort reveal faulty sociological claim
This type research meant pick apart theory conclusion made society culture
As term reflects researcher carefully analyze question previous claim finding
Before critical research theory used sociology sociological research interpretive
The research focused understanding explaining society various point view
Let look difference using previous example
Sociologists research find American minority likely experience poverty white Americans
Sociologists using critical method analyze critique finding looking factor minority status
Specifically look totality society rather one segment
They look societal problem historical context evaluating problem came specific point time
Critical sociologist use many different discipline study
They look thing like geography economics history political science anthropology psychology
The critical sociologist might look size impoverished family area country live access job education level
Notice critical research method focus evaluating data suggesting appropriate change address problem
The critical research method asks minority experience poverty fix issue
Get FREE access day create account
Let recap main difference two research method
Keep mind sociological researcher well versed method
Different situation call different
The perspective point view used examine human behavior connection society
Perspectives research method lens sociologist view human society social behavior
The interpretive method acknowledges social perspective shape fact data
This includes sociologist view experience
Interpretive research take varying viewpoint account analyzing explaining sociological data conclusion
In contrast critical method question conclusion using different discipline
The critical method seek correct sociological conclusion disprove faulty conclusion
This research method help discover alternate additional explanation conclusion
Let review
study development structure functioning human society social problem
Sociologists use point view used examine human behavior connection society
Generally speaking perspective research method
Two main sociological research method focus understanding subjective experience rather simply observing fact
This research method seek explain sociological data conclusion looking different people view knowledge
us critical thought effort reveal faulty sociological claim
This research method pick apart theory conclusion made society culture order bring forth additional alternate theory

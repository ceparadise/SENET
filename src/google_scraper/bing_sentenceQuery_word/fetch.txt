When conventional program written language understand computer
This called source code
This source code may translated method called compilation version computer understand called object code
The object code stored location memory
Each line object code executed one time computer
The process computer retrieving line memory figuring want called
It used various context usually mean data place program something
So hospital app might fetch patient record database
Or game might fetch texture hard drive
Or executing program hardware might fetch value main memory happens stored cache
Fetching data often requires time make potentially complicated operation
In simplest case instruct computer fetch damn data wait arrive continue
But complicated case fetching might happen asynchronously issue command fetch stuff go thing data arrives get notified somehow
That get bit tricky sometimes
Most likely git command fetch
fetch one half pull pull defined fetch followed merge
So fetch grab remote repository without changing local copy

Rob Williams
Each instruction address processor take address something called program counter
The program counter charge tracking instruction CPU execute
In basic team instruction memory tracked Hubpages
The Following stage inside Cycle Once CPU fetch instruction decodes instruction strip easily executed Complete PC Pedia

However CPUs understand different type instruction
For Example Assembly code must decoded binary instruction
Hubpages
Execution decoding executed memory needed data performed
For example command print given first instruction reached CPU
Store execution CPU writes result onto main memory register
The CPU must give feedback execution
Then output data written presentation owned De Montfort University copyright
To right diagram show basic stage cycle Shane Preece
Whenever processor execute instruction data temporarily stored local memory location bit called register
The type processor machine owns depends overall number register vary ten many hundred even thousand
There many type register main one listed
Accumulator register store arithmetic operation well logical one Status register hold system status indicator overflow Instruction register contains current instruction processed Ordinal counter contains address next instruction

Memory split two part
Primary Secondary Primary memory one important part computer
The processor inside computer store retrieves information memory accessed CPU random order making RAM random access memory
So location memory accessed CPU store read
Random Access Memory RAM common major type Semiconductor memory
RAM ability read data memory also able write new data memory really easy incredibly fast
Both reading writing done via electrical signal
However RAM classed volatile
This memory deleted power resulting loss data
Leading RAM used temporary storage
RAM also two different type DRAM SRAM
William Stallings

DRAM Dynamic memory made cell hold data charge capacitor

SRAM used cache memory
Rob Williams

Read memory contains pattern data edited changed
ROM classed meaning power supply needed order maintain bit value memory
ROM read changed rewritten
One best thing ROM data program always located main memory never needed loaded form secondary storage device
William Stallings

Cache Memory lie main memory CPU
The Cache memory random access memory computer microprocessor access quickly RAM
When microprocessor process data firstly take look cache memory find data


Cache memory local memory cause waiting time information stored RAM Random Access Memory
This overall effect speed performance computer main memory making slower processor time certain type memory faster greatly increased cost
Cache memory sometimes put level closeness accessibility microprocessor
An example cache level cache chip microprocessor usually separate static RAM SRAM chip
The main RAM usually dynamic RAM DRAM chip
SearchStorage
Cache also reduces latency time memory transferring information
When processor operation cache interface controller transfer information Also cache interface RAM level three cache allow transfer

Memory store program well data
Thus program must go memory CPU executed
Programs consist many tell CPU
The format semantics instruction defined ISA instruction set architecture
The reason instructons reside memory CPUs typically hold little memory
The memory CPU slower run
Thus memory CPU separate chip
CPUs usually run much faster memory thus memory often bottleneck running code
The purpose rather brief tutorial explain step taken CPU run single instruction
The instruction fetched physical memory
RAM
Here detail
The address instruction fetched hidden register called PC program counter
A hidden register register visible ISA programmer CPU visible control unit CPU
The instruction copied memory IR instruction register also another hidden register
The book call memory refers instruction cache
They talk cache avoid introducing new term might confuse student
Think cache fast memory forget instruction memory assume come RAM
In order figure instruction need decoded
Part decoding process fetch input operand
For example instruction add content register place result register value register need fetched perform addition
For operation fetch one register immediate value
Those two value added
The CPU must know see instruction get two value register see instruction must get value one register immediate value
That decoding come
In example addition performed
This carried circuit called unit
For RISC machine MIPS memory access occurs instruction
For instruction step anything
The memory accessed data memory really data cache
The result operation performed step ALU written appropriate register register file
A register file hardware store register
Update value PC
Normally
However branch jump instruction PC updated address

Learn central processing unit three main component factor influence CPU speed cycle

The computer fetch
This done repeatedly computer booted shut
The first step cycle carry fetching instruction
The CPU fetch main memory hard drive store CPU temporary memory register
Once instruction fetched CPU need understand instruction action
This called
When instruction decoded CPU carry action needed
This called instruction
The CPU designed understand set instruction
A single piece program code might require several instruction
Look Python code First computer need load value variable immediate access store register
Next need load value variable
Then need multiply two number together finally need store result variable

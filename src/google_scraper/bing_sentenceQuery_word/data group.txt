The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit

also called process discovering interesting useful pattern relationship large volume data
The field combine tool learning management analyze large digital collection known data set
Data mining widely used business insurance banking retail science research astronomy medicine government security detection criminal terrorist
The proliferation numerous large sometimes connected government private database led regulation ensure individual record accurate secure unauthorized viewing tampering
Most type data mining targeted toward general knowledge group rather knowledge specific supermarket le concerned selling one item one person selling many item many pattern analysis also may used discern anomalous individual behaviour criminal activity
As computer storage capacity increased many company began store transactional data
The resulting record collection often called data warehouse large analyzed traditional statistical approach
Several computer science conference workshop held consider recent advance field artificial intelligence AI discovery genetic neural adapted knowledge discovery preferred term computer science community
The process led First International Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held Montreal launch journal
This also period many early company formed product introduced
One earliest successful application data mining perhaps second marketing research detection
By studying consumer purchasing behaviour typical pattern usually becomes apparent purchase made outside pattern flagged later investigation deny transaction
However wide variety normal behaviour make challenging single distinction normal fraudulent behaviour work everyone time
Every individual likely make purchase differ type made relying normal single individual likely give many false alarm
One approach improving reliability first group individual similar purchasing pattern since group model le sensitive minor
For example frequent business traveler group likely pattern includes unprecedented purchase location member group might flagged transaction catalog purchase fit group profile
The complete process involves multiple step understanding goal project data available process change based final analysis
The three key computational step process model evaluation use model
This division clearest classification data
Model learning occurs one applied data group class attribute known order produce classifier learned data
The classifier tested independent evaluation set contains data known attribute
The extent model classification agree known class target attribute used determine expected accuracy model
If model sufficiently accurate used classify data target attribute unknown
There many type data mining typically divided kind information attribute known type knowledge sought model
Predictive modeling used goal estimate value particular target attribute exist sample training data value attribute known
An example classification take set data already divided predefined group search pattern data group
These discovered pattern used classify data right group target attribute unknown though attribute may known
For instance manufacturer could develop predictive model distinguishes part fail extreme heat extreme cold condition based manufacturing model may used determine appropriate application part
Another technique employed predictive modeling analysis used target attribute numeric value goal predict value new data
Descriptive modeling clustering also divide data group
With clustering however proper group known advance pattern discovered analyzing data used determine group
For example advertiser could analyze general population order classify potential customer different cluster develop separate advertising campaign targeted group
Fraud detection also make use clustering identify group individual similar purchasing pattern
Pattern mining concentrate identifying rule describe specific pattern within data
analysis identifies item typically occur together purchase transaction one first application data mining
For example supermarket used analysis identify item often purchased instance store featuring fish sale would also stock tartar sauce
Although testing association long often simple see small data set data mining enabled discovery le apparent association immense data set
Of interest discovery unexpected association may open new avenue marketing research
Another important use pattern mining discovery sequential pattern example sequence error warning precede equipment failure may used schedule preventative maintenance may provide insight design flaw
detection viewed flip side finding data instance unusual fit established pattern
Fraud detection example anomaly detection
Although fraud detection may viewed problem predictive modeling relative rarity fraudulent transaction speed criminal develop new type fraud mean predictive model likely low accuracy quickly become date
Thus anomaly detection instead concentrate modeling normal behaviour order identify unusual transaction
Anomaly detection also used various monitoring system intrusion detection
Numerous technique developed including pattern discovery time series data stock price streaming data sensor network relational learning social network
The potential invasion privacy using data mining concern many people
Commercial database may contain detailed record people medical history purchase transaction telephone usage among aspect life
Civil libertarian consider database held business government unwarranted intrusion invitation abuse
For example sued NSA alleging warrantless spying American citizen acquisition call record American telecommunication company
The program began discovered public information began leak
Often risk data mining usually aim produce general knowledge rather learn information specific issue misuse inappropriate disclosure information database
In many federal agency required produce annual report specifically address privacy project
The law requiring privacy report federal agency defines data mining quite restrictively discover locate predictive pattern anomaly indicative terrorist criminal activity part individual As various local national international agency begun share database potential abuse security forced government work industry developing secure computer network
In particular research technique data mining operate distorted transformed decrease risk disclosure individual data
Data mining evolving one driver competition challenge problem
A commercial example million Netflix Prize
American company offer movie rental delivered mail streamed began contest see anyone could improve percent recommendation system algorithm predicting individual movie preference based previous rental data
The prize awarded BellKor team seven mathematician computer scientist engineer United States Canada Austria Israel achieved percent goal June finalized victory improved algorithm day later
The open competition spurred many clever contestant
For example Conferences Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held workshop Netflix Prize research paper presented topic ranging new collaborative filtering technique faster matrix factorization key component many recommendation system
Concerns privacy data also led advance understanding privacy anonymity
Data mining however result must viewed care statistical analysis
One strength data mining ability analyze quantity data would impractical analyze manually pattern found may complex difficult human understand complexity requires care evaluating pattern
Nevertheless statistical evaluation technique result knowledge free human bias large amount data reduce bias smaller sample
Used properly data mining provides valuable insight large data set otherwise would practical possible obtain

For public folder database database management moved organization level functionality changed since implemented Exchange Server
Exchange server integrates high availability core architecture combining cluster continuous replication CCR standby Continuous replication SCR single high availability solution data replication
Exchange server also add automatic failure recovery exchange server role deploy multiple exchange server
Because change building high availability solution longer requires cluster hardware advanced cluster configuration
As get started exchange server concentrate How exchange server work hardware new feature MS Exchange server
What Data Availability Groups DAG MS exchange server
How work Data Availability Group DAG
What new feature MS Exchange
Microsoft released Exchange Server new feature
This article introduce new feature important also support MS exchange server
Legal hold Exchange implement new legal hold feature
With feature allows u maintain content Exchange mailbox
A hold may visible user depending IT configures
The hold feature lack granularity Move Archive keep policy applying level entire mailbox
The new legal hold facility prevents user getting rid email way
Multi mailbox search This feature make lot easier organization perform
Search privilege delegated appropriate audit compliance legal support staff using new access control RBAC
For audit purpose searchable log kept search
This substantial enhancement Exchange
Exchange control panel The Exchange Control Panel integrated OWA
This feature allows user performed basic task changing information contact
Data availability group Exchange provided several HA DR feature increase Exchange uptime without complex expensive third party solution Cluster Continuous Replication
DAG allows replica exist mail database
Database availability group allow designate multiple server host copy individual database
HA copy assume automatic failure date copy typical local user
Database level failover In previous Exchange Server cluster implementation failure required entire cluster node fail
Voice mail transcription legacy voice mail system often expensive maintenance contract require proprietary system operation management process
Users benefit integrating voice mail email feature voice text preview
Personal archive In Exchange user create two mailbox primary mailbox archive mailbox
With using archive mailbox user store primary mailbox organized
Items moved automatically primary mailbox archive mailbox using retention policy
Data availability group DAG MS Exchange There several layer Exchange Server configured high availability solution
New Exchange Server Database Availability Group offering high availability Mailbox Server mode
If want full high availability solution Client Access Server Hub Transport Server need configured high availability solution well
In MS exchange server feature implement similar DAG MS exchange server LCR local continuous replication mainly used small business wanted replicate copy Exchange database another disk server
b SCC single copy cluster I would call traditional Exchange cluster used shared storage host Exchange database
c CCR cluster continuous replication used replicate Exchange database information Exchange Server allowing hardware storage redundancy limited Active node Passive node
SCR standby continuous replication introduced Exchange provide ability replicate Exchange database disaster recovery location
A database availability group DAG base component high availability site resilience framework built Microsoft Exchange Server
A DAG group Mailbox server host set database provide automatic recovery failure affect individual server database
A DAG boundary mailbox database replication database server switchovers failovers internal component called Active Manager
Active Manager Exchange component manages switchovers failovers run every server DAG
Any server DAG host copy mailbox database server DAG
When server added DAG work server DAG provide automatic recovery failure affect mailbox database disk failure server failure
When Microsoft Exchange support DAG removal feature MS exchange
Microsoft describes new feature higher availability feature DAGs Database Mobility
Database Mobility key feature Incremental Deployment system Database Availability Group DAG Mailbox Database Copies How work
The concept DAG function I believe easier learned someone worked Exchange cluster previous
What also great database mobility real flexibility provides deciding utilize HA organization
We see past wanted improve system higher availability Exchange Server must need design implement clustering technology establish exchange server
Microsoft introduce model incremental deployment whereby deploy stand alone Exchange server establishing role need deploy system Mailbox Hub CAS UM
deploy DAG later point time enable high availability
And keep role old rule time server
DAGs involved two server failover clustering service enabled
With failover clustering enabled configured automatically add server DAG feature
We add separate Exchange mailbox server DAG
But need notice still witness server member DAG like file share witness CCR cluster Microsoft Exchange
When added upgrade server DAG able replicate copy database system server DAG using new keep improved continuous replication built Exchange
Key enhancement include native TCP socket stack rather SMB file transfer replicated log
Encryption compression duplication traffic improving security performance administrator
It also create copy single database DAG probable server DAG
Beside instruction manual automatically failover object available establish database server may fails
Conclusion With new Database Availability group functionality Exchange Server ability create high availability solution Mailbox Server level functionality replaces Continuous Cluster Replication CCR Continuous Cluster Replication SCR Exchange Server
The Database Availability Group
It flexible powerful le complex solution combine best world
I really recommend everybody start try MS exchange Database Availability Group whether possible implement company

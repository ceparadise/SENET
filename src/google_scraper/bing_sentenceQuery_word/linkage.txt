In computing take one generated combine single file file another file
A simpler version writes output directly memory called though typically considered separate process
Computer program typically composed several part module need contained within single case refer mean
Typically object file contain three kind symbol For compiler object file result compiling one input source code file
When program comprises multiple object file linker combine file unified executable program resolving symbol go along
Linkers take object collection called
Some linkers include whole library output include symbol referenced object file library
Libraries exist diverse purpose one system library usually linked default
The linker also take care arranging object program
This may involve code assumes specific another base
Since compiler seldom know object reside often assumes fixed base location example zero
Relocating machine code may involve absolute jump load store
The executable output linker may need another relocation pas finally loaded memory execution
This pas usually omitted offering every program put address space conflict even program load base address
This pas may also omitted executable executable
On variant process performed linker assembling object file program called loading executable code onto file
Additionally operating system program handle job linking loading program
Many environment allow dynamic linking postponing resolving undefined symbol program run
That mean executable code still contains undefined symbol plus list object library provide definition
Loading program load well perform final linking
Dynamic linking need linker
This approach offer two advantage There also disadvantage Static linking result linker copying library routine used program executable image
This may require disk space memory dynamic linking portable since require presence library system run
Static linking also prevents DLL Hell since program includes exactly version library routine requires conflict program
In addition program using routine library require entire library installed
As compiler information layout object final output take advantage shorter efficient instruction place requirement address another object
For example jump instruction reference absolute address offset current location offset could expressed different length depending distance target
By generating conservative instruction usually largest relative absolute variant depending platform adding possible substitute shorter efficient instruction final link
This step performed input object read assigned temporary address pas subsequently reassigns address may turn allow relaxation occur
In general substituted sequence shorter allows process always converge best solution given fixed order object case relaxation conflict linker need weigh advantage either option
While instruction relaxation typically occurs relaxation already take place part optimising process
In case relaxation also occur part relocation process combined technique
In environment including mainframe type program known
However linkage name implies additional capability allowing addition replacement deletion individual program section
Operating system different format executable contain supplementary data component section program individual program section replaced part program updated relocatable address reference corrected linkage editor part process
One advantage allows program maintained without keep intermediate object file without program section changed
It also permit program update distributed form small file originally card deck containing object module replaced
In system object code form format image update introduced system using medium
In later release subsequent system contain additional data version component module create traceable record update
Note term linkage editor construed implying program operates mode like example text editor
It strictly intended execution editing command supplied user sequentially organized record unit record medium card deck example DASD medium disk file example tape also supported tape often used initial installation OS

Record linkage RL process finding record across data set
The record people book etc
It become important discipline computer science Big Data
It term used computer engineer among others describe process joining record one source source
It also defined task disambiguate manifestation real world entity various record mention linking grouping
Computer scientist often refer data matching object identity problem
Other name used describe concept include duplicate detection deduplication record matching reference reconciliation object identification integration entity resolution conflation
The algorithm match input record canonicalized record upon receipt RL either Record linkage become increasingly useful health care administration demographic study provision health statistic medical research
It enabled health care administrator researcher It involves cleaning data set consideration particularly key identifier field undergoing data quality assessment prior record linkage RL highly sensitive quality data
It also involves selecting key feature formatting particular format
These could involve simple normalization key identifier mismatch occur
This task involves selecting best attribute distinguish two entity
For record individual say name first name last address email key feature
The goal construct pair record comparison vector similarity score component attribute
Similarity score simply Boolean match real value distance function
This involves developing program perform record linkage processing small sample data executing whole data set
As usually size data set large take lot computation time
This help tweaking algorithm process RL turnaround time reduces considerably test
It important sample data set representative actual data set
After constructed vector similarity pair record must compute probability pair record match
There several method discovering probability match
Two simple proposal use weighted sum average component similarity score use threshold
However extremely hard pick weight tune threshold
Another simple approach rule based matching manual formulation rule set difficult
The Similarity score generated based various algorithm usually string matching like edit distance fuzzy string matching algorithm
generates link based number individual identifier match among available data set
Two record said match via deterministic record linkage procedure identifier certain threshold identical
sometimes called fuzzy matching take different approach record linkage problem taking account wider range potential identifier computing weight identifier based estimated ability correctly identify match using weight calculate probability two given record refer entity
Record pair probability certain threshold considered match pair probability another threshold considered pair fall two threshold considered possible match dealt accordingly
used record linkage like Decision Trees SVMs Ensembles Classifiers Conditional Random Fields etc
The issue Training Set Generation since imbalance class far outnumber match result misclassification
Active Learning method technique used attempt circumvent difficulty training set generation
In approach use concept localization fetch record matching close match based number approach one selecting record hash first name city
Common blocking algorithm include hash based blocking similarity neighborhood based blocking creating complex blocking predicate combining simple blocking predicate
Another approach scale RL process use distributed computing approach

MapReduce used disjoint blocking
Map phase per record computation compute block associate various reducer reduce phase global computation perform pairwise matching
There several important form constraint relevant next section given specific mention Mi Quality record linkage measured following dimension Along two ground truth number total number true match record pair Nm total number true record pair Nu various measure different perspective defined dimension
Several measure listed following It seen sensitivity measure percentage correctly classified record match specificity measure percentage correctly classified

coupling two gene pattern inheritance located chromosome
But actually mean
The recipe life written DNA code
Long string DNA form gene
Each gene code part human recipe
Since different version gene called slightly different recipe make u unique
Our gene organized
Each chromosome long string many many gene attached together
Humans two copy chromosome thus two copy gene
Genetic information must passed along next generation
Humans reproduce sexually mother father contribute one copy gene
Thus resulting offspring correctly two copy one parent
In order pas along one copy gene egg sperm cell undergo process called meiosis split DNA half
In instance shot determining copy included gamete
However since chromosome traveling unit meiosis gene travel together chromosome
In word genetically linked
Remember gene often come one allele
This mean matter two copy get packaged gamete since two copy might different allele
Imagine gene hair color gene eye color
Perhaps one copy contains allele red hair red eye copy allele blue hair blue eye
Since gene chromosome gamete get allele red hair also get allele red eye
A gamete ca get red hair blue eye gene distributed individually
Meiosis distributes one copy chromosome gamete rather distributing one copy gene
Imagine chromosome like calendar different month different gene within calendar
Each calendar month gene calendar different picture different allele
Maybe Calendar A snowy farm scene January summer garden June
Maybe Calendar B Arctic fox January puppy June
Get FREE access day create account
If person gamete need one copy month gene given full attached calendar unit easier distributing month individually
However mean Arctic fox picture always passed together puppy picture
They linked
Nobody get Arctic fox summer garden picture allele different calendar chromosome
Now let add original example
gene height
One chromosome copy allele tallness allele shortness
If gamete get chromosome allele red eye red hair could get packaged either version
It could packaged chromosome allele tallness chromosome allele shortness
The height gene hair color gene unlinked coupled together come inheritance
If go back calendar analogy would like daily planner instead monthly calendar
It would matter monthly calendar could still get daily planner
One option influence
Of course picked daily planner January picture stuck together June picture since linked within daily planner
The monkey wrench simple lesson
This process early meiosis two version chromosome swap DNA
In case red hair gene get swapped blue hair gene red eye packaged chromosome blue hair
Now allele linked instead original red allele
It truly game changer
caused two gene located chromosome
A long string many many gene attached together
The two gene travel together meiosis important separating chromosome pair
This mean linked different version gene often inherited together occur egg sperm cell often gene different chromosome figure looking often occur together new offspring
But discovered monkey wrench thrown whole thing process early meiosis two version chromosome swap DNA
It disrupts typical genetic linkage really called game changer

Linkage generally refers physical state linked due chromosomal organization genome
Linkage disequilibrium refers presence statistical association allelic variant within population due history recombination mutation selection genomic region
You also get linkage disequilibrium due epistatic interaction locus necessarily physically linked
Think way absence selection recombination break association allelic variant adjacent locus
The tightly locus physically linked longer process take
Thus physically linked locus likely show significant linkage disequilibrium correspondence LD ultimately depending process mutation gene flow selection recombination within population
It possibly pay start defining linkage equilibrium
Say two gene A B two allele respectively A B b
If recombination completely free truly random surveyed population might expect find possible combination allele equal frequency
In example allele combination would AB Ab aB ab
And expect find one population
That equilibrium one another
If survey population find possible allele combination found equal frequency say allele display linkage disequilibrium
There several reason linkage disequilibria occur principle one people talking genetic linkage
Genetic linkage tendency gene extension allele physically close one another chromosome inherited together
Specifically tendency gene NOT undergo recombination
Any pair gene linkage cause display linkage disequilibrium recombination truly random
And amount disequilibrium observe connected far apart chromosome linked gene
This apart likely recombination event happen
Linkage disequilibrium refers state allele linked

If got allele A linked allele b
And see Ab AB aB linkage disequilibrium
You expect haplotype ab ab exist recombination forced allele apart yet

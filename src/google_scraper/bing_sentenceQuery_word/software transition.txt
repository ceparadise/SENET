Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I currently hold BA Middle Eastern History pretty good fit last job Army
I getting ready move civillian world computer always hobby I like look turning career
My question Should I look getting second undergrad would programming education certificate enough get foot door school later
Are online certificate respected enough especially addition traditional degree
I basically want know set sight order get going software development
Getting additional qualification seems necessary kind make sense getting started
I think going depend vastly kind position want headed deep rabbit hole wish go
The one thing I would say ought focus fundamental No matter kind work end programming business process pursuing PhD getting fundamental straight pay dividend
Courses algorithm software engineering computer architecture give different view work matter
A CS undergraduate degree would good choice especially grad study want go
I understand vary quality though something bear mind
I teach aimed people like earned bachelor degree field CS want transition CS order go software engineering although also teaching
While quick cheap program usually better choice second bachelor degree since student take anything CS related math course many peer similar position
Depending aiming
working tech
company versus professor may enough qualification already
The programming industry still industry extremely forgiving qualification necessary work
This likely due age industry nature
If feel need traditional preparation site like others provide Massively Open Online Courses MOOC great place get CS course take Intro course advanced one free paid certificate also available
Also working real open source project one place start looking align interest skill proved capable great resume item
From written I think well spending time finding company need skill already hobbyist likely know lest one language pretty well practicing skill

refers informal paradigm context describes change communication mechanism function communication system particular service component
In transition communication mechanism within system replaced functionally comparable mechanism aim ensure highest possible quality captured
Transitions enable communication system adapt changing condition runtime
This change condition example rapid increase load certain service may caused large gathering people mobile device
A transition often impact multiple mechanism different communication layer
Mechanisms given conceptual element networked communication system linked specific functional unit example service protocol component
In case mechanism also comprise entire protocol
For example transmission layer LTE regarded mechanism
Following definition exist numerous communication mechanism partly equivalent basic functionality local wireless network UMTS broadband wireless connection
For example LTE equivalent basic functionality technologically significantly different design operation
Mechanisms affected transition often component protocol service
For example case video use different video data encoding carried depending available data transmission rate
These change controlled implemented transition A research example video adaptation service support mobile video application
Through analyzing current process communication system possible determine transition need executed communication layer order meet quality requirement
In order communication system adapt respective framework condition architectural approach adaptive system used MAPE cycle
This central concept used determine state communication system analyze monitoring data plan execute necessary transition
A central goal user consciously perceive transition running application functionality used service perceived smooth fluid
The study new fundamental design method model technique enable automated coordinated transition functionally similar mechanism within communication system main goal collaborative research center funded German research foundation DFG
The DFG collaborative research center MAKI Adaptation future Internet focus research question following area Fundamental research transition method ii Techniques adapting communication system basis achieved targeted quality iii specific exemplary transition communication system regarded different technical perspective

During last decade increasing emphasis placed need carefully planned transition program help student integrate university
In paper critically examine experience designing running successive transition program Computer Science Software Engineering student
Over last three year trialled several model
At present program requires entering student enrolled transition subject Making Connections run half semester
The subject led designated academic staff serf forum student learn department university
The program includes language study skill assessment component including task
Students extend subject taking academic skill workshop run university student support service
We found compulsion useful facilitator student engagement addition objective assessment task beneficial

When referring video slide effect happens photo slide video clip
For example fade transition used fade picture slide show
The transition adjusted Microsoft PowerPoint clicking Transitions tab
Once Transitions section see available Transitions click arrow scroll view available Transitions
Clicking transition give overview transition
Clicking allows change direction option effect
allow sound Transition
allows increase decrease duration time effect
There dozen type transition used program

Anyone learn study school
Here I transformed career biologist programmer
Originally published Be proactive learning code whether online course letting others review code
Do focus know
Two half year ago I made switch pursuing PhD biology working real world software developer
Here tip I picked along way may helpful anyone thinking transitioning software engineering career
I started studying biology college absolutely fascinating
I loved learning life work basic metabolic pathway allow u break food energy development highly complex multicellular organism like
But I went graduate school quickly became apparent spending day biology lab hope making groundbreaking scientific discovery would fulfilling I thought
I joined lab used computational method study RNA splicing
I thrilled dry lab meant I performed research solely computer performing analysis sequencing data gathered lab member
As month went though I realized passion lay using software analyze data rather creating tool
After I knew I wanted switch career I started study software engineering filling gap computer science knowledge trying learn coding best practice
If still registered school try add couple CompSci class schedule even within field study
I pleasantly surprised grad program flexibility fact I could take class computer science department
If graduated take massive open online course MOOC idea
If friend program join meetup group find people like want learn people experience want share expertise
Next know little bit coding account programming tool add existing code share prospective employer start new project keep fresh
GitHub account free best place swap idea code programmer online
This sound harsh worthwhile philosophy embrace
If interview interviewer may ask something like would implement hash Rather getting defensive saying never took algorithm class undergrad fact environmental science major stop think anything know hash map
Maybe come across reading learned side project
Start know work
You need reveal weakness formally studied interviewer probably know difference expertly talk know rather
You may think degree sociolinguistics worth anything trying switch career path fooled
You learned lot transferrable skill getting degree sense throwing away
Some knowledge I worked diligently drive memory may never used job Betterment I doubt I ever need draw amino acid structure thank goodness
However analytical skill I used dissect dense scientific paper I apply toward parsing complicated tax law algorithm correctly calculates disallowed loss tricky wash sale rule overlap rule prevents double counting loss municipal bond dividend
Rather thinking old degree waste time discovered software engineering think stepping stone way new career
It something make stand sea applicant took traditional route given unique perspective software engineering

A plural simply mathematical
It exactly one finite number given time
The FSM change one state another response external change one state another called
An FSM defined list state initial state condition transition
The behavior state machine observed many device modern society perform predetermined sequence action depending sequence event presented
Examples dispense product proper combination coin deposited whose sequence stop determined floor requested rider change sequence car waiting require input combination number proper order
The finite state machine le computational power model computation
The computational power distinction mean computational task Turing machine FSM
This FSM limited number state
FSMs studied general field
An example simple mechanism modeled state machine
A turnstile used control access subway amusement park ride gate three rotating arm waist height one across entryway
Initially arm locked blocking entry preventing patron passing
Depositing coin slot turnstile unlocks arm allowing single customer push
After customer pass arm locked another coin inserted
Considered state machine turnstile two possible state
There two possible input affect state putting coin slot pushing arm
In locked state pushing arm effect matter many time input given stay locked state
Putting coin giving machine input shift state
In unlocked state putting additional coin effect giving additional input change state
However customer pushing arm giving input shift state back
The turnstile state machine represented showing possible state transition based upon input given machine output resulting input The turnstile state machine also represented called
Each state represented
Edges show transition one state another
Each arrow labeled input trigger transition
An input cause change state input state represented circular arrow returning original state
The arrow node black dot indicates initial state
A description status system waiting execute
A transition set action executed condition fulfilled event received
For example using audio system listen radio system radio state receiving next stimulus result moving next station
When system CD state next stimulus result moving next track
Identical stimulus trigger different action depending current state
In machine representation also possible associate action state Several type used
The common representation shown combination current state
B input
Y show next state
C
The complete action information directly described table added using footnote
A FSM definition including full action information possible using see also
The notation describing state machine
overcome limitation traditional finite state machine retaining main benefit
UML state machine introduce new concept extending notion
UML state machine characteristic
They support depend state system triggering Mealy machine well associated state rather transition Moore machine
The standard includes graphical symbol describe action transition SDL embeds basic data type called Abstract Data Types action language execution semantic order make finite state machine executable
There large number variant represent FSM one figure
In addition use modeling reactive system presented finite state machine significant many different area including
Finite state machine class automaton studied
In computer science finite state machine widely used modeling application behavior design study computation language
Finite state machine subdivided transducer acceptor classifier sequencer
also called produce binary output indicating whether received input accepted
Each state FSM either accepting accepting
Once input received current state accepting state input accepted otherwise rejected
As rule input character action used
The example figure show finite state machine accepts string nice
In FSM accepting state state
A possibly infinite set symbol sequence aka
formal language called Finite State Machine accepts exactly set
For example set binary string even number zero regular language cf
Fig
set string whose length prime number
A machine could also described defining language would contain every string accepted machine none rejected one language accepted machine
By definition language accepted FSMs language regular FSM accepts
The problem determining language accepted given finite state acceptor instance generalization graph edge weighted element arbitrary
The start state also accepting state case automaton accepts empty string
An example accepting state appears DFA detects whether input string contains even number
also start state indicates state even number input
S therefore accepting state
This machine finish accept state binary string contains even number including binary string containing
Examples string accepted DFA etc
A generalization finite state machine similar acceptor produce single output termination two terminal state
generate output based given input state using action
They used control application field
In control application two type distinguished subclass acceptor transducer type
They produce one sequence seen output sequence acceptor transducer output
A distinction automaton
In deterministic automaton every state exactly one transition possible input
In automaton input lead one one transition given state
The algorithm transform nondeterministic automaton usually complex deterministic automaton identical functionality
A finite state machine one state called combinatorial FSM
It allows action upon transition state
This concept useful case number finite state machine required work together convenient consider purely combinatorial part form FSM suit design tool
There set semantics available represent state machine
For example tool modeling designing logic embedded controller
They combine usually one current state flow graph one language resulting different formalism set semantics
These chart like Harel original state machine support hierarchically nested state state action transition action
In accordance general classification following formal definition found For deterministic FSMs conventional allow
defined every combination
If FSM state next symbol defined announce error
reject input
This useful definition general state machine le useful transforming machine
Some algorithm default form may require total function
A finite state machine computational power restricted head may perform read operation always move left right
That formal language accepted finite state machine accepted kind restricted Turing machine vice versa
If output function function state input alphabet definition corresponds modelled
If output function depends state definition corresponds modelled
A machine output function known
If disregard first output symbol Moore machine readily converted Mealy machine setting output function every Mealy transition
labeling every edge output symbol given destination Moore state
The converse transformation le straightforward Mealy machine state may different output label incoming transition edge
Every state need split multiple Moore machine state one every incident output symbol
Optimizing FSM mean finding machine minimum number state performs function
The fastest known algorithm
Other technique include using
Additionally acyclic FSAs minimized linear time
In FSM may built using
More specifically hardware implementation requires store state variable block determines state transition second block combinational logic determines output FSM
One classic hardware implementation
In output directly connected state minimizing time delay output
Through state machine may optimized minimize power consumption
The following concept commonly used build software application finite state machine Finite automaton often used programming language compiler
Such frontend may comprise several finite state machine implement parser
Starting sequence character lexical analyzer build sequence language token reserved word literal identifier parser build syntax tree
The lexical analyzer parser handle regular part programming language grammar

Analyzing Ethical Scenarios Abstract One approach teaching ethical issue related computer technology use ethical scenario case study
Unfortunately author text area give concrete methodology analyzing scenario
Students therefore tend flounder asked instance write essay event depicted scenario
This paper provides methodology analyzing scenario
Introduction In Computing Curriculum report Association Computing Machinery conjunction Institute Electrical Electronic Engineers identified first time importance including social professional context part core curriculum computer science major Tucker
According report undergraduate also need understand basic cultural social legal ethical issue inherent discipline computing page
There several technique employed order present topic student
The popular technique appears variously called short narrative one event involve one ethical issue
The intent student reading scenario expected analyze participant action arrive judgment concerning ethical nature
Such scenario related field computing first illustrated John Parker conducted workshop attended diverse group professional including computer scientist psychologist sociologist lawyer Parker
The group task analyze numerous scenario related computing specifically attempting identify ethical issue involved
Parker goal develop concept unethical practice unique prevalent computer science technology field final result used development explicit code ethic among AFIPS constituent society pp

While seminal work provides general framework analyzing scenario unfortunately detailed enough use undergraduate computer science setting
In addition framework assumes participant fact expert field
This hardly assumed scenario analyzed undergraduate student may yet marginally experienced even computing
Many recent author followed Parker lead however include type scenario text
For instance Forester Morrison include section lengthy scenario end book used discussion
Each scenario meant illustrate particular aspect ethic addressed chapter
Dejoie includes list short scenario adapted Parker
Rosenberg provides several case study along analysis
He note study may useful teaching student behave ethically least would identify ethical dilemma facing computer professional
Course syllabus circulated National Conference Computing Values indicate scenario analysis widely used technique ethic education computer science student
However none reference suggest methodology analyzing scenario appropriate undergraduate even graduate level
Suggesting use Parker technique instance would require student able extract underlying ethical principle address issue scenario without suggesting done
This clearly expecting much undergraduate student many weak understanding ethical theory ability perform critical analysis general writing skill
While best student might somewhat successful indefinite task majority student tend flounder easily becoming disenchanted entire exercise
It necessary therefore provide student approaching task
This would provide mean organizing information scenario well thought preliminarily attempting write
This technique organizing common within realm critical writing
The revered student technique outlining one form
Guides clear writing also provide clue detailed methodology
Trimble instance section critical analysis suggests student range back forth plot pursuit textual evidence support viewpoint critic taking using detail demonstrate point
Following one method approaching analysis currently used student enrolled computer science course Social Consequences Computing Millersville University
The intent methodology assist student breaking scenario component part order better isolate organize key element
The Methodology The following set guideline allows student dissect scenario place issue identified social context take advantage available tool various code ethic analyzing ethical issue presented
This approach analogous classical computer programming methodology known
The idea programming technique break large problem successively smaller presumably easily solved problem solution become obvious
The total solution problem constructed carefully recombining smaller solution
Every computer science major entirely familiar comfortable using technique time junior general student mastered approach survive level
However student might completely home using technique creating computer program also often highly intimidated task critically analyzing prose
While student undoubtedly taught outlining method developing essay various writing course method one putting piece together proper order
The task critical analysis however begin breaking idea expressed prose component part
The essential idea issue must identified
The purpose proposed methodology assist student decomposition
Once accomplished student use traditional writing technique develop essay student present opinion scenario along argument supported material text scenario
To begin consider Scenario adapted Parker
While might possible practicing professional several year experience form valid opinion scenario much difficult student
Interactive Human Judgment System The spokesperson union airline maintenance worker charge airline introduced computer program perform function require interactive human judgment safety ensured
The program one schedule maintenance reassigns aircraft emergency arise airplane unexpectedly become unusable
The system analyst whose direction program written aware operational factor taken consideration program assured management decision rule used program conform requirement IATA International Air Transport Association
In opinion program interactive one person involved final decision making company prepared go additional expense interactive system
When testing program could devise example existing program produced action failed meet safety condition
Because could document reason doubt also part inclined defensive work asked testify inquiry dealing union complaint volunteer opinion system designed
Scenario
The following step assist student analyzing scenario
List Participants Their Actions Make list participant involved respective action
This list include following group participant taken specific obvious action participant acted upon otherwise affected action primary participant mentioned scenario take direct action participant specifically identified name may stake outcome event described scenario implied participant may primary secondary nature
In Scenario might list following participant action Primary Participants Systems analyst designed program knowing operational factor taken account informed management concern failed volunteer opinion testifying Airline management disregarded analyst concern indicated decision rule used program conform IATA requirement opposed making system interactive Union spokesperson charge airline ignoring safety factor Union file complaint airline Inquiry board hold hearing Secondary Participants Maintenance worker must use new maintenance software IATA set requirement airplane maintenance Implied Participants Programming staff primary implemented system analyst design Airplane crew passenger secondary must travel plane maintained developed system Reduce List Simplifying Assumptions It somewhat obvious many listed participant minimal interest analysis scenario
Their action either trivial direct concern ethically
It happens list participant action often wind kitchen sink situation every possible person even remotely associated event listed
It important weed limited impact real issue addressed scenario
Clearly need cut list manageable length time spent analyzing people issue truly interest
For instance perhaps assumed union acted good faith filing charge airline engaged grandstanding sake publicity attempting harass management contract negotiation
If union complaint legitimate ignore action matter need comment final written analysis scenario
Other simplification include There distinction union spokesperson union
The inquiry board legitimate job properly
The IATA established sound maintenance requirement aircraft
The union represents maintenance worker distinction group extent distinction unimportant scenario
While main issue appears overall safety crew passenger stating obvious probably eliminated list
While defense I followed order hardly legitimate many case programming team actual implementation probably eliminated consideration assumption followed standard programming practice coding program system
Another consideration system analyst charge outcome project therefore developed specification programmer implemented
As result assumption participant except system analyst airline management eliminated
While reduction perhaps obvious certain respect necessary go step including participant eliminate sake completeness
It easy assume mentioned prominently scenario one impact final analysis
Legal Considerations Certainly action law unethical
List law cover action discussed scenario clearly student must introduced pertinent law regarding privacy hacking etc
Obviously student expected knowledgeable lawyer aspect applicable law
However least aware major law directly related field
A subset legal consideration company policy
There may current law govern particular action may company policy requires prohibits certain action
Such policy must explicitly stated given scenario never assumed
Although text pertinent law sample company policy may readily available undergraduate student concept introduced overlooked eventually situation
Also law policy prohibiting action mean action ethical
In example scenario likely many law pertaining regulation airline industry
The IATA must authority matter since developed set maintenance requirement
It impossible however analyze probably lengthy numerous set law might bearing case
One must assume violation law determined board inquiry
A legal issue would pertinent case however would liability law
What liability airline management assume case airplane crash due faulty maintenance
system analyst
programming staff
maintenance worker
While would take legal specialist great deal time present entire set law legal decision affect case clearly important provide guidance student issue
Clearly system present special problem liability
Students least made aware liability issue discus employer perhaps good attorney
List Possible Options Participants Make list option participant may chose path action described scenario
While list could potentially infinite
participant could committed suicide clearly pertinent viable option need listed
The scenario may list option faced participant
In case option implied
Obviously participant chose Action A Action B C etc
chosen must known reader going make judgment ethical behavior
This list help ascertain whether existed another alternative participant purely ethical whether participant perhaps chosen least option
In Scenario analyst could refused participate design unless operational factor incorporated suggested involving maintenance worker design effort contacted IATA directly concern offered opinion inquiry board contacted medium concern The airline management could involved maintenance worker design effort ensured operational factor incorporated design taken system analyst advice agreed allow system include interactive feature List Possible Justifications Participants Actions In order evaluate participant may chosen respective response situation compile list many reason might suggested scenario
List justification explicitly offered scenario well justification make sense careful make assumption
For instance considering possible justification main participant scenario easy suggest defense similar situation make kind decision
In scenario analyst may justify action case stating simply followed management decision
could prove problem even additional testing
professional opinion might taken simply hunch system deficient
The airline management might state cost redesigning system interactive use prohibitively expensive could put company financially precarious position
fact meet IATA requirement reason stringent maintenance process
unreasonable expect company base expensive redesign single employee hunch however informed expert person
It important list limited legitimate justification simply compilation unless somehow explicitly stated scenario
List Key Statements List quotation text important analysis
These probably used create part previous list mostly obvious
Jot phrase used basis previously listed item
These phrase might follow action begin explicit implied though
Other important phrase include indicate secrecy getting approval telling anyone
Unmistakable indicator expression suggest participant refusal accept responsibility action statement participant make excuse behavior statement demonstrate personal gain main participant
For scenario following phrase important operational factor taken consideration assured management decision rule used program conform requirement IATA
company prepared go additional expense could devise example existing program produced action failed meet safety condition
volunteer opinion system designed
List Questions Raised According Parker reader make assumption regarding else happened scenario
He warns assuming one thing happened infer circumstance leading event
He instructs reader rely strictly included scenario excess baggage might carried analysis reader
Otherwise may follow lengthy deliberation exploring extension given scenario may result discussion situation vaguely resembles original scenario
However natural language ambiguous nature
No matter carefully particular scenario might crafted regardless exhortation rely solely directly supportable text instance ambiguous given scenario
In addition often simply unknowable piece information direct bearing outcome scenario
In Scenario instance standard design programming practice followed project
There information available within scenario assist answering question
One could argue great deal hinge answer one question however
It must considered ambiguity point fundamental flaw scenario
author craft case carefully enough
One would think important goal developing scenario would make entirely unambiguous
The nature natural language however make nearly impossible task
Other question might raised example scenario include Was issue including representative maintenance crew design team ever brought
Was conscious decision exclude
Could analysis done demonstrate efficacy interactive system
What prototype
Should computer ever given sole authority matter human life clearly risk
This last question course widely ultimately focal point discussion
Real life full ambiguity
The vagary natural language make ambiguity nearly set statement inevitable
Although human being generally adept dealing ambiguity regular basis clearly would need extensive legal system modern society agreed interpretation event statement etc
It necessary least acknowledge ambiguity exist even carefully crafted statement
Thus necessary perform amount exploration various possible interpretation scenario might evoke multiple reader
Other Models Related Issues Scenarios computer science may appear unique broken piece distilled action irrespective hardware environment involved may similar real world system ethical issue largely resolved
These model serve analogy given situation
Once relationship two seemingly dissimilar scenario made obvious conclusion may easier draw
Using example electronic mail look model presented usage telephone postal system mail
When ask company right monitor electronic mail might ask similar question employer right monitor employee phone call open employee letter read someone memo
Questions like may answered quite emphatically existing model could applied seemingly new yet question raised application
This similar notion homomorphism discrete mathematics
Nearly system might serve analogy example scenario
The disaster certainly come mind
Another incident Challenger space shuttle
One analogy might come mind would development Mercury space capsule
After input original seven astronaut intended initially passenger pilot capsule heavily modified include flight control
Clearly instance became crucial involve immediately affected automated system direct user
Comparison Codes Ethics The revised Code Ethics ACM member appeared February
Other profession Data Processing Management Association Institute Electrical Electronics Engineers published similar Codes Ethics used governing action member
The action scenario participant compared directly established code looking instance apply
Many code listed appropriate text use course social consequence computing
Huff Finholt Dejoie
A comprehensive list code also available via Internet Codes Conduct Codes Ethics Around World address http
It important student exposed code given opportunity
For example least following ACM principle apply Contribute society human
Avoid harm others
Be honest trustworthy
Strive achieve highest quality professional work
Give comprehensive thorough evaluation computer system impact including analysis possible risk
Manage personnel resource design build information system enhance quality working life
Ensure user need clearly articulated assessment design requirement
In addition following Data Processing Management Association DPMA rule apply As member I shall Accept full responsibility work I perform
Not misrepresent withhold information concerning capability equipment software system
Never misrepresent withhold information germane problem situation public concern allow known information remain unchallenged
It pointed rule clearly applied system analyst evaluating action le clear meaning term evaluating airline management action
It unfair hold ethical standard set professional organization
However since two participant essentially antagonist scenario support one participant undermines position
What derived list statement analyst might use support case board inquiry directly management
The Place Ethical Theory The reader undoubtedly notice discussion ethical theory methodology
This intentional several reason
First course methodology applied computer science course philosophy course
Whether ethical theory taught course certainly timeless issue debate
It intention revisit debate
The reality situation little class time available detailed presentation ethical theory depth student might reasonably expected apply
In addition student appear little affinity theory great difficulty internalizing
Second clear learning theory make student adept solving ethical conundrum
Furthermore faced dilemma become professional ability cite specific ethical theory might view situation either help make decision defend management
A significant reason including ethical theory methodology however would redundant
The code ethic conduct professional organization already incorporate particular point view nature ethic applied profession
While code might satisfy philosopher either form content nonetheless expression profession position ethic
Historically code often viewed somewhat superfluous little flowery sentiment practical aspect
This methodology point however code indeed put practical use
Composition Once student follows methodology completion task decomposition student must reassemble part coherent essay must construct
The student numerous small part draw composition process
It student select important item various list discus essay
One caveat however student tend view decomposition methodology outline final essay
Without additional direction develop essay frequently simply start step process write information list paragraph move step list write short time etc
reach end step
While may produce coherent presentation information also creates rather uninteresting essay sounding essentially whether positive thing moot point
Students must typically encouraged use creativity liven final review presentation fact
Conclusions Experience teaching methodology date somewhat mixed
Some student appear like others
This attitude may due number factor least student approach writing process
For student written assignment despised adding process top task might serve make task even onerous
Another reason student dislike nature task
Most student seem prefer dealing question clearly definable right answer
The methodology presented paper way attempt come process produce single answer ethical dilemma considered right
However student almost universally trained expect outcome science class experiment clearly one correct solution also social science humanity class type assignment test given rely heavily question student expected answer particular way
In addition difficult instructor provide appropriate feedback student question answer
It often difficult explain student got grade although clearly instructor justify particular grade way student understand good cause suspicious grade
There certain subjectivity evaluation student performance task scenario analysis
While instructor prefer think case much difficult defend evaluation true evaluating significant writing assignment consider favorite literature author
While problem likely disappear major positive result methodology override negative
Experience computer science major enrolled course Social Consequences Computing required course CS major Millersville University show clearly methodology improves performance student scenario analysis
The quality paper risen significantly since methodology introduced especially case marginal student
In addition methodology actually provide way professor defend would normally appear purely subjective grade
If student omitted certain aspect analysis professor point area lacking suggest student overlooked one aspect another hence resulting grade
In addition student analysis could graded completeness well used checklist grading final essay
One additional benefit methodology parallel process student already familiar namely structured programming
Not make new process understandable student provides concomitant strengthening understanding methodology use programming task well
To date evaluation methodology anecdotal
A rigorous study method awaits future research could take either qualitative attitudinal approach
However overall reaction student favorable general

We often speak distinction origin operational science
What distinguishes
Does God see differently u
CMI discus question today feedback United States writes CMI responds Dear Jeffrey As explain several item distinction origin operational science latter deal thing repeatable observable
If I tell water boil degree Celsius well test many time like
All operational science like principle even get lot complex
Origins science take find operational science try apply past explain see present
Criminal forensic science popularized unrealistically many popular TV series instance try use evidence reconstruct crime figure happened committed crime
To much larger degree origin science try take know biology chemistry geology today extrapolate back try find thing earth past
see
Origins science trying answer historical question get happened past give u today
And origin science invalid creationist geologist cosmologist example engage sort origin science instance hypothesizes certain condition Flood led dinosaur egg track bonebeds see today see
The difference evolutionary origin science creationist origin science creationists realize nature question therefore turn
inform sort big historical event may caused see today see
There still debate among creationist scientist instance thing like plate tectonics stage Flood certain stratum represent u Bible give u historical scaffold hang idea see
It would common evolutionist say dependence Bible give u historical framework operational science bias u way unacceptable true scientist
But evolutionary scientist scaffolding hang idea
For instance many different idea relationship various group animal related assume million year evolution
Not even finding like numerous evidence genetic code organism alarming rate doom including u except Jesus promised return first finding make question scaffold even absorb scaffold
So word operational science stuff requires lab coat goggles run experiment collect data
Origins science try apply result explain happened past explain see world today
And surprisingly origin science limited godless evolutionist something creationists informed historical record Scripture glory God Creator
Does God recognize distinction operation origin science
In one sense truth God truth distinction level correspondence reality historical truth scientific truth
Nevertheless even God recognizes difference natural regularity operation science investigates history origin science investigates
God testifies certain unrepeatable event past

Neither know God apart act history including authorship Bible accurately reflect His eternal unchangeable nature sufficiently u know Him
Moreover God judge u without appealing relevant act past event perspective Judgment Day
But neither act apart God sustaining universe way amenable operation science investigation

Both science history investigation temporal activity operate respect creation
God genuinely interacts u ground u time immediately miracle witness mediately ordinary providence though He subject time
Therefore He conceptual distinction history science essentially made website even He definable
Sincerely Lita Cosner Great response explanation Lita
Your statement The difference evolutionary origin science creationist origin science creationists realize historical nature question therefore turn historical
inform sort big historical event may caused see today instructive
While know historical text written men accept writing inspiration Holy Spirit
I help wonder latter part evolutionist would use historical text explain origin science since rely almost exclusively men writing prop theory assumption
What shame pity choose close mind instruction ultimate teacher dependable witness history world
Somhow question also seems suggest God would make distinction operational science origin science might regard one
Ultimately I think point His glory
Operational science respect thinking God thought Him declaring glory God excuse recognizing Him origin science believing His Word message salvation contained therein
It estimation God would want u know difference two science ultimately point Him
We created glorifying Him attitude towards science support believe faith Him something separate ralations Him
Thank CMI wonderfull material support Biblical attitude towards science
Truth seeking scientist need careful investigation operate framework natural process God made orderly universe never exclude possibility miraculous
God sovereign law
After evolutionist believe miracle spontaneous generation
Bible believing scientist must never operate assumption natural process possible
That said God wise enough made creation way much happens naturally
I vigorously object use expression Origin Science
SCIENCE definition body knowledge established mean SCIENTIFIC METHOD
Terms like Origin Science Social Science Medical Science NOT really SCIENCE accept Hypotheses mean CONSENSUS STATISTICAL LEVELS OF CONFIDENCE
CMI reached CONSENSUS interpreting Bible
Likewise Secular Psychologist reach CONSENSUS HOMOSEXUALITY NORMAL Biologists reach CONSENSUS Darwinian Evolution SCIENCE
However CONSENSUS NOT Science

I love work spirit CMI defeat LIE Darwinian Evolution return true simple definition SCIENCE

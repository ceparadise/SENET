The literary meaning word cohesion consistency organization different unit
In computer science software engineering cohesion refers level strength unity different component software program
It remained norm software engineering software program developed different function module module separate task associated
Cohesion software determines strength source code comprehended exploring associative principle type calculating method
The concept cohesion introduced capture feature program software engineering domain
This concept make easy determine module software program indicates rapidly perform different task assigned
Increased cohesion software program obtained identical operation performed different module inversely proportional decreased number module
This mean software program designed perform multiple task multiple module higher probability lower cohesion negatively affect overall performance effectiveness computing machine
Associative principle software cohesion refer relationship type software module corresponding action operation
These principle collectively constitute cohesion software program vary according different operational requirement
There seven associative principle formalized seven type software cohesion includes coincidental logical temporal procedural communicational sequential functional cohesion
Each cohesion type unique associative principle associated define action property software module
There certain property associated cohesion software engineering
For instance software constituted three different module similar term action overall cohesion software program increase
Similarly cohesion decrease module entirely different unique action associated
Furthermore cohesion software program also dependent upon type data process inversely proportional increased number data type
Cohesion software program analysis quantitative qualitative method
In qualitative measurement process textual code software program analyzed taking different sample evaluating according coding standard respective programming language
In contrast quantitative evaluation cohesion identifies number module constituted within software program evaluates action according scale

learn share knowledge build career
I learning computer programming several place I stumbled upon concept cohesion I understand desirable software high cohesion mean
I Java C Python programmer learning book Primer mention cohesion without index could point link topic
I find wikipedia page computer science cohesion informative since say qualitative measure give real code example
High cohesion class well defined job
Low cohesion class lot job much common
Let take example You class add two number class creates window displaying result
This low cohesive class window adding operation much common
The window visual part program adding function logic behind
To create high cohesive solution would create class Window class Sum
The window call Sum method get result display
This way develop separately logic GUI application
An explanation Steve McConnell Cohesion refers closely routine class code routine
Classes contain described strong cohesion heuristic goal make cohesion strong possible
Cohesion useful tool managing complexity code class support central purpose easily brain remember everything code
Some way achieving Uncle Bob Classes
Each method class manipulate one variable
In general class
A class variable used method maximally cohesive
In general neither advisable possible create maximally cohesive class hand would like cohesion high
When cohesion high mean method variable class hang together logical whole
The notion cohesion strongly related notion coupling also principle based heuristic high cohesion named Single Responsibility Principle S SOLID
High cohesion software engineering concept
Basically say class supposed fully
Do overload function supposed whatever directly related appear code class either
Example quite subjective since also consider scale
A simple program modularized fragmented complex program may need level abstraction take care complexity

Email class
It contains data member cc bcc subject body may contain method saveAsDraft send discardDraft
But login since number email protocol implemented separately
Cohesion usually measured using one LCOM Lack cohesion metric original LCOM metric came Chidamber Kemerer
See example A concrete example If class example one private field three method three method use field perform operation class cohesive
Pseudo code cohesive class If class example three private field three method three method use one three field class poorly cohesive
Pseudo code poorly cohesive class The class one thing principle come Robert Martin one principle
The principle prescribes class one reason change
Staying close Single Responsibility Principle could possibly result cohesive code opinion two different thing
This example low cohesion But high cohesion implies function class supposed like named
And function job function
So following example high cohesion cohesion mean class method one defined job
name method class also
example write calculator name class calculator asdfghj
also consider create method task
subtract add etc programmer might use program future know exactly method
good naming reduce commenting effort also principle DRY repeat A general way think principle cohesion locate code along code either depend upon depends
Cohesion applied level composition class level
For instance package namespace ideally contain class relate common theme heavily dependent

keep dependency local
article probably informative Wikipedia case
The term cohesion originally used describe module source code qualitative measure well source code module related
The idea cohesion used variety field
For instance group people military unit may cohesive meaning people unit work together towards common goal
The essence source code cohesion source code module work together towards common well defined goal
The minimum amount source code needed create module output module
The interface well defined input flow interface output flow back interface
There side effect emphasis minimalism
A benefit functionally cohesive module developing automating unit test straightforward
In fact good measure cohesion module easy create full set exhaustive unit test module
A module may class object oriented language function functional language oriented language Much original work area measuring cohesion mostly involved work COBOL program IBM back cohesion definitely object oriented concept
The original intent research concept cohesion associated concept coupling came research characteristic program easy understand maintain extend
The goal able learn best practice programming codify best practice teach practice programmer
The goal good programmer write source code whose cohesion high possible given environment problem solved
This implies large application part source code body vary part level cohesion source code module class
Some time best get temporal sequential cohesion due problem trying solve
The best level cohesion functional cohesion
A module functional cohesion similar mathematical function provide set input get specific output
A truly functional module side effect addition output maintain kind state
It instead well defined interface encapsulates functionality module without exposing internals module person using module provide particular set input get particular output return
A truly functional module thread safe well
Many programming language library contain number example functional module whether class template function
The functional cohesive example would mathematical function sin cosine square root etc
Other function may side effect maintain state kind resulting making use function complicated
For instance function throw exception set global error variable C must used sequence function example Standard C library maintains internal state provides pointer must managed issue log log utility example function longer functional cohesion
I read Yourdon Constantine original book Structured Programming I first came across idea cohesion Meilir book Practical Guide Structured Systems Design much better job describing coupling cohesion
The Yourdon Constantine book seems bit academic
Steve McConnell book Code Complete quite good practical revised edition quite bit say good programming practice

There many way describe water
It cool refreshing swimming pool warm comforting bathtub
Water
A universal solvent wash away dirt life
But would ever use word describe water
Probably
If anything water useful washing stickiness away
If closely examine water smallest form atom molecule however find sense
Not sticky like child hand eating lollipop sticky cohesive way
In lesson examine cohesion water take closer look property water make molecule attracted one another
Cohesion water property water molecule make together
To better understand water cohesion need zoom teaspoonful water
In teaspoon hundred drop water
And individual drop find million water molecule
But exactly make water molecule
A made one atom oxygen two atom hydrogen
As may already know molecular formula
The oxygen hydrogen atom held tightly together bond
But fully understand water cohesion must zoom even water molecule examine smallest component atom
An smallest building block matter
Atoms tiny ca seen naked eye
Yet make every single thing universe
Atoms combine form molecule molecule combine form element make matter
You think atom tiniest Lego piece set
If attach several Legos together form subunit larger structure
These subunit represent molecule matter
Atoms composed three smaller particle called proton electron neutron
carry positive charge carry negative charge neutral
Neutrons proton found center atom
Electrons found orbiting around nucleus quickly move almost speed light
It electron involved attaching atom together make molecule
Electrons found different level orbit depending many electron present atom
Sometimes atom bond together sharing electron outer level
These called
Are wondering relates back water cohesion
Let look water molecule
One oxygen atom bonded two hydrogen atom
As mentioned atom held together bond
This covalent bond created oxygen atom share outer electron electron two hydrogen atom
Although oxygen atom sharing electron two hydrogen atom electron tend attracted oxygen atom
This oxygen hydrogen meaning stronger pull electron
This creates imbalance charge within molecule
If boat everyone moved one side balance entire boat would thrown
Likewise charge water molecule unbalanced electron lean toward oxygen
The side molecule oxygen atom negative side hydrogen molecule positive
Get FREE access day create account
Okay part finally relate back sticky water molecule
Imagine water molecule floating around together
You probably already know opposite attract
Therefore negative charge attracts positive charge
What happen slightly negative side one water molecule come contact slightly positive side another molecule
They attracted together
This whole idea behind water cohesion
The bond formed attraction called
They weak last fraction second
However new bond form another molecule immediately one broken
And increase cohesiveness water
One way see water cohesion work examine surface pond lake
You might see small creature called water strider skimming along surface water
They able stay surface without falling
This water molecule surface cohesive create condition called
As mentioned hydrogen bond keeping water molecule together weak larger creature could held water surface tension
But water strider small light surface tension support
Another way observe water tension simple experiment involving penny eyedropper
Using eyedropper carefully place one drop water time onto penny
As continue place drop penny water actually form mound finally spilling
This due water cohesion
One key example water cohesion water transport plant
In plant microscopic vessel water run
As water evaporates plant leaf water stem actually move upward force gravity replace lost water
This water cohesive drop attracts next pulling
In way different part plant receive water need
property water make molecule attracted
A made one oxygen atom bonded two hydrogen atom
The molecule unbalanced charge oxygen side slightly negative hydrogen side positive
This imbalance charge make opposite attract water molecule bond one another weak hydrogen bond

Is page english language use cohesion
Mar UTC I think actual example high low cohesion module might make concept discussed article bit concrete average reader
I see I come
July UTC I came find simple definition high LOW cohesion
Also I wanted example concept
Unfortunately high low cohesion never defined beginning article
Also source code example
Can someone please provide request
I believe would appropriate reason type cohesion specified position high low mentioning benefit disadvantage using type cohesion mentioned
Addidion
added definition cohesion respect military
A page created reflect meaning
I would reference website cover subject I intend add much possible future
Should scale linear
Is always considered case appropriate order worst best
Or different situation different grouping easier maintain
Say Controller layout
The method would grouped functionally temporal Communicational even word
example
July UTC The content article based book published OOP paradigm became popular
How OOP influenced topic
I found information web informational cohesion related OOP case regarded better functional cohesion
The presented Tom DeMarco Robert Martin different occasion clearly related
June UTC Torbjörn Kalin It clear redirects page
I expected Coherence software refer commercial software product made Tangosol
There seem page fine page seem relevant term
Also disambiguation page description Coherence software component Parallels Desktop Mac Windows virtualization software seem related article
Maybe link redirect ot disambiguation page anchor new section computing
December UTC I find odd Expat used example functional cohesion instead clearer generic explanation
This appears intentional inclusion product name
According first sentence page intuition example cohesion Coincidence Logical Commucational Logical cohesion talk mechanic language put building block common bin method object function module object class
However example Temporal Procedural Sequential talk single function
This make sense someone enlighten broken atm
Also I suggest structure example consistent way
A module X coherent contains routine Y improve readability
January UTC gui guj fgyh vb fcrd vfrtg vftvbgty Cohesion seems fall outside realm Computer Science arguably within purveiw field Software Engineering
May UTC I think might backwards low cohesion two function separated problem good thing high cohesion mean two function must always together otherwise something work
So I think article wrong least definition high low cohesion wrong
December UTC The link Yourdon Constantine
point exactly foot note
I understand document quoted

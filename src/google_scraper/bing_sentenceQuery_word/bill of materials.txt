For item BoM includes manufacturer part number MPN approved manufacturer list AML component descriptor
It may also include attached reference file part specification design file schematic
A production planning inventory control system material requirement planning integrates data production schedule inventory bill material calculate purchasing shipping schedule part component required build product
Originally used internally within company BoM served way track product change maintain accurate list required component
As manufacturing become increasingly distributed however BoM taken greater importance
Today BoM serf primary reference file product data transferring product information original equipment manufacturer electronic manufacturing service EMS provider EMS vendor supplier
As outsourcing expands number company involved manufacturing process particular product need accuracy BoM critical
According International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative BoM error typically fall within three category completeness consistency correctness
Incomplete data common BoM defect
Critical piece information often omitted include quantity part description reference designation approved manufacturer list AML
Missing AMLs reportedly cause majority problem
Information BoM sometimes conflict information provided engineering drawing design file
For example quantity may match may location particular component indicated board BoM specifies nine
Another consistency problem format
The format BoM even though customer change one transmission next making difficult match confirm data
Language another stumbling block vary BoM BoM
Incorrect serious problem
Common error include invalid manufacturer supplier information obsolete data incorrect part number example manufacturer part number MPN given match description part MPN recognized
Additional error result receipt information hard copy format requires manual data task

A sometimes list raw material intermediate assembly part quantity needed manufacture
A BOM may used communication manufacturing partner confined single manufacturing plant
A bill material often tied whose issuance may generate reservation component bill material stock component stock
A BOM define product designed ordered sale bill material built maintained service bill material
The different type BOMs depend business need use intended
In process industry BOM also known
The phrase bill material BOM frequently used engineer adjective refer literal bill current production configuration product distinguish modified improved version study test
Sometimes term material used refer flexible simplified version like part number used represent group related usually standard part go together
In electronics BOM represents list component used printed wiring board printed circuit board
Once design circuit completed BOM list passed layout engineer well component engineer procure component required design
BOMs top level representing finished product may completed item
BOMs describe referred
An example NAAMS BOM used automotive industry list component assembly line
The structure NAAMS BOM System Line Tool Unit Detail
The first hierarchical database developed automating bill material manufacturing organization early
At present BOM used data base identify many part code automobile manufacturing company
A bill material implosion link component piece major assembly bill material explosion break apart assembly component part
A modular BOM displayed following format A BOM also visually represented product structure tree although rarely used workplace
For example one Product Structure diagram illustrates time needed build acquire needed component assemble final product
For product time phased product structure show sequence duration operation
A CBOM form BOM used industry multiple option highly
telecom system hardware SANS server etc
PCs auto
The CBOM used dynamically create company sell
The benefit using CBOM structure reduces needed maintain product structure
The configurable BOM frequently driven configurator software however enabled manually manual maintenance infrequent unwieldy manage number permutation combination possible configuration
The development CBOM dependent structure place
The modular BOM structure provides selected configure
While configurators utilize hierarchical rule syntax find appropriate modular BOMs maintenance similar BOMs one component different various voltage becomes highly excessive
A newer approach Structuring utilizing proprietary search engine scheme transversing selectable componentry high speed eliminates Planning Modular BOM duplication
The search engine also used combinatorial feature constraint GUI representation support specification selection
To decide variant part component chosen attributed product option characteristic feature
If option product build ideal possible describe connection part product variant Boolean expression refers subset set product
A bill material BOM referred indented BOM bill material list component assembly part required make product
It provides display item relationship
When item unfinished part component including finished part raw material also exhibited
A structure illustrated tree several level
In contrast structure consists one level child component assembly material

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
My understanding BoM essentially list various component required electronic product module
Does mean could simple spreadsheet
Are formal BoM citing must contain
Any good referenced
Yup BOM spreadsheet
At minimum contain refdes internal part number component
If maintain internal part database contain refdes manufacturer full part number component
If small build I put Mouser part number order BOM
I like coalesce identical part number instead row row row I row
This also necessitates quantity column
It also make harder look given refdes since order
The BOM used guy ordering part guy running pick place machine add annotation want folk see
Oh BOM useful costing add component price
Again small run
Big run use sophisticated accounting
Yes useful common way express BOM spreadsheet
No standard format
Individual company may internal spec form BOMs independent standard least enough people follow make useful
I use following column BOM spreadsheet A Total quantity part required complete build
The cell contains number unit built
The remaining A cell derived quantity per unit column B
B Qty
Number part required per unit
C Designators
Component designators like etc
The cell line list designators instance particular part within unit
D Desc
Basic description string like Capacitor unpolarized Resistor fixed etc
E Value
More detailed value beyond basic description
This might Ohms W particular resistor
F Package
The name package part variant like sometimes proprietary package designation something standard
This default name package Eagle libary I explicitly set
G Subst
Yes indicate whether substitution allowed
For example probably want let purchasing buy whatever kΩ resistor get week microcontroller better exactly one specify
H Manuf
Manufacturer name usually blank generic part
I Manuf part
Manufacturer part number
J Supplier
Example supplier name like Mouser
K Supp part
Part stock number supplier listed column L Part
Cost per part
M Board
Cost part whole board unit
This automatically derived B N All
Cost part whole production run
This automatically derived A I also line bottom
These bare board kitting manufacturing testing delivery stock
The purpose additional line mostly allow summing complete cost production run
I would attach example seem way
Here screen shot one BOM spreadsheet something internal I giving customer information
To able read probably save image disk view externally
This site resizes image maximum width display message
In case I never filled cost show overall costing
Typically integrated layout environment create schematic choose component library add
You also indicate preferred supplier cost
One tool export BoMs automatic updating schematic change various format including Excel
Here example That site want see whole thing

A bill material used manufacturer product contain raw material part quantity
Each line bill material BOM include part number item description quantity unit measure procurement type describes part purchased manufactured
There number different type bill material engineering bill material manufacturing bill material equipment bill material
The different type bill material depend business need use intended
The engineering bill material engineering BOM defines finished product designed
The engineering BOM list item part component assembly product designed engineering
The engineering BOM often organized engineer based Design CAD drawing
For finished product may one engineering BOM created
It important create accurate bill material especially new product vital correct part available item manufactured
To ensure part available required department need information vendor need used purchase item lead time part ordered
The purchasing department negotiate obtain best price part reduce overall cost finished product
If bill material correct cause problem
If quantity line item incorrect cause production stopped delay cost company would either need find missing part start another production order
The manufacturing bill material also referred manufacturing BOM contains part assembly required build complete shippable product
This includes packaging material required ship finished product customer
The bill material also include process need performed item completed
The manufacturing bill material store information required manufacturing activity
When MRP run bill material exploded finished product ordered customer
The MRP process take detail manufacturing bill material calculates based suggested delivery date customer whether material need purchased order need started
There number element bill material need decided creating BOM
For company bill material validity date range
For new product introduced market manufacturer may testing product test market may want restrict use BOM month two month
If test period product requires modification either key element packaging bill material changed new validity date established new BOM would created
It possible bill material finished product configured specific requirement
The configurable bill material contains component required material customer specific requirement

In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

These problem procedure data space program representing procedure particular programming language computer
Problems procedure often confused
A problem defined criterion determines whether proposed solution accepted
One understand problem completely without method solution
Procedures usually built elementary procedure
What elementary procedure may complex procedure constructed one first topic computer science
This subject hard understand since precise notion computable function guide u computability relative given collection initial function easy define
Procedures operate member certain data space produce member data space using general still data space intermediate
A number operation known constructing new data space simpler one yet general theory representable data space comparable theory computable function
Some result given
Programs symbolic expression representing procedure
The procedure may represented different program different programming language
We shall discus problem defining programming language semantically stating procedure program represent
As syntax programming language rule allow u determine whether expression belongs language formalized part syntax relate closely semantics well studied
The problem translating procedure one programming language another much studied shall try give definition correctness translation
Computers finite automaton
From point view computer defined effect executing program given input state memory output
Computer science must study various way element data space represented memory computer procedure represented computer program
From point view current work automaton theory beside point

In computer programming element field file data type manipulated referenced way attribute
Let consider portrait How would describe person image
Brunette attractive couple characteristic come mind
These characteristic also considered attribute
Now let consider image sandwich Besides attribute might assign image
So exactly portrait photo sandwich relate computer programming
In computer programming element entity field file specific characteristic
For example web programming element assigned unique attribute
Computer programming attribute describe characteristic data whether file paragraph field
Let take closer look
The language used render webpage HTML HyperText Markup Language comprised various element paragraph unordered list image
These element represent item displayed web page
Get FREE access day create account
The paragraph element includes specific group characteristic attribute assigned
In former version language one specific attribute paragraph element align attribute
This attribute could set left right center justify
If attribute set right paragraph would aligned right rendered page
In separate programming language CSS Cascading Stylesheet attribute may also referenced
In either example attribute alignment seen communicated code
In database world attribute may refer single field table even table
An attribute field could preferred data type
For example attribute social security number field could limit nine character
Let look back attribute example provided original photo brunette attractive
The woman portrait described brunette
When hear term automatically connect color hair
Keeping mind must acknowledge attribute apply data type
We would apply hair color attribute sandwich would
It important note attribute may reserved specific data type
For example computer world paragraph would attribute last modified date
Last modified date attribute file
The available attribute may vary depending data type referenced
With various type data available many way described
Data whether file text table field manipulated referenced way
Each data type specific set attribute addressed

also called collection data specially organized rapid search retrieval
Databases structured storage retrieval modification deletion data conjunction various operation
A DBMS extract information database response query
A brief treatment database follows
For full treatment
A database stored set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Using keywords various sorting command user rapidly search rearrange group select field many record retrieve create report particular data
Database record file must organized allow retrieval information
main way user retrieve database information
The power DBMS come ability define new relationship basic one given table use get response query
Typically user provides string character computer search database corresponding sequence provides source material character appear user request example record content field person word
The many user large database must able manipulate information within quickly given time
Moreover large business organization tend build many independent file containing related even overlapping data activity often require linking data several file
Several different type DBMS developed support requirement flat hierarchical network relational
Early system arranged sequentially alphabetically numerically chronologically development storage device made possible random access data via index

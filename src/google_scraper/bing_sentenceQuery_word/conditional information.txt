In feature perform different computation action depending whether evaluates true false
Apart case always achieved selectively altering based condition
In language term conditional usually used whereas term conditional conditional construct preferred term distinct meaning
A conditional sometimes colloquially referred especially perceived simple one specific form irrelevant unknown
Although usually classified conditional construct another way select alternative
The construct sometimes called common across many programming language
Although syntax varies language language basic structure form look like In example code part represented constitutes conditional intrinsic value may substituted either value intrinsic meaning
In contrast combination expression surrounding consequent follows afterward constitute conditional intrinsic meaning expressing coherent logical rule intrinsic value
When find expects condition example mean variable x contains number greater zero evaluates condition
If condition statement following executed
Otherwise execution continues following branch either usually optional branch
After either branch executed return point
In early programming language especially dialect statement could contain statement
This led style programming known program style called
As result allows virtually arbitrary statement put statement block inside statement gained popularity became norm even BASIC programming circle
Such mechanism principle based older advanced family language language influenced modern BASIC variant many year
While possible using statement statement write program spaghetti code well structured readable program written structured programming language structured programming make easier enforces
Structured statement like example one key element structured programming present popular programming language
A subtlety optional else clause found many language mean since conditionals parsed multiple way
Specifically parsed depending whether associated first second
This known problem resolved various way depending language
By using possible combine several condition
Only statement following first condition found true executed
All statement skipped
The statement simply followed
In Ada difference one needed one us instead followed
This similar provides keyword avoid large number brace would required multiple statement also us special keyword structure denoted indentation rather brace repeated use would require increased indentation every condition
Similarly earlier UNIX shell later gathered POSIX shell syntax use elif giving choice delimiting space line break
However many language directly descended Algol special syntax construct present present many syntactical derivative C PHP
This work language statement case follow conditional without enclosed block
This design choice slight cost code branch effectively adding extra nesting level complicating job compiler implementors analyse implement arbitrarily long chain recursively
If term sequence conditionals testing value single expression alternative also called
Conversely language switch statement produced sequence statement
Many language support similar statement return value result
Thus true expression evaluate value statement change program state perform kind action
member family allow expression In dialect first inspired great extent ALGOL In part compulsory every expression must value
Logic would expressed conditionals language usually expressed recursive function
Because Haskell possible write control structure ordinary expression lazy evaluation mean evaluate condition proper branch strict language would evaluate three
It written like language special conditional expression function may described template like This mean inlined expression unlike language compared expression similar Ruby Scala among others
To accomplish using would take one line code typical layout convention Some argue explicit statement easier read may compile efficient code ternary operator others argue concise expression easier read statement spread several line
First user run program cursor appears waiting reader type number
If number greater text My variable named
displayed screen
If number smaller message My variable named
printed screen
In language function called provided used conditional expression
However behave like true conditional expression true false branch always evaluated result one thrown away result returned IIf function
Up language Fortran arithmetic statement halfway computed IF case statement based This earliest conditional statement Fortran Where e numeric expression necessarily integer equivalent Because equivalent multiple statement could jump anywhere considered unstructured control statement used structured statement used
In practice observed arithmetic statement referenced following statement one two label
This conditional control statement original implementation Fortran computer
On computer three address three state
Other computer would flag register positive zero negative even overflow carry associated last arithmetic operation would use instruction accumulator negative accumulator zero similar
Note expression evaluated case integer arithmetic overflow may occur overflow carry flag would considered also
In contrast language conditional statement defined class abstract method take two parameter
two subclass define method executing first closure executing second closure
In concept conditional expressed using expression ifThenElse passed two function left right conditionals also pas empty tuple result ifThenElse order actually call chosen function otherwise ifThenElse return function object without getting called
In system number used without definition like Lisp Traditional paper math expressed single closure Here true false ifThenElse bound respective definition passed scope end block
A working JavaScript analogy using function single variable rigor The code multivariable function look like another version earlier example without system number assumed
First example show first branch taken second example show second branch taken
Smalltalk us similar idea true false representation True False singleton object respond message differently
Haskell used use exact model Boolean type time writing Haskell program use syntactic sugar b else c construct unlike ifThenElse compose unless either wrapped another function shown The Haskell section page
language multiway branch compare given value specified constant take action according first constant match
There usually provision default action taken match succeeds
Switch statement allow compiler optimization
In dynamic language case may limited constant expression might extend example right implement default case matching string
may seen sophisticated alternative statement
It available many programming language functional programming feature many others
Here simple example written language The power pattern matching ability match action also pattern data
Here example written illustrates feature This code defines function applies first argument function element second argument list return resulting list
The two line two definition function two kind argument possible case one list empty return empty list case list empty
Pattern matching strictly speaking choice construct possible Haskell write one alternative guaranteed always matched situation used choice construct simply way bind name value
However frequently used choice construct language available
In programming language comparable data structure idiomatic use implement conditional assignment
In language allow programmer assign named function variable reference conditional flow implemented using hash
An alternative conditional branch instruction
Predication feature enables instruction conditionally executed instead modifying
This table refers recent language specification language
For language specification latest officially released implementation referred

Alternatively referred set rule performed certain condition met
It sometimes referred statement IF condition met THEN action performed
For example consider following textual example conditional statement
IF value le THEN display word Value le screen The example conditional statement might interpreted human brain
Using computer programming language conditional statement could written like example
myval print Value le In example myval software program print Value le screen
myval print The value equal else print Value equal In example variable exactly print The value equal screen
Otherwise print Myval equal screen
myval print Value greater elsif myval print Value le else print The value equal Finally last example print one three message screen depending value greater le equal

transfer also known conditional branching whereby would able jump different instruction depending value data
This extremely powerful feature missing many early computer century
transfer also known conditional branching whereby would able jump different instruction depending value data
This extremely powerful feature missing many early computer century

The conditional control structure allows program follow alternative path execution
Iteration looping give computer much power
They repeat sequence step often necessary appropriate repetition quite simple step solve computer Colossus conditional ability execute different instruction alter order execution instruction based value data
For instance IF X THEN GO TO LINE
This gave ENIAC lot flexibility machine conditional ability execute different instruction alter order execution instruction based value data
For instance IF X THEN GO TO LINE
This gave ENIAC lot

x equal exit directs program exit x equal

This handled process manager OS see First little
So process program execution
The first three letter program process probably clue something
Think process An abstraction sequence instruction executed processor processor may need service hardware device process time sharing executing device driver instruction process
make hardly sense understand process bit reading
A process contains A really important thing remember process program disk would file
Imagine recipe cake
Now cake recipe instruction making cake like program disk
The actual activity making cake process
The thing take away section OS collection process
The OS make computer productive switching CPU process

The diagram fairly simple
You see actual switching process happening neither process executing CPU perform processing middle switching
The actual switching time vary around microsecond second millisecond The concept processing used far assumed single address space used every process single thread control
But multiple thread within one process
It possible think way You multiple process sharing one computer multiple thread sharing process
This would useful web browser example one thread receiving data network another display text
With web browser could one thread getting input user another thread autosaving
Imagine word processor single threaded You able type anything autosaving
Note On version powerpoint I type anything autosaving
It annoying
You might hear something called
This another way saying thread
So thread multiple flow control sharing one address space
Each one need program counter register value stack
Remember thread process share code section global variable network connection open file
You may heard
This multiple thread share process
Programs become responsive resource shared better
If part program blocked keep running
As IO CPU use shared thread process performance usually better
It economical There lot cost associated making process
Memory resource need allocated
Creating thread faster
There concern though I mentioned two thread share data
Therefore one thread might read location another writing need take care stop problem like
Implementing threading fast done user space
However OS aware meaning user level thread get blocked whole process blocked
This useful support multiprocessor dual core available
This OS schedule individual thread

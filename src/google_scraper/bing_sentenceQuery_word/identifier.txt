unique expression written format either code number combination distinguish variation one another among class substance item object
For living organism structural identification object identifier could complicated
In computer science lexical token name entity
The concept analogous Identifiers used extensively virtually information processing system
Naming entity make possible refer essential kind symbolic processing
In computer language identifier token also called name language entity
Some kind entity identifier might denote include type label subroutine
In language character sequence lexical form identifier known keywords
In language distinction clear
Computer language usually place restriction character may appear identifier
For example early version C language identifier restricted sequence one letter digit may appear first character underscore
Later version language along many modern language support almost character identifier common restriction permit white space character language operator
Implementations programming language using identifier often compile time entity
That compiled program contains reference memory address offset rather textual identifier token memory address offset assigned compiler identifier
Implementations programming language offer interactive evaluation source code using interpreter incremental compiler present identifier runtime sometimes even object freely manipulated evaluated
In Lisp called
Compilers interpreter usually assign semantic meaning identifier based actual character sequence used
However exception
For example Since uniqueness identifier confusion various description one substance one item one topic one object cleared
Typical example

Identifier Definition An identifier simply name program name variable within program used identify relevant
Typically identifier must start letter must space
Search Identifier UK US Search Identifier rest Computing Students

An identifies label either unique object unique object object class may idea physical countable object class thereof physical noncountable substance class thereof
The abbreviation often refers identity identification process identifying identifier identification
An identifier may word number letter symbol combination
The word number letter symbol may follow wherein letter digit word symbol represent idea longer name may simply arbitrary
When identifier follows encoding system often referred
Identifiers follow encoding scheme often said arbitrarily assigned greater meaning
Sometimes identifier called code even actually arbitrary whether speaker belief deeper meaning simply speaking casually imprecisely
The identifier refers one particular object universe
A identifier needed identify part design
Thus Model T identifies automobile Ford comprises whereas Model T Serial Number identifies one specific member one particular Model T car owned one specific person
The concept equal term thus denotatively always synonymous often connotatively distinguished name sense traditional naming
For example employee number identifier specific human normal connotation may consider Jamie Zawinski name identifier whereas considers Netscape employee number identifier name
This indistinction rather one
In label sign token uniquely identifies object within
The suffix also used naming
ID code may inherently carry along
For example know food package front identifier data also metadata tell packaged September UTC manufactured Licensed Vendor Number Peoria IL USA plant Building package line shift inspected Inspector Number
Arbitrary identifier might lack metadata
For example food package say ID may tell anything except date manufacturer name production sequence rank inspector number
In case arbitrary identifier sequential serial number leak information

Opaque designed avoid leaking even small amount really
In name
Identifiers used extensively virtually
Identifying entity make possible refer essential kind symbolic processing
In identifier also called name language entity
Some kind entity identifier might denote include
Which character sequence constitute identifier depends language
A common rule sequence underscore also allowed condition begin digit simplify lexing avoiding confusing allowed definition used earlier version Python many language
Later version language along many modern language support almost character identifier
However common restriction permit whitespace character language operator simplifies tokenization making
For example forbidding identifier due use binary operation mean tokenized allowed would identifier addition
Whitespace identifier particularly problematic space allowed identifier clause legal identifier tokenizing requires phrasal context condition clause
Some language allow space identifier however ALGOL variant example following valid statement could entered keywords represented boldface concretely via
In ALGOL possible keywords syntactically differentiated risk collision ambiguity space eliminated phase source processed via lexing could
In language character sequence lexical form identifier known example frequently keyword clause lexically form namely sequence letter
This overlap handled various way may forbidden identifier simplifies tokenization parsing case may allowed distinguished way via stropping keyword sequence may allowed identifier sense determined context requires lexer
may also reserved word forbidden identifier particularly case word may become keyword future
In language distinction clear
The scope accessibility within program identifier either local global
A global identifier declared outside function available throughout program
A local identifier declared within specific function available within function
For implementation programming language using identifier often entity
That compiled program contains reference memory address offset rather textual identifier token memory address offset assigned compiler identifier
In language support interactive evaluation source code using interpreter incremental compiler identifier also runtime entity sometimes even freely manipulated evaluated
In called
Compilers interpreter usually assign semantic meaning identifier based actual character sequence used
However exception
For example In language Go identifier uniqueness based spelling visibility
In identifier one possible
It unique within document
Many resource may carry multiple identifier
Typical example The inverse also possible multiple resource represented identifier discussed
Many system originate within small
Over year bleed larger namespaces people interact way formerly trade scientific collaboration military alliance general cultural interconnection assimilation
When dissemination happens limitation original naming convention formerly latent moot become painfully apparent often necessitating
Such limitation generally accompany shift away original context broader one
Typically system show implicit context context formerly assumed narrow lack capacity low number possible IDs reflecting outmoded narrow context lack feature defined reserved future need lack specificity disambiguating capability related context shift longstanding uniqueness encounter novel nonuniqueness
Within computer science problem called
The story origination expansion system provides good case example context
The capitalization variation seen reveals instance problem occurring proper noun distinction complication must dealt
A universe every object UID would need namespaces say would constitute one gigantic namespace human mind could never keep track semantically interrelate many UIDs

An identifier C name program element
It namespace class method variable interface
Identifiers symbol used uniquely identify program element code
They also used refer type constant macro parameter
An identifier name indicate meaning usage element referred
C programming language compiled implementation identifier entity
During run time identifier referred reference memory address offset compiler assigned textual identifier token
Like identifier C
Microsoft recommends use Camel Pascal notation along semantics naming identifier instead Hungarian notation used prior programming
For example employeeSalary might represent Camel notation wherein first letter word capitalized except first word
Camel notation used name private member field parameter
EmployeeSalary identifier Pascal notation word identifier begin letter
It usually used type name nonprivate member type
The rule followed using identifier include An identifier prefixed called verbatim identifier
Although prefixing allows use keywords help interfacing programming language recommended practice

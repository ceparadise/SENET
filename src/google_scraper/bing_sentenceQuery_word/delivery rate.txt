Liz Bacon Lachlan MacKinnon With growth IT job beating recession continued report skill shortage UK industry yet computer science graduate reported
The IT telecom industry employ one workforce predicted grow nearly five time faster UK average according half million new entrant required
Nine firm suffering IT telecom related shortage delaying development new product service report add
The growing demand student around world UK qualification evidence UK university offer high level technical skill knowledge
Recent international comparison ranked teaching research UK university among best qualification comparison body NARIC rank UK qualification highest quality band worldwide
Yet many employer complain graduate taught skill want many large employer admit recruiting elite Russell Group university
How picture compare rest world
The USA also report increasing demand coupled skill shortage IT sector repeated across EU Canada Australia
By contrast much developing world employer willing invest qualification staff one reason significant demand UK postgraduate degree amongst international student
So many recent UK computer science graduate unemployed
Input based recent report commissioned investigated data produced Higher Education Statistics Agency HESA cite number interrelated factor affecting unemployment
Some factor obvious quality degree obtained location within UK institution study one key factor employment rate black minority ethnic BME student
Computer science forefront widening access agenda far higher proportion BME student studying traditional science engineering subject
This also influence balance student number university Russell Group institution BME student opposed Russell Group university BME
BME graduate higher unemployment rate across subject even BME computer science student Russell Group institution unemployment rate compared average Russell Group unemployment rate
However need clear many student come still live area extremely high unemployment figure would heralded significant success story
It argued consideration graduate employment need contextualised contemporary rather making unrealistic comparison institution draw significantly different demographic
Having said considerable bias employment prospect graduate BME origin similar better qualification white counterpart even resulted graduate changing obtain interview
Most employer looking graduate two three year work experience past graduate recruitment scheme would take new graduate train workplace
These scheme largely vanished employer arguing investment wasted graduate swiftly move
There also many report suggest offshoring graduate IT work short term strategy employer strangling pipeline necessary develop experienced IT professional
Recent change school curriculum introduced teaching computer science GCSE emphasis coding reap significant benefit
Ensuring school pupil strong technical understanding computer science ability program develop computer system mean employer educator much stronger pool talent draw upon
In turn enable evolution training education meet future need IT industry
This positive development come nothing however address contributing factor result current high level computer science graduate unemployment
So
Two clear message emerge research
Firstly employment prospect BME graduate need tackled national level
Only parity treatment employer enable benefit widening access higher education particular success computer science attracting student diverse community
Secondly employer need incentivised reintroduce graduate training scheme stop offshoring graduate job provide employment prospect new graduate rebuild pool talent experience UK IT industry
These issue tackled locally nationally must tackled UK lose current position knowledge economy

This focus important community issue innovative solution societal challenge people group making impact technology
The chart tell quite story
That blue line one look like hockey stick show interest computer science freshman University Washington Seattle skyrocketed since compared engineering field
The UW alone
Countless university Harvard Stanford University Michigan seeing similar demand computer science degree
On surface encouraging trend tech industry get enough new engineer
But beneath surface problem College student want become computer scientist many case enough room faculty meet demand
Young adult today realizing computer science knowledge help succeed software developer nearly job
Heck even journalist like u take Javascript HTML course
Kids waking said Bill Melinda Gates Chair Computer Science Engineering UW
Every field becoming information field program level beyond intro course huge value It also becoming popular thing learn
Yep geek cool today world
Students feel computing socially relevant even hip said computer science department chair Harvey Mudd College
But may encouraging see many young mind yearning build technology change world solution insane demand
In search potential fix growing problem GeekWire spoke computer science professor nation top university expert like Hadi Partovi Washington STEM Chief Policy Officer leading new coding trade school
What found short university appear prepared demand much planned future
There hope
The nascent online education industry could provide help program like proving beneficial want crash course coding outside typical university system
But much need done satisfy unprecedented demand computer science education
This first time explosion computer science interest
Back mid surge advent personal computer
Some argue university tried apply fix keep demand strategy ultimately led substantial fall year later
Then big boom late
Students saw entrepreneur creating website made millionaire wanted
There small number case actually happening alumnus helped fuel frenzy said Harvey Mudd computer science chair
It something like every college basketball player thinking going play But bubble burst leading another steep reduction computer science degree
Now seeing third surge though one differs greatly previous spike
What happened financially driven interest today appears coming new technology particularly seeing power smartphones
This time around I see student choosing major computer science genuinely excited said
Good job almost certainly factor decision many case I see fewer dollar sign student eye enthusiasm contribute something meaningful society cool former Stanford computer science department associate chair also cited employer graduate computer science background
He said latest surge It idea uncertain time people looking best stable education ensure least job Roberts explained
It le Wow I could become billionaire like saw Lazowska Roberts gave last month nuance particular wave computer science major
They found huge spike demand major introductory course enrollment computer science course realize need computer science skill particular field
This vastly outstrips previous enrollment peak late Lazowska said
The graph show Lazowska talking
Here increasing demand introductory course pas popular intro class Harvard example And increasing demand major Finally increasing demand So begs question What university crazy level interest
There simple answer question Increase classroom size hire faculty
However easier said done
At private institution adding space faculty doable stronger funding
At Stanford percent student take computer science course school place cap program
If say people want study certain subject Stanford historically expected figure way accommodate
university difficult time
The UW example expand computer science program two year ago constrained funding state government
We turning away many student love Lazowska said
That Lazowska offered bevy potential crappy solution increasing demand That last idea online education something many agree continue grow used every level education including university
Partovi technology veteran help expose computer science million kid big believer learning code online
The good news absolute best university course computer science also available study online via platform EdX Coursera Partovi said
Although online course completion rate course motivated student access university program due rising tuition cost shortage spot program still available But online class may provide cheaper accessible solution Lazowska warned computer science education without interaction simply good enough
He said lesson UW student learn working small team class invaluable another reason increasing class size could detrimental implication quality learning
We send student Amazon Facebook Microsoft Google team design experience said
You may get knowledge data structure Coursera much le obvious learn work collaborate small trade school also pointed inefficiency online education
Learning code frustrating lonely said
Graduation rate full online course single digit Having company like Code Fellows another potential alternative solution computer science degree
The program one growing number organization teach intensive coding bootcamps take traditional route learning computer science university level
It growing rapidly ever since launching two year ago attractive guarantee job graduation
Smith explained group like Code Fellows also flexibility university respond customer demand hearing feedback hiring partner perspective student understand technology relevant workplace
I think trade school like Code Fellows going huge part solution bridging gap demand supply software engineer ability learn quickly efficiently higher quality team expert guiding said
But advisor previously worked Microsoft startup said something like Code Fellows place tech ecosystem really replacement quality education someone receive university level
No matter smart way get breadth depth education university would something like bootcamp said Verespej earned Masters Computer Science UC San Diego
It If case perhaps university get creative way teach computer science
Chief Policy Officer said one solution could collaboration business higher education
She pointed University Maryland Lockheed Martin one example
These partnership leverage industry faculty teach course design curriculum provide internship research project benefit enabling student get experience industry exposure earning degree key factor looking full time work King said
Or colleague John Cook suggested year ago maybe time Seattle bankrolled technology investor
Lazowska however said raising money program would extremely difficult
He also expressed serious doubt would succeed
People always talk creating MIT creating Stanford creating Georgia Tech Lazowska said
Those university
There never instance one created becoming truly excellent le Roberts former Stanford computer science department head still teach class Palo Alto said like idea special institution teaching essential part field describes Hogwarts School Software He noted industry may persuaded fund something like much like Lockheed Martin partnering University Maryland
But hopeful optimistic solution university level
In fact expects academic institution able produce enough worker may lead downturn economy
Roberts compared dilemma global warming
We know problem something requires individual sacrifice even though downstream benefit shared said
It classic tragedy common problem
The entire economics structure go finding good way keep teacher employed reasonable Roberts cautioned problem fixed obvious solution
He said simply existing faculty teach student dilutes quality education student end receiving eventually diminish quality computer science graduate going workforce dire need
Roberts noted something similar happened surge
Every fix try impose end making environment le interesting positive people need said
If remember happened I quite sure repeat When asked workplace demand computer programmer coming college Partovi shared image
The number bit staggering Bureau Labor Statistics predicts million job student six year
This critical issue university many company
veteran recruiter Director Talent Madrona Venture Group said certainly computer science graduate five year ago enough
It still meet demand today employer said
Partovi note Washington state time open job graduate
King executive Washington STEM stressed importance computer science education meeting demand future job
Computer science job growing pay well
Students know code access best paying fastest growing job nation Washington said
It imperative every young person option particularly girl student color student rural area tend left computer science education hence wonder tech company trouble recruiting retaining diverse But unfortunately one really clear answer university adapt fill job particularly looking year road
With program like Washington STEM pushing forward computer science education expect even high school senior likely support parent wating study programming college
Harvey Mudd said ultimately people power control much money funneled school
My advice would folk control university budget Invest resource allow computer science department meet demand qualified student said
This investment pay dividend satisfaction student ultimately There may hope horizon
Perhaps government allocate fund allow school hire faculty
Maybe high individual like donate money help educate tomorrow leader
It hard know solution I see resource said Roberts former Stanford computer science associate chair
But keep talking
I hope wake people

Enrollment undergraduate computer science course college nationwide
But trend hailed tech industry dark side disproportionate number student taking course caught cheating
More student caught cheating introductory computer science course course campus thanks automated tool professor use detect unauthorized code reuse excessive collaboration forbidden way completing homework assignment
Computer science professor say student dishonest student field likely get caught software available check plagiarism
Half academic dishonesty case University Washington involve computer science student
The truth every campus large proportion reported case academic dishonesty come introductory computer science course reason totally obvious use automated tool detect plagiarism explains Professor Ed Lazowska chair computer science engineering University Washington
We compare student submission compare previous student submission code may Web
These tool flag suspicious case manually examined
Stanford University disclosed February honor code violation involved computer science student although student represent student body
Of honor code violation investigated last year Stanford Judicial Panel involved computer science student
The tool employ make easy catch student cheating say Professor Mehran Sahami associate professor computer science Stanford University
I would say computer science student violate honor code often dishonest
Sahami say computer science student mistakenly believe writing software code similar solving mathematical proof one correct answer exists
What student realize software code akin writing essay significant amount creativity involved
One thing happens computer science contributes cheating rate student unaware dissimilar program task really look Sahami say
They tend think OK copy portion someone else program
But tool discover
As college student study computer science number cheating incident rise
At University Washington total enrollment two introductory computer science course highest ever approaching student last four quarter compared student year ago
In two course assignment identified involving academic dishonesty Lazowska say
The top computer science school country experiencing trend
We see cheating
It something working hard stop number mean say Professor Lenny Pitt director undergraduate program Department Computer Science University Illinois
Cheating gone across many field easier find tool today
Cheating introductory computer science class typically involves homework assignment rather exam
Students get frustrated code wo run tempted borrow solution someone else
Because computer science assignment complicated need debugging professor assign homework several year row
That mean student find code written someone already taken course
There lot infrastructure need built lot effort go creating homework problem
There disincentive professor change problem every semester
So tend reassign similar problem cause cheating past solution available Pitt say adding University Illinois check homework repository past solution
The common form cheating involves excessive
Many student like collaborate point copying
Pitt asks
The course policy need really clear
Some course allow work pair triple
If follow policy would call cheating
At Stanford student allowed discus strategy solving homework problem need write code
You looking someone else program sharing computer science student Sahami say
Sahami say introductory computer science course require student code program course allow teamwork
We want learn mechanic first open world collaboration add
Students often resort cheating feel excessive pressure peer family excel professor say
Anecdotally see larger incidence cheating among foreign student domestic student I think part extreme pressure well succeed Pitt say
That pressure contributes idea need well possible even mean taking shortcut
Computer science professor say much copying excess collaboration go college course
Does anyone right mind think cheating happening large introductory course field
If smoking something Lazowska say
There several case faculty discipline adapted tool detect plagiarism term paper found plagiarism rate far greater typically encountered computer science course
As college recruiter traipse across country seeking best computer science graduate Class need aware rising incident cheating computer science course
Ethics huge issue IT industry copyright licensing privacy say David Foote CEO Foote Partners research firm tracking IT workforce management
Foote sits advisory council Hiram College Center Study Ethics Values
We need looking idea breed people concerned naturally issue ethic morality
For CIOs issue whether copying code homework assignment could lead prospective employee ethical lapse job
Businesses want hire worker wo get trouble software licensing patent infringement intellectual property problem
There enough program American university looking ethic cheating Foote say
Do pick computer science people
Pick fact university enough general calling attention cheating
Foote point incident excess collaboration qualify cheating college campus would encouraged industry want employee reuse software improve efficiency cut cost
In real world people write code team given piece project work Foote say
The academic world mapping onto real handing assignment people coding
To encourage collaboration Georgia Tech changed approach cheating introductory computer science course
Instead trying catch punish student excessive collaboration Georgia Tech requires student disclose name student helped complete homework
Students sign collaboration agreement explains Cedric Stallworth assistant dean Undergraduate Enrollment Georgia Tech College Computing
We realize computing one subject best learned group
If student using somebody else code learning right
To ensure student mastering material Georgia Tech requires give oral demonstration software work one teaching assistant
We worry le catching cheater
We worry properly assessing student skill set Stallworth say
Less percentage grade homework percentage assessment assessment designed truly measure skill
Then cheat homework going help assessment count bulk grade
Computer science professor think cheating result student unprepared take course
They seeing rise failure rate drop grade
Instead say student qualified ever
We seen increase failure rate Stanford Sahami say adding le student typically fail introductory computer class
This student body accepts failure
For pas class important thing
Lazowska say rising enrollment computer science course important trend resulting increase plagiarism case
An range student recognizing even major something else preparation computational thinking essential Lazowska say
There reason believe computer science student anything better ever

Even growth vast majority computer science job pursued filled men
As industry whole add million job coming year continues notable absence woman field
This trend begin well entering job market girl account half Advanced Placement AP yet boy computer science exam
In Mississippi Montana Wyoming single girl took AP Computer Science examination
There clear disconnect computer science industry message girl receive ability succeed tech organization
This guide examines history behind disparity educator parent employer computer scientist reverse trend
Before advent home computer early substantially woman undertook computer science degree
According academic year woman accounted nearly computer science undergraduate student
This number steadily dropped widespread use home computer became common
A everyday usage personal computer within home found men far likely use computer use hour per week woman
Only men reported using computer weekly basis compared female surveyed
As woman made computer science student
Much attention devoted studying reason drop female computer science major
The central conclusion first personal computer essentially early gaming system firmly catered male
While early word processing tool also available told story new device met need men
As male began purchasing computer personal use nerdy programmer classification began take hold professional world computer science
By percentage woman studying computer science postsecondary level
Though woman represent workforce compared engineer female
Furthermore percentage woman working computer profession steadily declined since dropping last year
According number possible step towards reversing trend encouraging female student undertake computer science
By fostering interest scientific topic early age working remove negative connotation barrier educator parent work together help girl maintain confidence curiosity STEM subject
For professional already field woman offer role model mentor men take stand sexist prejudiced behavior workplace
Due marketing strategy last three decade many woman developed misconception computer science
While notion geek coder alive well many young woman may unaware myriad job available opportunity make palpable difference
The University California Berkeley experienced revolution introductory computer science class changing marketed course
What used known Introduction Symbolic Programming called The Beauty Joy Computing
The
For first time woman class outnumbered men
A recent Deloitte found woman choice account buying decision nationwide
In addition impactful career offered computer science one field woman opportunity earn salary male counterpart
According discrepancy overall pay rate remained stalled last decade
Even woman make cent dollar compared men position however incongruity far le pronounced perhaps even within field computer science
As Smithsonian Magazine survey conducted AAUW recent graduate found one year graduation male female programmer earning salary
The absence gender shift within pay scale also held true traditionally industry including math physical science occupation
A recent Deloitte found woman choice account buying decision nationwide
Furthermore diversity opinion integral innovation
Though still commonplace find board project team without sole female member integration woman field naturally lead holistic understanding consumer marketplace
In addition reason mentioned many tech computer science company forefront progressive workplace policy
Some innovative tech company benefit include In report researcher found woman working tech company particularly much likely healthy balance
Many tech company supportive professional procedure working home employing videoconferencing technology
Furthermore many company also flexible hour allowing employee work best suit provided project completed time
While average length maternity leave America salaried employee six week many technology company recognize key component keeping female employee providing substantial fair policy new mother
Some parental leave policy include Whether new father mother adoptive parent Facebook employee receive four month paid leave addition baby cash assist unexpected cost
Furthermore company set breastfeeding room office
Expectant mother given total week work including four week delivery
Fathers adoptive parent provided six week paid leave
Additionally Apple Facebook offer assistance adoption fertility treatment including freezing egg
This massive tech company offer variety provision
All biological mother receive week paid leave number extending complication arise
All new parent receive week paid leave primary caregiver eligible seven week
Aside generous time company also offer assistance program help new parent find childcare discount agency place nanny towards supply new child special room mother breastfeed
Consistently best place work parent SAS go beyond come serving woman family
In addition generous paid leave program company offer variety benefit child growing
A subsidized onsite child care center mean parent visit kid throughout day company cafeteria includes special menu appealing younger crowd think hot dog
The company also instills spirit trust employee allowing step away office whenever necessary long work completed time
Now historical reasoning misconception overturned time think taking step toward involving woman industry
Keep reading learn fostering passion computer science young girl
With number female studying computer science near low clear action need taken
Understanding root problem start early age essential rectifying
According recent coverage child indicate interest science however enter middle school percentage interested girl fall dramatically
By high school many girl previously took advanced scientific course drop study
child indicate interest science however enter middle school percentage interested girl fall dramatically
The summary offered corroborated extended conducted researcher Florida Gulf Coast University The University Colorado cite numerous reason drop female interest education progress
In secondary school le emphasis placed developing girl computer science skill compared boy
Even go study topic college often report feeling lag behind male counterpart due dearth attention high school level
Furthermore female student lack relatable role model inspiration given many leader field men
Lastly historic marketing perception scientific field catered largely male student
While characterization permeated last decade still belief profession often narrow impersonal unsuited wish make difference human level
Beginning number woman studying computer science similar field fell steep decline
In recent year number leveled establishing baseline assessing success newly implemented educational initiative
Some innovative way educator parent work increase girl interest computer science subject include While boy tend verbal class educator engage female student bring learning initiative discussion
This increase likelihood girl engaging subject matter better prepare plan study one topic collegiate level
Girls entering field computer science likely face resistance subject area heavily populated female
Adults bolster resolve providing example strong successful female thriving career
Whether creating mentorship program secondary postsecondary level bringing speaker using female leader case study educator parent instill sense confidence girl interested pursuing historically male dominated field giving role model
As discussed previous section number woman computer science related degree dropped sharply response message home computer mostly men
In interim year woman shifted subject typically referred humanity liberal art evidenced A June report featured Harvey Mudd College effort counter trend
Rather pure programming introductory computer science course reworked focus solving wealth opportunity within field
The school also lessened intimidation factor splitting course two section based incoming student prior programming experience
The result
Within four year college went woman electing major subject
As push encourage girl interest computer science gain momentum number program created help foster interest
Some innovative include Whether operating middle school high school collegiate level group pivotal encouraging sustaining girl pursuit topic
Outside organization mentioned number initiative engage girl computer science
Whether competition summer camp science fair MOOC governmental program resource help parent educator think outside box come encouraging girl scientific pursuit

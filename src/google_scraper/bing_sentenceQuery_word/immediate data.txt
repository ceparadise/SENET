Academia policymakers hailing news question facing CIOs others charge IT hiring How much Do company need employee deep technical skill developed computer science software engineering degree better business major
Not surprisingly computer science educator software company hardware manufacturer adamant need computer science major drive innovation tech company
The dearth computer science graduate forcing company look offshore qualified people argue
Not enough computer science major serious repercussion competitiveness say Professor Cary Laxer head computer science software engineering Institute Technology
There large number Chinese student Indian student interested work
We going lose competitive edge country turn software engineer
But CIOs IT staffing firm say need collaboration problem solving communication developed motivated college student
After today Millennials wireless social medium technology integrated lifestyle grasp exploit far better boss
Computer science degree mattered lot year ago IT cost center
But job IT The huge IT budget even CIOs line business say David Foote CEO Foote Partners conduct quarterly survey IT skill pay
This brought whole new group IT skill come mathematics economics business marketing
On March The Computing Research Association issued annual report number college student pursuing computer science bachelor degree university
The number shown sharp decline throughout decade
In fall around newly declared computer science major
That figure dropped half bust bottoming last two year
But increase
See
Having enough computer science software engineering major critical tech company say need hire undergraduate deep technical skill practical programming experience

It help familiarity product
Having knowledge really important regardless aspect business go
Even year rise computer science major tech company say still enough computer scientist engineer fill open job
That tech company CIOs often hire instead
In responded drop computer science degree creating provides free software training tool college professor across discipline rather computer science department
IBM working college faculty worldwide around student
As company greater greater need computer communication software decline student going consequence supply demand balance say Kevin Faughnan director IBM Academic Initiative
IBM goal Academic Initiative encourage college student become familiar IT apply across industry
With initiative IBM focusing strengthening technical underpinning business major rather encouraging computer science major
The business student computer science skill intro data management Web part major Faughnan say
We try encourage faculty interdisciplinary
As part initiative IBM provided university simulation game teach business process modeling It incumbent business school integrate technology curriculum Faughnan say
I think technology much computer science major horizontal skill applied across discipline
For example ca marketing day without data mining
CIOs say hiring business major IT experience computer science major
Henry Eckstein senior vice president strategy technology York Insurance Services Group say member IT shop computer science software engineering degree
Most employee Russia
Eckstein say making hiring decision weighs experience first IT certification second college degree third
If I look candidate I see computer science major going influence decision I looking newer least I know good training discipline Eckstein say
But going someone computer science degree
Particularly I looking developer I looking skill set many year experience knowledge subject matter
When CIOs surveyed top skill looking employee cite technical skill
Instead top concern ethic critical thinking collaboration communication skill according CIO survey compiled
The technical skill demand programming database system analysis ranked lower CIOs priority list
You computer science degree get entry level job IT say Professor Jerry Luftman executive director School Technology Management Stevens Institute Technology
Luftman compiles SIM annual CIO survey
When CIOs asked skill looking people clear skill critical
Luftman say computer science major engineer make good IT professional critical thinking skill logical analysis
But say business information system major valuable employee balance technical skill business collaboration communication skill
During downturn IT asked work business partner identify opportunity leverage IT improve process improve productivity Luftman say
My advice Generation X Generation make sure good balance technical business skill
Stephen Pickett past president SIM auto industry CIO say lack computer science major problem CIOs
That SIM local chapter working business school improve technical offering computer science school improve business course
We necessarily need computer science graduate
A business graduate strong computer science curriculum work lot case Pickett say
In computer science school try add business curriculum get student coming
Pickett say MIS degree good match IT business skill
It enough add computer hobbyist
The thing need project management experience business process evaluation
You get knowing application desktop Pickett add
College grad look business process find improve people going popular
Striking right balance technical skill business knowledge critical given global economic meltdown Pickett say
In downturn even important get people solve business problem business problem much difficult solve Pickett say
You solve problem without significant business resource
You technical knowledge business knowledge lot imagination
Foote say counsel high school student think carefully business like work
The question Do want techie guy work bowel organization work infrastructure job want front working application
Foote say
If want front might want work HR finance whatever area business interest
You also want look industry casino insurance whatever figure product service interested
Foote recommends student majoring math business pursue minor computer science
That give much view IT give option say
Computer science educator claim image old fashioned way viewing program
There perception propagated medium computer science major mean work bowel organization coding front terminal eating potato chip drinking Mountain Dew say Professor Lenny Pitt Director Undergraduate Programs Department Computer Science University Illinois
This far truth
Our graduate working bridge management technical people
They technical writing software testing usability
In light declining enrollment decade top computer science school like University Illinois retooled curriculum embrace soft skill collaboration communication
These department focused graduating student explain complex technical issue layman term
The decline enrollment last six year forced professor think teaching computer science student make sure giving skill need successful like collaborative learning working part team say Peter Harsha director government affair CRA
Carnegie Mellon University emphasizes teamwork collaboration computer science program requires technical communication course
Students also required take course humanity pursue minor field foreign language
Twenty year ago kid would get program would nerdy added requirement program force broader say Professor Peter Lee head Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University
Today opposite problem people tendency dabbler
We want deep broad
Carnegie Mellon strategy seems working
Last year Carnegie Mellon computer science graduate went work industry including IT vendor Microsoft Google IT user Bloomberg Goldman Sachs
The went graduate school
Where see demand high salary people deep technical software skill Lee say
These student computer savvy able manage IT operation
They actually understand software issue engineer software
Those people recruiter want
Lee predicts computer science major remain demand industry becoming dependent computing data mining

In altered normal execution value
When associated identifier constant said named although term constant named constant often used interchangeably
This contrasted identifier value changed normal execution value Constants useful programmer compiler programmer form code allow reasoning compiler allow check constancy assumption violated allow simplify
There various specific realization general notion constant subtle distinction often overlooked
The significant constant constant constant type
Typical example constant include mathematical constant value standard internal configuration value C example Typical example constant value calculated based input function example Some make explicit syntactic distinction constant variable symbol example considering constant syntax error language considered syntactically simply identifier difference treatment semantic assignment identifier syntactically valid identifier constant semantically invalid
Although constant value defined constant may referenced many time program
Using constant instead specifying value multiple time program simplify code maintenance also supply meaningful name consolidate constant binding standard code location example beginning separate file
There several main way express data value change program execution consistent across wide variety programming language
One basic way simply writing number character string program code straightforward C similar language
In assembly language literal number character done using immediate mode instruction available microprocessor
The name immediate come value available immediately opposed loading indirectly looking memory address
On hand value longer microprocessor word length string array handled indirectly assembler generally provide data embed data table program
Another way defining symbolic
Many programming language many assembler offer macro facility programmer define generally beginning source file separate definition file name different value
A preprocessor replaces name appropriate value compiling resulting something functionally identical using literal speed advantage immediate mode
Because difficult maintain code value written literally value used repetitive way often done macro
A third way declaring defining variable constant
A global static variable declared symbol defined assembly keyword qualifier meaning value set compile time changeable runtime
Compilers generally put static constant text section object file along code opposed data section initialized data kept
Some compiler produce section specifically dedicated constant
Memory protection applied area prevent overwriting constant errant pointer
These constant differ literal number way
Compilers generally place constant single memory location identified symbol rather spread throughout executable macro
While precludes speed advantage immediate mode advantage memory efficiency debugger work constant runtime
Also macro may redefined accidentally conflicting header file C conflicting constant detected compile time
Depending upon language constant untyped typed
In C macro provide former provides latter Ada universal numeric type used desired untyped variant implicitly converted appropriate type upon use
Besides described many procedural language Ada extend concept constantness toward global variable created initialization time local variable automatically created runtime stack register dynamically allocated memory accessed pointer parameter list function header
constant designate variable residing specific region memory value set compile time
In code expression constant initialized constant
Use constantness necessary program legality semantic correctness three advantage constant originated language feature
Studies Ada code shown constant used infrequently typically le object could used much local object actually invariant created
On hand immutable variable tend default since favour programming style recursion make default
Some language called even forbid entirely
Constantness often used function declaration promise object passed reference called function change
Depending syntax either pointer object pointed may constant however normally latter desired
Especially C discipline ensuring proper data structure constant throughout program called
In possible declare parameter function method constant
This guarantee parameter modified first assignment inadvertently
If parameter type modified
If type variable pointer address modified either
However content object modified without limit
Declaring parameter constant may way signalise value changed programmer must keep mind check modification object done compiler
Besides feature also possible declare function method
This prevents function method modifying anything local variable
In C keyword exists effect function parameter case
There however way stir compiler make check albeit bit tricky
To get effect first two interface defined Then defined method select right interface capability A constant data structure object referred parlance
An object immutable confers advantage program design
For instance may copied simply copying pointer reference avoiding copy operation conserving memory
language extend constantness even
Individual member struct class may made const even class
Conversely keyword allows class member changed even object instantiated
Even function const
The meaning const function may called object instantiated const const function change data
C qualifier const constant readonly used constructor runtime application
Java qualifier called prevents changing reference make sure never point different object
This prevent change referred object
Java basically equivalent
It provide feature
In qualifier state affected data member variable assignable It must decidable compiler variable marker initialized must performed class compile
Java keywords meaning applied primitive variable
Considering pointer reference Java mean something similar pointer
In one declare pointer type
Here must initialised time declaration changed point modifiable

valid
It ca point another location
Final reference Java work way except declared uninitialized
Note Java support pointer
It restriction default way accessing object Java Java use star indicate
For example last example pointer used access instance
One also declare pointer data
Here modified point anything anytime pointed value modified pointer
There equivalent mechanism Java
Thus also method
enforced Java although use interface defining interface class passing around one ensure object passed around system way modified
provides way create unmodifiable wrapper via similar method
Methods Java declared completely unrelated meaning mean method overridden subclass
In qualifier effect data member Java modifier effect similar yet typed
The effect Java applied method class induced C aid third keyword
Unlike C permit method parameter marked
However one may also pas around subclass provides support converting mutable collection immutable one may passed wrapper
Treatment constant varies significantly
issue imperative language like default typically create vary name suggests thus one wish mark binding constant requires additional indication
In programming language paradigm related issue arise analog found
In data typically constant default rather variable default
Instead assigning value variable storage space name potentially variable value one creates binding name value construct many dialect
In functional language particularly multiparadigm one modifying data commonplace others avoided considered exceptional case another Lisp dialect us construct modify data exclamation point drawing attention
Such language achieve goal default drawing attention modification rather constantness
In number OOLs concept particularly used basic type like string notable example include Java JavaScript Python C
These language vary whether type marked immutable may allow particular field attribute object type marked immutable
In multiparadigm language allow functional style feature may combined
For example object field immutable default must explicitly marked keyword mutable Scala binding explicitly immutable defined value explicitly mutable defined variable
constant vary
Some simply name would variable
Others use capital underscore constant way similar traditional use symbolic macro
In k signifies constant well
One enforced convention variable begin capital letter considered constant including class name

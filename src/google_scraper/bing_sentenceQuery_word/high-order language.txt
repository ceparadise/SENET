In strong detail
In comparison may use element easier use may automate even hide entirely significant area computing system
making process developing program simpler understandable relative language
The amount abstraction provided defines programming language
In programming language using commonly called
Examples autocodes
The first programming language designed computer created
However implemented time original contribution due largely isolated development although influenced language Superplan degree also Algol
The first really widespread language machine independent development IBM earlier system
defined committee European American computer scientist introduced well
It also first language clear distinction corresponding
Algol also introduced several concept construct first described formal method BNF
During roughly period introduced also called structs introduced fully general programming language first time
language refers higher level abstraction
Rather dealing register memory address call stack language deal variable array complex arithmetic boolean expression subroutine function loop lock abstract computer science concept focus optimal program efficiency
Unlike language language element translate directly machine native
Other feature string handling routine language feature file may also present
One thing note programming language language allows programmer detached separated machine
That unlike language like assembly machine language programming amplify programmer instruction trigger lot data movement background without knowledge
The responsibility power executing instruction handed machine programmer
language intend provide feature standardize common task permit rich debugging maintain architectural agnosticism language often produce efficient code optimization specific system architecture
border prevents programming technique applied situation computational limitation standard conformance physical constraint require access architectural resource fi response time hardware integration
programming exhibit feature like generic data interpretation intermediate code file often result execution far operation necessary higher memory consumption larger binary program size
For reason code need run particularly quickly efficiently may require use language even language would make coding easier
In many case critical portion program mostly language leading much faster efficient simply reliably functioning
However growing complexity modern architecture compiler language frequently produce code comparable efficiency programmer produce hand higher abstraction may allow powerful technique providing better overall result counterpart particular setting
language designed independent specific computing system architecture
This facilitates executing program written language computing system compatible support Interpreted program
language improved designer develop improvement
In case new language evolve one others goal aggregating popular construct new improved feature
An example maintains backward compatibility mean program library written Java continue usable even programming shop switch Scala make transition easier lifespan coding indefinite
In contrast program rarely survive beyond system architecture written without major revision
This engineering Penalty
Examples programming language active use today include many others
The term inherently relative
Some decade ago similar language often considered supported concept expression evaluation recursive function data type structure considered
Today many programmer might refer C lack large garbage collection etc
basically support scalar operation provides direct memory addressing
It therefore readily blend assembly language machine level
Assembly language may regarded higher level often still used without representation support concept constant limited expression sometimes even variable procedure
turn inherently slightly higher level used internally many processor
There three general mode execution modern language Note language strictly interpreted language compiled language
Rather implementation language behavior use interpretation compilation
For example interpreted even though typically compiled
Similarly Java show difficulty trying apply label language rather implementation Java compiled bytecode bytecode subsequently executed either interpretation compilation typically compiler JVM
Moreover compilation interpretation strictly limited description compiler artifact binary executable IL assembly
Alternatively possible language directly implemented computer computer directly executes HLL code
This known designed targeted specific language

In also least one following All function
In mathematics function also termed
The common example since map function also function
function confused us word functor throughout mathematics see
In untyped function language derived function take one function argument value type form
In following example function take function applies function value twice
If applied several time preferably return function rather value
This line principle
Or quickly In Clojure start lambda expression refers next function argument
In Scheme example function used implement
It take single argument return function
The evaluation expression first return function evaluating
The returned function
Then evaluates returned function argument returning
This equivalent expression since equivalent curried form
In Erlang example function take list function argument
It evaluates function argument argument
If function return false next function evaluated
If function return next function argument evaluated
If function return function return
Note function
The example return
In Elixir mix module definition anonymous function Alternatively also compose using pure anonymous function
Notice function literal defined either identifier anonymously assigned variable
Run full program
With generic lambda provided Or using std In Perl code object closure therefore reference inner lexical variable outer scope lexical variable closed inside function
Perl also support pointy block syntax lambda expression assigned variable invoked anonymously
Tcl us apply command apply anonymous function since
The XACML standard defines function standard apply function multiple value attribute bag
The list function found
language allow programmer pas around reference function
The following C code computes approximation integral arbitrary function The function C standard library us function pointer emulate behavior function
also used achieve effect higher order function
However macro easily avoid problem variable capture may also result large amount duplicated code difficult compiler optimize
Macros generally strongly typed although may produce strongly typed code
In language possible achieve algorithmic result obtained via function dynamically executing code sometimes called operation scope evaluation
There significant drawback approach In language support function effective substitute
An object act essence like function method may accept object parameter produce object return value
Objects often carry added overhead compared pure function however added defining instantiating object method
Languages permit versus object provide flexibility method
An example using simple stack based record function return function The function take record input return integer value sum record field
used implement function language lack In case different type used trigger different function via
The overloaded function example signature

A enables write le independent particular type
Such considered closer human language
In contrast considered close machine language
The main advantage language easier read write maintain
Ultimately program written language must translated machine language

Project Management How Define Project Constraints How Assess Your Project Stakeholders Power Interest How Use Stakeholder Register Template How Gather Ideas Projects Handling Administrative Issues End Your Project Project limitation may influence manage project may even determine whether project driver supporter decide proceed project
Project limitation typically fall several category
By recognizing category focus investigation thereby increase chance discover limitation affecting project
Your project driver supporter may preset expectation requirement one following category The product effect project
For example new product must cost per item manufacture new book must fewer page length
When must produce certain result
For example project must done June
You know whether possible finish June know someone expects product produced
The type amount availability resource perform project work
Resources include people fund equipment raw material facility information
For example budget two people full time three month use test laboratory first week June
The strategy performing different task
For example told must use organization printing department reproduce new user manual system developing
You know manual look like many page number copy need need
Therefore know whether organization printing department task
But point know someone expects printing department work
Be careful vague limitation provide poor guidance demoralize people deal
Here example vague limitation improve Finish project soon This statement tell nothing
With limitation audience may suddenly demand project final result advance warning
Finish project close business June You Laura Webster project part time How heavily count
From Laura point view juggle assignment period idea long one take
You Laura Webster project four hour per day first two week Determining limitation mission job identify examine possible source information
You want miss anything want clarify conflicting information
After know people expect determine whether meet expectation
Try following approach Check driver limitation regarding desired result check supporter limitation concerning activity performance resource
These material may include plan annual budget capital appropriation plan analysis feasibility study report related project minute meeting individual performance objective
Confirming limitation different source increase confidence accuracy
Resolve conflicting opinion limitation soon possible

Karen year experience consultancy including creation training material running course IT professional
So want manage project completion
And possibly even successfully lucky
Where start
How important aspect project management
These essentially rule bind managing project
They determine whether project successful
Think route direction get destination may change time
This lesson identify constraint provide detailed description use sample project illustrate constraint related
Then prepared ask relevant constraint question planning understand impact constraint
The following six constraint recognized determining factor project management Let take look extremely simple project help u understand constraint interrelated
This project requires make trip local store lunch work day pay colleague man work station
The constraint time available deliver project
In case schedule must return store colleague return station
If allotted time overrun due traffic queue store etc
additional cost incurred colleague must paid extra oversee station additional time
Alternatively quality scope customer satisfaction project may impacted colleague may unable remain additional time thus forcing return purchasing lunch item
If happy end result get good lunch good price delay work station covered good chance customer
satisfied
The jeopardized project constraint impacted
For example dissatisfied pay lunch planned unable purchase lunch
measure successful correct project deliverable
In case considered high goal achieved lunch purchased time without additional cost work station maintained duration absence
A change project quality likely impact customer satisfaction
refers feature project project
This includes lunch purchased driving specific local store colleague covering station
Examples scope feature cycling store colleague take station buying dinner instead lunch
Get FREE access day create account
If project scope change example store longer stock lunch item may decide purchase dinner item alternative
However impact project scope quality customer satisfaction budget project deliver set
The dinner may nice lunch happy dinner instead lunch cost
uncertainty threat project
There many known risk There also always possibility unknown risk arising project
Project risk impact project constraint
The important action take risk attempt identify possible risk mitigate
Plan alternative action risk occurs project impacted
include people budget asset required deliver project
You colleague resource
Your car project budget resource
The budget cover cost gas car cost lunch cost colleague
Let say colleague fall You may choose hire replacement colleague therefore incurring additional project cost maintaining quality scope intact
You may unable hire replacement colleague short notice therefore preventing purchasing lunch impacting project quality customer satisfaction scope
You may also decide leave workstation unattended putting position risk jeopardizing quality project
All good project management approach include knowing detailing planning mitigating project constraint To unlock lesson must Member

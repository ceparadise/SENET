Hardly say one startup CEO lambasts school failing teach practical computer skill suggesting developer skip degree path first place
In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity
An Android developer authority computer copy editor Shakespeare Keats
Instead larger lesson may developer realistic career opportunity school upfront program lead

Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue

That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

In domestic environment computer play practical part affair hardware also consists external peripheral mouse keyboard screen
The programming layer deal software instruction used accomplish computation manage data
Programs take many form performed many level implemented many different language
Yet despite enormous variety programming issue goal remains solve problem
Every computer operating system OS help manage computer resource
Operating system Linux help u interact computer system manage way hardware device program data interact
Knowing operating system key understanding computer general
The previous inner layer focus making computer system work
The application layer contrast focus using computer solve specific problem
We run application program take advantage computer ability area helping u design building play game
The spectrum computer software tool involves specific sub discipline computing information system artificial intelligence simulation
Describe role computer take networked world
Computers longer exist isolation someone desktop
We use computer technology communicate communication fundamental layer computing system operate
Computers connected network share information resource
The Internet example evolved global network almost place Earth communicate via computing technology
The World Wide Web make communication relatively easy revolutionized computer use made accessible general public
Roles computer may take today internet simple client end user web server email server computer handle email messaging DNS server computer translates domain name address router computer handling data network firewall computer tasked control allowed disallowed connection typically security purpose
The use computing technology result increased security hazard
Some issue security dealt low level throughout computer system
Many though involve keeping personal information secure
Discuss social ethical issue associated networked world
Many issue discussed information security set technique policy enforced organisation individual ensure proper access protected data
Information security make certain data read modified anyone without proper authorization data available needed
Information security described synthesis confidentiality integrity availability
Although aspect information security overlap interact define three specific way look problem
Any good solution information security problem must adequately address issue
From business point view planning information security requires risk analysis process demining data need protecting identifying risk data calculating likelihood risk may become reality
Once risk analysis complete plan implemented manage risk accordingly
A risk pairing threat vulnerability
We want minimize vulnerability threat put u risk
These threat either malicious posed hacker accidental system crash
Another principle embraced information security expert concept separating available data management privilege single individual authority significant impact system
This principle often implemented redundant check approval needed key activity
For instance large financial transaction often require separate authorization process
Administrators assign individual privilege needed carry job function
Central confidentiality integrity data making sure unauthorized user gain access account
Identify relevant stakeholder planning new system
A stakeholder organization group individual affected organization objective
Stakeholders may responsible design financial interest responsible maintenance client organization
Examples stakeholder include user developer legislator
Describe method obtaining requirement stakeholder
There many method obtaining need stakeholder
One method observation involves monitoring system work
For example developer may watch union worker register new member course day record note process along question asked information needed etc
While method produce quantifiable data observation allows developer human insight process method may obtain
Additionally impossible observe system without changing
Surveys easier method collecting data
As taken remotely cheaper le time consuming
Surveys produce clear number easy perform statistic
For example email may sent costumer library asking use current book loaning system
However response rate may low response may exhibit bias
Interviews allow researcher interact stakeholder
They direct method collecting data
However small sample size remain risk well social pressure stakeholder
It important keep mind privacy stakeholder
For example designing system reporting corruption government agency one may want publish identity whistleblower interviewed design process protect source
Describe appropriate technique gathering information needed arrive workable solution
If legacy system replaced one must examine current system first
Also one analyse similar competing product
Additionally necessary take organisational capability much resource
money organisation available account sometimes performing literature search
google appropriate technique
Construct suitable representation illustrate system requirement
A flowchart type diagram represents algorithm workflow process showing step box various kind order connecting arrow
Data flow chart similar system flow chart except show decision made
They show different path data take held processed
A structure chart break computer system submodules
They represent modularization aspect computer science
balance Discuss social ethical issue associated introduction new IT system
Describe purpose prototype demonstrate proposed system client
Software prototyping activity creating prototype software application incomplete version software program developed
Prototyping several benefit The software designer implementer get valuable feedback user early project
The client contractor compare software made match software specification
Discuss importance iteration design process
Prototypes often used alongside iterative design process quickly build product market suitable client need
Iterative design allows product improved refined quickly based testing result
For example Windows shortly released failure OS Windows
Explain possible consequence failing involve design process
Dissatisfaction need may met
Define term usability
Usability ease use object
The object use software application anything human interacts
The efficient satisfying memorable program usable

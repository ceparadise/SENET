Nevertheless modern processor publishing platform try replace inappropriately positioned hyphen corresponding dash automatically reduces need learn type manually
Also using instead minus sign usually considered acceptable
The easiest one deal

The case required type hyphen manually joining two word woman prefix word

In case prefix common word le likely hyphen used

And see dealing internet I tend use double hyphen instead never know text editor going handle handle often convert double hyphen
And far I know substituting spaced use unspaced definitely
That seems convention
The difference em en dash matter great deal spacing make much clearer especially distinguish dash interjecting little note like hyphen phrase example
It technically wrong
I think MS Word contributes practice
You get automatically make single hyphen
However typing along type followed word like convert hyphen
It remove space around
For reason I gotten habit way I writing something formal

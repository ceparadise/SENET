In represents countable number ordered value may occur
An instance list computer representation concept finite potentially infinite analog list
Lists basic example contain value
If value occurs multiple time occurrence considered distinct item
The name also used several concrete used implement abstract list especially
Many provide support special syntax semantics list list operation
A list often constructed writing item sequence separated within pair delimiters
Some language may allow list type like case data type accurately described array
In list usually provided subclass generic list class traversed via separate
List data type often implemented using linked list sort may appropriate application
In context programming term list may refer specifically linked list rather array
In abstract list usually defined two operation yield empty list add item beginning list
Implementation list data structure may provide following Lists typically implemented either either singly doubly linked usually variable length
The standard way implementing list originating programming language element list contain value pointer indicating location next element list
This result either depending whether list nested sublists
Some older Lisp implementation Lisp implementation also supported compressed list using special internal representation invisible user
Lists manipulated using
The former often preferred latter norm
Lists implemented holding pair providing access element
residing fringe internal node storing child index used guide search taking time logarithmic list size long change much provide illusion enable swap prefix append operation logarithmic time well
Some language offer list offer use kind table emulate list
For example provides table
Although Lua store list numerical index array internally still appear dictionary
In list fundamental data type represent program code data
In dialect list first three prime number could written
In several dialect Lisp including list collection pair consisting value pointer next pair null value making singly linked list
As name implies list used store list element
However unlike traditional list expand shrink stored dynamically memory
In computing list easier implement set
A finite mathematical sense realized list additional restriction duplicate element disallowed order irrelevant
Sorting list speed determining given item already set order ensure order requires time add new entry list
In efficient implementation however set implemented using rather list
Lists also form basis including variation
The abstract list type element type list defined following function axiom element list
It implicit Note first nil rest nil defined
These axiom equivalent abstract data type
In definition simply regarded defined term constructor
In algebraic term represented transformation
obtained constructor separately handling case
The list type form following function using rather represent monomorphic list element type defined Alternatively monad may defined term operation Note since applied progressively deeper argument recursive call
The list type additive monad monadic zero monadic sum
Lists form operation
The identity element monoid empty list
In fact set list element

Computer system need reliable
Backing testing redundancy disaster recovery plan help improve system reliability
Computers found almost anywhere usually handling data quickly efficiently fewer error done task manually
However lot thing go wrong computer system Reliability major concern company
There serious consequence including Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I struggling search modern fast consequence finder
That implementation based theory thing ilk OTTER etc
To describe I mean consequence finding please correct term usage inappropriate Given satisfiable consistent set clause C clause finite disjuction literal wherever atom p clause p p clause p add new clause C provided already found C
This I understand process performing Resolution
Assuming generate possible new clause C contintually adding generated clause trying find new clause C
As small example input p q p r p q p r q r would output
If remove subsumed clause C
clause form exists clause form set clause C
I want C
I impression would tool like mentioned generate set since C essentially would remain performed vanilla resolution satisfiable set clause
Updated answer based upon revised question It sound like resolution exactly want I suggest implement resolution algorithm combined subsumption test
Implementing straightforward programming exercise take hour
Original answer earlier version question I know dedicated solver aimed solving problem one poor man approach might implement using SAT solver
The approach depend looking particular space consequence allowed come
Let first observe use SAT solver determine whether candidate clause indeed consequence
This useful building block
Suppose x formula boolean variable
Let c x clause
You easily use SAT solver test whether c x consequence x
In particular test whether x c x satisfiable satisfiable c x consequence otherwise c x consequence
If want consequence conjunction literal find minimal consequence using SAT solver
In particular suffices use dumb search
Focus clause contain single literal possibility
Test see one consequence requires invocation SAT solver
In word variable test whether consequence also test whether consequence
Now bunch consequence say literal
Then also consequence turn minimal consequence minimal among space conjunction literal
This procedure requires O n invocation SAT solver pretty efficient
If want consequence disjunction literal also possible find minimal consequence minimal among set disjunction literal though somewhat complex
Let build idea You use SAT solver find single consequence x necessarily minimal consequence
Feed x SAT solver let find satisfying assignment say
Then possible identify consequence necessarily minimal x
In particular clause consequence x
To put another way consider clause c x either according whether false true c x consequence x
This somewhat trivial boring consequence valid one
Once single consequence c x possible minimize
In particular look minimal subset S x I consequence x
How
We simply try removing one literal time c x removing one index time set I testing step whether result remains valid consequence
If removing literal disjunction leaf valid consequence go ahead remove literal removal longer valid consequence remove
Each test requires single invocation SAT solver procedure requires n invocation SAT solver
When done single minimal consequence x x
Next I show find second consequence
Let explain using example
Suppose x say suppose know x minimal consequence literal removed disjunction keeping consequence
We want find second minimal consequence x disjunction literal
What say set literal appear x
Well either x contain literal contain literal contain literal otherwise would consequence x subsumed thus minimal
So let search consequence satisfies constraint
One way search satisfying assignment x feeding SAT solver
Suppose SAT solver give u satisfying assignment
Then immediately suggests consequence subsumed x namely clause expressed disjunction literal
If want minimize consequence get minimal consequence x
By construction x minimal different x
This give u way find two minimal consequence
Now clear find minimal consequence
Suppose found x x minimal consequence x x
We define formula x Feed formula SAT solver
If unsatisfiable done found minimal consequence
Otherwise suppose find satisfying assignment say
Then immediately supply new consequence minimize get new minimal consequence x
Now iterate found
The running time algorithm best expressed measure
If minimal consequence clause algorithm complete making O mn query SAT solver
It might even somewhat efficient use SAT solver allows make multiple related query remembers state across query
Now suppose want allow consequence CNF formula want consequence minimal among set consequence
Then problem becomes trivial
In particular x trivial consequence x possible show minimal consequence formula satisfying assignment subsumed formula fewer satisfying assignment consequence
Resolution mean end end goal
Resolution one technique used SAT solver SAT solver also use technique well combination technique important
What seen practice current SAT solver perform lot better vanilla resolution many problem
Therefore advice articulate problem statement clearly try keep clear mind distinction goal problem statement v way achieve goal algorithm use
Formulate goal way describes want achieve want achieved
Once articulate goal clearly might find resolution optimal method

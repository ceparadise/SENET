BOX
Asking question science defining problem engineering
Developing using model
Planning carrying investigation
Analyzing interpreting data
Using mathematics computational thinking
Constructing explanation science designing solution engineering
Engaging argument evidence
Obtaining evaluating communicating information Throughout discussion consider practice science engineering
In many case practice two field similar enough discussed together
In case however considered separately
Engaging practice science help student understand scientific knowledge develops direct involvement give appreciation wide range approach used investigate model explain world
Engaging practice engineering likewise help student understand work engineer well link engineering science
Participation practice also help student form understanding crosscutting concept disciplinary idea science engineering moreover make student knowledge meaningful embeds deeply worldview
The actual science engineering also pique student curiosity capture interest motivate continued study insight thus gained help recognize work scientist engineer creative The actual science engineering pique student curiosity capture interest motivate continued study
endeavor deeply affected world live
Students may recognize science engineering contribute meeting many major challenge confront society today generating sufficient energy preventing treating disease maintaining supply fresh water food addressing climate change
Any education focus predominantly detailed product scientific fact developing understanding fact established ignores many important application science world misrepresents science marginalizes importance engineering
The idea science set practice emerged work historian philosopher psychologist sociologist past year
This work illuminates science actually done short term study activity particular laboratory program historically study laboratory notebook published text eyewitness account
Seeing science set practice show theory development reasoning testing component larger ensemble activity includes network participant institution specialized way talking writing development model represent system phenomenon making predictive inference construction appropriate instrumentation testing hypothesis experiment observation
Our view perspective improvement previous approach several way
First minimizes tendency reduce scientific practice single set procedure identifying controlling variable classifying entity identifying source error
This tendency overemphasizes experimental investigation expense practice modeling critique communication
In addition procedure taught isolation science content become aim instruction rather mean developing deeper understanding concept purpose science
Second focus practice plural avoids mistaken impression one distinctive approach common single scientific method uncertainty universal attribute science
In reality practicing scientist employ broad spectrum method although science involves many area uncertainty knowledge developed many aspect scientific knowledge well established unquestioned foundation culture technology
It engagement practice student recognize knowledge come part scientific theory firmly established others
Third attempt develop idea science taught process inquiry hampered lack commonly accepted definition constituent element
Such ambiguity result widely divergent pedagogic objective outcome counterproductive goal common standard
The focus important practice modeling developing explanation engaging critique evaluation argumentation often underemphasized context science education
In particular stress critique essential element building new knowledge general learning science particular
Traditionally science education paid little attention role critique science
However idea science evaluated alternative explanation compared evidence acceptance explanation ultimately assessment data reliable relevant decision explanation satisfactory
Thus knowing wrong answer wrong help secure deeper stronger understanding right answer right
Engaging argumentation evidence explanation support student understanding reason empirical evidence explanation demonstrating science body knowledge rooted evidence
One helpful way understanding practice scientist engineer frame work done three sphere activity shown
In one sphere dominant activity investigation empirical inquiry
In second essence work construction explanation design using reasoning creative thinking model
And third sphere idea fit model explanation evidence appropriateness product design analyzed debated evaluated
In three sphere The three sphere activity scientist engineer
activity scientist engineer try use best available tool support task hand today mean modern computational technology integral virtually aspect work
At left figure activity related empirical investigation
In sphere activity scientist determine need measured observe phenomenon plan experiment program observation method data collection build instrument engage disciplined fieldwork identify source uncertainty
For part engineer engage testing contribute data informing proposed design
A civil engineer example design new highway without measuring terrain collecting data nature soil water flow
The activity related developing explanation solution shown right figure
For scientist work sphere activity draw established theory model propose extension theory create new model
Often develop model hypothesis lead new question investigate alternative explanation consider
For engineer major practice production design
Design development also involves constructing model example computer simulation new structure process may used test design range simulated condition later stage test physical prototype
Both scientist engineer use sketch diagram mathematical relationship simulation physical make prediction likely behavior system collect data evaluate prediction possibly revise model result
Between within two sphere activity practice evaluation represented middle space
Here iterative process repeat every step work
Critical thinking required whether developing refining idea explanation design conducting investigation
The dominant activity sphere argumentation critique often lead experiment observation change proposed model explanation design
Scientists engineer use argumentation make case idea whether involving new theory design novel way collecting data interpretation evidence
They peer attempt identify weakness limitation argument ultimate goal refining improving explanation design
In reality scientist engineer move fluidly iteratively back forth among three sphere activity conduct activity might involve two even three mode
The function therefore solely offer scheme help identify function significance range diversity practice embedded work scientist engineer
Although admittedly simplification figure identify three overarching category practice show interact
Engineering science similar involve creative process neither us one method
And scientific investigation defined different way engineering design described various way
However widespread agreement broad outline engineering design process
Like scientific investigation engineering design iterative systematic
It iterative new version design tested modified based learned point
It systematic number characteristic step must undertaken
One step identifying problem defining specification constraint
Another step generating idea solve problem engineer often use research group session brainstorming come range solution design alternative development
Yet another step testing potential solution building testing physical mathematical model prototype provide valuable data obtained way
With data hand engineer analyze well various solution meet given specification constraint evaluate needed improve leading design devise better one
In contrast scientific study may may driven immediate practical application
On one hand certain kind scientific research led Pasteur fundamental contribution germ theory disease undertaken practical purpose resulted important new technology including vaccination anthrax rabies pasteurization milk prevent spoilage
On hand many scientific study search planet orbiting distant star driven curiosity undertaken aim answering question world understanding Students opportunity immerse practice explore central science engineering critical appreciating skill expert nature enterprise
observed pattern
For science developing explanation constitutes success regardless whether immediate practical application goal science develop set coherent mutually consistent theoretical description world provide explanation wide range phenomenon For engineering however success measured extent human need want addressed
Both scientist engineer engage argumentation different goal
In engineering goal argumentation evaluate prospective design produce effective design meeting specification constraint
This optimization process typically involves competing goal consequence never one correct solution design challenge
Instead number possible solution choosing among inevitably involves personal well technical cost consideration
Moreover continual arrival new technology enables new solution
In contrast theory science must meet different set criterion parsimony preference simpler solution explanatory coherence essentially well new theory provides explanation phenomenon fit observation allow prediction inference past made
Moreover aim science find single coherent comprehensive theory range related phenomenon
Multiple competing explanation regarded unsatisfactory possible contradiction contain must resolved data enable either selection best available explanation development new comprehensive theory phenomenon question
Although expect student able develop new scientific theory expect develop model argue using conjunction evidence observation develop explanation
Indeed developing model argument explanation key developing demonstrating understanding accepted scientific viewpoint
A focus practice plural avoids mistaken impression one distinctive approach common single scientific The practice described chapter derived scientist engineer actually engage part work
We recognize student reach level competence professional scientist engineer novice violinist expected attain ability virtuoso
Yet student opportunity immerse practice explore central science engineering critical appreciating skill expert nature enterprise
We consider eight practice essential element science engineering curriculum
Asking question science defining problem engineering
Developing using model
Planning carrying investigation
Analyzing interpreting data
Using mathematics computational thinking
Constructing explanation science designing solution engineering
Engaging argument evidence
Obtaining evaluating communicating information In eight subsection follow address turn eight practice depth
Each discussion describes practice articulates major competency student end grade Goals sketch competence level might progress across preceding grade Progression
These sketch based committee judgment little research evidence yet developmental trajectory practice
The overall objective student develop facility inclination call practice separately combination needed support learning demonstrate understanding science engineering
briefly contrast role practice manifestation science counterpart engineering
In science engineering practice used iteratively combination seen linear sequence step taken order presented
BOX Practice Questions engine drive science engineering
Science asks What exists happens
Why happen
How one know
Engineering asks What done address particular human need want
How need better specified
What tool technology available could developed addressing need
Both science engineering ask How one communicate phenomenon evidence explanation design solution
Asking question essential developing scientific habit mind
Even individual become scientist engineer ability ask question important component science literacy helping make critical consumer scientific knowledge
Scientific question arise variety way
They driven curiosity world Why sky blue
They inspired model theory prediction attempt extend refine model theory How particle model matter explain incompressibility liquid
Or result need provide better solution problem
For example question impossible siphon water height foot led Evangelista Torricelli inventor barometer discovery atmosphere identification vacuum
Questions also important engineering
Engineers must able ask probing question order define engineering problem
For example may ask What need desire underlies problem
What criterion specification successful solution
What constraint
Other question arise generating possible solution Will solution meet design criterion
Can two idea combined produce better solution
Students grade level able ask question text read feature phenomenon observe conclusion draw model scientific investigation
What possible
And question arise testing solution Which idea tested
What evidence needed show idea optimal given constraint
The experience learning science engineering therefore develop student ability indeed encourage question investigated empirically
Students also need recognize distinction question answered empirically answerable domain knowledge human experience
GOALS By grade student able Ask question natural example Why season
What bee
Why structure collapse
How electric power generated
Distinguish scientific question Why helium balloon rise
nonscientific question Which colored balloon prettiest
Formulate refine question answered empirically science classroom use design inquiry construct pragmatic solution
Ask probing question seek identify premise argument request elaboration refine research question engineering problem challenge interpretation data example How know
What evidence support argument
Note feature pattern contradiction observation ask question
For engineering ask question need desire met order define constraint specification solution
PROGRESSION Students grade level able ask question text read feature phenomenon observe conclusion draw model scientific investigation
For engineering ask question define problem solved elicit idea lead constraint specification solution
As progress across grade question become relevant focused sophisticated
Facilitating evolution require classroom culture respect value good question offer student opportunity refine question questioning strategy incorporates teaching effective questioning strategy across grade level
As result student become increasingly proficient posing question request relevant empirical evidence seek refine model explanation engineering problem challenge premise argument suitability design
Practice Scientists construct mental conceptual model phenomenon
Mental model internal personal idiosyncratic incomplete unstable essentially functional
They serve purpose tool thinking making prediction making sense experience
Conceptual model focus section contrast explicit representation way analogous phenomenon represent
Conceptual model allow scientist engineer better visualize understand phenomenon investigation develop possible solution design problem
Used science engineering either structural functional behavioral analog albeit simplified conceptual model include diagram physical replica mathematical representation analogy computer simulation
Although correspond exactly complicated entity modeled bring certain feature focus minimizing obscuring others
Because model contain approximation assumption limit range validity application precision predictive power important recognize limitation
Conceptual model sens external articulation mental model scientist hold strongly interrelated mental model
Building understanding model role science help student construct revise mental model phenomenon
Better mental model turn lead deeper understanding science enhanced scientific reasoning
Scientists use model sake simplicity use term model refer conceptual model rather mental model represent current understanding system part system study aid development question explanation communicate idea others
Some model used scientist mathematical example ideal gas law equation derived model gas set point mass engaged perfectly elastic collision wall simplified model based atomic theory matter
For complex system mathematical representation physical system used create computer simulation enable scientist predict behavior otherwise intractable example effect increasing atmospheric level carbon dioxide agriculture different region world
Models evaluated refined iterative cycle comparing prediction real world adjusting thereby potentially yielding insight phenomenon modeled
Engineering make use model analyze existing system allows engineer see condition flaw might develop test possible solution new problem
Engineers also use model visualize design take higher level refinement communicate design feature others prototype testing design performance
Models particularly modern computer simulation encode relevant physical law property material especially helpful realizing testing design structure building bridge aircraft expensive construct must survive extreme condition occur rare occasion
Other type engineering problem also benefit use specialized simulation design testing phase
But science engineer use model must aware intrinsic limitation test known situation ensure reliable
GOALS By grade student able Construct drawing diagram representation event example draw picture insect labeled feature represent happens water puddle warmed sun represent simple physical model object use basis explanation make prediction system behave specified circumstance
Represent explain phenomenon multiple type example represent molecule model bond move flexibly model type different one useful different purpose
Discuss limitation precision model representation system process design suggest way model might improved better fit available evidence better reflect design specification
Refine model light empirical evidence criticism improve quality explanatory power
Use provided computer simulation simulation developed simple simulation tool tool understanding investigating aspect system particularly readily visible naked eye
Make use model test design aspect design compare effectiveness different design solution
PROGRESSION Modeling begin earliest grade student model progressing concrete picture physical scale model toy car abstract representation relevant relationship later grade diagram representing force particular object system
Students asked use diagram map abstract model tool enable elaborate idea finding present others
Young student encouraged devise pictorial simple graphical representation finding investigation use model developing explanation occurred
More sophisticated type model increasingly used across grade instruction curriculum material student progress science education
The quality model highly dependent prior knowledge skill also student understanding system modeled student expected refine model understanding develops
Curricula need stress role model explicitly provide student modeling tool modeling NetLogo spreadsheet model student come value core practice develop level facility constructing applying appropriate model
Practice Scientists engineer investigate observe world essentially two goal systematically describe world develop test theory explanation world work
In first careful observation description often lead identification feature need explained question need explored
The second goal requires investigation test explanatory model world prediction whether inference suggested model supported data
Planning designing investigation require ability design experimental observational inquiry appropriate answering question asked testing hypothesis formed
This process begin identifying relevant variable considering might observed measured controlled constrained experimental design take particular value
Planning control important part design investigation
In laboratory experiment critical decide variable treated result output thus left vary treated input condition hence controlled
In many case particularly case field observation planning involves deciding controlled collect different sample data different condition even though condition direct control investigator
Decisions must also made measurement taken level accuracy required kind instrumentation best suited making measurement
As form inquiry key issue one goal measure variable accurately possible reduce source error
The investigator must therefore decide constitutes sufficient level precision technique used reduce random systematic error
GOALS By grade student able Formulate question investigated within scope classroom school laboratory field available resource appropriate frame hypothesis possible explanation predicts particular stable outcome based model theory
Decide data gathered tool needed gathering measurement recorded
Decide much data needed produce reliable measurement consider limitation precision data
Plan experimental procedure identifying relevant independent dependent variable appropriate need control
Consider possible confounding variable effect ensure investigation design controlled
PROGRESSION Students need opportunity design investigation learn importance decision measure keep constant select construct data collection instrument appropriate need inquiry
They also need experience help recognize laboratory sole domain legitimate scientific inquiry many scientist earth scientist ethologist ecologist laboratory natural world experiment conducted data collected field
In elementary year student experience structured help learn define feature investigated pattern suggest causal relationship What feature ramp affect speed given ball leaf ramp
The plan investigation trial make record information need refined iteratively student recognize experience limitation original plan
These investigation enriched extended linking engineering design example student apply learned ramp design track make ball travel given distance go around loop stop uphill slope
From earliest grade student opportunity carry careful systematic investigation appropriately supported prior experience develop ability observe measure record data using appropriate tool instrument
Students opportunity plan carry several different kind investigation year
At level engage investigation range structured order expose issue question would unlikely explore measuring specific property material emerge student question
As become sophisticated student also opportunity identify question researched also decide data gathered variable controlled tool instrument needed gather record data appropriate format eventually consider incorporate measurement error analyzing data
Older student asked develop hypothesis predicts particular stable outcome explain reasoning justify choice
By high school hypothesis based model theory
In addition student able recognize always possible control variable method used example looking correlation understanding correlation necessarily imply causality
Practice Once collected data must presented form reveal pattern relationship allows result communicated others
Because raw data little meaning major practice scientist organize interpret data tabulating graphing statistical analysis
Such analysis bring meaning may used evidence
Once collected data must presented form reveal pattern relationship allows result communicated others
Engineers make decision based evidence given design work rarely rely trial error
Engineers often analyze design creating model prototype collecting extensive data performs including extreme condition
Analysis kind data informs design decision enables prediction assessment performance also help define clarify problem determine economic feasibility evaluate alternative investigate failure
Spreadsheets database provide useful way organizing data especially large data set
The identification relationship data aided range tool including table graph mathematics
Tables permit major feature large body data summarized conveniently accessible form graph offer mean visually summarizing data mathematics essential expressing relationship different variable data set see discussion mathematics
Modern visualization tool often allow data displayed varied form thus learner engage interactively data analysis
In addition standard statistical technique help reduce effect error relating one variable another
Students need opportunity analyze large data set identify correlation
Increasingly data temperature pollution level scientific available Internet
Moreover information technology enables capture data beyond classroom hour day
Such data set extend range student experience help illuminate important practice analyzing interpreting data
GOALS By grade student able Analyze data systematically either look salient pattern test whether data consistent initial hypothesis
Recognize data conflict expectation consider revision initial model needed
Use spreadsheet database table chart graph statistic mathematics information computer technology collate summarize display data explore relationship variable especially representing input output
Evaluate strength conclusion inferred data set using appropriate mathematical statistical technique
Recognize pattern data suggest relationship worth investigating
Distinguish causal correlational relationship
Collect data physical model analyze performance design range condition
PROGRESSION At elementary level student need support recognize need record drawing word share others
As engage scientific inquiry deeply begin collect categorical numerical data presentation form facilitate interpretation table graph
When feasible computer digital tool introduced mean enabling practice
In middle school student opportunity learn standard technique displaying analyzing interpreting data technique include different type graph identification outlier data set averaging reduce effect measurement error
Students also asked explain technique needed
As student progress various science class high school investigation become complex need develop skill additional technique displaying analyzing data scatterplots express relationship two variable
Students helped recognize may need explore one way display data order identify present significant feature
They also need opportunity use mathematics statistic analyze feature data covariation
Also high school level student opportunity use greater diversity sample scientific data use computer digital tool support kind analysis
Students expected use technique engineering well
When important made cognizant purpose data collect analyze intended help validate improve design decide optimal solution
Practice Mathematics computational tool central science engineering
Mathematics enables numerical representation variable symbolic representation relationship physical entity prediction outcome
Mathematics provides powerful model describing predicting phenomenon atomic structure gravitational force quantum mechanic
Since century computational theory information computer technology algorithm revolutionized virtually scientific engineering field
These tool strategy allow scientist engineer collect analyze large data set search distinctive pattern identify relationship significant feature way previously impossible
They also provide powerful new technique employing mathematics model complex example circulation carbon dioxide atmosphere ocean
Mathematics computation powerful tool brought bear scientific investigation
Mathematics serf pragmatic function communicative function one language science structural function allows logical deduction
Mathematics enables idea expressed precise form enables identification new idea physical world
For example concept equivalence mass energy emerged mathematical analysis conducted Einstein based premise special relativity
The contemporary understanding electromagnetic wave emerged Maxwell mathematical analysis behavior electric magnetic field
Modern theoretical physic heavily imbued mathematics would make sense try divide mathematical nonmathematical part
In much modern science prediction inference probabilistic nature understanding mathematics probability statistically derived inference important part understanding science
Computational tool enhance power mathematics enabling calculation carried analytically
For example allow development simulation combine mathematical representation Increasing student familiarity role mathematics science central developing deeper understanding science work
multiple underlying phenomenon model dynamic complex system
Computational method also potent tool visually representing data show result calculation simulation way allow exploration pattern
Engineering involves mathematical computational skill
For example structural engineer create mathematical model bridge building design based physical law test performance probe structural limit ass whether completed within acceptable budget
Virtually engineering design raise issue require computation resolution
Although difference mathematics computational thinking applied science engineering mathematics often brings two field together enabling engineer apply mathematical form scientific theory enabling scientist use powerful information technology designed engineer
Both kind professional thereby accomplish investigation analysis build complex model might otherwise question
Mathematics including statistic computational tool essential data analysis especially large data set
The ability view data different perspective different graphical representation test relationship variable explore interplay diverse external condition require mathematical skill enhanced extended computational skill
GOALS By grade student able Recognize dimensional quantity use appropriate unit scientific application mathematical formula graph
Express relationship quantity appropriate mathematical algorithmic form scientific modeling investigation
Recognize computer simulation built mathematical model incorporate underlying assumption phenomenon system studied
Use simple test case mathematical expression computer program compare outcome known real see make Use understanding mathematics statistic analyzing data
PROGRESSION Increasing student familiarity role mathematics science central developing deeper understanding science work
As soon student learn count begin using number find describe pattern nature
At appropriate grade level learn use instrument ruler protractor thermometer measurement variable best represented continuous numerical scale apply mathematics interpolate value identify maximum minimum range average simple data set
A significant advance come relationship expressed using equality first word algebraic example shifting distance traveled equal velocity multiplied time elapsed
Students opportunity explore symbolic representation used represent data predict outcome eventually derive relationship using mathematics
Students gain experience using computer record measurement taken probe instrument thereby recognizing process allows multiple measurement made rapidly recurrently
Likewise student gain experience using computer program transform data various tabular graphical form thereby aiding identification pattern
Students thus encouraged explore use computer data analysis using simple data set early age
For example could use spreadsheet record data perform simple recurring calculation data calculation average speed measurement position multiple time
Later work introduce use mathematical relationship build simple computer model using appropriate supporting program information computer technology tool
As student progress understanding mathematics computation every level science classroom place tool progressively exploited
Practice Because science seek enhance human understanding world scientific theory developed provide explanation aimed illuminating nature particular phenomenon predicting future event making inference past event
Science developed explanatory theory germ theory disease Big Bang theory origin universe Darwin theory evolution specie
Although role often informal use word theory mean theory construct based significant body knowledge evidence revised light new evidence must withstand significant scrutiny scientific community widely accepted applied
Theories mere guess especially valued provide explanation multiple instance
In science term hypothesis also used differently everyday language
A scientific hypothesis neither scientific theory guess plausible explanation observed phenomenon predict happen given situation
A hypothesis made based existing theoretical understanding relevant situation often also specific model system question
Scientific explanation account link scientific theory specific observation example explain observed relationship variable describe mechanism support cause effect inference
Very often theory first represented specific model situation question explanation developed
For example one understands theory oxygen obtained transported utilized body model circulatory system developed used explain heart rate breathing rate increase exercise
Scientific theory developed provide explanation aimed illuminating nature particular phenomenon predicting future event making inference past event
Engaging student standard scientific explanation gain understanding major idea science central aspect science education
Asking student demonstrate understanding implication scientific idea developing explanation phenomenon whether based observation made model developed engages essential part process conceptual change occur
Explanations science natural pedagogical us given inherent appeal simplicity analogy empirical data may even form thought experiment
And explanation especially valuable classroom rather spite fact often competing explanation offered example recent gradual rise mean surface temperature Earth
Deciding best explanation matter argument resolved well given explanation fit available data much simplifies would seem complex whether produce sense understanding
Because scientist achieve understanding building theory explanation aid model representation drawing data evidence student also develop facility constructing explanation
This essential step building understanding phenomenon gaining greater appreciation explanatory power scientific theory learning class acquiring greater insight scientist operate
In engineering goal design rather explanation
The process developing design iterative systematic process developing explanation theory science
Engineers activity however element distinct scientist
These element include specifying constraint criterion desired quality solution developing design plan producing testing model prototype selecting among alternative design feature optimize achievement design criterion refining design idea based performance prototype simulation
GOALS By grade student able Construct explanation phenomenon using knowledge accepted scientific theory linking model evidence
Use primary secondary scientific evidence model support refute explanatory account phenomenon
Offer causal explanation appropriate level scientific knowledge
Identify gap weakness explanatory account others
In experience engineering student opportunity Solve design problem appropriately applying scientific knowledge
Undertake design project engaging step design cycle producing plan meet specific design criterion
Construct device implement design solution
Evaluate critique competing design solution based jointly developed design criterion
PROGRESSION FOR EXPLANATION Early science education student need opportunity engage constructing critiquing explanation
They encouraged develop explanation observe conducting investigation evaluate others explanation consistency evidence
For example observation owl pellet dissect lead produce explanation owl eating habit based inference made find
As student knowledge develops begin identify isolate variable incorporate resulting observation explanation phenomenon
Using measurement one factor affect another develop causal account explain observe
For example investigating condition plant grow fastest may notice plant die kept dark seek develop explanation finding
Although explanation level may simple plant die dark need light order live grow provides basis question deeper understanding plant utilize light developed later grade
On basis comparison explanation observation student appreciate explanation plant need light grow fails explain die water provided
They encouraged revisit initial idea produce complete explanation account observation
By middle grade student recognize many explanation science rely model representation entity small see large visualize
For example explaining temperature water increase beyond heated requires student envisage water consisting microscopic particle energy provided heating allow particle escape despite force attraction holding particle together
In later stage education student also progress using mathematics simulation construct explanation phenomenon
PROGRESSION FOR DESIGN In way child natural engineer
They spontaneously build sand castle dollhouse hamster enclosure use variety tool material playful purpose
Thus common elementary school activity challenge child use tool material provided class solve specific challenge constructing bridge paper tape testing failure occurs
Children capability design structure enhanced pay attention point failure asking create test redesigns bridge stronger
Furthermore design activity limited structural engineering also include project reflect area engineering need design traffic pattern school parking lot layout planting school garden box
In middle school especially beneficial engage student engineering design project expected apply recently learned example using concept ecology solve problem related school garden
Middle school student also opportunity plan carry full engineering design project define problem term criterion constraint research problem deepen relevant knowledge generate test possible solution refine solution redesign
At high school level student undertake complex engineering design project related major local national global issue
Increased emphasis placed researching nature given problem reviewing others proposed solution weighing strength weakness various alternative discerning possibly unanticipated effect
Practice Whether concern new theory proposed explanation phenomenon novel solution technological problem fresh interpretation old data scientist engineer use reasoning argumentation make case
In science production knowledge dependent process reasoning requires scientist make justified claim world
In response scientist attempt identify claim weakness limitation
Their argument based deduction premise inductive generalization existing pattern inference best possible explanation
Argumentation also needed resolve question involving example best experimental design appropriate technique data analysis best interpretation given data set
In short science replete argument take place informally lab meeting symposium formally peer review
Historical case study origin development scientific idea show new idea often difficult accept argued example Copernican idea Earth travel around sun Darwin idea origin specie
Over time idea survive critical examination even light new data attain consensual acceptance community process discourse argument science maintains objectivity progress
The knowledge ability detect bad science requirement scientist citizen
Scientists must make critical judgment work peer scientist citizen alike must make evaluative judgment validity medium report implication people life society
Becoming critical consumer science fostered opportunity use critique evaluation judge merit scientifically based argument
In engineering reasoning argument essential finding best possible solution problem
At early design stage competing idea must compared possibly combined achieve initial design choice made argumentation merit various idea pertinent design goal
At later stage design process engineer test potential solution collect data modify design iterative manner
The result effort often presented evidence argue strength weakness particular design
Although form argumentation similar criterion employed engineering often quite different science
For example engineer might use analysis analysis risk appeal aesthetic prediction market reception justify one design better entirely different course action followed
GOALS By grade student able Construct scientific argument showing data support claim
Identify possible weakness scientific argument appropriate student level knowledge discus using reasoning evidence
Identify flaw argument modify improve response criticism
Recognize major feature scientific argument claim data reason distinguish element example
Explain nature controversy development given scientific idea describe debate surrounded inception indicate one particular theory succeeded
Explain claim knowledge judged scientific community today articulate merit limitation peer review need independent replication critical investigation
Read medium report science technology critical manner identify strength weakness
PROGRESSION The study science engineering produce sense process argument necessary advancing defending new idea explanation phenomenon norm conducting argument
In spirit student argue explanation construct defend interpretation associated data advocate design propose
Meanwhile learn evaluate critically scientific argument others present counterargument
Learning argue scientifically offer student opportunity use scientific knowledge justifying explanation identifying weakness others argument also build knowledge understanding
Constructing critiquing argument core process science one support science education research suggests interaction others cognitively effective way learning
Young student begin constructing argument interpretation phenomenon observe data collect
They need instructional support go beyond simply making include reason reference evidence begin distinguish evidence opinion
As grow ability construct scientific argument student draw wider range reason evidence argument become sophisticated
In addition expected discern aspect evidence potentially significant supporting refuting particular argument
Students begin learning critique asking question finding others
Later expected identify possible weakness either data argument explain criticism justified
As become adept arguing critiquing introduced language needed talk argument claim reason data etc
Exploration historical episode science provide opportunity student identify idea evidence argument professional scientist
In encouraged recognize criterion used judge claim new knowledge formal mean scientific idea evaluated today
In particular see practice peer review independent verification claimed experimental result help maintain objectivity trust science
Practice Being literate science engineering requires ability read understand literature
Science engineering way knowing represented communicated word diagram chart graph image symbol mathematics
Reading interpreting producing text fundamental practice science particular constitute least half engineer scientist total working time
Even student developed reading skill reading science often challenging student three reason
First jargon science text essentially unfamiliar together often extensive use example passive voice complex sentence structure many find text inaccessible
Second science text must read extract information accurately
Because precise meaning word clause may important text require mode reading quite different reading novel even newspaper
Third science text multimodal using mix word diagram chart symbol mathematics communicate
Thus understanding science text requires much simply knowing meaning technical term
Communicating written spoken form another fundamental practice science requires scientist describe observation precisely clarify thinking justify argument
Because writing one primary mean communicating The term text used refer form communication printed text video production
scientific community learning produce scientific text essential developing understanding science learning draw appreciating skill visual artist
Indeed new recognize reading writing skill essential science formal inclusion framework science practice reinforces expands view
Science simply advance scientist unable communicate finding clearly persuasively
Communication occurs variety formal venue including journal book conference presentation carefully constructed website occurs well informal mean discussion email message phone call blog
New technology extended communicative practice enabling multidisciplinary collaboration across globe place even emphasis reading writing
Increasingly scientist required engage dialogue lay audience work requires especially good communication skill
Being critical consumer science product engineering whether lay citizen practicing scientist engineer also requires ability read view report science press Internet recognize salient science identify source error methodological flaw distinguish observation inference argument explanation claim evidence
All construct learned engaging critical discourse around text
Engineering proceeds similar manner engineer need communicate idea find exchange example new technique new us existing tool material
As science engineering communication involves written spoken language many engineering idea best communicated sketch diagram graph model product
Also wide use handbook specific particular engineering field provide detailed information often tabular form best formulate design solution commonly encountered engineering task
Knowing seek use informational resource important part engineer skill set
GOALS By grade student able Use word table diagram graph whether hard copy electronically well mathematical expression communicate understanding ask question system study
Read scientific engineering text including table diagram graph commensurate scientific knowledge explain key idea communicated
Recognize major feature scientific engineering writing speaking able produce written illustrated text oral presentation communicate idea accomplishment
Engage critical reading primary scientific literature adapted classroom use medium report science discus validity reliability data hypothesis conclusion
PROGRESSION Any education science engineering need develop student ability read produce text
As every science engineering lesson part language lesson particularly reading producing genre text intrinsic science engineering
Students need sustained practice support develop ability extract meaning scientific text book medium report form scientific communication form text initially rather narrative often linguistically dense reliant precise logical flow
Students able interpret meaning text produce text written language diagram used express scientific idea engage extended discussion idea
From start science education student asked engage communication science especially regarding investigation conducting observation making
Careful description observation clear statement idea ability refine statement response question ask question others achieve clarification said begin earliest grade
Beginning upper elementary middle school ability interpret written material becomes important
Early work reading science text also include explicit instruction practice interpreting table diagram chart coordinating information conveyed information written text
Throughout science education student continually introduced new term meaning term learned opportunity use apply specific context
Not must student learn technical term also general academic language analyze correlation part student everyday vocabulary thus need specific elaboration make sense From start science education student asked engage communication science especially regarding investigation conducting observation making
scientific text
It follows master reading scientific material student need opportunity engage text identify major feature expected simply apply reading skill learned elsewhere master unfamiliar genre effectively
Students write account work using journal record observation thought idea model
They encouraged create diagram represent data observation plot table well written text journal
They also begin produce report poster present work others
As student begin read write text particular genre scientific report investigation explanation supporting argumentation experimental need introduced purpose explored
Furthermore student opportunity engage discussion observation explanation make oral presentation result conclusion well engage appropriate discourse student asking question discussing issue raised presentation
Because spoken language discussion presentation far everyday language scientific text novel development written spoken scientific need proceed parallel
In high school practice developed providing student complex text wider range text material technical report scientific literature Internet
Moreover student need opportunity read discus general medium report critical eye read appropriate sample adapted primary literature begin seeing science communicated science practitioner
In engineering student likewise need opportunity communicate idea using appropriate combination sketch model language
They also create drawing test concept communicate detailed plan explain critique model various sort including scale model prototype present result simulation regarding planning development stage also make compelling presentation ultimate solution
Science enormously successful extending humanity knowledge world indeed transforming
Understanding science achieved success technique us essential part science education
Although universal agreement teaching nature science strong consensus characteristic scientific enterprise understood educated citizen
For example notion single scientific method observation hypothesis deduction myth perpetuated day many fundamentally wrong
Scientists use deductive reasoning also search pattern classify different object make generalization repeated observation engage process making inference might best explanation
Thus picture scientific reasoning richer complex diverse image linear unitary scientific method would suggest
What engages scientist however process critique argumentation
Because examine idea look flaw controversy debate among scientist normal occurrence neither exceptional extraordinary
Moreover science established formal mechanism peer review establishing credibility individual scientist work
The idea survive process review criticism one become well established scientific community
Our view opportunity student learn basic set practice outlined chapter also opportunity stand back reflect practice contribute accumulation scientific knowledge
For example student need see construction model major mean acquiring new understanding model identify key feature akin map rather literal representation reality great achievement science core set explanatory theory wide application
Understanding science function requires synthesis content knowledge procedural knowledge epistemic knowledge
Procedural knowledge refers method scientist use ensure finding valid reliable
It includes understanding importance appropriate use control trial procedure method reduce error used science
As much specific domain learned within science
Procedural knowledge also called concept evidence
Epistemic knowledge knowledge construct value intrinsic science
Students need understand meant example observation hypothesis inference model theory claim able readily distinguish
An education science show new scientific idea act imagination commonly created day collaborative effort group scientist whose critique argument fundamental establishing idea worthy pursuing
Ideas often survive coherent already known either explain unexplained explain observation explain simpler elegant manner
Science replete idea seemed promising withstood test time concept ether vital force life
Thus new idea initially tentative time survives repeated testing acquire status piece knowledge unquestioned uncontested existence atom
Scientists use resulting theory model represent explain predict causal relationship
When theory well tested prediction reliable permitting application science technology wide variety policy decision
In word science miscellany fact coherent body knowledge hard serf powerful tool
Engagement modeling critical argumentation invite encourages student reflect status knowledge understanding science work
And involve practice science come appreciate basic nature level sophistication understanding given practice contributes scientific enterprise continue develop across grade level

In simply classification data tell programmer intends use data
Most programming language support various type data example
A data type provides set value
variable function may take value
The type defines operation done data meaning data way value type type value expression may take value Data type used within type system offer various way defining implementing using
Different type system ensure varying degree
Almost programming language explicitly include notion data type though different language may use different terminology
Common data type include For example type represents set ranging value well operation performed integer addition subtraction multiplication
Colors hand represented three denoting amount red green blue one string representing color name allowable operation include addition subtraction multiplication
Most programming language also allow programmer define additional data type usually combining multiple element type defining valid operation new data type
For example programmer might create new data type named would include real imaginary part
A data type also represents constraint placed upon interpretation data describing representation interpretation structure stored computer memory
The type system us data type information check access manipulate data
Most data type statistic comparable type computer programming vice versa shown following table identified five definition type literature
Types including behavior align closely model whereas model would tend include code called
The five type The definition term representation often done imperative language definition term value space behaviour used language
typically type basic language implementation
All data computer based digital electronics represented alternative lowest level
The smallest addressable unit data usually group bit called usually bit
The unit processed instruction called typically bit
Most instruction interpret word word represent unsigned integer value signed integer value
Because machine language machine need distinguish unsigned signed data type part
There specific set arithmetic instruction use different interpretation bit word number
Machine data type need made available allowing control hardware
The instance supply integer type various width
If corresponding native type exist target platform compiler break code using type exist
For instance integer requested bit platform compiler tacitly treat array two bit integer
Several language allow convenient manipulation machine data
In higher level programming machine data type often hidden implementation detail would render code le portable exposed
For instance generic type might supplied instead integer specific
The represents value
Although two value possible rarely implemented single binary digit efficiency reason
Many programming language explicit Boolean type instead interpreting instance false value true
Boolean data simply refers logical structure language interpreted machine language
In case Boolean refers logic False
True always non zero especially one known Boolean
Such derived one primitive type
This done number way
The way combined called
Composing primitive type compound type generally result new type
different type
Many others possible tend variation compound
The distinct value compared assigned necessarily particular concrete representation computer memory compiler interpreter represent arbitrarily
For example four suit deck playing card may four enumerator named belonging enumerated type named
If variable declared data type one assign four value
Some implementation allow programmer assign integer value enumeration value even treat integer
Such Character string type store sequence character character set
Since character set include possible numeric string
However many language treat belonging different type numeric value
Character string type different subtypes according required character width
The original wide ASCII found limited superseded set encode wide variety alphabet symbol
Strings may either fixed size even programming language
They may also subtyped maximum size
Note string primitive language instance C may composed array character
Types based derived basic type explained
In language C type derived type
The main derived type data type whose value refers directly point another value stored elsewhere using
It primitive kind
In everyday term page number book could considered piece data refers another one
Pointers often stored format similar integer however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To ameliorate potential problem pointer considered separate type type data point even underlying representation
Any type specify implementation
For instance abstract type implemented array contiguous block memory containing multiple value set memory block linked
Abstract type handled code know care underlying type contained
Programming agnostic concrete data type called
Arrays record also contain underlying type considered concrete specify content element laid memory
Examples include For convenience language may supply real world data type instance even language allows built primitive type
A associate type computed value
By examining flow value type system attempt prove occur
The type system question determines constitutes type error type system generally seek guarantee operation expecting certain kind value used value operation make sense
A may use static type value optimize storage need choice algorithm operation value
In many compiler data type example represented accord
They thus use value addition multiplication etc
The depth type constraint manner evaluation affect language
A may associate operation varying concrete algorithm type case
study type system although concrete type system programming language originate practical issue computer architecture compiler implementation language design
Type system may variously forth

Databases used organise data clear consistent way
Most website online application use database
With much data shared online data security important issue
The actual unit data entered give
These unit data also called
When create database need set data type
For example film database might need alphabetical character number
Fields usually restricted certain data type
way classifying data value common property
Different kind data value also need different amount store different operation performed upon
The data type In database programming language data type set follows The structure also called
When design database need create schema explain type data stored
There key area consider data Before creating database need think purpose
What database going used
What search might performed
In film table example structure table would If creating database people data type would use capture someone age
It would best capture age date birth DATE data type eg
An alternative would capture age number like
However need think database
If input someone age need update every time someone year older
This would inefficient time consuming
It would much better enter date birth

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

basic value fact
Note term considered plural scientific community data collected data collected however everyone follows sometimes see data used singular
Every task computer carry work data way
Without data computer would pretty useless
It therefore important understand represent organize data
This lesson look different type data used computer system represented digital form organized database
There two general way represent data analog digital
data continuous actual fact represents
data discrete broken limited number element
Nature analog computer digital
Many aspect natural world continuous nature
For example think spectrum color
This continuous rainbow infinite number shade
Computer system hand continuous finite
All data stored binary digit limit much data represent
For example color image computer limited number color number might large still finite
Consider example color bit detail
The first monitor display essentially text terminal single color
White text appeared black background
Newer monitor used color enough represent basic image still quite limited
Modern display million color look much natural
Still number color finite
Computer system work different type digital data
In early day computing data consisted primarily text number however modern day computing lot different multimedia data type audio image graphic video
But ultimately data type stored binary digit
For data type specific technique convert binary language computer interpret data using sens sight sound
We ca talk data without mentioning database
A organized collection data
Instead data list random order database provides structure organize data
One common data structure database table
A table consists row column
Each row typically called record column typically called field
This example simple database table customer
Each customer unique identifier Customer ID name telephone number field
The first row called header row indicates name field
Following header row record unique customer
While example simple easily imagine else might stored database
For example might store customer mailing address billing information history past purchase etc
For organization many thousand customer quickly becomes large database
To use large database effectively use database management system
A specialized software input store retrieve manage data

Now let consider difference data information
They related making distinction useful especially working computer system
Data basic value
They unstructured lack context
For example list text entry list number would considered data
Information help u answer question
In order data organized processed useful manner
For example list text number could list name customer list number could telephone number
Knowing data represent name belongs number give structure context data resulting information
The distinction data information useful depend perspective user
For example want make sale call list customer name phone number informative want know bought past type business large organization etc
So perspective list name phone number data need additional data get information really interested
Let review
basic value fact
Computers use many different type data stored digital format text number multimedia
Data organized database table database management system used work large database
A proper understanding data allows organize useful information

Programming us number different data type
A determines type value object operation performed
One widely used data type string
A consists one character include letter number type character
You think string plain text
A string represents alphanumeric data
This mean string contain many different character considered text even character number
A string also contain space
This present bit issue
How going distinguish value string actual code program
The solution mark beginning end string special character typically quote
For example following code used print text screen The use quote ensures text World
recognized string two separate word may special meaning programming language
The use quote also make possible use numeric character part string
For example following code used store street address Without quote numeric character would interpreted number quote recognized part string represents street address
The second important data type numeric data
There several different one
An numeric value without decimal
Integers whole number positive negative
Sometimes distinction made short long integer referring much data storage used number
A short integer typically stored using bit mean store unique value
For number larger would need use long integer us bit
A number decimal referred
The terminology varies somewhat programming language used
The term come floating point mean control decimal point located
The term refers using double amount storage relative float
Working number code little bit like using calculator
Here example numeric value used code case using multiplication character The value stored would
The data type represent two value true false
Typically used represent True used represent False
Consider following example user input two value program determines whether first one smaller second one
In example first value fact smaller second one program therefore result Boolean value False
The Boolean type primary result conditional statement used control workflow program
For example particular condition true condition false something else

The data type covered far often referred primitive data type
A composite data type obtained combining one primitive data type
These also referred data structure
Common example composite data type list array
A contains element one particular data type
For example list could contain string
An example would name player soccer team
Each name string organize name together form list
A list simplest data structure
For example list string could look like A list number could look like Each element list identified specific index
All element list ordered particular sequence
This sequence change unless actively change element sort sequence
Each element index tell position sequence element located
Typically index value first position zero
In example number located index position number located index position
An data type element identified one index
An array similar list array multiple dimension
A array list linear sequence element type
In array element organized two dimension think row column table
This type array us two index one row one column
The unique combination two index value represents unique cell table
Each cell corresponds element string number data type
A array called matrix
A array represented cube us three index
Arrays dimension difficult visualize
Dates time data type distinguish numeric data
There many different way format date time
Some common way format date Some common way format time Each programming language tool work time example determine long took carry particular calculation
In data type value represent one limited number predefined category
For example four suit deck playing card club diamond heart spade
If writing program create card game would use data type called one four value
Enumerated data type built programming language created programmer
For example playing card game would write code create data type predefined value represent
Within programing language data type object determines type value operation performed object
Widely used data type include string numeric Boolean data type
Composite data type include list array
Enumerated data type allow create customized data type limited number predefined category

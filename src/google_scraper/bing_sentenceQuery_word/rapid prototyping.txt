Construction part assembly usually done using technology
The first method rapid prototyping became available late used produce part
Today used wide range application used part relatively small number desired without typical unfavorable economics
This economy encouraged online service bureau
Historical survey RP technology start discussion simulacrum production technique used sculptor
Some modern use progeny technology produce
The ability reproduce design dataset given rise issue right possible interpolate volumetric data image
As manufacturing workflow traditional Rapid Prototyping process start creation geometric data either solid using CAD workstation slice using scanning device
For Rapid prototyping data must represent valid geometric model namely one whose boundary surface enclose finite volume contain hole exposing interior fold back
In word object must inside
The model valid point space computer determine uniquely whether point lie inside outside boundary surface model
CAD approximate application vendor internal CAD geometric form simplified mathematical form turn expressed specified data format common feature STL de facto standard transferring solid geometric model SFF machine
To obtain necessary motion control trajectory drive actual SFF rapid prototyping prepared geometric model typically sliced layer slice scanned line producing drawing used generate trajectory toolpath mimicking reverse physical building process

Such system also known name additive fabrication three dimensional printing solid freeform fabrication layered manufacturing
Rapid prototyping also describes software engineering methodology
Rapid prototyping automatic construction physical object using solid freeform fabrication used produce model prototype prototyping take virtual design computer aided design CAD animation modeling software transforms cross section still virtual create cross section physical space one next model finished
It WYSIWYG process virtual model physical model correspond almost identically
The machine read data CAD drawing lay successive layer liquid powdered material way build model long series cross section
These layer correspond virtual cross section CAD model glued together fused often using laser automatically create final shape
The standard interface CAD software rapid prototyping machine STL file format
However currently several scheme RepRap Project
improve rapid prototyper technology stage prototyper manufacture component part
These technology offer advantage many application compared classical subtractive fabrication method milling turning WYSIWYG An acronym What You See Is What You Get used computing describe system content editing appears similar final product
It commonly used word processor application Web HTML authoring
To increase effective communication
To decrease development time
To decrease costly mistake
To minimize sustaining engineering change
To extend product lifetime adding necessary feature eliminating redundant feature early design
The basic methodology current rapid prototyping technique summarized follows CAD model constructed converted STL format
The resolution set minimize stair stepping

The RP machine process file creating sliced layer model

The first layer physical model created
The model lowered thickness next layer process repeated completion model

Once begin taking client commercial world likely asked build prototype part programme writing might offer build one give practical demonstration section work rather describing paper Powerpoint presentation
A prototype model give client idea programme likely operate used sample client user try
Clients like get sticky paw programme developed make aware prototype simply temporary piece software assume continue use
Occasionally prise crowbar give cup tea biscuit consolation
You also watch get attached prototype
It easy forget prototype limited scope capability try waste time attempting make Broadway show rather using short run performance tool
Plus want find invested lot time energy working prototype remember sickening lurch going part final programme
It easy see client developer get attached prototype
Once pick new programme interesting seeing
It natural curiosity hook u fascinated want keep using inevitably find useful make job easier
You sure warn client temporary nature prototype way reduce reliance
Make small
The best prototype small part system discard used used quickly
Not small lose touch overall project small prototype keep mind focused broader picture developing programme keep cost

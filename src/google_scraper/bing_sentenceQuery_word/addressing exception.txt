process responding occurrence anomalous exceptional condition requiring special processing often changing normal flow
It provided specialized construct mechanism like facility like
In general exception break normal flow execution executes
The detail done depends whether hardware software exception software exception implemented
Some exception especially hardware one may handled gracefully execution resume interrupted
Alternative approach exception handling software error checking maintains normal program flow later explicit check contingency reported using special return value auxiliary global variable C floating point status flag input validation preemptively filter exceptional case
Hardware exception mechanism processed CPU
It intended support error detection redirects program flow error handling service routine
The state exception saved stack
Exception handling hardware standard refers general exceptional condition defines exception event occurs operation particular operand outcome suitable every reasonable application
That operation might signal one exception invoking default explicitly requested alternate handling
By default IEEE exception resumable handled substituting predefined value different exception
infinity divide zero exception providing later checking whether exception occurred see typical example handling IEEE exception
An style enabled use status flag involves first computing expression using fast direct implementation checking whether failed testing status flag necessary calling slower numerically robust implementation
The IEEE standard us term trapping refer calling routine exceptional condition optional feature standard
The standard recommends several usage scenario including implementation value followed resumption concisely handle
The default IEEE exception handling behaviour resumption following default value avoids risk inherent changing flow program control numerical exception
For example ended catastrophic explosion due part programming language exception handling policy aborting computation arithmetic error case floating point integer conversion
In Ariane Flight case programmer protected four seven critical variable overflow due concern computational constraint computer relied turned incorrect assumption possible range value three unprotected variable Ariane assumption correct
According loss Flight would avoided IEEE policy default substitution used overflowing conversion caused software abort occurred piece code turned completely unnecessary Ariane
The official report crash conducted inquiry board headed noted An underlying theme development Ariane bias towards
The supplier SRI following specification given stipulated event detected exception processor stopped
The exception occurred due random failure design error
The exception detected inappropriately handled view taken software considered correct shown fault
Although failure due systematic software design error mechanism introduced mitigate type problem
For example computer within SRIs could continued provide best estimate required information
There reason concern software exception allowed even required cause processor halt handling equipment
Indeed loss proper software function hazardous software run SRI unit
In case Ariane resulted two still healthy critical unit equipment
From processing point view hardware similar resumable exception though typically unrelated user program
The may provide facility handling exception program via
Typically interrupt caused execution process handled interrupt service routine operating system operating system may send process may asked operating system register signal handler called signal raised let operating system execute default action like terminating program
Typical example
Software exception handling support provided software tool differs somewhat understood exception handling hardware similar concept involved
In programming language mechanism exception handling term typically used specific sense denote data structure storing information exceptional condition
One mechanism transfer control exception known
The exception said
Execution transferred catch
From point view author raising exception useful way signal routine could execute normally example input argument invalid
value outside resource relies unavailable like missing file hard disk error error
In system without exception routine would need return special
However sometimes complicated user routine need write extra code distinguish normal return value erroneous one
Programming language differ substantially notion exception
Contemporary language roughly divided two group Kiniry also note Language design partially influence use exception consequently manner one handle partial total failure system execution
The major influence example use typically core library code example technical book magazine article online discussion forum organization code standard
Contemporary application face many design challenge considering exception handling strategy
Particularly modern enterprise level application exception must often cross process boundary machine boundary
Part designing solid exception handling strategy recognizing process failed point economically handled software portion process
Software exception handling developed
This originated exception keyword returned case error instead terminating program entering debugger
Error introduced late via keyword
This rapidly used error raising control flow thus augmented two new keywords MacLisp June reserving error handling
The cleanup behavior generally called finally introduced New Implementation LISP
This adopted
Contemporary Scheme handled exception closure
The first paper structured exception handling
Exception handling subsequently widely adopted many programming language onward
Originally software exception handling included resumable exception resumption semantics like hardware exception exception termination semantics
However resumption semantics considered ineffective practice see standardization discussion quoted longer common use though provided programming language like Common Lisp Dylan
Exception handling mechanism contemporary language typically termination semantics opposed hardware exception typically resumable
This based experience using theoretical design argument favor either decision extensively debated standardization discussion resulted definitive decision termination semantics
On rationale design mechanism note A Palo Alto standardization meeting November heard brilliant summary argument termination semantics backed personal experience data Sun formerly Xerox PARC
Jim used exception handling half dozen language period year early proponent resumption semantics one main designer implementers Xerox system
His message He backed statement experience several operating system
The key example It written people liked used resumption ten year use one use resumption left half million line system context inquiry
Because resumption actually necessary context inquiry removed found significant speed increase part system
In every case resumption used ten year become problem appropriate design replaced
Basically every use resumption represented failure keep separate level abstraction disjoint
A contrasting view safety exception handling given describing plethora feature notational convention many unnecessary like exception handling even dangerous
Do allow language present state used application reliability critical
The next rocket go astray result programming language error may exploratory space rocket harmless trip Venus It may nuclear warhead exploding one city
Exception handling often handled correctly software especially multiple source exception million line Java code found exception handling defect
Citing multiple prior study others result Weimer Necula wrote significant problem exception create hidden path difficult programmer reason
initially released exception handling explicitly omitted developer arguing obfuscated
Later mechanism added language Go author advise using unrecoverable error halt entire process
One case early criticism exception handling dealing resource leak state inconsistency escaping section locked one temporarily holding file open
The one approach handle
Many computer language support exception exception handling
This includes
like version language
Exception handling commonly resumable language exception thrown program search back function call exception handler found
Some language call stack search progress
That function containing handler exception call function turn call function exception occurs function may terminated handle
An language without unwinding
Common Lisp call exception handler unwind stack
This allows program continue computation exactly place error occurred example previously missing file become available
The stackless implementation programming language support exception handling without stack unwinding
Excluding minor syntactic difference couple exception handling style use
In popular style exception initiated special statement exception object
Java Object Pascal value special extendable enumerated type
Ada SML
The scope exception handler start marker clause language block starter end start first handler clause
Several handler clause follow specify exception type handle name us exception object
A language also permit clause used case exception occurred end handler scope reached
More common related clause executed whether exception occurred typically release resource acquired within body block
Notably provide construct since encourages RAII technique free resource using
In whole exception handling code might look like note exception type called would need declared somewhere As minor variation language use single handler clause deal class exception internally
According paper Westley Wiemer syntax block Java contributing factor software defect
When method need handle acquisition release resource programmer apparently unwilling nest enough block due readability concern even would correct solution
It possible use single block even dealing multiple resource requires correct use another common source bug type problem
Regarding semantics construct general Wiemer Necula write While conceptually simple complicated execution description language specification Gosling et al
requires four level nested official English description
In short contains large number programmer often overlook
C support various mean error checking generally considered support exception handling although used implement exception semantics
optional support structured exception handling
support exception handling pervasive consistent
It difficult write robust Python program without using keywords
The implementation exception handling programming language typically involves fair amount support code generator accompanying compiler
It addition exception handling ended useful lifetime original compiler
Two scheme common
The first generates code continually update structure program state term exception handling
Typically add new element know handler available function method associated frame exception thrown pointer layout directs runtime appropriate handler code
This approach compact term space add execution overhead frame entry exit
It commonly used many Ada implementation example complex generation runtime support already needed many language feature
Dynamic registration fairly straightforward define amenable
The second scheme one implemented many compiler approach
This creates static table relate range program state respect exception handling
Then exception thrown runtime system look current instruction location table determines handler play need done
This approach minimizes executive overhead case exception thrown
This happens cost space space allocated data section loaded relocated exception actually thrown
This second approach also superior term achieving
Other definitional implementation scheme proposed well
For language support approach involve overhead advanced
A different view exception based principle supported particular
The idea provide rigorous basis exception handling defining precisely normal abnormal behavior
Specifically approach based two concept The Safe Exception Handling principle introduced Bertrand Meyer hold two meaningful way routine react exception occurs In particular simply ignoring exception permitted block must either retried successfully complete propagate exception caller
Here example expressed Eiffel syntax
It assumes routine normally better way send message may fail triggering exception algorithm next us fail le often
If fails routine whole fail causing caller get exception
The boolean local variable initialized False start
If fails body clause executed causing execution
If execution fails clause execute end clause final causing routine execution whole fail
This approach merit defining clearly normal abnormal case abnormal case causing exception one routine unable fulfill contract
It defines clear distribution role clause normal body charge achieving attempting achieve routine contract clause charge reestablishing context restarting process chance succeeding performing actual computation
Although exception Eiffel fairly clear philosophy Kiniry criticizes implementation Exceptions part language definition represented INTEGER value exception STRING value
Additionally basic value object inherent semantics beyond expressed helper routine necessarily foolproof representation overloading effect one differentiate two integer value
If exception thrown caught operationally exception thrown applicable handler specified uncaught exception handled runtime routine called
The common default behavior terminate program print error message console usually including debug information string representation exception
This often avoided handler example catch exception reach runtime
Note even though uncaught exception may result terminating abnormally program may correct exception caught notably rolling back partially completed transaction releasing resource terminates normally assuming runtime work correctly runtime controlling execution program ensure orderly shutdown process
In multithreaded program uncaught exception thread may instead result termination thread entire process uncaught exception handler caught handler
This particularly important server example running thread terminated without server overall affected
This default uncaught exception handler may overridden either globally example provide alternative logging reporting uncaught exception restart thread terminate due uncaught exception
For example Java done single thread via globally via Python done modifying
The designer Java devised checked exception special set exception
The checked exception method may raise part method
For instance method might throw must declare fact explicitly method signature
Failure raise error
Kiniry note however Java library often inconsistent approach error reporting Not erroneous situation Java represented exception though
Many method return special value indicate failure encoded constant field related class
Checked exception related exception checker exist programming language
The external tool OCaml invisible
require syntactic annotation optional
possible compile run program without checked exception although recommended production code
The feature interface closer Java introduced later
A function could raise exception listed type leaking exception called function would automatically turned sole runtime exception instead resulting error
Later similar feature
These feature include compile time checking central concept checked exception incorporated major programming language Java
Early version programming language included optional mechanism checked exception called
By default function could throw exception limited clause added function signature specified exception function may throw
Exception specification enforced
Violations resulted global function called
An empty exception specification could given indicated function throw exception
This made default exception handling added language would required much modification existing code would impeded interaction code written language would tempted programmer writing many handler local level
Explicit use empty exception specification could however allow compiler perform significant code stack layout optimization generally suppressed exception handling may take place function
Some analyst viewed proper use exception specification difficult achieve
In recent language standard use exception specification specified version standard removed language
A function throw exception denoted noexcept keyword
In contrast Java language like C enforce exception caught
According Hanspeter Mössenböck distinguishing checked exception unchecked exception make written program convenient le robust uncaught exception result abort
Kiniry note however Java JDK version throw large number unchecked exception one every line code whereas Eiffel us much sparingly one thrown every line code
Kiniry also writes As Java programmer know volume code typical Java application sometimes larger comparable code necessary explicit formal parameter return value checking language checked exception
In fact general consensus among Java programmer dealing checked exception nearly unpleasant task writing documentation
Thus many programmer report resent checked exception
This lead abundance exception
Kiniry also note developer C apparently influenced kind user experience following quote attributed via Eric Gunnerson Examination small program lead conclusion requiring exception specification could enhance developer productivity enhance code quality experience large software project suggests different result decreased productivity little increase code quality
According fairly broad agreement design group checked exception language feature C
Hejlsberg explained interview The throw clause least way implemented Java necessarily force handle exception handle force acknowledge precisely exception might pas
It requires either catch declared exception put throw clause
To work around requirement people ridiculous thing
For example decorate every method throw Exception
That completely defeat feature made programmer write gobbledy gunk
That help Checked exception reduce incidence unhandled exception surfacing given application
Unchecked exception object remain unhandled
However checked exception either require extensive declaration revealing implementation detail reducing encourage coding poorly considered block hide legitimate exception appropriate handler
Consider growing time
An interface may declared throw exception X Y
In later version code one want throw exception Z would make new code incompatible earlier us
Furthermore one body code declares interface implemented different body code code plugged called first adapter code may rich set exception describe problem forced use exception type declared interface
It possible reduce number declared exception either declaring potentially thrown exception defining declaring exception type suitable level abstraction called method mapping lower level exception type preferably wrapped using order preserve root cause
In addition possible example changing interface calling code would need modified well since sense exception method may throw part method implicit interface anyway
Using declaration usually sufficient satisfying checking Java
While may use essentially circumvents checked exception mechanism Oracle discourages
Unchecked exception type generally handled except possibly outermost level scope
These often represent scenario allow recovery frequently reflect programming defect generally represent unrecoverable JVM failure
Even language support checked exception case use checked exception appropriate
The point exception handling routine ensure code handle error condition
In order establish exception handling routine sufficiently robust necessary present code wide spectrum invalid unexpected input created via software also sometimes referred
One difficult type software write exception handling routine protocol software since robust protocol implementation must prepared receive input comply relevant specification
In order ensure meaningful regression analysis conducted throughout exception handling testing highly automated test case must generated scientific repeatable fashion
Several commercially available system exist perform testing
In runtime engine environment exist tool attach runtime engine every time exception interest occurs record debugging information existed memory time exception thrown value
These tool called error interception tool provide information exception
Somewhat related concept checked exception
Synchronous exception happen specific program statement whereas raise practically anywhere
It follows asynchronous exception handling ca required compiler
They also difficult program
Examples naturally asynchronous event include pressing interrupt program receiving stop suspend another
Programming language typically deal limiting asynchronicity example Java deprecated use ThreadDeath exception used allow one thread stop another one
Instead exception raise suitable location program synchronously
see encompasses aforementioned exception handling system
In language environment advent condition generalisation error according implies function call late exception handler decision unwind stack may taken
Conditions generalization exception
When condition arises appropriate condition handler searched selected stack order handle condition
Conditions represent error may safely go unhandled entirely purpose may propagate hint warning toward user
This related exception handling exception said permitted return expression signaled exception taken corrective action handler
The condition system generalized thus within handler condition
possible jump predefined restart point
lie signaling expression condition handler
Restarts function closed lexical environment allowing programmer repair environment exiting condition handler completely unwinding stack even partially
Condition handling moreover provides
Restarts provide various possible mechanism recovering error select mechanism appropriate given situation
That province condition handler since located code access broader view
An example Suppose library function whose purpose parse single file entry
What function entry malformed
There one right answer library could deployed program many different purpose
In interactive browser right thing might return entry unparsed user see automated program right thing might supply null value unreadable field abort error many entry malformed
That say question answered term broader goal program known library function
Nonetheless exiting error message rarely right answer
So instead simply exiting error function may offering various way instance skip log entry supply default null value unreadable field ask user missing value unwind stack abort processing error message
The restarts offered constitute available recovering error selection restart condition handler supply

In case branch Instructions use addressing
But I really clear said book MIPS address calculating branch target actually relative address following instruction opposed current instruction
Anybody please explain
Thanks
This question came site computer enthusiast power user
Branch instruction MIPS offset value provide offset byte
This offset added Next PC value rather PC branch
Why NPC used rather PC branch obvious
This may related use Stanford MIPS project assembler performed limited instruction reordering filling delayed branch slot previous instruction
With design offset forward branch branch positive offset commonly used implement conditionally branching clause would never changed conversion offset backward branch branch negative offset commonly used loop would changed delay slot filled extra instruction
This might simplify compiler development
An alternative speculation would slightly simplified initial implementation branch evaluated second pipeline stage current PC NPC relative branch instruction
A third speculation considered conceptually cleaner given use delayed branch slot
The offset becomes relative instruction branch activated
As comment say probably easier fit add displacement target increment PC sub step instruction execution one done early
This wo make much difference reach forward somewhat greater backwards might affect corner case

In object whose value refers another value stored elsewhere using
A pointer location memory obtaining value stored location known pointer
As analogy page number book index could considered pointer corresponding page dereferencing pointer would done flipping page given page number reading text found indexed page
Pointers data significantly improve performance repetitive operation traversing structure
In particular often much cheaper time space copy dereference pointer copy access data pointer point
Pointers also used hold address entry point subroutine
In used often using called
A pointer simple concrete implementation abstract
Several language support type pointer although restriction use others
While pointer used refer reference general properly applies whose explicitly allows pointer manipulated arithmetically via memory address opposed possible
Because pointer allow protected unprotected access memory address risk associated using particularly latter case
Primitive pointer often stored format similar however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To alleviate potential problem matter pointer considered separate type parameterized type data point even underlying representation integer
Other measure may also taken validation bound checking verify content pointer variable contain value valid memory address within numerical range processor capable addressing
credited invention pointer
In Lawson presented Computer Pioneer Award f inventing pointer variable introducing concept thus providing first time capability flexibly treat linked list high level language
According first appeared print technical memorandum
In pointer kind
A datum read written using one memory access instance primitive
A group primitive contiguous memory viewed collectively one datum instance aggregate could logically contiguous byte value represent coordinate point space
When aggregate entirely composed type primitive aggregate may called sense primitive array byte program use word way
In context definition smallest primitive specifies different byte
The memory address initial byte datum considered memory address entire datum
A primitive value intended used memory address said
It also said pointer value datum memory address
More generally pointer kind said obtain datum
The feature separate pointer kind reference pointer value meant interpreted memory address rather concept
References serve level indirection A pointer value determines memory address datum used calculation
Because indirection fundamental aspect algorithm pointer often expressed fundamental typed programming language pointer determines type datum pointer point
When setting like tree necessary pointer help manage structure implemented controlled
Typical example pointer start pointer end pointer pointer
These pointer either actual absolute start address base typically us fewer bit full address usually require one additional arithmetic operation resolve
Relative address form manual share many advantage disadvantage
A offset containing unsigned integer used provide relative addressing kilobyte data structure
This easily extended address pointed forced word boundary requiring additional shift left order adjust offset factor addition base address
Generally though scheme lot trouble convenience programmer absolute address underlying preferred
A one byte offset hexadecimal value character
used point alternative integer value index array

In way character efficiently translated usable sequential absolute address without
used control usually make extensive use pointer
The pointer usually embedded table entry may instance used hold entry point executed based certain condition defined table entry
The pointer however simply index separate associated table comprising array actual address address depending upon programming language construct available
They also used point earlier table entry loop processing forward skip table entry early exit loop
For latter purpose pointer may simply table entry number transformed actual address simple arithmetic
Pointers thin top addressing capability provided modern
In simplest scheme numeric assigned unit memory system unit typically either depending whether architecture effectively transforming memory large
The system would also provide operation retrieve value stored memory unit given address usually utilizing machine
In usual case pointer large enough hold address unit memory system
This introduces possibility program may attempt access address corresponds unit memory either enough memory installed
beyond range available memory architecture support address
The first case may certain platform architecture called segfault
The second case possible current implementation pointer bit long address extend bit
Pointers must conform certain rule canonical address pointer dereferenced processor raise
On hand system unit memory address
In case complex scheme employed use different part memory different time
The last incarnation architecture support bit physical memory address mapped linear address space paging mechanism
Thus possible total memory may accessed time
Another example computer family processor though supporting MB physical memory could access GB virtual memory combination address segment register made accessing KB one data structure cumbersome
In order provide consistent interface architecture provide allows address refer unit memory others refer device computer
There analogous concept file offset array index remote object reference serve purpose address type object
Pointers directly supported without restriction language implicitly
They primarily used constructing turn fundamental constructing nearly well passing data different part program
In functional programming language rely heavily list pointer reference managed abstractly language using internal construct like
When dealing array critical operation typically involves stage called involves constructing pointer desired data element array
In data structure pointer used reference explicitly tie one piece structure another
Pointers used pas parameter reference
This useful programmer want function modification parameter visible function caller
This also useful returning multiple value function
Pointers also used deallocate dynamic variable array memory
Since variable often become redundant served purpose waste memory keep therefore good practice deallocate using original pointer reference longer needed
Failure may result available free memory gradually severe case rapidly diminishes accumulation numerous redundant memory block
The basic define pointer This declares identifier object following type This usually stated succinctly pointer
Because C language specify implicit initialization object automatic storage duration care often taken ensure address point valid sometimes suggested pointer explicitly initialized value traditionally specified C standardized macro Dereferencing null pointer C produce could catastrophic
However implementation simply halt execution program question usually
However initializing pointer unnecessarily could hinder program analysis thereby hiding bug
In case pointer declared next logical step point something This assigns value address
For example stored memory location value assignment
To dereference pointer asterisk used This mean take content locate address memory set value
If later accessed new value
This example may clearer memory examined directly
Assume located address memory also assume machine int wide
The following would memory following code snippet executed The NULL pointer shown
By assigning address yield following memory value Then dereferencing coding computer take content address assign location yielding following memory Clearly accessing yield value previous instruction modified content way pointer
In C array indexing formally defined term pointer arithmetic language specification requires equivalent
Thus C array thought pointer consecutive area memory gap syntax accessing array identical used dereference pointer
For example array declared used following manner This allocates block five integer name block act pointer block
Another common use pointer point dynamically allocated memory return consecutive block memory le requested size used array
While operator array pointer equivalent result operator differs
In example evaluate size array evaluate size pointer
Default value array declared like If located memory starting address machine memory contain following value like address Represented five integer
These five integer occupy bit byte byte stored first stored consecutively starting address
The syntax C pointer The last example access content
Breaking Below example definition This definition essentially definition empty list cell type another link also type
The definition reference however use potentially confusing signal value
For reason data structure C usually dealt via carefully checked correctness
Pointers used pas variable address allowing value changed
For example consider following code In program required memory depends may enter
In case programmer need allocate memory dynamically
This done allocating memory rather variable usually stored
Variables also stored CPU register another matter Dynamic memory allocation made pointer name like common variable ca given
Pointers used store manage address block memory
Such block used store data object array object
Most structured language provide area memory called object dynamically allocated
The example C code illustrates structure object dynamically allocated referenced
The provides function allocating memory block heap
It take size object allocate parameter return pointer newly allocated block memory suitable storing object return null pointer allocation failed
The code illustrates memory object dynamically deallocated returned heap free store
The standard C library provides function deallocating previously allocated memory block returning back heap
On computing architecture pointer used directly manipulate memory device
Assigning address pointer invaluable tool programming
Below simple example declaring pointer type int initialising address example constant In mid using access video capability PCs slow
Applications typically used access video memory directly casting constant pointer array unsigned int value
Each value consisted code low byte colour high byte
Thus put letter row column bright white blue one would write code like following In many language pointer additional restriction object point specific
For example pointer may declared point language attempt prevent programmer pointing object integer eliminating error
For example C would integer pointer would char pointer
The following would yield compiler warning assignment incompatible pointer type declared different type
To suppress compiler warning must made explicit indeed wish make assignment say cast integer pointer char pointer assign
A draft C standard requires casting pointer derived one type one another type maintain alignment correctness type Pointers par
In language allow pointer arithmetic arithmetic pointer take account size type
For example adding integer number pointer produce another pointer point address higher number time size type
This allows u easily compute address element array given type shown C array example
When pointer one type cast another type different size programmer expect pointer arithmetic calculated differently
In C example array start byte whereas byte point would point
Other risk casting include loss data wide data written narrow location
unexpected result value comparison problem especially signed v unsigned value
Although impossible general determine cast safe language store used confirm dangerous cast valid runtime
Other language merely accept conservative approximation safe cast none
As pointer allows program attempt access object may defined pointer origin variety
However usefulness pointer great difficult perform programming task without
Consequently many language created construct designed provide useful feature pointer without also sometimes referred
In context pointer directly address memory used article referred contrast smart pointer variant
One major problem pointer long directly manipulated number made point unused address data used purpose
Many language including recent like replace pointer opaque type reference typically referred simply used refer object manipulated number preventing type error
Array indexing handled special case
A pointer address assigned called
Any attempt use uninitialized pointer cause unexpected behavior either initial value valid address using may damage part program
The result often used function pointer branch address
In system explicit memory allocation possible create deallocating memory region point
This type pointer dangerous subtle deallocated memory region may contain data deallocated may reallocated overwritten unrelated code unknown earlier code
Languages prevent type error deallocation performed automatically reference scope
Some language like support use simple form help track allocation dynamic memory addition acting reference
In absence reference cycle object refers indirectly sequence smart pointer eliminate possibility dangling pointer memory leak
string support reference counting natively
The introduces optimisation based around eliminate pointer bug without resorting
A value reserved indicating pointer refer valid object
Null pointer routinely used represent condition end unknown length failure perform action use null pointer compared value
An pointer whose value interpreted offset address pointer thus data structure autorelative pointer member point portion data structure data structure may relocated memory without update value auto relative pointer
The cited patent also us term mean thing
However meaning term used way A pointer whose value offset value another pointer
This used store load block data assigning address beginning block base pointer
In language pointer reference another pointer requiring multiple dereference operation get original value
While level indirection may add performance cost sometimes necessary order provide correct behavior complex
For example C typical define term element contains pointer next element list This implementation us pointer first element list surrogate entire list
If new value added beginning list changed point new element
Since C argument always passed value using double indirection allows insertion implemented correctly desirable eliminating special case code deal insertion front list In case value le caller properly updated address new item
A basic example argument given prototype variable pointer array string array array pointer string convention name program character string
In language pointer reference executable code point function method procedure
A store address function invoked
While facility used call function dynamically often favorite technique virus malicious software writer
A pointer point valid object consequently may make program crash behave oddly
In pointer specifically initialized may point unpredictable address memory
The following example code show dangling pointer Here may point anywhere memory performing assignment corrupt unknown area memory trigger
In doubly back pointer held element back item referring current element
These useful navigation manipulation expense greater memory use
These pointer declaration cover variant pointer declaration
Of course possible triple pointer main principle behind triple pointer already exist double pointer
The higher priority
Where pointer used address entry point program start also either uninitialized corrupted call nevertheless made address said occurred
The consequence usually unpredictable error may present several different way depending upon whether pointer valid address whether coincidentally valid instruction opcode address
The detection wild branch present one difficult frustrating debugging exercise since much evidence may already destroyed beforehand execution one inappropriate instruction branch location
If available usually detect wild branch take effect also provide complete partial trace history
It possible simulate pointer behavior using index normally array
Primarily language support pointer explicitly support array thought processed entire memory range within scope particular array index thought equivalent assembly language point individual byte whose actual value relative start array absolute address memory
Assuming array say contiguous character individual byte contiguous byte within array directly addressed manipulated using name array bit unsigned simulated pointer quite similar example shown
Pointer arithmetic simulated adding subtracting index minimal additional overhead compared genuine pointer arithmetic
It even theoretically possible using technique together suitable simulate intermediate another language support pointer example
To achieve code initially loaded contiguous byte array simulator read interpret action entirely within memory contained array
If necessary completely avoid problem usually actioned compiler hand coded simulator
strongly typed language pointer typed safe type conversion permitted
All pointer default initialized attempt access data pointer cause raised
Pointers Ada called
Ada permit arithmetic access type although many compiler vendor provided feature Ada support safe arithmetic access type via package
Several old version Windows platform support STRPTR return address string VARPTR return address variable
Visual Basic also support OBJPTR return address object interface ADDRESSOF operator return address function
The type integer value equivalent held pointer type
Newer dialect exhaustive pointer implementation however
In FreeBASIC arithmetic pointer equivalent C treated though pointer byte width
pointer dereferenced Also casting type pointer generate warning
In pointer variable store address
Each pointer type point one freely cast pointer type function pointer object pointer
A special pointer type called void pointer allows pointing object limited fact dereferenced directly shall cast
The address often directly manipulated casting pointer integral type sufficient size though result may indeed cause undefined behavior earlier C standard integral type guaranteed large enough specifies defined implementation need provide
fully support C pointer C typecasting
It also support new group typecasting operator help catch unintended dangerous cast
Since also provides used situation safer alternative primitive C pointer
also support another form reference quite different pointer called simply
ability modify pointer target address arithmetic operation well magnitude comparison restricted language standard remain within bound single array object otherwise invoke
Adding subtracting pointer move multiple size
For example adding pointer integer value increment pointer
This effect incrementing pointer point next element contiguous array often intended result
Pointer arithmetic performed pointer size thus pointed address added although compiler perform byte arithmetic extension treating
Pointer arithmetic provides programmer single way dealing different type adding subtracting number element required instead actual offset byte
Pointer arithmetic pointer us byte offset definition
In particular C definition explicitly declares syntax element array equivalent content element pointed
This implies equivalent one write equally well access fourth element array
While powerful pointer arithmetic source
It tends confuse novice forcing different context expression ordinary arithmetic one pointer arithmetic one sometimes easy mistake one
In response many modern computer language example permit direct access memory using address
Also safe C dialect address many issue pointer
See discussion
The supported ANSI C generic pointer type
A pointer store address object function C implicitly converted object pointer type assignment must explicitly cast dereferenced
C used pointer purpose ANSI C
allow implicit conversion pointer type even assignment
This design decision avoid careless even unintended cast though compiler output warning error encountering cast
In reference void complement pointer void reference behave like alias variable point never variable whose type
In pointer supported certain condition block code including pointer must marked keyword
Such block usually require higher security permission allowed run
The syntax essentially address pointed either memory
However pointer managed memory pointer managed object must declared using keyword prevents moving pointed object part memory management pointer scope thus keeping pointer address valid
An exception using structure safe managed equivalent require unsafe code
This type often returned using method example The framework includes many class method namespaces class convert type example many type pointer example allow communication
Most method security permission requirement unmanaged code since affect arbitrary place memory
The programming language support pointer variable
Primitive group record data object declared within program inherently memory allocated within program space address data item typically single memory word
In program source code data item used like variable content implicitly accessed indirectly pointer
Memory space data object typically using external statement via embedded extended language construct statement
Extended version COBOL also provide pointer variable declared clause
The value pointer variable established modified using statement
Some extended version COBOL also provide variable capable storing
The language provides full support pointer data type including pointer structure string handling extensive
quite leap forward compared programming language time
The derivative C fully support C pointer C typecasting
The employ value reference semantics without pointer arithmetic
Nevertheless pointer class provided
They offer pointer arithmetic typecasting explicit memory management interfacing software feature
introduced strongly typed pointer capability
Fortran pointer contain simple memory address
They also encapsulate lower upper bound array dimension stride example support arbitrary array section metadata
An used associate variable attribute
The statement may also used associate pointer block memory
For example following code might used define create linked list structure add support procedure pointer
Also part feature support intrinsic function converting pointer Fortran pointer back
pointer
Its declaration syntax equivalent C written way around ending type
Unlike C Go garbage collection disallows pointer arithmetic
Reference type like exist
Some type like map channel boxed
internally pointer mutable structure initialized using function
In approach unified syntax pointer arrow operator dropped dot operator pointer refers field method dereferenced object
This however work level indirection
Unlike explicit representation pointer
Instead complex data structure like implemented using
The language provide explicit pointer manipulation operator
It still possible code attempt dereference null reference null pointer however result thrown
The space occupied unreferenced memory object recovered automatically
Pointers implemented much Pascal parameter procedure call
even strongly typed Pascal fewer way escape type system
Some variant include garbage collection
Much pointer available
There still fewer way evade type system variant still safer respect pointer variant
As garbage collection part language specification
Unlike many language feature pointer standard allows pointer reference dynamically created variable anonymous allow reference standard static local variable
It pointer arithmetic
Pointers also must associated type pointer one type compatible pointer another type
pointer char compatible pointer integer
This help eliminate type security issue inherent pointer implementation particularly used
It also remove risk caused ability dynamically let go referenced space using standard procedure effect library function found mean risk dangling pointer entirely eliminated
However commercial open source Pascal derivative compiler implementation pointer allowed reference standard static local variable cast one pointer type another
Moreover pointer arithmetic unrestricted adding subtracting pointer move number byte either direction using standard procedure move pointer size point
An untyped pointer also provided name compatible pointer type
The support pointer although rarely used form pack unpack function
These intended simple interaction compiled OS library
In case Perl us typed allow form pointer arithmetic
They used construct complex data structure

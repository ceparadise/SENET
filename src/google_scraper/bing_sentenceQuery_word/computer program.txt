The term becoming popular process seen discipline
Computer program categorized used produce
Two main paradigm
specify sequential using declaration expression statement One criticism imperative language side effect assignment statement class variable called variable
describe computation performed compute
Declarative program omit considered instruction
Two broad category declarative language
The principle behind functional language like allow make easier reason program like mathematical function
The principle behind logical language like define problem solved goal leave detailed solution Prolog system
The goal defined providing list subgoals
Then subgoal defined providing list subgoals etc
If path subgoals fails find solution subgoal another path systematically attempted
A computer program form computer programming language called
Source code may converted immediately aid
Compilers used translate source code programming language either
Object code need processing become machine code machine code consists native instruction ready execution
Compiled computer program commonly referred executables binary image simply reference used store executable code
Interpreters used execute source code programming language
The interpreter performs behavior
One advantage interpreter easily extended
The programmer presented prompt individual line code typed performed immediately
The main disadvantage interpreter computer program run slower compiled
Interpreting code slower interpreter must decode statement perform
However software development may faster using interpreter testing immediate compiling step omitted
Another disadvantage interpreter interpreter must present executing computer
By contrast compiled computer program need compiler present execution
computer program execution
For example Java Hotspot contains Just In Time Compiler selectively compiles Java bytecode machine code code Hotspot predicts likely used many time
Either compiled interpreted program might executed without human interaction
often used create batch process
One common scripting language executing environment called
No property programming language require exclusively compiled exclusively interpreted
The categorization usually reflects popular method language execution
For example Java thought interpreted language C compiled language despite existence Java compiler C interpreter
Typically computer program stored requested either directly indirectly computer user
Upon request program loaded computer program called accessed directly central processor
The central processor executes run program instruction instruction termination
A program execution called
Termination either normal error software hardware error
Many operating system support enables many computer program appear run simultaneously one computer

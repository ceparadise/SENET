We agree disagree
The sole criterion assumption based upon horde market job market
General perception require technical skill
Result Every Tom Dick Harry pursuing career Software Testing
After certain time everything becomes stagnant
everyone need move comfort zone hit
So
never accident always result intelligent effort
one single technology
much
Building involves stringent process expert communication knack detail business understanding scripting knowledge array different testing type like security mobile apps performance cloud etc
Being jack trade land job build great
To stand competition need master least one
one
That depends upon capability interest Test Management Automation scripting Security Vulnerability analysis Performance Mobile Apps Testing Cloud computing IoT application Database schema master wisely
In last couple year software tester seen writing wall test operation grow increasingly automated scripting skill essential grow
It new trade least need know
It started supply grew really crowded industry needed measure capability apart Manual concept
The easiest course scripting skill IT hence became new
Yeah
I agree automation scripting knowledge important distinguish candidature everything
The ability analyze communicate reason equally important
A great Software Tester many competency Critical thinking Business Architecture understanding Domain knowledge Tools acquired relevant training practice Test People Management Test improve attitude etc
build successful
People say boring
uninteresting tedious unexciting
I say anything done repeatedly eventually boring applies ANY technology
You need explore learn new thing progress
Try asking Software developer tell boring job become When deciding keep mind manual testing opportunity
Even practically thousand candidate competing
Then opportunity

The jack manual test concept nothing ever replace Manual test automated testing extend reach work replace master least one automation specialized test type
Why think role came existence
Hope see QA conference Day
Hi There nothing like good bad job
Do love love
Software testing indeed good field provided passion verify validate usability etc
If want consider Software testing many reason join software testing
Coming Scope immense scope software testing
It depends much want learn fast learn
You expert Requirement Analysis Test Automation Security Testing Performance Testing UAT etc

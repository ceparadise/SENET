Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

An dedicated function within larger mechanical electrical system often constraint
It part complete device often including hardware mechanical part
Embedded system control many device common use today
percent manufactured component embedded system
Examples property typical embedded computer compared counterpart low power consumption small size rugged operating range low cost
This come price limited processing resource make significantly difficult program interact
However building intelligence mechanism top hardware taking advantage possible existing sensor existence network embedded unit one optimally manage available resource unit network level well provide augmented function well beyond available
For example intelligent technique designed manage power consumption embedded system
Modern embedded system often based
CPU integrated memory peripheral interface ordinary microprocessor using external chip memory peripheral interface circuit also common especially system
In either case processor used may type ranging general purpose specialized certain class computation even custom designed application hand
A common standard class dedicated processor DSP
Since embedded system dedicated specific task design engineer optimize reduce size cost product increase reliability performance
Some embedded system benefiting
Embedded system range portable device large stationary installation like largely complex system like
Complexity varies low single chip high multiple unit network mounted inside large enclosure
One first recognizably modern embedded system developed MIT Instrumentation Laboratory
At project inception Apollo guidance computer considered riskiest item Apollo project employed newly developed monolithic integrated circuit reduce size weight
An early embedded system released
When Minuteman II went production replaced new computer first use integrated circuit
Since early application embedded system come price dramatic rise processing power functionality
An early example designed small system still required external memory support chip
In National Engineering Manufacturers Association released standard programmable microcontrollers including almost controller single board computer numerical controller
As cost microprocessor microcontrollers fell became feasible replace expensive component button knob read microprocessor even consumer product
By early memory input output system component integrated chip processor forming
Microcontrollers find application computer would costly
A comparatively microcontroller may programmed fulfill role large number separate component
Although context embedded system usually complex traditional solution complexity contained within microcontroller
Very additional component may needed design effort software
Software prototype test quicker compared design construction new circuit using embedded processor
Embedded system commonly found consumer cooking industrial automotive medical commercial military application
Telecommunications system employ numerous embedded system network end user
Computer networking us dedicated route data

Embedded system within medical equipment often powered industrial computer
Embedded system used transportation fire safety safety security medical application life critical system system isolated hacking thus reliable unless connected wired wireless network via cellular method IoT monitoring control purpose
For fire safety system designed greater ability handle higher temperature continue operate
In dealing security embedded system able deal cut electrical communication system
A new class miniature wireless device called networked wireless sensor
Wireless sensor networking make use miniaturization made possible advanced IC design couple full wireless subsystem sophisticated sensor enabling people company measure myriad thing physical world act information IT monitoring control system
These mote completely typically run battery source year battery need changed charged
Embedded module provide simple mean wirelessly enabling device communicates via serial port
Embedded system designed specific task rather computer multiple task
Some also performance constraint must met reason safety usability others may low performance requirement allowing system hardware simplified reduce cost
Embedded system always standalone device
Many embedded system consist small part within larger device serf general purpose
For example feature embedded system tuning string overall purpose Robot Guitar course play music
Similarly embedded system provides specific function subsystem car
The program instruction written embedded system referred stored memory chip
They run limited computer hardware resource little memory small keyboard screen
Embedded system range system dedicated one task complex resemble modern computer desktop operating system
Simple embedded device use graphic character example simple
More sophisticated device use graphical screen sensing button provide flexibility minimizing space used meaning button change screen selection involves natural behavior pointing desired
often screen joystick button pointing device
Some system provide user interface remotely help serial
etc
network
connection
This approach give several advantage extends capability embedded system avoids cost display simplifies allows one build rich user interface PC
A good example combination running embedded device
The user interface displayed PC connected device therefore needing software installed
Embedded processor broken two broad category
Ordinary microprocessor μP use separate integrated circuit memory peripheral
Microcontrollers μC peripheral thus reducing power consumption size cost
In contrast personal computer market many different basic used since software application commodity product installed end user
Both well various degree used
well processor found
Word length vary beyond although typical remain
Most architecture come large number different variant shape many also manufactured several different company
developed embedded system use
microprocessor also used embedded system generally require support circuitry microcontrollers
example standard computer board intended small embedded ruggedized system mostly
These often physically small compared standard PC although still quite large compared simple embedded system
They often use embedded
Sometimes board use processor
In certain application small size power efficiency primary concern component used may compatible used general purpose personal computer
Boards VIA range help bridge gap highly integrated physically smaller attribute making attractive embedded engineer
The advantage approach commodity component may used along software development tool used general software development
Systems built way still regarded embedded since integrated larger device fulfill single role
Examples device may adopt approach contain code specific application
However embedded system board use ISA PCI bus
When processor involved may little benefit standarized bus connecting discrete component environment hardware software tool may different
One common design style us small system module perhaps size business card holding high density chip processor peripheral external storage runtime memory
The module vendor usually provide boot software make sure selection operating system usually including real time choice
These module manufactured high volume organization familiar specialized testing issue combined much lower volume custom mainboards external peripheral
Implementation embedded system advanced embedded system easily implemented already made board based worldwide accepted platform
These platform include limited
A common array embedded system SoC contains complete system consisting multiple processor multiplier cache interface single chip
SoCs implemented ASIC using FPGA
Embedded system talk outside world via As software embedded system designer use develop embedded system software
However may also use specific tool Software tool come several source As complexity embedded system grows higher level tool operating system migrating machinery make sense
For example consumer computer often need significant software purchased provided person manufacturer electronics
In system open programming environment required software provider sell large market
Embedded system commonly found consumer cooking industrial automotive medical application
Some example embedded system player mobile phone videogame console digital camera DVD player GPS
Household appliance microwave oven washing machine dishwasher include embedded system provide flexibility efficiency
Embedded may performed different level depending facility available
The different metric characterize different form embedded debugging slow main application close debugged system application actual system application expressive trigger I set debugging I want inspect memory particular value reached I inspect debugging process memory memory register etc
From simplest sophisticated roughly grouped following area Unless restricted external debugging programmer typically load run software tool view code running processor start stop operation
The view code may mixture
Because embedded system often composed wide variety element debugging strategy may vary
For instance debugging centric embedded system different debugging embedded system processing performed peripheral DSP FPGA
An increasing number embedded system today use one single processor core
A common problem development proper synchronization software execution
In case embedded system design may wish check data traffic bus processor core requires debugging level instance
operating system often support operating system event
A graphical view presented host PC tool based recording system behavior
The trace recording performed software RTOS special tracing hardware
RTOS tracing allows developer understand timing performance issue software system give good understanding system behavior
Commercial tool like exists
Embedded system often reside machine expected run continuously year without error case recover error occurs
Therefore software usually developed tested carefully personal computer unreliable mechanical moving part disk drive switch button avoided
Specific reliability issue may include A variety technique used sometimes combination recover software bug also hardware For high volume system minimizing cost usually primary design consideration
Engineers typically select hardware good enough implement necessary function
For prototype embedded system general purpose computer may adapted limiting program replacing operating system
There several different type software architecture common use
In design software simply
The loop manages part hardware software
Hence called simple control loop control loop
Some embedded system predominantly controlled
This mean task performed system triggered different kind event interrupt could generated example timer predefined frequency serial port controller receiving byte
These kind system used event handler need low latency event handler short simple
Usually kind system run simple task main loop also task sensitive unexpected delay
Sometimes interrupt handler add longer task queue structure
Later interrupt handler finished task executed main loop
This method brings system close multitasking kernel discrete process
A system similar simple control loop scheme except loop hidden
The programmer defines series task task get environment run
When task idle call idle routine usually called pause wait yield nop stand etc
The advantage disadvantage similar control loop except adding new software easier simply writing new task adding queue
In type system piece code switch task thread based timer connected interrupt
This level system generally considered operating system kernel
Depending much functionality required introduces le complexity managing multiple task running conceptually parallel
As code potentially damage data another task except larger system using program must carefully designed tested access shared data must controlled synchronization strategy scheme
Because complexity common organization use RTOS allowing application programmer concentrate device functionality rather operating system service least large system smaller system often afford overhead associated real time system due limitation regarding memory size performance battery life
The choice RTOS required brings issue however selection must done prior starting application development process
This timing force developer choose embedded operating system device based upon current requirement restricts future option large extent
The restriction future option becomes issue product life decrease
Additionally level complexity continuously growing device required manage variable serial USB Bluetooth Wireless LAN trunk radio multiple channel data voice enhanced graphic multiple state multiple thread numerous wait state
These trend leading uptake addition operating system
A logical step OS
The usual arrangement operating system kernel allocates memory switch CPU different thread execution
User mode process implement major function file system network interface etc
In general microkernels succeed task switching intertask communication fast fail slow
communicate efficiently normal subroutine call
The hardware software system available extensible application programmer
In case relatively large kernel sophisticated capability adapted suit embedded environment
This give programmer environment similar desktop operating system like therefore productive development downside requires considerably hardware resource often expensive complexity kernel le predictable reliable
Common example embedded monolithic kernel
Despite increased cost hardware type embedded system increasing popularity especially powerful embedded device
Here reason In addition core operating system many embedded system additional software component
These component consist networking protocol stack like also included storage capability like flash memory management system
If embedded device audio video capability appropriate driver codecs present system
In case monolithic kernel many software layer included
In RTOS category availability additional software component depends upon commercial offering

I approached job writing embedded C micro controller
At first I would thought embedding programming low software stack maybe I thinking wrong
Normally I would shrugged opportunity write embedded code I consider electrical engineer
Is bad assumption
Am I able write interesting useful software embedded system I kick dropping low software stack
I went school computer science really enjoyed writing compiler thinking concurrent algorithm designing data structure developing framework
However I currently employed web developer scream interesting thing I described
I currently deal issue like check box need pixel left date formatted wrong
I appreciate everyone input
I know I make decision I would like clarification mean embedded programmer fit I find interesting
Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise

I pick working embedded system coding UI day
You never forget first time watch machine start moving way programmed
It way satisfying pushing pixel
As embedded programmer job make custom hardware work
Typically I developed bunch software dev board previous version hardware
When new board come job put software board demonstrate everything work
Because almost always problem kind debugging skill essential
If external peripheral work bad chip bad connection chip buggy code incorrect use peripheral
The way tell extensive debugging
This mean comfortable oscilloscope network analyzer logic analyzer target debugger
The debugging process becomes almost scientific
I develop hypothesis design experiment provide evidence hypothesis test
When evaluating intern new embedded engineer skill critical
All software problem start interfacing physical world variety problem increase exponentially
The essence job solve long series problem concept reality
In experience one get better result approaching embedded system software development software developer hat rather electronics engineer hat
practice like TDD CI le common hardware engineering On hand I think experience developing embedded system make one better software developer
I similar situation year ago
I point year software development application server environment
My experience dealing low level hardware writing assembler teenager ZX spectrum
It certainly challenge
I found dealing chip set assembler enjoyable I certainly learned lot hardware
A substantial part role testing hardware using software learning cope programming recognising software bug actually hardware bug
Actually sometimes take quite bit work software hardware people identify bug hardware software
One aspect I failed deliver device driver work
I never really grasped one thing company director never understood
It became accepted fact
Becomming familiar occiloscope soldering ion essential
remembering hardware guy say number ALWAYS mean useful
Realising Hardware engineer find dealing software frustrating help hardware project involve software called cable

I Electrical Engineer yet I done small amount embedded software development
The biggest issue I found I much basic background math I know easily break complex series advanced mathematical algorithm code without lot help
For stuff I needed play signalling read value input submit data output sort stuff I found little different conceptually I day day good old fashioned Software Developer
Writing software really
It need go beyond actual software I find thing getting dicey I knowledge mess directly hardware
This usually happens trying debug test code
If got really great tool chain might integrated debugging simulation environment take pain away yet even help sometimes need get back basic test code sort analyzer reality embedded platform provide luxury basic compiler EE help
From perspective I think electrical engineer essential embedded programming task simple actual requirement minimal
Beyond I think EE would make life much easier working embedded environment particularly real science required figure problem
I done business level embedded programming Bachelor mostly embedded system I year real experience

Embedded system programming hard
An immediate issue con fusion level characteristic would ordinarily encapsulated behind interface often essence embedded system architecture thus emerge layer design
Parallelism typical introducing opportunity nasty bug data corruption race condition deadlock starvation
External device generally communicate interrupt software engineering nightmare asynchronous function call occurring unpredictable point execution delivering result shared data
Embedded system commonly monitor control external device reliability including meeting constraint essential equipment may risk
Since malfunctioning equipment could jeopardize human life material asset embedded system often safety critical high security requiring certification standard
The development process embedded software much complicated native system involving environment emulator specialized often expensive tool hardware
Finally significantly many critical embedded system contain large amount software perhaps million line code developed team may geographically distributed must evolve time response change requirement
Embedded system must therefore modular extensible adaptable developer need rigorously follow sound process version control configuration management quality assurance
All present quite challenge professional embedded system programmer
A natural question The unfortunate answer least US
This article identifies root cause gap suggests make progress
The problem start early curriculum
Too often introductory Computer Science course fall one two extreme either focusing syntactic detail programming language used semicolon go else treating programming matter choosing component plugging GUI
The basic design analyze algorithm data structure covered summarily
Software methodology Object Orientation best approached context development life cycle large application introduced trivial example benefit appreciated proverbial cannon used shoot fly
Important issue understanding vulnerability knowing avoid explored
The rush university jump Java bandwagon late precipitated problem
Java fine language many kind application especially one need dynamic flexibility
However Object Orientation bias make clumsy traditional system reliance Garbage Collection hide memory management issue embedded system programmer need understand deal thread model source subtle trap pitfall
To blunt adopting Java replace previous language used introductory programming course Pascal Ada C step backward pedagogically
Many university went Java job ironically may produced generation programmer superficial skill losing job overseas competition broader deeper talent
As explained university need take fresh look goal programming language used introductory computer science course ensure least upper level student gain practical experience broad spectrum language

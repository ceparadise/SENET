The notation mean function eventually bounded multiple
Here eventually depends direction one taking limit
We focus first limit going infinity since common case
More precisely say exist positive constant
While Big O notation mean eventually bounded Ω notation mean eventually bounded More precisely say Ω exist positive constant
The notation Θ mean Ω
There two remaining notation ο Greek omicron ω Greek omega
The omicron notation also called notation
We say ο limit
We say ω limit
The idea remain essentially finite limit though technical detail definition differ
exist positive constant δ x δ
Ω exist positive constant δ C x δ
ο limit
ω limit
Often see statement without reference explicit limit determine context limit implied

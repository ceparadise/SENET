Software Reusability
Wiley Encyclopedia Computer Science Engineering

Soongsil University Department Computer Science Seoul Korea As key strategy overcome software crisis attempt reuse software asset building software way
Software reuse technology evolved generation programming paradigm
In article first define seven dimension software reusability
With observe evolution reuse technology
For programming paradigm key reuse construct discussed technical assessment reusability given
In addition observe reusability design pattern architectural style
Finally derive key trend software reusability technical assessment reuse technology evolution

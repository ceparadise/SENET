Learn basic essay writing guide Extracts document Introduction Table content Introduction Transaction Processing What transaction processing
Advantages Disadvantages Analysis Applications Spreadsheets Database Word Processing Email Conclusion The Paperless society
Introduction Paperless Society Conclusion Appendices Bibliography References Computer Solutions Introduction The following report look three main area first area demonstrate understanding regarding advantage disadvantage Transaction Processing
The second section look advantage disadvantage business context discussing application Spreadsheets Database Word processing would best used expand strength weakness area
The finally part three research provide evidence regarding society live today achieved Society
It discus look toward providing evidence backup discredit hypothesis method using different form research
Transaction Processing What transaction processing
Transaction processing involves round trip transfer financial transaction data example consumer credit card information merchant web site processing network VeriSign thereafter completes transfer fund merchant
From quotation established processing electronic form processing data
This format financial transaction simply processing order via electronic format purchase via Web
Advantages The advantage system ease quickness used
For example automated transaction process ATM machine whole wall banking
Through service customer able withdraw deposit money check account detail order stationary cheque book statement etc
This available time convenient customer accessible hour day meaning customer conduct Middle Other facility also available within package mail merge
This benefit company data merged program order produce thing mailing label envelope standard form letter etc
The advantage time saved repetitive job quick easy relatively error free
Large volume letter etc produced short time
Through inclusion spelling grammar check facility document checked error quickly make work dispatched company become professional
The find replace function able locate specified would within document replace another required
This save time go multi paged document reading word word order find error change
The program automatically change word second check user word located fact want changing
There many feature within program make viable business older form typing ability change font style size address appearance new version Microsoft Word used effective desk top publishing package
The main disadvantage computer shuts program performs illegal operation work saved document could lost
Another disadvantage word processing program compatible would mean work produced specific software would edited one compatible version
Training cost could also become expensive order staff able operate specific processing package retraining new version word Conclusion Paper consumption increase around world especially developing Asian country
World consumption metric ton according FAO Food Agriculture Organisation United Nations
The second annual National Filing Survey found per cent respondent believe paperless office unachievable even working towards believe either
Conclusion Although fact lead u believe reaching goal society documented evidence case found
On research carried seam disprove hypothesis Paperless society
From finding seen evidence show paper used today previously possible different format
reduced preparation time cost sending correspondence evidence show recipient still print lot information
This could fully trusting technology yet even finding easier read hard copy format one fully know sure research concluded done study Richard Harper Abigail Sellen
Therefore research concluded still long way society possible never one
When I hear term paperless office I control laughter
Why
Because thing paperless office
And unfortunately likely become reality anytime soon
Scott Nesbitt latest technology allow u work digital world depend paper heavily
Indeed workplace dependent paper
It seems promised paperless office much mythical ideal today thirty year ago
This student written piece work one many found section
Grade The salary survey done external agency salary fixed based
There four major head salary fixed review
It important break bus system smaller segment information travel number route specific destination
Below ca seen breakdown bus system The internal bus This connects computer component CPU main memory generated reasonable number scenario
The formulation customized fixed problem
The way MIP worked minimized cost function approximated distribution cost actual system ignoring stochastic dynamic element
This would mean computer system stolen data would lost would fallen wrong hand
More security alarm could used
There already temperature sensor case fire operation movement sensor case break

For example I drop table roll back transaction table recreated
What limit schema change made transaction
If depends version Sql Server please say
I thinking using statement create table need drop ALL table later part workflow
None table ten row
Most database object DDL statement part user transaction
Some exception exists like operation related file database like ALTER DATABASE FILE
At server level object part transaction
Exceptions object like endpoint may start stop listenning socket
The general rule thumb metadata operation part transaction
If operation external side effect creates file open socket etc part transaction rollback guaranteed
The vast majority DDL statement metadata modify metadata catalog table eg
add row behave like transacted operation transaction rolled back row removed hence table
There detail eg
view top real internal table like real table modified CREATE TABLE high level happening
Why test scenario
I tried took minute
Thread necro seems longer case using batching simply run code m sql server following IS NOT ROLLED BACK By posting answer agree

Does term context describing structure refer actual structure data structure

I talk schema entity without
For example suppose I writing documentation JSON API always return particular structure say Can I say payload returned API includes required value name age
Or term exclusively refer another document formally describes structure using schema language sort
In case another appropriate term refer recurring pattern structure
The Github API section titled schema
However word schema mentioned text use schema language
This would suggest schema general term output
Unless consider english schema language case entire page schema
Hmmm
In order write documentation structure JSON object returned API follow two approach describe common attribute object returned every function API API function describe specific attribute type meaning example Many APIs use JSON exchange data documented using approach
Google APIs various service Facebook Graph API
In case I think correct use term schema
give formal description output using schema definition language like designed IETF play role XML schema definition language XML
But I know established standard active Google group I find notable example
In case provide valid schema output function
If choose approach say obviously provide By posting answer agree

information processing divided individual indivisible operation called
Each transaction must succeed complete unit never partially complete
For example purchase book online bookstore exchange money form credit book
If credit good series related operation ensures get book bookstore get money
However single operation series fails exchange entire exchange fails
You get book bookstore get money
The technology responsible making exchange balanced predictable called transaction processing
Transactions ensure resource permanently updated unless operation within transactional unit complete successfully
By combining set related operation unit either completely succeeds completely fails one simplify error recovery make one application reliable
Transaction processing system consist computer hardware software hosting application performs routine transaction necessary conduct business
Examples include system manage sale order entry airline reservation payroll employee record manufacturing shipping
Since though necessarily transaction processing today interactive term often treated synonymous
Transaction processing designed maintain system Integrity typically modern known consistent state ensuring interdependent operation system either completed successfully canceled successfully
For example consider typical banking transaction involves moving customer saving account customer checking account
This transaction involves least two separate operation computer term debiting saving account crediting checking account
If one operation succeeds book bank balance end day
There must therefore way ensure either operation succeed fail never inconsistency bank database whole
Transaction processing link multiple individual operation single indivisible transaction ensures either operation transaction completed without error none
If operation completed error occur others attempted system roll back operation transaction including successful one thereby erasing trace transaction restoring system consistent known state processing transaction began
If operation transaction completed successfully transaction system change database made permanent transaction rolled back done
Transaction processing guard hardware software error might leave transaction partially completed
If computer system crash middle transaction transaction processing system guarantee operation uncommitted transaction cancelled
Generally transaction issued concurrently
If overlap
need touch portion database create conflict
For example customer mentioned example saving account attempt transfer different person time moving checking account one succeed
However forcing transaction processed sequentially inefficient
Therefore concurrent implementation transaction processing programmed guarantee end result reflects outcome could reached executing transaction sequentially order property called
In example mean matter transaction issued first either transfer different person move checking account succeeds one fails
The basic principle system
However terminology may vary one system another term used necessarily universal
system ensure database integrity recording intermediate state database modified using record restore database known state transaction committed
For example copy information database modification transaction set aside system transaction make modification sometimes called
If part transaction fails committed copy used restore database state transaction began
It also possible keep separate modification database management system
sometimes called
This required rollback failed transaction useful updating database management system event database failure system provide
If database management system fails entirely must restored recent
The reflect transaction committed since made
However database management system restored journal image applied database bring database management system date
Any transaction progress time failure rolled back
The result database consistent known state includes result transaction committed moment failure
In case two transaction may course processing attempt access portion database time way prevents proceeding
For example transaction A may access portion X database transaction B may access portion Y database
If point transaction A try access portion Y database transaction B try access portion X occurs neither transaction move forward
system designed detect deadlock occur
Typically transaction cancelled rolled back started different order automatically deadlock occur
Or sometimes one deadlocked transaction cancelled rolled back automatically restarted short delay
Deadlocks also occur among three transaction
The transaction involved difficult detect point transaction processing system find practical limit deadlock detect
In system commit rollback mechanism available undesirable often used undo failed transaction restore system previous state
defined property reliable transaction system late acronym atomicity consistency isolation durability
A transaction change state atomic either happen none happen
These change include database change message action transducer
A transaction correct transformation state
The action taken group violate integrity constraint associated state
Even though transaction execute concurrently appears transaction T others executed either T T
Once transaction completes successfully commits change database survive failure retain change Transaction processing benefit Standard first developed often closely coupled particular
implemented similar principle mixed success
However recent year distributed model become considerably difficult maintain
As number transaction grew response various online service especially single distributed database practical solution
In addition online system consist whole suite program operating together opposed strict model single server could handle transaction processing
Today number transaction processing system available work level scale large system including
One effort DTP see also JTA
However proprietary environment IBM still popular although CICS evolved include open industry standard well
The term used describe transaction processing system uncommonly challenging requirement particularly throughput requirement transaction per second
Such system may implemented via distributed cluster style architecture
It used least

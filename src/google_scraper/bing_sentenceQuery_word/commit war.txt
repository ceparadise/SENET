learn share knowledge build career
After reading I decided would good start experimenting GitHub
I thought What better way experiment introductory computer science homework
However practice open solution web I concerned student might plagiarize
I
Thus question come mind I consider practice Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise
Does putting homework code GitHub open copied
If create public repository yes
Private repository cost money private repository though pointed free student version Are people plagiarize familiar GitHub
Open source sharing
That kind point
Do store thing want keep private public place
Should I concerned
For general homework
Again put essay personal writing public repository
That would similar putting essay public blog
Would plagiarism detection software scan GitHub I know
Probably eventually
Git used without github
To really learn git need github bitbucket paid service
GitHub public set server work
Git great tracking revision
If ever used Google Docs Google Drive looked history feature probably familiar nice able revisit change old version work
Git formalizes allowing comment commits branch work multiple version experiment without worrying overwriting original work
I read Quora post thought I might add
The best thing improve skill rent server vendor like Rackspace Digital Ocean Linode name provider
These service run little though month typical
From learn configure Linux machine
You install git repository mail server web server whatever want low risk environment
Make mistake reset server virgin state
I recommend installing Ubuntu distro large community relative ease installing new software
One problem developer often dependent sysadmins task really part repertoire
It depends
If repository public anyone see fork
They may even send pull request
If repository private hand seen people allow
You need paid subscription create private repos
That
But IMO always suppose plagiarizer familiar everything
It homework
Why care
It like doctor thesis next patent material
I know software Wikipedia
I would surprised someone made Github
But usually software check whether copied something well known site author original content nothing worry
If people plagiarizing mean good
Last least might want read Creative Commons
Unless really want keep work top secret better use CC license lose night sleep people copying work
My advice asked viewed active site design logo Stack Exchange Inc user contribution licensed

About site A journal thought thing life Collection article I published Presentations I delivered recently Software I written My link collection My picture collection featuring cute little chihuahua Pico Quick introduction internals people scared word like
In simplified form git object storage DAG object handful different type object
They stored compressed identified hash incidentally content file represent representation git
The simplest object bunch byte
This often file symlink pretty much anything else
The object point determines semantics
Directories represented object
They refer content file filename access mode etc stored subdirectory
When node point another node DAG node exist without
Nodes nothing point garbage collected rescued much like filesystem inodes filename pointing
A refers represents state file time commit
It also refers parent
More one parent mean commit merge parent mean initial commit interestingly one initial commit usually mean two separate project merged
The body object commit message
References head branch like note slapped node DAG
Where DAG get added existing node mutated moved around freely
They get stored history directly transferred repository
They act sort bookmark I working
add node DAG move note current branch new node
The ref special actually point another ref
It pointer currently active branch
Normal ref actually namespace often skip part
Remote reference note different color
The difference normal different namespace fact remote ref essentially controlled remote server
update
A node DAG note yet another color
A point includes optional message GPG signature
The fast way access tag lost recovered DAG
The node DAG moved repository repository stored effective form pack unused node garbage collected
But end repository always DAG
So armed knowledge store version history visualize thing like merges differ tool try manage history linear change per branch
This simplest repository
We remote repository one commit
Here ed remote received one new commit remote merged yet
The situation
As merge new commits local branch thing happened moving note changing file working directory respectively
One local later
We new local commit new remote commit
Clearly merge needed
Results
Because new local commits actual new node created DAG
Note two parent Here tree look commits branch another merge
See stitching pattern emerge
The DAG record exactly history action taken
The stitching pattern somewhat tedious read
If yet published branch clearly communicated others base work alternative
You branch instead merging commit replaced another commit different parent branch moved
Your old commit remain DAG garbage collected
Ignore know way screwed totally
If extra pointing old commit remain pointing keep old commit alive indefinitely
That fairly confusing though
Do rebase branch others created new commits top
It possible recover hard extra work needed frustrating
The situation garbage collecting ignoring unreachable commit creating new commit top branch
also know rebase multiple commits one command
That end brief intro people intimidated computer science
Hope helped

In domain CPU problem CPU next instruction execute following clock cycle potentially lead incorrect computation result
Three common type hazard data hazard structural hazard control flow hazard branching hazard
There several method used deal hazard including bubbling case method
pipelined processor performed several stage given time several instruction processed various stage pipeline fetch execute
There many different instruction pipeline instruction may
A hazard occurs two simultaneous possibly order instruction conflict
Data hazard occur instruction exhibit modify data different stage pipeline
Ignoring potential data hazard result also termed race hazard
There three situation data hazard occur Consider two instruction occurring program order
try read source writes A read write RAW data hazard refers situation instruction refers result yet calculated retrieved
This occur even though instruction executed prior instruction prior instruction processed partly pipeline
For example The first instruction calculating value saved register second going use value compute result register
However operand fetched operation result first yet saved hence data dependency occurs
A data dependency occurs instruction dependent completion instruction
try write destination read A write read WAR data hazard represents problem concurrent execution
For example In situation chance may finish concurrent execution must ensured result register stored chance fetch operand
try write operand written A write write WAW data hazard may occur environment
For example The write back WB must delayed finish executing
A structural hazard occurs part processor hardware needed two instruction time
A canonical example single memory unit accessed fetch stage instruction retrieved memory memory stage data written read memory
They often resolved separating component unit separate cache
Branching hazard also termed control hazard occur
On many instruction pipeline microarchitectures processor know outcome branch need insert new instruction pipeline normally stage
also termed method preclude data structural branch hazard
As instruction fetched control logic determines whether hazard occur
If true control logic insert pipeline
Thus next instruction would cause hazard executes prior one sufficient time finish prevent hazard
If number equal number stage pipeline processor cleared instruction proceed free hazard
All form stalling introduce delay processor resume execution
occurs branch instruction jump new memory location invalidating prior stage pipeline
These prior stage cleared allowing pipeline continue new instruction indicated branch
There several main solution algorithm used resolve data hazard In case algorithm used The task removing data dependency delegated compiler fill appropriate number instruction dependent instruction ensure correct operation instruction possible
For example write value register already contains add register store result register
Following execution register contain value
However Instruction write register fully exit pipeline Instruction start executing mean Register contain value Instruction performs addition
In event Instruction add old value register register contains instead
This error occurs Instruction read Register Instruction result write operation Register
So Instruction reading content Register register still contains
Forwarding described help correct error depending fact output Instruction used subsequent instruction value committed Register
Forwarding applied example mean The effect Instruction us correct recent value Register made immediately pipelined
With forwarding enabled stage pipeline two input value read register specified example value Register new value Register example value sent next stage
Added control logic used determine input use
To avoid control hazard microarchitectures In event branch cause pipeline bubble incorrect instruction entered pipeline care must taken prevent instruction effect processor state excluding energy wasted processing discovered loaded incorrectly
Memory latency another factor designer must attend delay could reduce performance
Different type memory different accessing time memory
Thus choosing suitable type memory designer improve performance pipelined data path

Computer forensics essential convicting many well known criminal including terrorist sexual predator murderer

Computer forensics integrates field computer science law investigate crime
For digital evidence legally admissible court investigator must follow proper legal procedure recovering analyzing data computer system
Unfortunately law written era computer forensics often outdated adequately ass technique used computer system search
The inability law keep pace technological advancement may ultimately limit use computer forensics evidence court
Privacy advocate growing especially concerned computer search may breach suspect human right
Furthermore method encryption anonymity grow advanced technology may abused helping criminal hide action
Ultimately role technology computer forensics may reach full potential due legal boundary potential malicious intention
Computer forensics indispensable conviction many criminal including terrorist sexual predator murderer
Terrorist organization may use Internet recruit member sexual predator may use social networking site stalk potential victim
However criminal fail cover track using technology implement crime
They fail realize computer file data remain hard drive even deleted allowing investigator track criminal activity
Even criminal delete incriminating file data remains binary format due data remanence residual representation data
File deletion merely renames file hide user original file still recovered
Eventually data may overwritten lost due volatile nature memory storage area used data
A random access memory chip RAM retrieves data memory help program run efficiently
However time computer switched RAM loses stored data
Therefore RAM referred volatile memory data preserved hard drive known persistent memory
The RAM constantly swapping seldom used data hard drive open space memory newer data
Over time though content swap file may also overwritten
Thus investigator may lose evidence longer wait since computer data persist indefinitely
Fortunately computer scientist engineered equipment copy computer content without turning machine
The content safely used lawyer detective analysis
Global Position System GPS software embedded smartphones satellite navigation satnav system also aid prosecutor tracking whereabouts suspect
Since company develop software computer forensics also develop product satellite navigator tool technology necessary acquiring GPS evidence
However evidence recovered GPS software limited list address
Current GPS software record time address archived whether address inputted person automatically recorded whether owner intent entering address associated crime
Despite limitation GPS evidence still crucial success many prosecution
In one famous example four armed suspect accused robbing bank United Kingdom convicted suspect owned vehicle whose satnav held incriminating evidence including bank address address three suspect
The Scottish National Crime Unit searched suspect TomTom GPS device obtain thousand address vehicle passed
Many address turned scene criminal offense
In force successfully found Pakistani compound Osama bin Laden killed tracking satellite phone call made bodyguard
While GPS evidence may enough establish motive GPS evidence still provide invaluable lead confirm hunch
For example contact list language preference setting may used establish suspect identity identify accomplice
Evidence GPS software mobile device valuable supplement form evidence
Some criminal grown cautious hiding incriminating data encryption technique
However according Andy Spruill senior director risk management Guidance Software criminal knowledge patience implement encryption software The minority criminal encrypt file may use partial encryption
If file hard drive encrypted investigator analyze unencrypted copy found elsewhere device find information seeking
Furthermore since computer user tend reuse password investigator locate password easily decipherable format gain access protected file
Computer data also oftentimes redundant Microsoft Word make copy time document modified deleting document may permanently remove hard drive
With many form difficult criminal completely delete incriminating computer evidence
While investigator exploit computer system glitch obtain evidence technological limitation often compromise computer search
A common protocol handling mobile device found crime scene turn power
Investigators want preserve battery prevent outside source using remote wipe feature phone content
When phone turned phone receive text message data may overwrite evidence currently stored device
However turning device consequence potentially causing data lost downloaded file corrupted
To solve problem computer engineer developed technology shielding device connecting cellular carrier network
Computer forensic scientist longer need turn device isolate
For example radio frequency RF shielded test enclosure box help keep signal entering leaving device
A Faraday bag used conjunction conductive mesh also isolate mobile device
Using technique investigator safely transport mobile device lab device turned
However GPS software Faraday bag foolproof
A cell phone isolated Faraday bag may adamantly search signal depleting phone battery power
When searching network cell phone also losing data
Radio frequency bag iPhone inside reducing data loss
These bag keep radio signal entering leaving device

According Professor David Last University Bangor Wales error locating signal may range meter obstruction present
While percent GPS measurement fall within metre true position clear open area large geographical barrier skyscraper may severely block reflect satellite signal
Interference solar weather may also disrupt signal
Criminals even purposely use jammer disrupt tracking system
Investigators must carefully audit communication channel monitoring system used tracking system
In better avoid skepticism jury able give clearer precise estimate amount error afflicting GPS measurement
Otherwise defense suppress GPS evidence measurement significantly faulty unreliable
While Fourth Fifth Amendments written long era computer concept still apply practice computer forensics
The amendment serve protect basic human right preventing unreasonable search seizure
In case defendant claimed cell phone analogous closed container suggesting investigator exercise restraint caution searching cell phone would bag private home
Generally investigator must first obtain search warrant typically given court order obtain preserve evidence easily destroyed
However exception rule observed investigator legally retrieved telephone number finite memory suspect pager without warrant content pager easily altered incoming message overwrite currently stored data
Searches without warrant incident arrest permissible help prevent fragile data evidentiary value lost
They consist mostly scanning device content using keyboard menu option
More advanced search incident arrest may include use mobile lab allows immediate download cellular phone data
However according search incident arrest conducted substantially contemporaneous arrest
If investigator want conduct forensic analysis proper legal authorization must first obtained
Proper legal procedure often vague burdensome investigator especially since law may vary state state
Some state may stricter policy regarding warrantless search
In court ruled since cell phone hold greater quantity data pager content le likely lost warrantless cell phone search thus unnecessary unjustified
Similarly court decided searching information stored cell phone analogous search sealed letter
Even investigator manage obtain search warrant evidence find may still suppressed forensic procedure fail follow legal procedure
For example looking unopened mail unread text carefully documenting chain custody may constitute improper search
With many boundary inconsistency legal system often difficult investigator successfully perform job
Different state national legal system plague computer forensics well
When Estonian charged computer crime Russia refused provide legal cooperation criminalized computer crime yet
Russia received severe Distributed Denial Service attack lack cooperation
In addition faulty legal system accessibility advanced technology may afflicting computer forensics
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO defines cyber terrorism cyber attack using exploiting computer communication network cause sufficient destruction generate fear intimidate society ideological goal As computer system grow powerful criminal may also abuse computer system commit crime software theft terrorism sexual harassment
For example stalker abuse Tor Project anonymizing tool victim cybercrime safely report abuse instead hide identity commit crime harassment
The technology advanced digital trail cybercrime tracked
As encryption program grow stronger popular forensic investigator may longer able decode hidden digital evidence
For computer forensics progress law must keep pace technological advancement
Clear consistent legal procedure regarding computer system search must developed police investigator properly trained
An International Code Ethics Cyber Crime Cyber Terrorism also established develop protocol obtaining preserving evidence maintaining chain custody evidence across border clear ing difference language Following measure may first step resolving technological legal limitation afflicting computer forensics
Interpol International Criminal Police Organization developed Computer Crime Manual training course rapid information exchange system serf foundation international cooperation
Lastly criminal abuse technology limited equipping police department training equipment forensic analysis
Only world safely prepared face future technology

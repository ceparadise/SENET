While two type computer look quite different general hardware component
Let start
This metal enclosure contains many hardware component
It come various shape size typical model inch high
Want know inside
Okay go get screwdriver let open
Seriously really computer best way learn actually get
To save u time however look desktop computer case
A computer enthusiast replaced metal side panel transparent one look inside
Although photo look pretty cool bit hard recognize individual component especially connecting wire running
This figure show schematic version desktop computer make easier point essential hardware component
The computer case contains power supply unit convert electricity direct current component
The critical component motherboard plastic board several essential component mounted
This includes central processing unit CPU main memory expansion slot hardware component
The internal hard disk drive serf mass storage device data file software application

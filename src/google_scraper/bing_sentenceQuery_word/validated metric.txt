I taking basic course general relativity
They introduced concept metric I able understand somebody explain need metric curved space
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
need metric Clocks measure time measure metric applied worldline path spacetime
Rulers measure distance measure metric along path spacetime
Everything used thinking measurement actually measure metric
need
Because clock ruler measure want connect measurement point physic experimental science
So could ask know needed
And write matrix everyday situation similar numerically identity matrix
Which allows ignore use allows confuse lot thing
For instance could take directional derivative
Or could write vector gradient vector dotted scalar product unit vector tell directional derivative direction
But dot product scalar product us metric
And use non cartesian coordinate already pay attention
But natural object take vector give directional derivative gradient
The gradient vector gradient metric applied make vector really function take vector give directional vector
And really issue relativity
You unlearn
You find thingsvyouvdivide thought gradient gradient vector actually different
Like force
Does
In Newtonian mechanic matter one equally F relativity ca equal thing
And learn force change momentum mass time acceleration
That real difficulty learning Relativity
And learn distinguish column vector like gradient vector row vector like gradient
If write metric matrix G relationship column vector c row vector naturally r two column vector b compute Ga And scalar
So row vector associated column vector Ga But would even think The problem matrix G sometimes identity matrix fact Euclidean space Cartesian coordinate identity matrix
So might thought Ga since practiced situation
And since first one learned might notice using identity matrix
In non Cartesian coordinate identity matrix
So practice non Cartesian coordinate get used
Learning difference change coordinate actual metric distance
For instance use polar coordinate r even unit distance
Clearly coordinate difference giving something measured ruler
For need metric
A metric distance function space
It take two space time give distance
We usually consider point infinitesimally close one another way applies every kind space curved
In Euclidean space metric given pythagoras theorem
In flat Minkowski space
In case absolute value coordinate matter difference used calculate distance
When space curved change
The distance function change move along space due change curvature
This dependency captured metric tensor
We general The previous two flat space also described general equation
For Euclidean space metric tensor unit matrix
For Minkowki spacetime metric tensor diagonal matrix topleft bottomright
In case constant matrix independent absolute coordinate
The metric tensor always space curvature change one place another
Pythagoras theorem example metric
Notice theorem postulated rather derived fact defines flat space
Notice also except short distance valid globe different rule calculate distance need specified instead
It way quantify behavior space whether flat curvilinear
Where d interval g metric x
As said x drawn analogous pythagoras euclidean space metric machine translates curved space
EDIT corrected Lewis Miller
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

clustering algorithm work like Usually Euclidean metric used Step
What happens metric symmetric function point point R used
Can still produce meaningful result
You use coordinate euclidian distance metric
Its distance matter need reassign cluster center
So coordinate use something euclidian distance
If coordinate ca use
In fact use function property distance symmetric triangle inequality clustering Euclidean distance Manhattan distance norm forth
During iteration cluster center assigned position minimizes sum distance point currently cluster
The Euclidean metric particularly simple finding new cluster center center mean cluster point
However every proper metric yield cluster center minimize sum distance point cluster though might bit complicated calculate new center
If distance function true metric get meaningless result even algorithm
Most sophisticated software support different distance measure clustering support

Sry question stupid I wondered like corresponding counterpart Lebesgue measure R
metric space E
Since natural way measure distance E given natural way measure set well
Sure I aware structure R special theory measure set metric space naturally
Well real difficult equivalent invariance translation
For instance normed space infinite dimension many ball radius put one radius r

cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet
This layer called
used reasoning

The term derived Greek word meaning meaning
The two main type biometric identifier depend either physiological characteristic behavioral characteristic
Physiological identifier relate composition user authenticated include finger geometry size position finger vein recognition DNA matching
Behavioral identifier include unique way individual act including recognition typing pattern walking gait gesture
Some behavioral identifier used provide continuous instead single authentication check
Authentication becoming increasingly common corporate public security system consumer electronics application
In addition security driving force behind biometric verification convenience remember carry
Some biometric method measuring person gait operate direct contact person authenticated
Components biometric device include Biometric data may held centralized database although modern biometric implementation often depend instead gathering biometric data locally cryptographically authentication identification accomplished without direct access biometric data
Biometric identifier depend uniqueness factor considered
For example fingerprint generally considered highly unique person
Fingerprint recognition especially implemented Apple iPhone first widely used mass market application biometric authentication factor
Other biometric factor including retina iris vein voice facial scan adopted widely far part le confidence uniqueness identifier factor easier spoof
Stability biometric factor also important acceptance factor
Fingerprints change lifetime facial appearance change drastically age illness factor
The greatest privacy issue using biometrics physical attribute like fingerprint retinal blood vessel pattern generally static modified
This distinction nonbiometric factor like password something know token something replaced breached otherwise compromised including million individual whose fingerprint compromised data breach
The increasing ubiquity camera microphone fingerprint reader many today mobile device mean biometrics continue become common method authenticating user particularly specified new standard authentication biometrics support biometric factor
While quality biometric reader continues improve still produce false negative authorized user recognized authenticated unauthorized user recognized authenticated
While camera sensor help enable use biometrics also enable attacker
Because people shield face ear hand voice gait attack possible simply capturing biometric data people without consent knowledge
An early attack fingerprint biometric authentication called date back Japanese researcher using confection showed attacker lift latent fingerprint glossy surface capacitance gelatin similar human finger fingerprint scanner designed detect capacitance would fooled gelatin transfer
Other biometrics factor also defeated determined attacker
In Jan Krissler also known Starbug Chaos Computer Club biometrics researcher demonstrated method extracting enough data photograph defeat iris scanning authentication Krissler reported defeating iris scanner authentication scheme used Samsung Galaxy smartphone
Krissler previously recreated user thumbprint image demonstrate Apple Touch ID fingerprinting authentication scheme also vulnerable
After Apple released iPhone X took researcher two week bypass Apple Face ID facial recognition using mask Face ID also defeated individual related authenticated user including child sibling

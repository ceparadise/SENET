Computers designed higher level RAS many feature protect data integrity help stay long period time without data integrity particular selling point mainframe
While RAS originated term extended concept system general including
Note distinction reliability availability reliability measure ability system function correctly including avoiding data corruption whereas availability measure often system available use even though may functioning correctly
For example server may run forever ideal availability may unreliable frequent data corruption
Physical fault temporary permanent
Transient intermittent fault typically handled detection correction ECC code instruction replay see
Permanent fault lead uncorrectable error handled replacement duplicate hardware processor sparing passing uncorrectable error high level recovery mechanism
A successfully corrected intermittent fault also reported OS provide information
Example hardware feature improving RAS include following listed subsystem extended idea making defining feature computer application like exchange system crash would catastrophic
see tend duplicate component running reliability become le popular due high cost
using technique like often used cheaper alternative

Software Reliability probability software operation specified period time specified environment
Software Reliability also important factor affecting system reliability
It differs hardware reliability reflects design perfection rather manufacturing perfection
The high complexity software major contributing factor Software Reliability problem
Software Reliability function time although researcher come model relating two
The modeling technique Software Reliability reaching prosperity using technique must carefully select appropriate model best suit case
Measurement software still infancy
No good quantitative method developed represent Software Reliability without excessive limitation
Various approach used improve reliability software however hard balance development time budget software reliability
With advent computer age computer well software running playing vital role daily life
We may noticed appliance washing machine telephone TVs watch analog mechanical part replaced CPUs software
The computer industry booming exponentially
With continuously lowering cost improved control processor software controlled system offer compact design flexible handling rich feature competitive cost
Like machinery replaced craftsmanship industrial revolution computer intelligent part quickly pushing mechanical counterpart market
People used believe software never break
Intuitively unlike mechanical part bolt lever electronic part transistor capacitor software stay unless problem hardware change storage content data path
Software age rust deform crack
There environmental constraint software operate long hardware processor run operate
Furthermore software shape color material mass
It seen touched physical existence crucial system functionality
Without proven wrong optimistic people would think software run correctly correct forever
A series tragedy chaos caused software prof wrong
These event always place history
Tragedies Therac machine year caused software able detect race condition alert u dangerous abandon old mechanical safety control surrender life completely software controlled safety mechanism
Software make decision unreliable human being
The British destroyer Sheffield sunk radar system identified incoming missile friendly
The defense system matured point mistaken rising moon incoming missile fire descending space junk etc also example misidentified incoming missile defense system
Software also small unnoticeable error drift culminate disaster
On February Golf War chopping error missed second precision every second accumulating hour made Patriot missile fail intercept scud missile
life lost
Fixing problem may necessarily make software reliable
On contrary new serious problem may arise
In changing three line code signaling program contains million line code local telephone system California along Eastern seaboard came stop
Once perfectly working software may also break running environment change
After success Ariane rocket maiden flight Ariane ended flame design defect control software unveiled faster horizontal drifting speed new rocket
There much scary story tell
This make u wondering whether software reliable whether use software embedded application
You hardly ruin clothes embedded software washing machine issue erroneous command chance happy ATM machine miscalculates money airplane heart radiation therapy machine software error easily claim people life
With processor software permeating safety critical embedded world reliability software simply matter life death
Are embedding potential disaster embed software system
According ANSI Software Reliability defined probability software operation specified period time specified environment
Although Software Reliability defined probabilistic function come notion time must note different traditional Hardware Reliability Software Reliability direct function time
Electronic mechanical part may become old wear time usage software rust life cycle
Software change time unless intentionally changed upgraded
Software Reliability important attribute software quality together functionality usability performance serviceability capability installability maintainability documentation
Software Reliability hard achieve complexity software tends high
While system high degree complexity including software hard reach certain level reliability system developer tend push complexity software layer rapid growth system size ease upgrading software
For example large aircraft one million source line software air traffic control system contain one two million line upcoming international Space Station two million line ten million line ground support software several major defense system five million source line software
While complexity software inversely related software reliability directly related important factor software quality especially functionality capability etc
Emphasizing feature tend add complexity software
Software failure may due error ambiguity oversight misinterpretation specification software supposed satisfy carelessness incompetence writing code inadequate testing incorrect unexpected usage software unforeseen problem
While tempting draw analogy Software Reliability Hardware Reliability software hardware basic difference make different failure mechanism
Hardware fault mostly software fault harder visualize classify detect correct
Design fault closely related fuzzy human factor design process solid understanding
In hardware design fault may also exist physical fault usually dominate
In software hardly find strict corresponding counterpart manufacturing hardware manufacturing process simple action uploading software module place count
Therefore quality software change uploaded storage start running
Trying achieve higher reliability simply duplicating software module work design fault masked voting
A partial list distinct characteristic software compared hardware listed Over time hardware exhibit failure characteristic shown Figure known bathtub curve

Software reliability however show characteristic similar hardware
A possible curve shown Figure projected software reliability ax
There two major difference hardware software curve
One difference last phase software increasing failure rate hardware
In phase software approaching obsolescence motivation upgrade change software
Therefore failure rate change
The second difference phase software experience drastic increase failure rate time upgrade made
The failure rate level gradually partly defect found fixed upgrade
The upgrade Figure imply feature upgrade upgrade reliability
For feature upgrade complexity software likely increased since functionality software enhanced
Even bug fix may reason software failure bug fix induces defect software
For reliability upgrade possible incur drop software failure rate goal upgrade enhancing software reliability redesign reimplementation module using better engineering approach method
A proof found result Ballista project robustness testing software Components
Figure show testing result fifteen POSIX compliant operating system
From graph see QNX robustness failure rate increase upgrade
But SunOS IRIX Digital UNIX robustness failure rate drop version number go

As many model many emerging none model capture satisfying amount complexity software constraint assumption made quantifying process
Therefore single model used situation
No model complete even representative
One model may work well set certain software may completely track kind problem
Most software model contain following part assumption factor mathematical function relates reliability factor
The mathematical function usually higher order exponential logarithmic
Software modeling technique divided two subcategories prediction modeling estimation modeling
Both kind modeling technique based observing accumulating failure data analyzing statistical inference
The major difference two model shown Table
Representative prediction model include Musa Execution Time Model Putnam Model
Rome Laboratory model etc
Using prediction model software reliability predicted early development phase enhancement initiated improve reliability
Representative estimation model include exponential distribution model Weibull distribution model Thompson Chelson model etc
Exponential model Weibull distribution model usually named classical fault rate estimation model Thompson Chelson model belong Bayesian fault rate estimation model
The field matured point software model applied practical situation give meaningful result second one model best situation
Because complexity software model extra assumption
Only limited factor put consideration
Most software reliability model ignore software development process focus result observed fault failure
By complexity reduced abstraction achieved however model tend specialize applied portion situation certain class problem
We carefully choose right model suit specific case
Furthermore modeling result blindly believed applied

In ability computer system cope error execution cope erroneous input
Robustness encompass many area computer science
Formal technique essential showing robustness since type testing involves invalid unexpected input
Alternatively used test robustness
Various commercial product perform robustness testing software analysis
In general building robust system encompass every point possible failure difficult vast quantity possible input input combination
Since input input combination would require much time test developer run case exhaustively
Instead developer try generalize case
For example imagine inputting
Some selected input might consist negative number zero positive number
When using number test software way developer generalizes set real three number
This efficient manageable method prone failure
Generalizing test case example one technique deal failure due invalid user input
Systems generally may also fail due reason well disconnecting network
Regardless complex system still handle error encountered gracefully
There many example successful system
Some robust system evolvable easily adapted new situation
Programs software tool focused specific task thus generalized flexible
However observation system demonstrate adaptation environment
One way biological system adapt environment use redundancy
Many organ redundant human
The one example
generally need one kidney second kidney allows room failure
This principle may taken apply software challenge
When applying principle redundancy computer science blindly adding code suggested
Blindly adding code introduces error make system complex render harder understand
Code provide reinforcement already existing code unwanted
The new code must instead posse equivalent function broken another providing function replace
To new code must know accommodate failure point
This mean need added system
But system add logic increase size becomes complex
Thus making redundant system system also becomes complex developer must consider balancing redundancy complexity
Currently computer science practice focus building robust system
Rather tend focus
One main reason focus robustness today hard general way
Robust programming style programming focus handling unexpected termination unexpected action
It requires code handle termination action gracefully displaying accurate unambiguous
These error message allow user easily debug program
When building software programmer assumes user break code
The programmer also assumes written code may fail work incorrectly
The programmer assumes user try incorrect bogus malformed input
As consequence programmer return user unambiguous intuitive error message require looking error code
The error message try accurate possible without misleading user problem fixed ease
Users gain access data structure
This information hidden user user accidentally modify introduce bug code
When correctly built user use without finding loophole modify interface
The interface already correctly implemented user need make modification
The user therefore focus solely code
Very often code modified may introduce possibility impossible case occurs
Impossible case therefore assumed highly unlikely instead
The developer think handle case highly unlikely implement handling accordingly
Robust machine learning typically refers robustness machine learning algorithm
For machine learning algorithm considered robust either testing error consistent training error performance stable adding noise dataset
Robust network design study network design face variable uncertain demand
In sense robustness network design broad like robustness software design vast possibility change input

A arrangement row column possibly complex structure
Tables widely used
Tables appear print medium handwritten note computer software architectural ornamentation traffic sign many place
The precise convention terminology describing table vary depending context
Further table differ significantly variety structure flexibility notation representation use
In book technical article table typically presented apart main text numbered captioned
A table consists ordered arrangement
This simplified description basic kind table
Certain consideration follow simplified description The element table may grouped segmented arranged many different way even nested
Additionally table may include header ancillary feature
The following illustrates simple table three column seven row
The first row counted used display column name
This called header row
The concept also part basic terminology
Any simple table represented table data value ordered
A common example table
In table cell body table value cell relates value beginning column
header row structure complex table
This combination value header row row lack better term header column column lack better term related unique cell table Tables described wide narrow format
As communication tool table allows form information unlimited number different social scientific context
It provides familiar way convey information might otherwise obvious readily understood
For example following diagram two alternate representation information presented side side
On left NFPA standard example value indicated right simple table displaying value along additional information
Both representation convey essentially information tabular representation arguably comprehensible someone familiar NFPA standard
The tabular representation may however ideal every circumstance example space limitation safety reason
There several specific situation table routinely used matter custom formal convention
Modern software application give user ability generate format edit table tabular data wide variety us example Tables us software development specification implementation
Usage software specification encompass ad hoc inclusion simple textual document use tabular specification methodology example include SCR Statestep
Proponents tabular technique among prominent emphasize understandability well quality cost advantage format allowing systematic inspection corresponding shortcoming experienced graphical notation cited motivating development least two tabular approach
At programming level software may implemented using construct generally represented understood tabular whether store data perhaps earlier result example determining flow program execution response various event input
Database system often store data structure called table column data field row represent data record
In medieval covered piece cloth count money
archaic term English institution accounted money owed
Thus table stack coin concrete realization

Facts dimension form core business intelligence effort
These table contain basic data used conduct detailed analysis derive business value
In article take look development use fact dimension business intelligence
Fact table contain data corresponding particular business process
Each row represents single event associated process contains measurement data associated event
For example retail organization might fact table related customer purchase customer service telephone call product return
The customer purchase table would likely contain information amount purchase discount applied sale tax paid
The information contained within fact table typically numeric data often data easily manipulated particularly summing together many thousand row
For example retailer described may wish pull profit report particular store product line customer segment
The retailer retrieving information fact table relates transaction meeting specific criterion adding row together
When designing fact table developer must pay careful attention grain table level detail contained within table
The developer designing purchase fact table retail organization described would need decide example whether grain table customer transaction individual item purchase
In case individual item purchase grain customer transaction would generate multiple fact table entry corresponding item purchased
The choice grain fundamental decision made design process significant impact business intelligence effort road
Dimensions describe object involved business intelligence effort
While fact correspond event dimension correspond people item object
In retail scenario used example discussed purchase return call fact
On hand customer employee item store dimension contained dimension table
Dimension table contain detail instance object
For example item dimension table would contain record item sold store
It might include information cost item supplier color size similar data
Fact table dimension table related
Again returning retail model fact table customer transaction would likely contain reference item dimension table entry corresponds table record describing item purchased
There error
Please try
Thank signing

learn share knowledge build career
What concept Computer Science think made better programmer
My degree Mechanical Engineering ended programmer I bit lacking basic
There standard CS concept I learnt recently given much deeper understanding I specifically Obviously list little short moment I hoping suggestion As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look blog post Steve Yegge formerly Amazon Google It go detail five important concept developer required know You definitely understand notation estimation algorithm used important compare two algorithm given estimation build estimation simple algorithm
I find little funny looking subject find wikipedia academic D Anyway go particular order Some concept helped development intellect code These whole domain discrete math serious introduction required CS Although often directed Perl hacker I think programmer would benefit clear presentation real code especially
I would say nowadays understanding Object Orientated Programming must even need use day day
From I would also say understanding common pattern also help
I see several good CS concept identified little talk Math
I suggest look
It wide range useful problem starting logical proof help write condition code
Graph theory combinatorics also help complex problem resolution algorithm optimization
While subject math linear algebra typically prerequisite advance computer graphic class
I find graph applied algorithm like depth first breath first search shortest path etc useful
Object orientation also really common concept
Rule
Software mean something
If unclear meaning spend time talking user understand
Algorithms Data Structures two side coin
Algorithm depends data structure data structure depends algorithm
Unlearn bubble sort quickly possible
Seriously
All modern language Java Python etc
collection class implement better sort bubble sort
There absolutely circumstance ever use bubble sort anything
You looking collection class includes sort method
Better looking algorithm avoids sorting entirely
You must learn several language
Programming language Java Python etc
Shell language
Database language SQL Presentation language HTML CSS Other data representation language XML JSON You must learn several data structure
Sequences list tuples file Hierarchical like XML HTML document well basic file system Relational like database file system hard soft link thrown Maps Indexes Associative Arrays including Hash Maps Tree Maps Sets Plus algorithmic complexity analysis
Sometimes called Big O
Why bubble sort bad quicksort log
covered detail I highlight couple For I got lot following course varsity Things I wish I done varsity I overstate importance logic programming
You said Mechanical Engineering must know much mathematics make life easier
powerful tool
Probably important thing I learned university
Logic like heavy artillery programmer lot complex problem well le complex one become much simpler put organized logical form
It like Linear Algebra Mechanical Engineers
I think good understanding compiler work good know
Aho classic book concept used creating compiler
The title Compilers Principles Techniques Tools
Its nickname Dragon Book
In order really understand book understanding formal language
Hopcroft good book Introduction Automata Theory Languages Computation
Alot good response mentioned already I wanted add subset important covered far
After year professional Software development I find I regularly use following concept school If support Garbage Collection memory allocation cleanup critical would added list
I upvote Discrete math
Computer science abstraction
learning think like Mathematician helpful
I also wanted add said language
Learning bunch TYPES language important
Not compiled v scripting
But functional ML Lisp Haskell logical Prolog object oriented Java Smalltalk imperative C Pascal FORTRAN even
The programming paradigm know easier pick new language hot new language come along
Some OS concept good book Edition Andrew Tanenbaum Basic knowledge Computer network good book OOPS concept Finite autometa A programming language I learnt C first Algorithms complexity sort search tree linked list stack queue good book Well worm open
I started Electrical Engineering
Keeping track data like Arnold Kindergarden Cop
It total chaos
It must controlled
How keep data fewest location fewest duplication information
How keep data light easily accessible
How control data growth integrity
This User access data keeping track
Most UIs designed developer
Thus UIs unfortunately parallel database design
Users care data design
They simply want want
They want get easily
Usually demand great separation data design User Interface
Learn separate engineering
Many language boil format
Many processor make work fast
Parallel computer around decade
They desktop time
With event cloud computing massive parallel processing manditory also preferable
It incredibly powerful
There lot job potential parallel developer
This help make lot logic
Many IFblock condition sit business rule table
To change logic change information table
recoding
recompiling
Keep thing separate code
It make easier others make update future
It also somewhat parallel MVC framework
PJ Try get understanding level programming
From lowest level assembly highest level
Take recursion example easy feature Try learn assembly create program use recursion assembly
Algorithms
Learning use programming language descent way something learn go It virtually impossible invent widely used Algorithms One really least aware ca done problem
For example one simply ca write program expect considered good matter fine code
To sum take look No need master know going As recent graduate computer science degree I recommend following As mentioned various post Big O notation OO Design Data structure Algorithms remember exact title book I used update remember Operating Systems NP Problems It clearly good understanding programming good guiding principle like following established pattern practice
If look SOA DDD ultimately fall back form OOP concept
I would recommend get good OOP book alos pick rich language like C Java begin PHP ruby guy please vote I giving example begin provide answer suggestion
If understand book everything else built easily foundation
If trouble concept book may software developer computer scientist
I going tell specific concept study would instead recommend lot light reading across wide range topic
Do worry getting understanding subject read point important able recognize problem looking studying actually faced
In word ok know solve combinatorics problem long know enough look combinatorics need see many way arrange set object pick subset
Wikipedia pretty good resource sort browsing especially skimming begin
An even better one especially find Wikipedia academic inaccessible
This interestingly enough original wiki invented Ward Cunningham
Strive
I stole image website linked I think essential understand basic theory behind without difficult even see problem debugging live server sunday morning
Semaphores critical section event
No bubble sort quicksort
It bubble sort average O quicksort O n
I would say important stuff Then Go specific language related stuff
I hope helpful
I would start quote tool hammer treat everything like nail
Abraham Maslow The important principle IMO know many different programing paradigm language inform well tool disposal
Any problem solved almost language choose full blown mainstream language huge default library small specialized language like AutoHotKey
The first job programmer determine use according specification problem
Some concept provide better approach topic whatever main goal may sophistication obfuscation performance portability maintance small code size
Otherwise finish like programmer desperately try something language specialized problem could trivial solve different programming context
This advice go along today tendency project take web application example may involve several language single application like C JS CSS XPath SQL XML HMTL RegExp even different programming paradigm instance C introduced recently concept functional programming paradigm lambda
So basic thing I think something everyone learn
Or least properly use homogeneous vector
It helpful creating like inverse kinematics robot calculating moment lot stuff
I fully understand linear algebra read one best course I ever taken even though teacher bad
Since machine multiple core CPU GPU becoming standard I would say include multiple thread multiple machine
It critical understand distributed processing
Sorry link really provide lot help

I wondering could fact table key belong dim table
However fact table seems contain dim data
The reason I came question I looking package us dim table fact table pull data manipulate dump fact table
But I trying find dependency fact table DSV table dialog box I added fact table I clicked related table none And claim fact table get data dim table
Correct I wrong
Does Fact table column contain dimension key constrained foreign key
I assume SSAS us foreign key identify related table case would detect table
You add related table manually
Another possibility Fact table contains dimension internally denormalized form
Rather dimension table key dimension member data stored string form Fact table
If case create dimension column Fact table
Is fact table table named query
By posting answer agree

Adding column existing fact table seems like fairly simple task
It also often legitimate business requirement
For example organization want investigate utility installing new expensive credit card facility decision maker would probably need able analyze payment type sale fact
To provided information exists OnLine Transaction Processing OLTP Production database one would simply need add payment type dimension PaymentTypeKey column fact table
This schema change fairly simple case many system data warehouse OLTP database solution need deployable able update table fill new column data directly OLTP source one statement
Likewise due differential nature ETL update even added new look fed new column newest row column filled
It also often unacceptable entirely truncate fact table ETL log causing rerun entirely fact table huge would clog server
The following method provides solution tacked existing fact ETL flow
To learn create basic fact ETL flow check earlier article matter
Assuming already set view OLTP database reflect table data warehouse basic step follows The first three point scope article covered detail
It worth noting step used conditional split setup come handy many situation basically equivalent logic IF statement ETL format
The following figure show new module tacked old existing fact table ETL What Steps never run column already fed
To set type solution follow step Create Execute SQL task test
This task run check query like This give Boolean value assign package variable direct flow package
The result set set follows Once done drag another Execute SQL task used creation staging table
However start drag output new task double click arrow open property
From change Evaluation operation Constraint Expression use following expression forget change Multiple constraint value Logical OR implies ETL take either output You configure Execute SQL task create staging table I like use IF NOT EXISTS statement ensure script run table exist
This ensure ETL stopped easily moment rerun without error
Here script The next task Data Flow Task
The source selects key fact primary key new column key view OLTP database The lookup task find PaymentTypeKey PaymentTypeID always surrogate key often preferred denormalized data warehouse
The Lookup task setup select PaymentTypeKey PaymentTypeID DimPaymentType Connection screen join PaymentTypeID Columns screen follows The last step OLE DB Source insert lookup output staging output following mapping
You must first run CREATE script temporary staging table able set mapping UI
Also order run package important change ValidateExternalMetadata value OLE DB Source task False
This allows package run even table yet exists normal created previous step The final task create another Execute SQL task run update fact table using staging table reference
It simple Execute SQL task data warehouse run following query After query run fact table new column dataflow look something similar screenshot left
You join old Data Flow Task finish
To drag output Update Fact Table task Original Data Flow Task
Next need click conditional Check column seeded task drag second output directly Original Data Flow Task edit property test ColumnIsSeeded variable direct old Data Flow Task value greater zero
If correctly output task Original Data Flow Task become dotted signifies flow package follow either one path
Note old package multiple starting task envelope Sequence Container kick entire sequence instead merely Original Data Flow Task This solution provides way safely updating new column added existing fact table
The conditional check allows flow package update column existing data move old data flow task data already populated
With mind new branch data flow logically run
Once successfully run ETL delete disable step run Original Data Flow Task
For BI documentation consider tool document SQL Server instance database object SSIS package SSAS cube SSRS report Tableau server site SharePoint Server farm

There unary operation The output value always true regardless input value p The output value never true always false regardless input value p one p output value remains The truth table logical identity operator follows one typically value produce value operand false value operand true
The truth table also written follows There possible two Here extended truth table giving definition possible truth function two Boolean variable P Q The four combination input value p q read row table
The output function p q combination read row table
The following table oriented column rather row
There four column rather four row display four combination p q input
T T F F T F T F There row key one row binary function two binary variable p q
For example row Key value solely T column denoted unique combination row value operation F three remaining column p q
The output row thus F F T F key Logical operator also visualized using
two typically value two produce value operand true
The truth table also written follows In ordinary language term true conjunction true
For assignment logical value conjunction false
It also said otherwise
two typically value two produce value least one operand true
The truth table also written follows Stated English otherwise
Logical implication associated two typically value two produce value first operand true second operand false value otherwise
The truth table associated logical implication symbolized rarely follows The truth table associated material conditional symbolized follows It may also useful note equivalent
also known biconditional two typically value two produce value operand false operand true
The truth table also written follows So p EQ q true p q true false false different truth value
two typically value two produce value one operand true
The truth table also written follows For two proposition also written p q
The two typically value two produce value operand true
In word produce value least one operand false
The truth table also written follows It frequently useful express logical operation compound operation operation built composed operation
Many composition possible depending operation taken basic primitive operation taken composite derivative
In case logical NAND clearly expressible compound NOT AND
The negation conjunction disjunction negation tabulated follows The two typically value two produce value operand false
In word produce value least one operand true
also known inventor
The truth table also written follows The negation disjunction conjunction negation tabulated follows Inspection tabular derivation NAND NOR assignment logical value functional argument produce identical pattern functional value
Thus first second expression pair logically equivalent may substituted context pertain solely logical value
This equivalence one
Truth table used prove many
For example consider following truth table This demonstrates fact
Here truth table give definition commonly used For binary operator condensed form truth table also used row heading column heading specify operand table cell specify result
For example us condensed truth table notation This notation useful especially operation commutative although one additionally specify row first operand column second operand
This condensed notation particularly useful discussing extension logic significantly cut combinatoric explosion number row otherwise needed
It also provides quickly recognizable characteristic shape distribution value table assist reader grasping rule quickly
Truth table also used specify function
For LUT truth table value row tabular format completely specifying boolean function LUT
By representing boolean value truth table value efficiently encoded value
For example integer encode truth table LUT input
When using integer representation truth table output value LUT obtained calculating bit index based input value LUT case LUT output value th bit integer
For example evaluate output value LUT given boolean input value bit index truth table output value computed follows th input true let else let
Then th bit binary representation truth table LUT output value
Truth table simple straightforward way encode boolean function however given size number input increase suitable function large number input
Other representation memory efficient text equation
In digital electronics computer science field applied logic engineering mathematics truth table used reduce basic boolean operation simple correlation input output without use code
For example binary addition represented truth table This truth table read left right Note table describe logic operation necessary implement operation rather simply specifies function input output value
With respect result example may arithmetically viewed modulo binary addition logically equivalent exclusive disjunction binary logic operation
In case used simple input output
However number type value one input increase size truth table increase
For instance addition operation one need two operand A B
Each one two value zero one
The number combination two value four
So result four possible output C If one use base size would increase nine possible output
The first addition example called
A carry previous operation provided input next adder
Thus truth table eight row would needed describe logic Irving Anellis done research show appears earliest logician devise truth table matrix

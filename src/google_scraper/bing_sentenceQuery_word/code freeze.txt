I curious community considers acceptable use term Code Freeze situation stop development except testing fixing bug
We finishing third final sprint followed Code freeze week testing
It big release component development transcended sprint
Historically even though call Code Freeze still commit code fix bug
Every release I try correct manager calling Feature Freeze pretty obvious going find bug commit code fix soon start heavy testing
But still persist calling Code Freeze
Sometimes still known bug declare Code Freeze
The Wikipedia definition seems agree I suspect calling situation Code Freeze sort willful provide false confidence stake holder
Or pretending Code Freeze situation according Scrum every sprint shippable piece software expectation following Scrum
So must call Scrum expects instead really
Am I analyzing
I find unhealthy ignoring reality situation either give calling something fix root problem
Has anybody else similar experience Code Freezes
Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise
We use term Feature Complete
All feature coded functional heading test pas confirm bug
If bug find fix retest
After satisfied result Code Complete
Am I analyzing
Yes
Well probably
Realistically thinking twice making code change freeze
Bugs pas severity test fix requires change codebase invalidates testing done
If yeah deluding
But gon na fix bug freezing code kinda pointless build ship
Ultimately matter understand meant label label
One big happy
I think actually correct interpretation
A feature freeze would halt introducing new feature feature currently development could continue completion could schedule refactoring work remove technical debt without generating new feature
A code freeze brings halt new development including refactoring new code allowed fix bug found QA
The latter seems team
Some people get adaptive agile engineering methodology like scrum may realise gotten
The reason agile engineering releasing customer whatever usable gradually build usability feature
Therefore scrummers least scrum master project required dynamic scrum modularise modularise good enough granularise project
You granularise module right size provide specification change within module managed within module
If module due dependence module unable satisfy enable broadcast version team could continue albeit le expected feature next general product release
A code freeze code freeze
If code freeze experiencing frequent thawing delay scrum master product architect communicating job properly
Perhaps point trying impress acquiesce management using industry fad called
Or management need hire architect scrum master able design granularise project within skill team well expectation customer technological constraint project
I think management element scrum master realise crucial good architect even scrum environment refuse hire one
A good architect able listen work team invaluable scrumming process constantly adapt architecture changing granularity expectation
I also think management element scrum master belongs spectrum programming universe due bad experience longer development cycle like waterfall therefore think scrum meant produce product within month therefore meticulous investigation effect really necessary
They sit wet finger air come great sprint
If team experiencing frequent thawing code freeze guy might need whole project rethink strategy see cause due refusal define module contract fit granularity module
Or guy defining module contract feature stuck module could currently rarefied enable team module continue
Do guy UML strategy aid discovering projected feature project release allows see effect stranded module see module need focus reach desired product release level
Are attending scrum sprint picture UML show advanced delayed bumping along happily otherwise blindly
Or scrum master would say room yea nay hmm module seems important without actually clear picture strandable module relation product release
A product release achieved progressive freezing module
As soon module completed product test done ensure module satisfies contract module say version
Even though work progress module project whole depend
The strategy minimise number module whose contract need thawed product release tested product release scale feature
If progressive modular freezing help development team either product complex management number iteration achieve proper release modular architecture strategy need serious rethinking
Yeah overthought
Yeah misnomer
If code would touch fix
That exactly situation code freeze
Yes requirement freeze integration break
It point stop including new feature next release valuable side thing
But probably call prerelease
What happen always releasable version system version control company pick one ship
Lean name code freeze waste
In comment mentioned word
That tell may using Scrum Agile methodology
In Scrum hardly anything Flexibility risk identification mitigation term engineering continuous integration matter lot Scrum
Given team code continuously integrated
As result may thing like freeze
You releasable product end sprint
It tested continuously already got bug report fixed already
Well theory
However good scrum team far theory scrum mainly principle
There many rule
I personally wo split many hair terminology intention behind term
Most certainly term used identify stage SDLC organization
Speaking strictly per Scrum bug fix phase
In case dedicating one sprint fix bug term mean feature backlog included sprint bug fix
This easily handled sprint planning meeting team even worry terminology
Even better even go beyond Product Owner
I worked project waterfall feature freeze AND code freeze
Feature freeze mean beginning bugfix period
Also new branch created new version could implement feature
point company start work new version
No new feature implemented bug fixed
Code freeze come QA think product releasable condition
know severe bug
Before final test cycle code freeze announced remember test cycle might take week
If test succeeds becomes released product
If fails new bug fixed
These checkins supervised architect manager risk every line practically documented
Then testcycle started
Summary After feature freeze check bugfixes
After code freeze check exceptional case
While Code Freeze may clouded meaning mentioned aptly Feature Freeze considering individual DOES place larger integrated deployment another entity responsible packaging deploying multiple software release various team
Code Freeze give time make sure environment lined package accounted
Code Freeze also mean nothing show stopping change getting
Everything else would handled next maintenance release
In perfect world scripted testing would completed point would time allowed deployment last fix retest
I yet see happen
The business tester test even deployment Code Freeze becomes signal step effort log everything sitting
In case signal START testing
Really Code Freeze business speak Here Tygers
code freeze repo locked hopefully bug fixed intended fixed tester whole nother round testing branching building production
outstanding bug scheduled iteration lead breathing neck closed deemed noncritical pushed back iteration
yes really frozen

Around time year many company institute code freeze put stop new deploys certain period time often wait holiday retail rush team back full force office
While new feature may going customer time mean meaningful work happening engineering team
This time full planning roadmapping setting team success coming year
It also fruitful time personal experimentation existing system example In natural world winter time rest resetting
And work world productivity Slack notification taking time year slow reflect good thing well
So whether code freeze reality workplace take time December think goal skill want learn change want make codebase broader work life
While sky limit seven suggestion get started Maybe mean learning new language curious perhaps
Set sight build sample project
Or keep mind sharp count toward holiday check complete challenging coding puzzle variety skill level
When new year begin ready apply newfound knowledge
There many organization need computer science professional willing share inspirational story teach mentor
Take December think might want volunteer time next year
You need expert service
Check organization working improve accessibility technology
If looking contribute open source project explore suggested project helpful guideline making first PR
Round team get creative
Hacking something outside codebase building prototype together great way build camaraderie learn get excited new product possibility
Take time team share appreciation thing accomplished together make New Year resolution year come
For example set intention work toward blameless
Or ensure voice even quiet one heard meeting
Add code coverage linting job CircleCI build
Check
Can workplace host coming year
Many group especially newer one hard time finding meeting space financial resource
If room consider hosting sponsoring local engineering meetup
You helping community making connection usually pizza
Take time make needed change existing infrastructure hit ground running new year

Currently code freeze SVN turn commit hook reject commits frozen branch

Is possible something similar Git

prevent push remote branch
If would make change private hosted GitHub repo
Yes use remote prevent anyone accessing branch want protect
I personally familiar GitHub though
Hopefully someone come along answer soon
By posting answer agree

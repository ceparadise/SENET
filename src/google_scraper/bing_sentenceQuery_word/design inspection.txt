Stack Inspection security mechanism introduced JVM deal running code originating location different level trust
This question aim finding simple description functionality
So How stack inspection work
See From paper
The stack inspection algorithm used current Java system thought generalization following model In model principal
Likewise privilege available This model resembles stack inspection system used internally Netscape Navigator
In model every stack frame labeled principal frame executing code part virtual machine library otherwise contains privilege flag may set system class chooses privilege explicitly stating want something dangerous
An untrusted class set privilege flag
When stack frame exit privilege flag automatically disappears
All procedure perform dangerous operation accessing file system network first apply stack inspection algorithm decide whether access allowed
The stack inspection algorithmsearches frame stack sequence newest oldest
The search terminates allowing access upon finding stack frame privilege flag
The search also terminates forbidding access throwing exception upon finding untrusted stack frame could never gotten privilege flag

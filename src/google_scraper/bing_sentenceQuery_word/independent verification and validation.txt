Independent verification validation IV V involves V V done third party organization involved development product
Thus product software get examined third party
The main check performed whether user requirement met along side ensuring product structurally sound built required specification
IV V help find discrepancy product quality specification helping product developer build product meet user requirement
IV V also ensures developer adhering regulation budget
For software product IV V organization may perform review source code examine associated product documentation analyze associated algorithm static verification
It also performs dynamic verification different testing method integration testing ensure software unit module meshed one tested properly work together
Functional testing done ensure functionality meet user requirement
In addition system testing carried entire software hardware system make sure working per user requirement acceptance

independent procedure used together checking product service system meet fulfills intended purpose
These critical component
The word verification validation sometimes preceded independent indicating verification validation performed disinterested third party
Independent verification validation abbreviated
In practice usage term varies
Sometimes even used interchangeably
standard adopted defines follows edition Verification intended check product service system portion thereof set thereof meet set design specification
In development phase verification procedure involve performing special test model simulate portion entirety product service system performing review analysis modeling result
In phase verification procedure involve regularly repeating test devised specifically ensure product service system continues meet initial design requirement specification regulation time progress
It process used evaluate whether product service system complies regulation condition imposed start development phase
Verification development production
This often internal process
Validation intended ensure product service system portion thereof set thereof result product service system portion thereof set thereof meet operational need user
For new development flow verification flow validation procedure may involve modeling either flow using simulation predict fault gap might lead invalid incomplete verification development product service system portion thereof set thereof
A set validation requirement defined user specification regulation may used basis qualifying development flow verification flow product service system portion thereof set thereof
Additional validation procedure also include designed specifically ensure modification made existing qualified development flow verification flow effect producing product service system portion thereof set thereof meet initial design requirement specification regulation validation help keep flow qualified
It process establishing evidence provides high degree assurance product service system accomplishes intended requirement
This often involves acceptance fitness purpose end user product stakeholder
This often external process
It sometimes said validation expressed query Are building right thing
verification Are building right
Building right thing refers back user need building right check specification correctly implemented system
In context required written requirement well formal procedure protocol determining compliance
It entirely possible product pass verified fails validated
This happen say product built per specification specification fail address user need
Verification machinery equipment usually consists design qualification DQ installation qualification IQ operational qualification OQ performance qualification PQ
DQ may performed vendor user confirming review testing equipment meet written acquisition specification
If relevant document manual provided vendor later need thoroughly performed user work industrial regulatory environment
Otherwise process IQ OQ PQ task validation
The typical example case could loss absence vendor documentation legacy equipment DIY assembly car computer etc
therefore user endeavour acquire DQ document beforehand
Each template DQ IQ OQ PQ usually found internet respectively whereas DIY qualification assisted either vendor training course material tutorial published guidance book series acquisition bundled site qualification service
This kind DIY approach also applicable qualification software computer operating system manufacturing process
The important critical task last step activity generating archiving qualification report auditing purpose regulatory compliance mandatory
Qualification venue dependent particular item shock sensitive require balancing need conducted object relocated
The full scale equipment qualification even time dependent consumables used
filter spring requiring hence necessary specified due time lapse
also conducted replacement part coupling another device installing new restructuring computer affect especially shared library necessary
In situation specification restructuring proposal appended qualification document whether genuine
Torres Hyman discussed suitability part clinical use provided guideline equipment user select appropriate substitute capable avoid adverse effect
In case genuine demanded regulatory requirement need conducted assembly
Instead asset recycled purpose
When qualification conducted standard endorsed third party standard accredited company particular division process called certification
Currently coverage certification accredited organization limited scheme requires fair amount effort get popularized
Validation work generally categorized following function The tested attribute validation task may include limited These term generally apply broadly across industry institution
In addition may specific meaning requirement specific product regulation industry

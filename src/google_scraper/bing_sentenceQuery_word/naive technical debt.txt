Technical debt concept programming reflects extra development work arises code easy implement short run used instead applying best overall solution
Technical debt commonly associated extreme programming especially context refactoring
That implies restructuring existing code refactoring required part development process
Under line thinking refactoring result poorly written code also done based evolving understanding problem best way solve problem
Technical debt may also known design debt
The term coined Ward Cunningham programmer also known developing first debt metaphor equates software development financial debt
Imagine project two potential option
One quick easy require modification future
The better design take time implement
In development releasing code quick easy approach like incurring debt come obligation interest technical debt come form extra work future
Taking time refactor equivalent paying principal
While take time short run also decrease future interest payment
Ward Cunningham describes concept follows The concept mean debt never incurred
Just leverage help company used correctly quick solution mean faster time market software development
In addition technical debt poor code
Bad code bad code technical debt result work good programmer unrealistic project constraint

Technical debt classified one three way
These include naïve technical debt unavoidable technical debt strategic technical debt
Naïve technical debt occurs best practice followed due unaware best design naming convention documentation guideline coding guideline
Unavoidable technical debt usually unpredictable unpreventable
It happens fault team building product
An example upgrade development tool bring newer often better way maintain custom solution
It could also occur one programmer move organization leaving behind code minimal documentation
The third final type technical debt strategic one knowingly incurred
This debt involves conscious proactive decision short term benefit
And often come time sensitivity
Is technical debt always bad thing
Despite term containing word debt always negative thing
At time quick solution mean sooner launch date benefit business
In addition technical debt poor code
Bad code simply technical debt result work high level programmer difficult project timeline constraint
Although technical debt always negative important handle debt ensure successful programming strategy
To avoid technical debt altogether follow best practice standard whether industry standard feature framework technology
It also important clearly define requirement front
Map development need wire frame design take place rather trying rework code design later process
While technical debt unavoidable effect minimized creating much supporting documentation possible sharing knowledge team member organization
Also try avoid last minute change
Last minute modification due lack time budget create issue
Proper documentation check take time
Projects evolve requirement change code become inefficient difficult manipulate
Identify issue refactor support future requirement
The longer programmer put code get added difficult becomes change

Bring Order From IT Chaos There three primary type Technical Debt Naïve technical debt common specific best practice followed due unaware best design pattern unfamiliar naming convention documentation guideline even coding guideline following abstraction development method serve one purpose
This happens frequently junior level developer even senior developer miss thing result create technical debt
My recommendation would use guideline book Clean Code Robert Martin Pragmatic Programmer Andrew Hunt David Thomas
This include several Extreme programming principle code review refactoring TDD pair programming name
Unavoidable technical debt happen due upgrade development tool bring newer often better way maintain custom solution
Also scope change requested mid development immediate cost
What adding new feature existing web site better support mobile device
This increase debt due rewriting system support multiple modality unless designed first place
In case like last example unavoidable technical debt really naïve technical debt avoided third type technical debt strategic also avoidable instead decided either intentionally unintentionally accrued
For instance skipping proper quality code practice like code review refactoring order make release certain deadline example strategic debt
Continually placing refactoring task bottom product backlog nowhere another example strategic debt
Strategic debt tackled determining actual financial cost technical debt presenting leadership order get buy

In field transaction management system abstract model describe execution transaction running system
Often operation action ordered time performed set executed together system
If order time certain operation determined system used
Examples operation requesting read operation reading writing aborting committing requesting lock locking etc
Not transaction operation type included schedule typically selected operation type data access operation included needed reason describe certain phenomenon
Schedules schedule property fundamental concept database theory
The following example schedule In example horizontal axis represents different transaction schedule The vertical axis represents time order operation
Schedule D consists three transaction
The schedule describes action transaction seen
First Reads Writes object X Commits
Then Reads Writes object Y Commits finally Reads Writes object Z Commits
This example schedule sequential overlap time action three transaction sequential transaction interleaved time
Representing schedule D table rather list convenience identifying transaction operation glance
This notation used throughout article
A common way technical literature representing schedule list Usually purpose reasoning concurrency control database operation modeled occurring point time without duration
When satisfactory start end possibly point event specified rarely
Real executed operation always duration specified respective time occurrence event within exact time beginning completion concurrency control reasoning usually precedence time whole operation without looking quite complex detail operation matter operation another operation
Furthermore many case relationship two specific operation matter specified specified pair operation
In general operation transaction schedule interleave transaction executed concurrently time order operation transaction remain unchanged implied transaction program
Since always time order operation transaction matter need specified schedule general operation rather order pair determined list operation
Also general case transaction may consist several process properly represented partial order operation rather total order
Thus general schedule partial order operation containing partial order transaction
two operation represented operation existence pair mean always schedule general case ordered pair
Such set schedule represented DAG operation node cycle allowed since cycle mean first operation cycle another second operation cycle contradicts perception
In many case graphical representation graph used demonstrate schedule
Since list operation table notation used article always represents total order operation schedule total order represented list always represented DAG
The transaction executed see example serial schedule one transaction start running transaction ended
A schedule equivalent outcome serial schedule property
In schedule E order action transaction executed D end E give result Two action said conflict conflicting pair The following set action conflicting While following set action The schedule said following two condition satisfied A schedule said schedule one serial schedule
Another definition schedule graph committed transaction considered acyclic graph defined include also uncommitted transaction cycle involving uncommitted transaction may occur without conflict serializability violation
Which serial schedule
A schedule said obeys CO also schedule property
This mean order time transaction commitment event compatible precedence partial order respective transaction induced schedule acyclic precedence graph serializability graph conflict graph
This implies also
The CO property especially effective achieving distributed system
discovered obviously mentioned
Its correct definition appears however description related technique theory partial inaccurate misleading
For extensive coverage commitment ordering source see
Two schedule said following condition satisfied A schedule said serial schedule
Note definition schedule
Notice example example discussion time
There however schedule schedule transaction performing The example since serial schedule
Since determining whether schedule little practical interest
Transactions commit transaction whose change read commit
These schedule recoverable
F recoverable commits make value read correct
Then commit
In aborted abort value A read incorrect
In case database left consistent state
If transaction abort transaction commits relied unrecoverable schedule
In example G unrecoverable read value A written committed
later aborted therefore value read wrong since committed schedule unrecoverable
Also named cascadeless
Avoids single transaction abort lead series transaction rollback
A strategy prevent cascading abort disallow transaction reading uncommitted change another transaction schedule
The following example one discussion recoverable In example although recoverable avoid cascading abort
It seen abort aborted order maintain correctness schedule already read uncommitted value written
The following recoverable schedule avoids cascading abort
Note however update A always lost since aborted
Note Schedule would serializable would committed
Cascading abort avoidance sufficient necessary schedule recoverable
A schedule strict strictness property two transaction write operation precedes operation either read write commit abort event also precedes conflicting operation
Any strict schedule cascadeless converse
Strictness allows efficient recovery database failure
The following expression illustrate hierarachical containment relationship class The illustrates clause graphically
In practice general purpose database system employ recoverable primarily strict schedule

The work involved maintaining generator clear inspection work tends complete specification start whereas change management IT work follow iterative approach defining need done
Approaches calculating schedule equally flexible
In case rigorous technique used model work calculate detailed timing
In case broad estimate made initially constant refinement information becomes available
A detailed model used perform calculation test result potential event
What resource x available February What adverse weather March

Scheduling policy set management plan scheduling consistent widely understood
On conclusion work schedule show planned actually happened important resource determining lesson learned
Outputs produced project level detailed scheduling take place
The approach scheduling depend upon nature project relation triple constraint time cost scope
Some project may delivered specific date others within limited budget using limited resource
Some project may scope work others may intend develop scope iteratively throughout life cycle often known Agile project management
Where scope work often presented work breakdown structure WBS showing major package work progressively broken individual activity
Schedule management run parallel process scope management risk management quality management
In early part project life cycle amount detailed information available limited
A schedule may restricted indicating target date major milestone
As calculated detailed description work milestone date may initially estimated using comparative parametric form estimating
Once scope management identified work required detailed model built showing work performed
Various method used model calculate start finish date component activity
Some method consider estimated time required perform piece work others allow resource productivity rate included
Traditionally schedule concentrate technical activity delivering project output
It becoming increasingly common include management activity schedule communication activity quality control activity risk response activity
In case combined complete schedule sometimes separate schedule although must mechanism monitoring dependency schedule
A programme schedule simply accumulation detail component project schedule
Within programme This variety type detail activity must collected effective manageable programme schedule
First programme must define consistent approach scheduling used across programme
This includes consistent technique estimating calculating schedule consistent software tool consistent approach summarising information inclusion programme schedule
Ideally programme schedule include milestone project schedule change management activity
In particular must include interdependency different project work
The programme schedule provides estimate timing resource usage programme must also enable decision made acceleration deceleration work within programme
Individual project focused designated target
Sometimes programme management team need divert resource one project another overall interest programme
A portfolio schedule must encompass wide range work greatly varying degree detail accuracy
Portfolio schedule must always communicated way enables stakeholder understand information derived detailed schedule speculative
An important function portfolio management team version capacity planning
Portfolio management must ensure necessary resource procured deliver portfolio
It must also avoid bottleneck conflicting demand limited resource
This mean estimating number resource required timing utilisation
The balancing phase portfolio life cycle must constantly review changing resource demand prioritise allocation limited resource
Doing effectively depend upon schedule information aggregated component project programme
Ideally portfolio support function provide scheduling expertise component project programme ensure aggregated information consistent accurate

In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

Computer science education getting something fresh look state local policymakers many starting push new measure broaden student access subject
Seventeen state District Columbia policy place allow computer science count mathematics science credit rather elective high number rise
Wisconsin Alabama Maryland adopted policy since December Idaho legislative measure awaiting final action
At least eight state process reviewing proposal similar legislative regulatory change
The amazing thing level policy change increasing diversity regional political happening said Cameron Wilson chief operating officer computer science advocacy group
These red state blue state embracing
In January Texas lawmaker approved legislation would allow student take computer science course satisfy move alarmed computing advocate say denies computer science deep root math science
Several state including Kentucky New Mexico considering similar approach
In addition large urban district getting action
The Chicago Broward County system finding way bring computer science course student school next academic year
There widespread agreement recent surge public interest around computer science education partly triggered hip marketing campaign
The nonprofit sponsored December Hour Code initiative get million student spend least one hour learning skill
According million student participated
A data point frequently cited million job computing field college computer science major fill
The group also say percent high school United States currently offer computer computer science advocate indicate best guess
We know sure really low exact number said Chris Stephenson executive director New York Computer Science Teachers Association group advocate increased access computer science education
According recent state data College Board administers Advanced Placement program single student took AP computer science test Wyoming
Just one student took exam last year Mississippi student took test Montana
Barbara Ericson director computing outreach senior research scientist Georgia Institute Technology Atlanta examined data
For instance student took exam total state Hispanic student took eight state
Fewer percent overall female three state female
Alison Derbenwick Miller vice president philanthropic arm information technology giant Oracle provides computer science curriculum school teacher called access computer science issue
In future student understanding computing computer science wo able get job job wo exist said
estimate percent job currently computing
Proponents teaching computer CSTA defines study computer algorithmic process including hardware software working behind scene broaden access high school level two decade
The interest seeing culmination lot people working really hard lot year said Derbenwick Miller
Groups Association Computer Machinery Computing Core laying foundational policy work
The NSF began investing computer science curriculum year ago part effort get computer science teacher high school
Then year ago funded list corporate donor including Google Microsoft Hadi Ali Partovi kicked campaign video featuring basketball star Chris Bosh Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg musician among celebrity explaining importance learning code
The video went viral viewed million time YouTube
The recent economic recession also turned public attention preparing student future employability
Those factor created perfect storm said Stephenson CSTA
All sudden computer science reached level public consciousness legislator started pay attention
Washington state appeared kick new round policy activity May Gov
Jay Inslee Democrat allowing student earn math science credit toward graduation taking computer science course
Several state quickly followed suit including Wisconsin Alabama Maryland according Computing Core
David Evans executive director National Science Teachers Association declined comment whether group support opposes particular policy allow computer science count math science credit
He said Schools district encouraged offer student best course prepare college workforce includes computer science course
However said proposition take computer science another core course
The January would add computer science core subject rather elective
The Broward County district Florida
Texas took different part larger piece legislation lawmaker included provision would allow existing computer science course fulfill requirement
Stephenson devoted career improving computer science education said Texas brand legislation worrisome mainly perpetuates misconception coding computer science
A coding language tool computer science course said
It like saying multiplication part tool set math learn math multiplication
Wilson adamantly legislation
It hurt computer science language said
A similar bill passed Kentucky Senate still need clear House
New Mexico also
And Tony Cárdenas introduced federal legislation December would designate programming language critical foreign language
This wildfire Stephenson said proposal
We understand trying go route
Make count math science credit
In Kentucky advocate pushed back proposed legislation part concern would reduce student option learning language
David Givens Republican state senator sponsored bill said would prefer computer science fulfill math science requirement state already stringent course requirement
It much challenge anything said
Even legislation broaden access computer science moving forward hurdle school implementation remain
First issue finding qualified teacher
Most state allow teacher certified computer science teacher said Stephenson
So either force teacher get secondary endorsement let anybody teach course
Related Blog States end dealing Ericson Georgia Tech call problem program wo train teacher state computer science certification state wo create certification program teacher training
Among teacher proficient computer science turnover problem said Ericson
They often leave classroom job industry
And student interest ca taken granted either
Surprisingly train teacher get excited go back teach ca get enough student said Derbenwick Miller

We definitely teaching computer science CS elementary school
Why
The common answer question job necessarily traditional computing programming job
Our nation current trajectory point lasting digital era need people think like software engineer network architect whether writing app solving resource distribution problem setting time
But let forget job moment
After really know economy year talking
The rationale teach CS student go well beyond career development
For kid entering school teaching CS giving thinking skill help become proactive learner citizen opposed consumer denizen world increasingly influenced manipulation digital bit
CS student new
Computing elementary school kid saw heyday Seymour Papert movement took education storm
But recent year enjoying comeback
version popular programming environment released iPad summer platform way
CS featured prominently new education offering
And team launched three course well nationwide network affiliate offer free workshop give every teacher classroom material
But decide whether teaching CS young student worth need understand computer science elementary grade really look like
It learning use keyboard mouse except purpose moving instruction block around form algorithm
And advocating safe digital literacy practice like visiting certain approved website unless website happens coding environment community student share work
The important part CS experience ability encourage support creative expression problem solving
As Seymour Papert said year ago CS giving kid opportunity engage powerful idea
The computer happens era best accessible tool purpose
Coding puzzle tutorial progression unplugged activity learning computing concept without computer onramps world student passionate powerful enough express imagination
Creativity collaboration persistence abstraction thinking skill coding build
Shouldn
Can figure creative clever way make room school schedule something important digital age student
Shouldn kid learn manipulate bit digitize problem add computing process toolbox
And important enough start teaching young age
If agree answer question yes stopping u
Many fear reading writing math instruction score suffer add one thing curriculum
But CS another subject
It serve glue interdisciplinary study mean time spend added integrated
And testing At moment influx hardware way elementary school prepare u Common Core testing
Shouldn take advantage opportunity show young student computer toy testing tool powerful mean expression enables driver creation
As PD provider know kid hesitant try something new
It u adult
We need make sure teacher administrator opportunity participate computer science professional learning build enthusiasm important subject learn integrate classroom relevant meaningful way
Just want kid learn count math class want give young student thorough background field revolutionizing every aspect world
We owe
I agree learning use many productivity editing collaborating communicating coding tool would valuable across curriculum
But early elementary student primary need literacy numeracy
For middle elementary introduction skill particularly coding engineering application age appropriate anything introductory instruction go beyond limit time
By middle school student teacher focused research collaboration writing skill allow complete core class homework
Funding another consideration
Some district particularly large one budget implement program would allow classroom teacher integrate computer skill core curriculum
But school face definite funding limitation many school small rural district also often deal added challenge spotty internet connectivity
Finding time school day enough device student continue major obstacle u many district
Finally achieving university demand deliver student writing comprehension communication mathematics skill already tall order
Throwing yet another demand mix would unrealistic many school student
Yes I read article unprepared student enter college manage demand digital age workplace
But I think make sense leave skill engineering higher mathematics global communication high school higher education
Elementary school place master basic including literacy language technology numeracy
I saying elementary student capable using even mastering code
But I believe really teaching introducing coding simply beyond scope school student able even asking lot middle school lab time class time limited
What pushing student study abstract concept developmentally ready make prepared rest century
Computer science necessary part whole educational package
However part important
All often tendency treat computer technology subject instead valuable powerful tool teach skill appropriate grade level

Methods making class session effective Ways encourage student participation class Advantages collaborative learning Examples effective laboratory practice This chapter discus several method teaching science within traditional format lecture discussion session laboratory
How help student learn science better efficiently format
Although universal best way teach experience show general principle apply American Association Advancement Science McDermott et Mazur Teach scientific way thinking
Actively involve student learning
Help student develop conceptual framework well develop problem solving skill
Promote student discussion group activity
Help student experience science varied interesting enjoyable way
Assess student understanding frequent interval throughout learning process
Evidence number discipline suggests oral presentation large group passive student contribute little real learning
In physic standard lecture help student develop conceptual understanding fundamental process electricity mechanic Arons McDermott Shaffer McDermott et
Similarly student grade large general chemistry lecture course correlate lecturing skill experience instructor Birk Foster
Despite limitation traditional lecture many institution forced offer introductory science course
Many professor teach course feel lecturing option dream could accomplish smaller class
However small growing group science faculty member developed way engage student process thinking questioning problem solving despite large class size
Strategies use introductory course biology geology described sidebar
Although many method described sidebar consistent expert know student learn see may welcomed student class
There several way help student make transition passive listener active participant learning Orzechowksi Start slowly student may much experience active learning
Introduce change beginning course rather midway
Avoid giving student impression experimenting
Biochemistry Genetics Molecular Biology Stanford University Professor Sharon Long Enrollment student One important tool I use engage student create opportunity thought active pursuit unknown class session
If I give lecture I provide common always leave blank critical part note
On board transparency I indicate unknown
I pause I talk drawing student attention hole note
If possible I ask suggested answer vote among possibility
By arranging pause lecture give student chance puzzle question preview ability work question independently
And attending class student gain important draw encourage class attendance
In teaching formal genetics I draw genetic cross first general form example Drosophila eye color inheritance test w x w w Then I put lecture completely blank Punnett square show structure provide answer
The student encounter unknown I address content line box question
Everybody consult neighbor second row anybody tell two blank top
What would genotype phenotype bottom right box
Physical Geology Arizona State University Professor Ramon Arrowsmith Enrollment student I show example geology experience occasionally include funny slide video audio clip lighten thing
I use multimedia presentation system composed vertical camera illuminated table I write place rock example book anything else I want student see
The video signal projected screen classroom
This form presentation worked well definitely improved student access material making thing visible
Along presentation system I use laser disc containing movie photograph textbook publisher
I easily switch multimedia laser disc output thus weave visual example lecture
Occasionally I show student computer file video VHS player
The student react well multimedia approach involve student I short exercise group talk
For I walk side auditorium designate even odd row
Then I say even people turn around face odd people exercise together
This generates group people
They put name onto single sheet turn
Then student work together question minute
I walk around room answering question
When time TA stand overhead projector I walk crowd I lapel mike hear collecting answer question
Then talk solution
Usually time run student turn paper
Of course get credit participation provides motivation I sure student understand concept better presented lecture
This process engages student
Of course grows student move assigned topic conversation come back fairly quickly
It bit unnerving potential loss control class student seem either like indifferent certainly quite passive lectured
Do give lecture completely
Anticipate student anxiety prepared provide support encouragement adapt expectation
Discuss approach colleague especially teaching course curriculum
When lecturing chosen necessary teaching method one way keep student engaged pause periodically ass student understanding initiate short student discussion see sidebar
Calling individual student answer question offer comment also hold student attention however student prefer feedback method anonymity
If opportunity discus question small group group offer answer remove one student spotlight
Another option student write answer index card pas card end row student seated select one answer present without disclosing whose
The literature teaching learning contains example technique maintain student attention lecture setting Eble Davis Lowman McKeachie Avoid direct repetition material textbook remains useful alternative resource
Use paradox puzzle apparent contradiction engage student
Make connection current event everyday phenomenon
Begin class something familiar important student
End class summarizing main point made
Adopt reasonable adjustable pace balance content coverage student understanding
Consider using slide video film computer simulation enhance presentation remember Students take note darkened room
The text need large enough read back room
Students need time summarize observation draw note conclusion
Pay attention delivery Maintain eye contact student part room
Step behind lecture bench feasible
Move around much distracting
Talk student blackboard
If using board avoid blocking AV projector screen
Shift mood intensity
Vary presentation technique
At beginning course discus student several strategy effectively engaging learning class
Some may listen others take note still others may try transcribe word
Some student may want tape class session
If want encourage particular form student participation make clear expectation reason student learning benefit
Whether lecture discussion section laboratory individual encounter questioning important part guiding student learning
When student ask question often seeking shortcut learning process getting right answer authority figure
However process arriving answer assessing validity answer usually important particularly student apply process next question
Both process obscured teacher simply give requested answer
Often Socratic student question another perhaps leading student often frustrating offer possible answer supporting reason assessment
In fact posing question effective teaching technique
Here tip effective use question Wait long enough indicate expect student think answering
Some student know silent professor give answer Rowe
Solicit answer volunteer selected student
Determine student confidence level listen answer
Solicit alternative answer elaboration provide material comparison contrast assessment
Solicit additional response student leading question observation
Direct ensuing discussion comparison evaluation extension offered answer rather simple validation refutation right wrong answer
Pose second question continue exploration
Biochemistry Genetics Molecular Biology Stanford University Professor Sharon Long Enrollment student Even demonstration work large class us everyday object student recognize especially something student find use
My favorite example use telephone cord demonstrate supercoiling DNA
The phone cord intrinsic helicity DNA though usually phone cord left handed whereas DNA often discussed right handed B form
Who experience coiled headset cord telephone show supercoils twist around
This present student chance play home convince direction handedness supercoils depends direction original helix whether cord underwound overwound headset replaced constraining end
Students learn important principle understanding nucleic acid handy practical tip let predict easiest way get kink phone cord
They get chance test understanding making prediction one hope active scientific learning
A professor question build confidence rather induce fear
One technique encourage student propose several different answer question
The student encouraged step outside answer begin develop skill necessary ass answer
Some question seek fact simply measure student recall others demand higher reasoning skill elaborating explaining concept comparing contrasting several possibility speculating outcome speculating cause effect
The type question asked response given student initial answer crucial type reasoning process student encouraged use
Several aspect question formulate reasoning knowledge tested encouraged deal dialogue testing
Chapters contain information question part assessment testing grading
Demonstrations effective illustrating concept class result passive learning without careful attention engaging student
They provoke student think especially helpful demonstration surprise challenge assumption illustrates otherwise abstract concept mechanism
Demonstrations use everyday object especially effective require little preparation part faculty see sidebar
Students interest peaked asked make prediction vote probable outcome
There numerous resource available help faculty design conduct demonstration
Many science education periodical contain one demonstration issue
The Demonstrations column Favorite Demonstration column two many example
The American Chemical Society University Wisconsin Press published excellent book chemical demonstration Shakhashiri Summerlin Ealy Summerlin et
Similar volume physic demonstration published American Association Physics Teachers Freier Anderson Berry
You consider number issue planning demonstration What concept want demonstration illustrate
Which many demonstration selected topic generate greatest enhancement student learning
Where class would effective
What prior knowledge reviewed demonstration
What design would effective given material hand target audience
Which step demonstration procedure carried ahead time
What question appropriate motivate direct student observation thought process demonstration
What question used test stretch student understanding new concept
If classroom lecture hall large consider whether student back able see demonstration
Look videotaping demonstration projecting image larger screen student see
Small group discussion section often used course complement lecture
In course small enrollment substitute lecture lecture discussion format used class period
The main distinction lecture discussion level student participation expected whole continuum exists
Discussions student answer instructor question student address one another instructor mainly guide discussion toward important point
In case discussion session productive student expected prepare advance
Focused discussion effective way many student develop conceptual framework learn problem solving skill try idea student instructor
The give take technical discussion also sharpens critical quantitative thinking skill
Classes student must participate discussion force go beyond merely plugging number formula memorizing term
They must learn explain word thinking
Students motivated prepare class expected participate actively
However discussion le predictable presentation time consuming require skill teacher
To lead effective discussion teacher must good facilitator ensuring key point covered monitoring group dynamic
Guidance needed keep discussion becoming disorganized irrelevant
Some student like may function effectively class much time devoted student discussion
Some may take point view paid hear expert teacher
For student useful review benefit format contrast lecture whose purpose transmit information
Sensitivity personality cultural linguistic gender difference may affect student participation discussion also important especially participation graded
When student spontaneously engage discussion may unprepared may reluctant speak assertive
Some may comfortable making comparison absolute statement others may comfortable narrative description quantitative analysis
You might try various strategy engage student meaningful discussion posing question measure different level understanding knowledge application analysis comprehension see
Probably best overall advice bold flexible willing adjust strategy fit character class
If want experiment using discussion class thing consider Decide goal class discussion
What want student get class session
Concepts
Problem solving skill
skill
The ability make connection discipline technology
Broader perspective
Keep mind goal may change progress material quarter semester
Explain student discussion structured
Will discussion involve whole class student work smaller group
Make clear expect coming class session read chapter think question end chapter seriously try first five problem etc
Let student see take attendance
Students come class may studying
If want student discus question concept small group explain student group form
Do allow student dominate discussion
Some student naturally respond quickly must encouraged let others chance
Be sure student participate acceptable level
In extreme case may speak outside class aggressive excessively reticent student
Look opportunity student bring class illustrating important point day topic
This effective way stimulate discussion
Be willing adjust need student take advantage strength teacher
Watch sign student need le guidance
Are main point coming getting resolved
Do need summarizing moderating
Collaborative learning umbrella term variety educational approach involving joint intellectual effort student student teacher together Goodsell et
Cooperative learning form collaborative learning instructional technique student work group achieve common goal contribute individually accountable way Stover et
The interaction take different form study group discussion group project group class group role leader timekeeper technician spokesperson forth assigned rotated Although cooperative learning used effectively elementary middle high school number year discussed Johnson Johnson Slavin study done demonstrate effectiveness college classroom
Nevertheless growing number practitioner assessing effectiveness Treisman Fullilove Johnson et Smith et Caprio Posner Markstein Cooper Watson Marshall
While many advocate collaborative learning quick point advantage also sensitive perceived problem
Cooper example point coverage lack control class student carry weight group need considered embarking collaborative learning
In addition evaluation group work requires careful consideration see
It hard imagine learning science learning science without laboratory field work
Experimentation underlies scientific knowledge understanding
Laboratories wonderful setting teaching learning science
They provide student opportunity think discus solve real problem
Developing teaching effective laboratory requires much skill creativity hard work proposing executing research project
Despite importance experimentation science introductory lab fail convey excitement discovery majority student
They generally give introductory science lab low mark often describing boring waste time
What wrong
It clear many introductory laboratory program suffering neglect
Typically student work way list instruction trying reproduce expected result wondering get right answer
While approach little science common practice efficient
Laboratories costly time consuming predictable cookbook lab allow department offer lab course large number student
Improving undergraduate laboratory instruction become priority many institution driven part exciting program developed wide range institution
Some lab encourage critical quantitative thinking emphasize demonstration principle development lab technique help student deepen understanding fundamental concept Hake
Where possible lab coincident lecture discussion
Before begin develop laboratory program important think goal
Here number possibility Develop intuition deepen understanding concept
Apply concept learned class new situation
Experience basic phenomenon
Develop critical quantitative thinking
Develop experimental data analysis skill
Learn use scientific apparatus
Learn estimate statistical error recognize systematic error
Develop reporting skill written oral
Practice collaborative problem solving
Exercise curiosity creativity designing procedure test hypothesis
Better appreciate role experimentation science
Test important law rule
Developing effective laboratory requires appropriate space equipment extraordinary effort department creative teacher
Still invested innovative introductory laboratory program report encouraging result better understanding material much positive student attitude toward lab faculty participation lab Wilson
Many science department implemented innovative laboratory program introductory course
We encourage consult organization publication listed Appendices
Education session professional society meeting another opportunity get good idea lab discipline
Some faculty member given lecturing large Animal Behavior Laboratory Princeton University Professor James Gould Enrollment approximately student section A major goal course teach student science collect initial observation formulate testable hypothesis perform test refine overhaul original hypothesis devise new test
Each lab two week long equipment animal available entire time
All material student could plausibly need stored shelf easy immediate access
In first hour discus lab possible hypothesis look material hand
Each group formulates initial plan obtains approval plan conduct experiment
The flexible lab utilize stimulus
In one lab student asked determine feature prey toad responds
Although begin live cricket worm encouraged use computer library virtual cricket toad
Students given instruction making new prey model modifying existing one test toad response different feature
The library includes variation shape motion color size plus variety cricket chirp call
In general student quickly discover virtual cricket work almost well real provide data since toad never fill
A simple statistical program computer help minimize drudgery data analysis enabling student concentrate experimental design result rather tedious computation
A number lab course make use modified stimulus
Labs using strategy deal mate recognition cricket fish competitor recognition fish predator recognition chick fish imprinting duckling color change lizard hemispheric dominance human
Cooperative Learning Laboratory Students two laboratory section chemistry course nonscience major worked group three two experiment acid base buffer
The experiment devised using modified jigsaw technique student group assigned particular part lesson unit responsible helping member group learn material
The week prior laboratory student given list objective preparatory work divided three part
Students decided divide responsibility preparatory laboratory task informed score exam would averaged member group would receive grade
Two control section laboratory conducted traditional manner student working independently
All four group student part lecture class significant difference age gender balance previous number chemistry class
Although control section overall GPA higher cooperative learning section versus student cooperative section higher overall score test
The author conclude use cooperative learning laboratory positive effect student achievement
Smith et class meeting favor supervised collaborative learning laboratory setting
Such workshop method devised teaching physic Laws chemistry Lisensky et mathematics
Although feasible many institution idea developed course translate reasonably well course lab associated course Thornton press
Laboratories enriched computer make data acquisition analysis easier much faster thus allowing student think result improved experiment
Computers also used element experiment simulate response vary stimulus
Computers offer convenience flexibility safety laboratory completely replace student interaction natural world
Laboratory teaching method vary widely certainly substitute instructor circulating among student answering asking question pointing subtle detail possible application generally guiding student learning
Although student work informally pair group many lab faculty formally introduced cooperative learning lab see sidebar
Some instructor rely lab handout give cookbook instruction pose carefully constructed sequence question help student design experiment illustrate important concept Hake
One advantage handout designer closely control student lab Moog Farrell
The challenge design student must think creative
In unstructured lab challenge prevent student getting stranded discouraged
Easy access faculty member teaching assistant essential type lab
Once decided goal laboratory familiar innovative idea field ready ask following question How others operated program
Seek colleague department institution may implemented laboratory program similar one considering learn experience
How much time energy willing invest
Buying new equipment tinkering lab probably improve lab much required implement substantial change
Changing way student learn involves rethinking way lab taught writing new lab handout setting training program teaching assistant perhaps designing new experiment
What support
Solicit interest support departmental colleague teaching assistant
Are departmental institutional administration supportive project willing accept risk
Determine likely provide needed resource
Are prepared go still get mediocre student evaluation
Helping Teaching Assistants Teach Laboratory All teaching assistant perform laboratory exercise student determine operational analytical difficulty test instructional note procedure
Teachers discus usual student question misconception idea directing student learning
Teachers review procedure circulating among student group ensure group get attention
Groups visited early help get started
Each group visited several time least midway lab discus preliminary result interpretation toward end lab review outcome interpretation
Teachers review student notebook report meet discus difficulty misconception
Discussions grading comment might made important procedure influence student performance attitude subsequent exercise
The various method student report lab work different pedagogical objective
The formal written report teach student communicate work journal style student sometimes sacrifice content appearance
Keeping lab notebook graded teach student keep record experiment may develop good writing presentation skill
Oral report motivate student understand work well enough explain others take time give student practice writing
Oral report also motivate student keep good notebook especially consult presentation
In choosing important aspect student lab experience consider student might report work future
Many benefit carefully planned laboratory exercise realized instructional staff well prepared teach
Often primary lab instruction come graduate undergraduate teaching assistant faculty member involved designing lab
Time must invested training teaching staff focusing first mastery lab experiment method instruction
It fine art guide student without either simply giving answer seeming obstinately obscure
Teaching assistant taught way difficulty adapting innovative laboratory program suggestion help guide transition
A good part success course depends group spirit whole team instructor teaching assistant
Many group meet weekly perhaps informal structured way teaching assistant provide feedback instructor well learn effective way teach next laboratory experiment see sidebar
The responsibility preparing teaching assistant largely dependent setting
While many faculty member institution responsible preparing teaching assistant task handled basis program large number graduate student
Many professional society publication topic see
The American Association Higher Education another excellent source information
Their publication Lambert Tice provides numerous example teaching assistant training program wide array discipline
Effective science teaching requires creativity imagination innovation
In light concern American science literacy scientist educator struggled teach discipline effectively
provides undergraduate science educator path understanding student accommodating individual difference helping grasp method wonder science
What impact teaching style
How I plan course curriculum
How I make lecture class laboratory effective
How I tell student thinking
Why understand
This handbook provides productive approach question
Written scientist also educator handbook offer suggestion greater impact classroom provides resource research

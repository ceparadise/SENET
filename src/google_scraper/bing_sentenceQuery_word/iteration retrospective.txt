An explanation iteration used algorithm programming Iteration programming mean repeating step
This often called loop
Algorithms consist instruction carried performed one another
Sometimes algorithm need repeat certain step told stop particular met
For example simple algorithm eating breakfast cereal might consist step This make designing algorithm quicker simpler need include lot unnecessary step

When designing program may instruction need repeating
This known iteration implemented programming using FOR WHILE statement
An plan set designed solve problem
There three basic building block construct use designing algorithm Algorithms used help design perform particular task
You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
An explanation iteration used algorithm programming Algorithms consist step carried performed one another
Sometimes algorithm need repeat certain step told stop particular met
For example simple algorithm eating breakfast cereal might consist step The algorithm repeat step cereal milk eaten
This make designing algorithm quicker simpler include lot unnecessary step
Once algorithm designed perfected must translated code computer read
We create program algorithm
Algorithms consist step
Programs consist statement
A statement single instruction word single step
Iteration implemented programming using statement
In programming iteration often referred looping program iterates loop earlier step

learn share knowledge build career
The past week I learning iterators
I still understand main difference iterating link list traversing one
I know traversing mean go visiting every element link list iterating basically thing different iterate everything standard library
mean walking element data structure
Historically computer science special form recursion additional stack space needed word
This form computationally exactly equivalent colloquially know namely finite loop loop fixed lower upper bound
Now make iteration especially well suited compared general recursion traversing linear data structure
Note work container
general graph need remember already visited node
using defined recursively term adjacent node rather via concept iterators
It context term used applied container
In summary every traversal iteration every iteration data structure traversal
However worth noting many people make distinction use term interchangeably
In particular usage Gerald Sussman fame
But seemingly data structure tree linearised purpose iteration applying thus traversed stack
Note I made definition fit mental model I going
Iteration discrete traversal may may
So traverse range allowable volume analog volume knob speaker iterate
But iteration type traversal
So every iteration traversal every traversal iteration
AFAIK synonymous
What make think difference
I feel traverse sometimes used indicate internal structure exploited
You traverse tree going parentnodes childnodes traverse list following next pointer
An array hand iterate
You element work one one
I would call agent action
Actually often confuses people refer something something related numerical method converging towards mathematical point via iteration
On hand even I use word interchangeably
You container concept
At minimum order something need know least whether neighbor get
A iterator basically give functionality traverse datastructure visiting every element
I would call synonym
There I know programming
Some datastructures information allows
For example stack able traverse though element access top stack

Iteration context computer programming process wherein set instruction structure repeated sequence specified number time condition met
When first set instruction executed called iteration
When sequence instruction executed repeated manner called loop
Iteration repetition process computer program usually done help loop
An example iteration programming language follows Consider database table containing student record
Each record contains following field If one want copy student record database print best way retrieve record iterate loop record
It executed using loop statement shown int first name last name table In example iterator starting first student record last student record

At regular interval team reflects become effective tune adjusts behavior accordingly
Manifesto The regular meeting member discus result review practice identify way improve
At end iteration Agile team apply many team use gather iteration retrospective team member discus practice identify way improve
Timeboxed hour le retrospective seek uncover working well team better next time
Each retrospective yield quantitative qualitative insight
The quantitative review gather evaluates metric team using measure performance
The qualitative part discus team practice specific challenge occurred last iteration two
When issue identified root cause analysis performed potential corrective action discussed improvement entered
The iteration retrospective used Agile team reflect completed derive new idea improve process
This help instill concept relentless pillar SAFe individual team
And help ensure every iteration yield small improvement team process
The whole team participates retrospective facilitating applying tool process data collection
The team conduct retrospective two part As organization move closer implementing Agile team robust list improvement opportunity including limited responsible preserving protecting time team need focus cultivating skill addition delivering new feature
The great time create opportunity team advance skill level new domain
There several popular technique eliciting subjective feedback success iteration also see The last conventional method Scrum Master simply put three sheet paper labeled What Went Well What Didn Do Better Next Time facilitates open brainstorming session
It conducted fairly easily making accomplishment challenge visible illustrated Figure
Teams may choose rotate responsibility facilitating retrospective

In last post I explained agile software development methodology work completed sprint
Although sprint meeting every week helpful important team member meeting clearly review key information factor contributed successful completion task deterrent successful program completion
This exactly agile sprint retrospective
In blog post going examine agile sprint retrospective important
Sprint retrospective meeting help agile team stay track project development process
It held end current sprint start following sprint
Retrospectives attended team member project manager note taker facilitator
The facilitator act like neutral person facilitate lead meeting team able make important decision end meeting
Derby Larsen According Mahnic Zabkar retrospective main topic discussion size code product backlog item total number product backlog item completed total number product backlog item pending
Unlike Scrum meeting fifteen minute long Sutherland Schwaber claim retrospective four hour long Hossain Babar Paik
Due length meeting participation multiple onshore offshore member often difficult find reliable form communication
Hence meeting sometimes held synchronous format video call time held asynchronous format posting result Wikis
Hossain Babar Paik After sprint retrospective team I realized important
The agile sprint retrospective important help increasing efficiency agile allowing team ensure continuous progress
After team first sprint retrospective concluded manner split task effective planning next phase
The identification hindrance allowed team function effectively following sprint
How retrospective help team increase efficiency
Firstly retrospective help team determine amount work required accomplish goal develop timeline project
Secondly meeting facilitator help team generate discussion help determining done increase functionality team
Such discussion also help determining root cause problem occurred identifying factor contributed successful completion task
Finally retrospective help team celebrate past achievement encouraged future project
Kerth From experience I realized couple important thing retrospective worth noting
When retrospective I noted sometimes team member identify different issue root cause problem
It important team come agreement root cause way team rectify issue
But agreeing something mean team one vote impose idea majority minority
Coming agreement long process involves lot interaction discussing various issue conducting multiple vote
During retrospective happened team concludes everything worked perfectly sprint nothing need changed
Although absolutely fine team consider perfect team able improve identify part improve
When lack discussion like question helped team identify feature improve upon Is client happy way interacted
Did provide update constantly
Was lack coordination team
Did different team member request information client multiple time
Did plan properly
Did correctly set sprint goal
Did overestimate underestimate task
What difficult issue deal time
How avoid issue next time
These question usually stir discussion required retrospective
If one opinion everyone agrees opinion team fail identify obstacle success
Our team able improve every sprint increase efficiency able correctly identify deterrent
As long retrospective held properly keeping point mind I believe help increasing efficiency team great extent
The last thing note Kerth suggests every group different dynamic important design retrospective manner fit team culture dynamic
Hence suggestion I made might work team
So make sure design team retrospective suit unique team
In post tried understand agile sprint retrospective contributes efficiency agile
We realized agile retrospective meeting extremely important retrospect team learn important lesson future
Although retrospective might difficult design retrospective designed properly suit team team able see great result
In next post I going explain agile task list important

act repeating process either generate unbounded sequence outcome aim approaching desired goal target result
Each repetition process also called iteration result one iteration used starting point next iteration
In context iteration along related technique standard building block
mathematics may refer process
applying function repeatedly using output one iteration input next
Iteration apparently simple function produce complex behaviour difficult problem example see
Another use iteration mathematics used produce approximate numerical solution certain mathematical problem
example iterative method
Manual calculation number square root common use example
computing technique marking block statement within defined number repetition
That block statement said computer scientist might also refer block statement iteration
The pseudocode example iteration line code bracket loop iterate three time It permissible often necessary use value part program outside bracketed block statement perform desired function
In example line code using value increment
In school iteration used describe process teaching guiding student repeat experiment assessment project accurate result found student mastered technical skill
This idea found old adage Practice make perfect
In particular iterative defined process learning development involves cyclical inquiry enabling multiple opportunity people revisit idea critically reflect implication
Unlike computing math educational iteration predetermined instead task repeated success according external criterion often test achieved
In algorithmic situation recursion iteration employed effect
The primary difference recursion employed solution without prior knowledge many time action repeat successful iteration requires foreknowledge
Some type programming language known designed set block statement explicit repetition loop
Instead programming language exclusively use
Rather call block code repeated number time executing code block instead divide work done number separate piece code block executes individual piece
Each piece work divided repeatedly amount work small possibly point algorithm work quickly
The algorithm revers reassembles piece complete whole
The classic example recursion algorithm
The Merge Sort recursive algorithm first repeatedly divide list consecutive pair pair ordered consecutive pair pair forth element list desired order
The code example recursive algorithm programming language output result pseudocode previous heading
In object ensures iteration executed way range different data structure saving time effort later coding attempt
An abstraction accepts reject data iteration

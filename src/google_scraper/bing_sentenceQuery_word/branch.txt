I wondering computer science branch mathematics
No one ever adequately described
It seems
My second question book computer rigorous take axiomatic approach
Basically putting computer science programming rigorous foundation
I think first question answered eloquently others
I like add group reference second question
As math major CS minor I taught CS people Dijkstra school I would consider rigorously grounded mathematics Knuth
To get taste Dijkstra idea read article letter glorious idiosyncrasy favourite mine
An excellent introduction view programming computer science This foundational book really CS book first year university
Kaldewaij Dijkstra academic grandchild way
I believe following book may similar content could certainly considered branch mathematics
This branch computer science deal computer computer program mathematical object
Theoretical computer scientist could described computer scientist know little computer
However people say computer science usually include many thing would considered mathematics instance computer architecture specific programming language etc
Let C M set thing considered computer science mathematics respectively
If I understand correctly question Is M
If case question well posed neither C M well defined
How draw line math math without ambiguity
No reasonable answer given try treat set
However I believe certain aspect set shared others pointed
logic proof etc
I would say computer science branch mathematics
Donald Knuth famous computer scientist also considered great mathematician
He wrote series book called extremely rigorous mathematical
To make position clear since apparently controversial
Almost computer science answering two question What turing machine
How make turing machine X
A Turing machine abstract mathematical object question Turing machine capability mathematical nature
Now implemented Turing machine various way
PC detail particular implementation subject computer engineering computer science
It uncommon hear idea along line computer science computer programming without practical constraint theoretical computer science computer science without physical constraint mathematics computer science without finiteness constraint Each subject chain seen limiting case one parameter describing constraint resource limit go zero infinity
From point view mathematics degenerate special case theoretical computer science degenerate case computer science That depends whether consider software engineering computer science
I
The theory computation absolutely branch mathematics one difficult
Forget P NP ca even decide understood average minute two
On hand software engineering applied psychology economically build maintain complex software system given limit human intellect
If create Cayley graph group mathematics
What simulate orbit element group
Where mathematical model cease become mathematics
The natural number still behave way accurate model model used person
The sole purpose computer model mathematical object
The goal computer science construct describe model mathematical object even implementation computer way get result program compute
Algorithms ironically aspect computer science influence field mathematics
A simple case determine algorithm time complexity great actually implement still contribution computer science
On hand show two construction equivalent say clique decision problem factoring large number algorithm one thing lower time complexity must algorithm complexity second property
The question much information avoid obtaining one problem information solution exhaustion another
The time complexity algorithm invariant measure give feel hard problem
When two problem equally hard complex time consuming harder one solved using easier one solution without solution processed algorithm close difference complexity total algorithm
Studying different problem time complexity see genericness problem relates difficulty solved general
It also useful see example logic gate implemented solution game Minesweeper show property system look feel like
However thing also deceptive Initially might look like must check every permutation type object find subset permutation satisfy property indicates hard problem permutation grow quickly say size set permutation
However might second stage saturation independent information permutation tried longer contribute solution problem else determined amount information collected
Like reaching minimum point determine circle
There also theorem characterize type data viable member search space
This sort Mandelbrot program use eye see solution problem look like find way enforce characteristic show hold possible solution
A good example projective plane incidence diagram finite plane enough symmetry decide whether even large group arrangement form partial match viable piece incidence diagram leading algorithm require order magnitude beyond age universe determine projective plane given order even managed find second stage require massive amount searching weaving data together year actual runtime come conclusion
The picture I painting success story reflection real lack understanding incidence diagram projective plane like rule govern
An understood object algorithm examination one understand difference object pure noise strategy work well enough make guess nature solution
So projective plane incidence diagram pure noise
Looking incidence diagram small plane look distinctive suggestion typical plane look nothing like known plane
But fact overall pattern induced binary matrix shown hold plane general mean possible starting characterization greatly reduce problem search space
Hence characterizing search space hard problem lot like characterizing object invariant property
I would say problem relate complexity much way position element infinite set natural number relates set density
But algorithm
What program
I refer Wikipedia type theory Calculus Constructions specific implementation computation
For full coverage Practical Foundations Programming Languages Harper
For treatment domain theory I refer Domain Theory Logical Form Abramsky
One answer given domain theory Scott domain logical structure program space property inference like lattice subalgebras normal subalgebras abstract algebra need head abstract algebra containing forked flawed crystal converging space would formulate recursive definition program logic find fixed point endomorphisms order structure equivalent continuous map onto topological space derived unfinished lattice
The Stone dual executed program operating according logic locale whose point algorithm
In actual domain theory generalize bit Scott domain form cartesian closed category meaning enough like topos program represented Scott domain arbitrarily expressive
All buried version Lawvere famous statement Galois connection syntax semantics
More specifically theory model theory logic space computation performs denotational semantics
On hand relationship construction object proof theorem
I know exact reasoning think proposition converted existential simultaneously holding property aggregate describe kind object whose definition thing simultaneously hold property prove proposition true prove type occupied actual thing
The correspondence proof proof equivalent program construction generally intuitionistic logic correspond typed lambda calculus thence cartesian closed category agrees logician topos category set intuitionistic logic
This affect language design quite bit provides mean computing proof instead algorithm
It basis philosophy Homotopy Type Theory Univalent Foundations Program well much intuitionistic logic computer science
There degree interplay linear logic
noncommutative geometry computer science
Physics Topology Logic Computation A Rosetta Stone Baez Stay show replace cartesian closed category closed monoidal category generalize isomorphism get sort wonderful quantum behavior semantics
Stone duality feature study Chu space model linear logic ultimately pretty similar Domain theory effect
So applies intuitionistic logic classical logic
It turn certain implementation continuation passing like Scheme well introducing control flow passing procedural programming purely functional language like Haskell amount making nonconstructive logic
The thing make Haskell bothersome many say outright useless ca make program communicate outside world depend outside communication even parameter without breaking format language talk procedure IO monad else destroying logic verifies program behavior
So lesson mathematics like interactive program constructive mathematics like library
Any science whether physic computer science statistic driven forward combination engineering mathematics
I would say mathematics computer science computer science element yet mathematics
In opinion
It true us nearly every aspect mathematics
And heavily depends Logic
But question posed way different one mathematics
In mathematics normally try understand structure object try categorize
Mostly totally unnecesairy easy compute
For example Algorithm determinant n matrix given n formula highly usefull mathematics calculating nearly impossible n
So formula say lot structure matrix say nothing compute
So main work mathematician bending brain till got prove problem
You got kind problem computer science
But normally want solution fast precise perfect
It also contain part like Software engineering mathematical
Or theory behind building computer part eletrical engineering
Also need lot part mathematics various area without really needing tiny prof lemma axiom depend math
For like physic written language math
But still knowing math help
I mean could also ask chemistry part physic heavily relies
Or biology beeing part chemistry also heavily depends
But I guess lot different opinion
I always felt I bend brain differently I want solve problem computer science
And lot mathematician ca really programm
I never read The Art Computer Programming Donald Knuth often noted good
Althought quite old
For rigorous approach inspired Bourbaki may interested Alexander Stepanov Paul McJones
It work subset prof various interesting theorem
But proposition proof first two lemma proof given
The author apparently wanted work Axiomatic method seems OP interest
I say computer science branch mathematics many branch connected science field study well
Many founding contributor field mathematician
The analogy musician sport bearing person sport accomplishment necessarily person musical talent
Computer science fostered mathematical carving
Computer Science touch lot different area study Mathematics one
I would probably reword idea say Computer Science involves Mathematics
Computer Math specialized field way computer designed created focus mathematics involving Base number system focus Algorithm designed efficient use algorithm
The study Cryptology almost mathematics
I think Computer Science Mathematics whole bunch Application development mixed
I think Computer Science really Branch Engineering
Now whether Engineering branch Mathematics whether Mathematics branch Engineering entirely depend perspective definition
Because Mathematics system tool abstracted view accounting thing I would say Math branch Language tool Engineering Science
two field CS mathematics becoming increasingly intertwined especially theoretical side sharp boundary getting blurred various research program development one would expect trend continue heighten gradually long term century
possibly whole essay paper book could written subject
strong connection overlap major eg
see eg recent paper Fields medalist collaborated computer scientist
paper sort mathematical AI arising next century
figure didnt really work T CS directly per se intensely combinatorical research given new life TCS eg sunflower theorem etc
problem originally considered CS problem seems deep tie combinatorics extremal set theory
one Clay problem
word chosen mainly advisory board elite
property undecidability found mathematics
computational proof mechanic
Turing proof undecidability Godels proof share common The halting theorem Cantor theorem set powerset Goedel incompleteness theorem instance Lawvere research program combining computer experiment mathematical analysis
application proving TCS algorithmic complexity bound
theorem connect deep property one field another sometimes called bridge theorem many
highlight mined bridge theorem example another figure span divide eg study fractal
worked IBM research decade
example
expert connection math TCS also given Godel credit founding basic concept computational complexity theory letter von Neuman mused required machine find proof
evidence trend found science funding founded Phd mathematician
Of course computer science part mathematics way around
Why
Take away math computer science computer get
Nothing metal
Take away computer science math get
Math without Boolean Algebra Binary Numbers
Math still decimal number system

A instruction cause computer begin executing different instruction sequence thus deviate default behavior executing instruction order
may also refer act switching execution different instruction sequence result executing branch instruction
A branch instruction either always result branching may may cause branching depending condition
Branch instruction used implement program loop conditionals executing particular sequence instruction certain condition satisfied
Mechanically branch instruction change PC
The program counter memory address next instruction
Therefore branch cause CPU begin fetching instruction different sequence memory cell
When branch CPU program counter set jump instruction
So next instruction becomes instruction address
Therefore flow control change
When branch CPU program counter unchanged
Therefore next instruction executed instruction branch instruction
Therefore flow control unchanged
The term used referring program high level language well program written
In branch usually take form various form encapsulate instruction sequence executed condition satisfied
Unconditional branch instruction used unconditionally jump begin execution different instruction sequence
Machine level branch instruction sometimes called instruction
Machine level jump instruction typically form latter may depending condition
Usually distinct form jump often called subroutine invokations known automatically save originating address return address stack allowing single subroutine invoked multiple location code
In CPUs earlier instruction set condition flag register
The earlier instruction may instruction
It often close branch though necessarily instruction branch
The stored condition used branch
This temporary information often stored flag register may also located elsewhere
A flag register design simple slower simple computer
In fast computer flag register place bottleneck speed instruction could otherwise operate parallel several need set flag bit particular sequence
There also machine particular instruction condition may checked jump instruction
In simple computer design comparison branch execute arithmetic use power flag register branch
In fast computer design comparison branch run faster flag register branch comparison branch access register parallelism using CPU mechanism calculation
Some early simple CPU architecture still found microcontrollers may implement conditional jump rather conditional skip next instruction operation
A conditional jump call thus implemented conditional skip unconditional jump call instruction
Depending jump instruction typically shortened form word word often along informative letter extra parameter representing condition
Sometimes detail included well range jump offset size special addressing mode used locate actual effective offset
This table list machine level branch jump instruction found several architecture VAX others set signal clear signal
ARM PIC others opposite subtractive operation
This inverted function carry flag certain instruction marked part table otherwise noted
However carry additive operation handled way architecture
To achieve high performance modern processor
They consist multiple part partially process instruction feed result next stage pipeline start working next instruction program
This design expects instruction execute particular unchanging sequence
Conditional branch instruction make impossible know sequence
So conditional branch cause stall pipeline restarted different part program
Several technique improve speed reducing stall conditional branch
Historically branch prediction took statistic used result optimize code
A programmer would compile test version program run test data
The test code counted branch actually taken
The statistic test code used compiler optimize branch released code
The optimization would arrange fastest branch direction taken would always frequently taken control flow path
To permit CPUs must designed least predictable branch timing
Some CPUs even instruction set designed branch hint compiler tell CPU branch taken
The problem software branch prediction requires complex software development process
To run software hardware moved statistic electronics
Branch predictor part processor guess outcome conditional branch
Then processor logic gamble guess beginning execute expected instruction flow
An example simple hardware branch prediction scheme assume backward branch
smaller program counter taken part loop forward branch larger program counter taken leave loop
Better branch predictor developed validated statistically running simulation variety test program
Good predictor usually count outcome previous execution branch
Faster expensive computer run faster investing better branch prediction electronics
In CPU hardware branch prediction branch hint let compiler presumably superior branch prediction override hardware simplistic branch prediction
Some logic written without branch fewer branch
It often possible use instead branch
Another technique
In approach one instruction branch always executed
Therefore computer use instruction useful work whether pipeline stall
This approach historically popular computer
In family compatible CPUs complicates multicycle CPUs pipeline faster CPUs pipeline superscalar CPUs execute instruction order

In part responsible loading
It one essential stage process starting program place program memory prepares execution
Loading program involves reading content containing program instruction memory carrying required preparatory task prepare executable running
Once loading complete operating system start program passing control loaded program code
All operating system support program loading loader apart highly specialized computer system fixed set specialized program
typically loader instead code executes directly ROM
In order load operating system part specialized used
In many operating system loader permanently resident memory although operating system support may allow loader located region memory
In case operating system support virtual memory loader may actually copy content executable file memory rather may simply declare virtual memory subsystem mapping region memory allocated contain running program code content associated executable file
See
The virtual memory subsystem made aware page region memory need filled demand program execution actually hit area unfilled memory
This may mean part program code actually copied memory actually used unused code may never loaded memory
In loader
The Unix loader task include In loader function contained following Some operating system need adjust address pointer executable compensate variation address loading start
The operating system need relocating loader program always loaded location address space pointer absolute address rather offset program
Some example IBM mainframe descendant including mainframe
In descendant system privileged operating system facility called IEWFETCH internal component OS Supervisor whereas LOADER application perform many function plus Linkage Editor entirely external OS Supervisor although certainly us many Supervisor service
IEWFETCH utilizes highly specialized theoretically possible load relocate entire executable within one revolution DASD medium m maximum m average legacy rpm drive
For load module exceed track size also possible load relocate entire module without losing revolution medium
IEWFETCH also incorporates facility overlay structure facilitates running potentially large executables minimum memory model small KB version OS KB KB common
The OS always resident portion Supervisor formatted way compatible version IEWFETCH
Unlike normal executables OS nucleus scatter loaded part nucleus loaded different portion memory particular certain system table required reside initial KB table code may reside elsewhere
The system application named IEWL
IEWL main function associate load module executable program object module output say assembler compiler including automatic call library language function format may efficiently loaded IEWFETCH
There large number editing option conventional application commonly employed
The load module format includes initial text record followed immediately relocation control record text record followed instance text record relocation control record pair end module
The text record usually large relocation control record small IEWFETCH three relocation control record buffer fixed byte smaller relocation control record certainly possible byte maximum possible IEWL ensures limitation complied inserting additional relocation record required next text record necessary special case sequence record may text record relocation record control record text record
A special byte within relocation control record buffer used disabled bit spin communication area initialized unique value
The Read CCW relocation control record Program Controlled Interrupt bit set
The processor thereby notified CCW accessed channel via special exit
At point processor enters disabled bit spin loop sometimes called shortest loop world
Once byte changed initialized value processor instantaneously know reading relocation control record completed bit spin terminated relocation may proceed synchronously rotation medium relocation occurs gap within medium relocation control record next text record
If relocation text record completed NOP CCW changed TIC loading relocating proceed using next buffer
If channel encounter NOP CCW channel program terminate restarted IEWFETCH via another special IOS exit
The three buffer continuous circular queue pointing next last pointing first three buffer constantly reused loading relocating proceeds
IEWFETCH thereby load relocate load module practical size minimum possible time
another type loader load link like already loaded running program

In set stored storage location denoted word copy value variable
In assignment statement expression fundamental construct
Today commonly used notation basic operation come originally Superplan popularized followed originally popularised although many notation use
In language symbol used regarded meaning assignment value others define assignment statement meaning used expression
Assignments typically allow variable hold different value different time
However language primarily allow kind destructive reassignment might imply change state
The purpose enforce
function depend state variable produce result given set parametric input point time
Modern program language also often use similar strategy although le strict certain part order reduce complexity normally conjunction complementing methodology
An assignment operation process different value associated particular variable name time pass
The program model operates changing state using successive assignment statement
Primitives imperative programming language rely assignment
At lowest level assignment implemented using
container value
It possible put value variable later replace new one
An assignment operation modifies current state executing program
Consequently assignment dependent concept
In assignment Example Assuming numeric variable assignment mean content variable doubled execution statement
An example segment code In sample variable first declared int assigned value
Notice declaration assignment occur statement
In second line declared without assignment
In third line reassigned value
Finally assigned value
For assignment operation necessary value valid represents modifiable entity valid modifiable
In language typically one necessary declare variable prior assigning value
Any assignment change existing value
disallowed purely functional language
In assignment discouraged favor single assignment also called
Single assignment example differs assignment described article done usually variable created subsequent reassignment allowed
An evaluation expression change observable state machine produce value input
Imperative assignment introduce side effect destroying making old value unavailable substituting new one referred reason similar
Single assignment form assignment available purely functional language variable sense imperative programming language rather named constant value possibly compound nature element progressively defined
Purely functional language provide opportunity avoiding sequential one step time execution since value independent
Impure functional language provide single assignment well true assignment though true assignment typically used le frequency imperative programming language
For example Scheme single assignment true assignment used variable specialized primitive provided destructive update inside list vector string etc
In OCaml single assignment allowed variable via syntax however destructive update used element array string separate operator well field record object explicitly declared meaning capable changed initial declaration programmer
Functional programming language use single assignment include data structure var accepts multiple assignment value equal contrast Haskell dataflow variable cell data structure like list symbol vals
code considered explicit sense named variable explicitly unassigned state set exactly
In Haskell contrast unassigned variable every variable thought implicitly set value rather computational object produce value created
In programming language assignment statement return value others
In example assignment statement return assigned value allowing idiom assignment statement return value assigned
In statement return value function used control loop assigning value variable
In programming language example return value assignment undefined idiom invalid
In variable assignment operation similar assignment like assigning field array field mutable data structure usually evaluate represented
This type one possible value therefore containing information
It typically type expression evaluated purely side effect
Certain use pattern common thus often special syntax support
These primarily reduce redundancy source code also simplify compilation clarifying programmer intent easing analysis source code
The case assigned value depends previous one common many imperative language notably majority descendant provide special operator called like instead written
Beyond syntactic sugar simplifies compilation since make clear modification variable possible
A statement like called value assigned multiple variable
Chained assignment often used initialize multiple variable Not programming language support chained assignment
Chained assignment equivalent sequence assignment evaluation strategy differs language
For simple chained assignment like initializing multiple variable evaluation strategy matter target assignment connected way evaluation strategy affect result
In programming language example chained assignment supported assignment expression value
In case chain assignment implemented assignment happen
For example equivalent
In also available value class type declaring appropriate return type assignment operator
In assignment statement expression thus value
Instead chained assignment series statement multiple target single expression
The assignment executed evaluates expression assigns result leftmost target assigns result next target using new value
This essentially equivalent though actual variable produced temporary value
Some programming language since allow several variable assigned parallel syntax like simultaneously assigns
This often known introduced name sometimes called though confusing used single assignment opposite
If side assignment single variable
array structure feature called The list unpacked assigned
More interestingly swap value
In language without parallel assignment would written use temporary variable since leaf original value
Some language Go Python combine parallel assignment tuples automatic allow multiple return value single function Python example This provides alternative use returning multiple value function
This date CLU helped popularize parallel assignment generally
In C similar parallel assignment allowing multiple assignment occur within single statement writing instead
This primarily used replaced parallel assignment language Go
However code ensure perfect simultaneity since right side following code evaluated left side
In language Python assign two variable concurrently using initial value compute new b
The use equal sign assignment operator frequently criticized due conflict equal comparison equality
This result confusion novice writing code confusion even experienced programmer reading code
The use equal assignment date back language designed particularly popularized Fortran A notorious example bad idea choice equal sign denote assignment
It go back Fortran blindly copied army language designer
Why bad idea
Because overthrow century old tradition let denote comparison equality predicate either true false
But Fortran made mean assignment enforcing equality
In case operand unequal footing The left operand variable made equal right operand expression
x mean thing x
Beginning programmer sometimes confuse assignment equality mean mathematics used assignment many language
But assignment alters value variable equality testing test whether two expression value
In language single equal sign used assignment operator equality relational operator context determining meant
Other language use different symbol two operator
For example The similarity two symbol lead error programmer forgets form appropriate mistypes intended
This common programming problem language C including one famous attempt backdoor Linux kernel assignment operator also return value assigned way function return value validly nested inside expression
If intention compare two value statement instance assignment quite likely return value interpretable Boolean true case clause executed leading program behave unexpectedly
Some language processor detect situation warn programmer potential error
The two common representation copying assignment
Both form may semantically denote either assignment assignment also value depending language usage
Other possibility include left arrow keyword though rarer variant Mathematical assignment generally depicted
Some platform put expression left variable right Some language Tcl uniformly use prefix postfix syntax statement including assignment

Motives creating virus include seeking desire send political message personal amusement demonstrate vulnerability exists software simply wish explore issue
Computer virus currently cause billion dollar worth economic damage year due causing system failure wasting computer resource corrupting data increasing maintenance cost etc
In response antivirus tool developed industry cropped selling freely distributing virus protection user various
As even though currently existing antivirus software able uncover computer virus especially new one computer security researcher actively searching new way enable antivirus solution effectively detect emerging virus already become widely distributed
The term virus also commonly erroneously used refer type
Malware encompasses computer virus along many form malicious software malicious BHOs malicious software
The majority active malware threat actually trojan horse program computer worm rather computer virus

A viable computer virus must contain locates new file new disk worthwhile target infection
Secondly every computer virus must contain routine copy program search routine locates
The three main virus part Infection mechanism also called vector virus spread propagates
A virus typically search routine locates new file new disk infection
The trigger also known could activated time virus run determines event condition malicious activated delivered particular date particular time particular presence another program capacity disk exceeding limit open particular file

Email virus A virus intentionally rather accidentally us email system spread
While virus infected file may accidentally sent email virus aware email system function
They generally target specific type email system Microsoft Outlook commonly used harvest email address various source may append copy email sent may generate email message containing copy attachment
In order avoid detection user virus employ different kind
Some old virus especially platform make sure last modified date host file stay file infected virus
This approach fool antivirus software however especially maintain date file change
Some virus infect file without increasing size damaging file
They accomplish overwriting unused area executable file
These called
For example Chernobyl Virus infects file
Because file many empty gap virus length add size file
Some virus try avoid detection killing task associated antivirus software detect example
In computer operating system grow larger complex old hiding technique need updated replaced
Defending computer virus may demand file system migrate towards detailed explicit permission every kind file access
While kind antivirus software employ various technique counter stealth mechanism infection occurs recourse clean system unreliable
In Microsoft Windows operating system proprietary
This leaf antivirus software little alternative send read request Windows OS file handle request
Some virus trick antivirus software intercepting request OS
A virus hide intercepting request read infected file handling request returning uninfected version file antivirus software
The interception occur actual operating system file would handle read request
Thus antivirus software attempting detect virus either given permission read infected file read request served uninfected version file
The reliable method avoid stealth virus reboot medium known clear
Security software used check dormant operating system file
Most security software relies virus signature employ
Security software may also use database file Windows OS file security software identify altered file request Windows installation medium replace authentic version
In older version Windows file Windows OS file stored allow file overwritten would report altered system file authentic using file hash scan altered file would always guarantee finding infection
Most modern antivirus program try find inside ordinary program scanning
Unfortunately term misleading virus posse unique signature way human being
Such virus signature merely sequence byte antivirus program look known part virus
A better term would search
Different antivirus program employ different search string indeed different search method identifying virus
If virus scanner find pattern file perform check make sure found virus merely coincidental sequence innocent file notifies user file infected
The user delete case clean heal infected file
Some virus employ technique make detection mean signature difficult probably impossible
These virus modify code infection
That infected file contains different variant virus
One method evading signature detection use simple encipher encode body virus leaving encryption module static change one infection next
In case virus consists small decrypting module encrypted copy virus code
If virus encrypted different key infected file part virus remains constant decrypting module would example appended end
In case virus scanner directly detect virus using signature still detect decrypting module still make indirect detection virus possible
Since would symmetric key stored infected host entirely possible decrypt final virus probably required since rarity may reason virus scanner least flag file suspicious
An old compact way use arithmetic operation like addition subtraction use logical condition byte virus constant operation repeated decryption
It suspicious code modify code may part signature many virus definition
A simpler older approach use key encryption consisted operation parameter like incrementing decrementing bitwise rotation arithmetic negation logical NOT
Some virus employ mean encryption inside executable virus encrypted certain event virus scanner disabled update computer
This called
At said time executable decrypt virus execute hidden infecting computer sometimes disabling antivirus software
first technique posed serious virus scanner
Just like regular encrypted virus polymorphic virus infects file encrypted copy decoded module
In case polymorphic virus however decryption module also modified infection
A polymorphic virus therefore part remain identical infection making difficult detect directly using signature
Antivirus software detect decrypting virus using encrypted virus body
To enable polymorphic code virus also called mutating engine engine somewhere encrypted body
See technical detail engine operate
Some virus employ polymorphic code way constrains mutation rate virus significantly
For example virus programmed mutate slightly time programmed refrain mutating infects file computer already contains copy virus
The advantage using slow polymorphic code make difficult antivirus professional investigator obtain representative sample virus bait file infected one run typically contain identical similar sample virus
This make likely detection virus scanner unreliable instance virus may able avoid detection
To avoid detected emulation virus rewrite completely time infect new executables
Viruses utilize technique said
To enable metamorphism metamorphic engine needed
A metamorphic virus usually large complex
For example consisted line code part metamorphic engine
As software often designed security feature prevent unauthorized use system resource many virus must exploit manipulate system application software spread infect computer
strategy produce large number bug generally also produce potential hole entrance virus
In order replicate virus must permitted execute code write memory
For reason many virus attach may part legitimate program see
If user attempt launch infected program virus code may executed simultaneously
In operating system use determine program association Microsoft Windows extension may hidden user default
This make possible create file different type appears user
For example executable may created named user see therefore assumes file likely safe yet opened run executable client machine
The vast majority virus target system running
This due Microsoft large market share user
The diversity software system network limit destructive potential virus malware
operating system allow user choose variety packaging tool mean malicious code targeting system affect subset user
Many Windows user running set application enabling virus rapidly spread among Microsoft Windows system targeting exploit large number host
While Linux Unix general always natively prevented normal user making change environment without permission Windows user generally prevented making change meaning virus easily gain control entire system Windows host
This difference continued partly due widespread use account contemporary version like
In researcher created released virus
Bliss however requires user run explicitly infect program user access modify
Unlike Windows user Unix user administrator except install configure software result even user ran virus could harm operating system
The Bliss virus never became widespread remains chiefly research curiosity
Its creator later posted source code allowing researcher see worked
Many user install detect eliminate known virus computer attempt run executable file may distributed email attachment example
Some antivirus software block known malicious website attempt install malware
Antivirus software change underlying capability host transmit virus
Users must update software regularly hole
Antivirus software also need regularly updated order recognize latest
This malicious individual always creating new virus
The German Institute publishes evaluation antivirus software Windows Android
Examples Microsoft Windows software include optional Windows XP Vista Windows protection included second Tuesday month optional download case Windows XP
Additionally several capable antivirus software program available free download Internet usually restricted use
Some free program almost good commercial competitor
Common assigned listed US
example software free personal use check PC vulnerable software attempt update
alert appear press release
Ransomware virus post message user screen saying screen system remain locked unusable payment made
deception malicious individual pretend friend computer security expert benevolent individual goal convincing targeted individual reveal personal information
Other commonly used preventative measure include timely operating system update software update careful Internet browsing avoiding shady website installation trusted software
Certain browser flag site reported Google confirmed hosting malware Google
There two common method antivirus software application us detect virus described article
The first far common method virus detection using list definition
This work examining content computer memory RAM file stored fixed removable drive hard drive floppy drive USB flash drive comparing file known virus signature
Virus signature string code used identify individual virus virus antivirus designer try choose unique signature string found legitimate program
Different antivirus program use different signature identify virus
The disadvantage detection method user protected virus detected signature recent virus definition update protected new virus see
A second method find virus use based common virus behavior
This method ability detect new virus antivirus security firm yet define signature also give rise using signature
False positive disruptive especially commercial environment may lead company instructing staff use company computer system IT service checked system virus
This slow productivity regular worker
One may reduce damage done virus making regular data operating system different medium either kept unconnected system time hard drive accessible reason using different
This way data lost virus one start using backup hopefully recent
If backup session like closed becomes longer affected virus long virus infected file copied onto
Likewise operating system CD used start computer installed operating system become unusable
Backups removable medium must carefully inspected restoration
The Gammima virus example propagates via removable
Many website run antivirus software company provide free online virus scanning limited cleaning facility purpose website sell antivirus product service
Some subsidiary user upload one suspicious file scanned checked one antivirus program one operation
Additionally several capable antivirus software program available free download Internet usually restricted use
Microsoft offer optional free antivirus utility called updated part regular Windows update regime older optional malware removal tool upgraded antivirus product Windows
Some virus disable important Windows tool
An example virus CiaDoor
Many virus removed computer entering Windows networking using system tool
restore critical system file previous checkpoint
Often virus cause system hang freeze subsequent hard reboot render system restore point day corrupted
Restore point previous day work provided virus designed corrupt restore file exist previous restore point
Microsoft improved Windows later used check repair corrupted system file
Restoring earlier clean copy entire partition copy one earlier backup disk image relatively simple usually remove malware may faster disinfecting reinstalling reconfiguring operating system program scratch described restoring user preference
Reinstalling operating system another approach virus removal
It may possible recover copy essential user data booting connecting hard drive another computer booting second computer operating system taking great care infect computer executing infected program original drive
The original hard drive reformatted OS program installed original medium
Once system restored precaution must taken avoid reinfection restored
Before computer network became widespread virus spread particularly
In early day many user regularly exchanged information program floppy
Some virus spread infecting program stored disk others installed disk ensuring would run user booted computer disk usually inadvertently
Personal computer era would attempt boot first floppy one left drive
Until floppy disk fell use successful infection strategy boot sector virus common wild many year
Traditional computer virus emerged driven spread personal computer resultant increase BBS use software sharing
software sharing contributed directly spread program virus written infect popularly traded software
software equally common virus BBSs
Viruses increase chance spreading computer infecting file file system accessed computer
become common since
Most virus written scripting language Microsoft program spread throughout infecting document
Since Word Excel also available could also spread
Although virus ability send infected virus take advantage COM interface
Some old version Microsoft Word allow macro replicate additional blank line
If two macro virus simultaneously infect document combination two also appear mating two would likely detected virus unique parent
A virus may also send contact friend colleague address stored infected machine
If recipient thinking link friend trusted source follows link website virus hosted site may able infect new computer continue propagating
Viruses spread using first reported academically demonstrated
There multiple instance scripting virus wild exploiting website Samy worm

FastCabs Company Description Adapted Connolly Begg Holowczak
Business Database Systems
Harlow England

Each office FastCabs manager several taxi owner driver administrative staff
The manager responsible operation office
An owner provides one taxi FastCabs taxi allocated use number driver
The majority owner also driver
FastCabs taxi available hire public hailing taxi street must requested first phoning company request taxi given address designated day time
There two kind client namely private client business
Private client request taxi whenever one needed ad hoc basis
The detail private client collected first booking reservation made
The business client agree contract work business FastCabs
This formal contract specifies number job trip FastCabs provide fixed fee
The fee may determined single fee given number trip fixed fee per trip trip minimum number trip completed
When job come FastCabs name phone number contract number appropriate client taken
The number passenger request specific type vehicle also recorded
The address noted
Each allocated unique jobID
The nearest driver address called radio informed detail job
When job completed driver note mileage used
For private client fee charged trip also noted
If job completed reason failed job noted
FastCabs provides several type vehicle client limousine large group van group luggage passenger car
Vehicles used trip mountain equipped

So I question I stuck time
I draw relationship based business rule include multiplicity well
The question follows A movie either one star two people staring together
A star must least one movie
I gotten relationship far Star How multiplicity Movie Star relationship like
I know something along line Can I combine get multiplicity
Help appreciated
Thanks
An extract formal UML specification So one continuous segment multiplicity
In case I would use end specify special restriction separatelly
You specify le formally
Some idea This logic could implemented Movie method like addStars Star order centralize
There lot correct solution however
Maybe noticed I recommended instead
This suggestion leading much flexible solution
Lower bound restrictive used really necessary might example Child born Parent
Its value Star end would mean least Star must linked Movie process creation
I find pretty ugly
What Stars created yet system
What Movie created lineup simply unknown time creation
What Movie simply Stars
By leaving boundary create Movies Start independent
You always link later making system much flexible

define case graded ring module My question defined M
Is kind case
When ring module necessarily graded I M define e I M M see
Now question arise case defined
Is kind case graded ring module
Let give another point view multiplicity
Remember function L category right taking value additive short exact sequence continuous injective direct limit L A B C short exact L M L submodule M system directed
Our main example length function composition length module
Let recall also theory module ring polynomial
Indeed right R X R X right R distinguished endomorphism M represents right multiplication X
Similarly right R nothing right R k pairwise commuting endomorphisms acting
We return setting
Indeed R commutative Noetherian ring M module R ideal definition M
Denote M homomorphism R consists multiplying element M
This give M natural R structure notice construction need R commutative need I generated set central element R need Noetherianity say I finitely generated
Now define multiplicity
We proceed inductively fact convenient define multiplicity attached general length function
So let u choose length function L Mod R let F finitely generated R X R Noetherian commutative let F endomorphism representing action X F
Then R X case L F Ker L F otherwise
case One define R X supremum multiplicity finitely generated submodules M
In fact show length function category Mod R X
Proceeding inductively define multiplicity Mod R Mod R X Y define multiplicity R show length function course many thing check
The thing check way obtain value given definition question difficult completely trivial
If arrived answer first question clear sequence multiplicity multiplicity length function Mod R multiplicity defined follows let Mod R k multiplicity Mod R I think compatibility looking
Let finish saying material I tried briefly explain original come Northcott book Lessons Rings Modules Multiplicities Peter PhD thesis Length function module

That basic thing surprisingly difficult find concise explanation Jet multiplicity jet general came forefront advocated Feynman way QCD established theory strong interaction
It experimentally observed colliding particle formed two jet
particle debris interaction formed two jet
The parton model modeled parton incoming leading effect energy parton rest low energy
In center mass system showed two body reaction
Back John Ellis et al analysing phenomenology QCD proposed mercedes diagram one could see center mass system three jet two interacting partons plus
The model hard scattering quark may involve hard gluon partons dressed soft gluon materializes
High pt event clinched existence gluon made simple parton model history
So high pt jet materialization either primary quark gluon multiplicity jet QCD prediction
Jet multiplicity number jet
The number jet interesting depending kind event want study
Sometimes jet multiplicity part event selection
For example want select W boson decaying hadronically two quark generally look event two jet

The explains introduction Deleuze Deleuze conceived philosophy production concept characterized In magnum opus try develop metaphysics adequate contemporary mathematics metaphysics concept multiplicity replaces substance event replaces essence virtuality replaces possibility What mean Deleuze develop metaphysics concept multiplicity replaces substance
To understanding substance philosophical concept dating antiquity
In way might metaphysically problematic
What multiplicity mean
Deleuze pick concept multiplicity Riemann Bergson develops many work variety way
In general reject dialectic proposes multiplicity instead M ultiplicity must designate combination many one rather organisation belonging many need whatsoever unity order form system
The one many concept understanding make overly loose mesh distorted dialectic proceeds opposition
Deleuze Substance theory Aristotle Spinoza operates freely dyad
monism reduces variety thing world unity one
Deleuze opposes said metaphysics replaces substance multiplicity replaces one le multiple true substantive substance

Even many multiplicity even one multiplicity

Everywhere difference multiplicity difference within multiplicity replace schematic crude opposition

Instead enormous opposition one many variety multiplicity word difference
Deleuze In concept multiplicity directly related turn directly related notion desiring machine flow It category multiplicity used substantive going beyond One many beyond predicative relation One many account pure multiplicity say affirmation irreducible sort unity
Deleuze References Deleuze
capitalism schizophrenia
Minneapolis University Minnesota Press

Difference repetition
New York Columbia University Press
paraphrasing entry multiplicity ed
Adrian Parr Although Multiplicity used throughout Deleuzes work many different way context essential trait It complex refer prior unity either fragmented whole manifold expression single concept
He insists understood substantively adjectivally
As Tsapkou mention concept borrowed Riemann Bergson
From Riemann take idea situation ensemble without becoming whole
More profoundly Bergson multiplicity two mode extensive numerical intensive continuous
The first characterises space second time
The first divided without changing nature second division implies change nature
D G also link concept virtual multiplicity virtual multiplicity
This real without neccesarily embodied world
D G frequently quote Prousts adage regarding memory discussing virtual without actual ideal without abstract
Rather expressing abstract alternative possibility form something like real openess change inheres every particular situation
The virtual abstract effect change
Existence actual multiplicity state affair virtual multiplicity particular intensive movement change
The concept multiplicity make reference transcendent realm contains law existence
The virtual counterpart actual multiplicity make possible continued change even point world actuality seems rigid oppresive
multiplicity substantive
well articulated term difference repetition within flux continous change occuring difference

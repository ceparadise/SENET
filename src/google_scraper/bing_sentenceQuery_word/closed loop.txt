An animation illustrates typical component error detector controller actuator measurement device well input output signal component
The activity also allows compare animation standard block diagram see various element system represented simplified form
This medium asset adapted WISCONLINE
Unlike system controlled input adjust based system use feedback regulate particular process
A system consists measurement device error detector controller actuator
A measurement device monitor variable temperature pressure weight provides data controller respond
The error detector receives data measurement device compare data set point target value
If controller receives error signal error detector controller sends signal instructing actuator apply necessary corrective action variable match value specified set point
An oven simple example system
The objective system maintain temperature inside oven specific preset level
When set oven certain temperature oven heat reach temperature
The oven thermostat serf measurement device controller
If thermostat detects temperature oven low instruct gas burner fire electric element heat cause temperature oven rise
When correct temperature reached thermostat instructs actuator turn stop heating oven
Many automated manufacturing system utilize system ensure desired outcome achieved
Imagine facility bakes bread
Computers control entire process using sensor monitor various aspect quantity ingredient oven temperature cooling time packaging
For example sensor used weigh ingredient dough finished product also monitor temperature oven cooling unit type sensor even visually inspect product color texture
The data gathered measurement device passed computer controller regulates system loaf bread come perfectly

One three basic logic structure computer
The two logic structure
In structure program asks question answer requires action performed original question asked answer action longer required
For example program written compute weekly payroll individual employee begin computing wage one employee continue performing action loop employee wage computed program move next action
Each pas loop called
Loops constitute one basic powerful programming concept
All logic problem programming solved forming using three logic structure combined infinite number way

We use loop write program repeat action many time
The three kind loop Java loop loop loop
They equivalent expressive power
rewrite loop us one loop construct loop us one
The loop following form
The execution loop start evaluating Boolean expression
If condition evaluates body loop executed body executed execution go back loop condition
If loop condition evaluates skip loop body continue executing program following loop
The following loop compute sum number
It start initializing variable variable
We use variable accumulate sum number covered far variable used count number
The loop body execute value counter variable time execute body increase current value increase counter variable one
The loop following form
The difference loop loop loop condition executed execute body loop
That loop execution start executing loop body loop condition evaluated first time
If loop condition evaluates execution jump back beginning loop execute body
If hand loop body evaluates exit loop continue program following loop
The loop therefore executes body loop convenient situation
The loop must terminated semicolon
The following loop computes sum number
The loop following form
It convenient remember loop term corresponding loop achieves effect
The following program us loop compute sum number
Notice example separate initial statement loop condition statement using semicolon statement inside initial statement separated using comma
As see loop useful writing provides u mean initialize counter variable n loop condition control number time execute loop used increase counter
In example used counting loop knew advance many time would like execute loop body
This example show use loop performs computation result achieved
Diving number amount counting many time subtract
We therefore compute division subtracting long possible time perform subtraction count
When subtraction longer possible count result division value left remainder division
In previous class wrote game user get guess number time
We copying necessary code time
Using loop compact way
We use loop count number guess far
In addition use use indicate user guessed number correctly exit loop
In following program read sequence positive number input find maximal among
We use number indicate end input
In case use loop since want execute loop body least user enter least one number
The body loop contain statement include loop
The following program print multiplication table number
The main loop outer loop iterating loop responsible iterating row multiplication table
The inner loop iterating value print row corresponding multiplied number
Note use special character represents tabulator tab
When print character console automatically tabulates output producing nicer table
A number divisible
We check number prime checking divisible number
If divisible number number prime
The following program us loop iterate number check dive number
If divide use indicator variable mark prime
We use indicator variable loop condition exit loop soon find number
Since know check number prime write program print prime number
We using two nested loop
The outer loop iterate number inner loop one check whether current number prime
The program output prime number

So far learned basic programming command
assigning value printing way control statement executed using statement
In lesson introduce sometimes called way make computer thing similar thing
For example word document would done loop
We describe two kind Python loop lesson loop loop
A statement repeat section code long condition true
Here example Here general structure So example keep repeating loop body greater
There another kind loop Python called loop
In many situation either kind loop used one simpler another useful know use
A loop built order easily loop range number see later lesson list data
Here example loop
The general structure numerical loop Here example loop inside another loop
The statement like emergency escape loop cause immediate jump command end loop body
Here example using read line input find one say
The statement make rest loop repeat body next round usually called next iteration
Here visualized example combine

Page system set achieve desired result way checking result achieved
For example heating system might include The aim system would heat house
When turned heating would stay turned regardless whether house remained cold became hot
system able correct order meet target result
Normally sensor used look output adjust process accordingly
This called
For example considering heating system thermostat could added measure temperature room compare set target
If room became cold thermostat would turn heating temperature became hot system would turned
The effectiveness system could analysed monitoring good keeping room target temperature

No credit card required The job loop perform iteration repetition simplest construct known
The general structure loop shown
Its corresponding flowchart shown
The control flow enters loop instruction condition
This statement determines whether control enters body loop
If condition evaluates true statement within loop executed
If condition evaluates false control flow go instruction loop exited
In case control flow continue statement number greater
Once statement finished executing control flow jump back first instruction condition whole process start
To clarify Ruby example shown
Its corresponding flowchart shown

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In computer programming loop sequence continually repeated certain condition reached
Typically certain process done getting item data changing condition checked whether counter reached prescribed number
If next instruction sequence instruction return first instruction sequence repeat sequence
If condition reached next instruction fall next sequential instruction branch outside loop
A loop fundamental programming idea commonly used writing program
An one lack functioning
The result loop repeat continually operating system sens terminates program error event occurs program automatically terminate certain duration time

process involved creating maintaining resulting
Software development process writing broader sense includes involved conception desired software final manifestation software sometimes planned process
Therefore software development may include research new development prototyping modification reuse maintenance activity result software product
Software developed variety purpose three common meet specific need specific case meet perceived need set potential case personal use
scientist may write software automate mundane task
development used controlling consumer product requires development process integrated development controlled physical product
underlies application programming process often developed separately
The need better software development process given rise discipline aim apply systematic approach exemplified paradigm process software development
There many approach software project management known software development life cycle model methodology process model
The traditional version contrasted recent innovation
A also known software development methodology model life cycle framework used control process developing
A wide variety framework evolved year recognized strength weakness
There several different approach software development take structured approach developing business solution whereas others may take incremental approach software evolves developed
One system development methodology necessarily suitable use project
Each available methodology best suited specific kind project based various technical organizational project team consideration
Most methodology share combination following stage software development These stage often referred collectively software development lifecycle SDLC
Different approach software development may carry stage different order devote le time different stage
The level detail documentation produced stage software development may also vary
These stage may also carried turn waterfall based approach may repeated various cycle iteration extreme approach
The extreme approach usually involves le time spent planning documentation time spent coding development automated test
More extreme approach also promote continuous testing throughout development lifecycle well working product time
More structured based approach attempt ass majority risk develop detailed plan software coding begin avoid significant design change later stage software development lifecycle planning
There significant advantage disadvantage various methodology best approach solving problem using software often depend type problem
If problem well understood solution effectively planned ahead time waterfall based approach may work best
If hand problem unique least development team structure software solution easily envisioned extreme incremental approach may work best
The source idea software product plenteous
These idea come including potential new customer existing customer sale prospect rejected product internal software development staff creative third party
Ideas software product usually first evaluated personnel economic feasibility fit existing channel distribution possible effect existing product line required fit company marketing objective
In marketing evaluation phase cost time assumption become evaluated
A decision reached early first phase whether based detailed information generated marketing development staff project pursued
In book state chapter subchapter Students engineering learn engineering rarely exposed finance marketing
Students marketing learn marketing rarely exposed finance engineering
Most u become specialist one area
To complicate matter u meet interdisciplinary people workforce role mimic
Yet software product planning critical development success absolutely requires knowledge multiple discipline
Because software development may involve compromising going beyond required client software development project may stray le technical concern etc
These process may also cause role overlap software development
Planning objective every activity want discover thing belong project
An important task creating software program extracting
Customers typically abstract idea want end result know
Skilled experienced software engineer recognize incomplete ambiguous even contradictory requirement point
Frequently demonstrating live code may help reduce risk requirement incorrect
Although much effort put requirement phase ensure requirement complete consistent rarely case leaving software design phase influential one come minimizing effect new changing requirement
Requirements volatility challenging impact future already going development effort
Once general requirement gathered client analysis scope development determined clearly stated
This often called scope document
Certain functionality may scope project function cost result unclear requirement start development
If development done externally document considered legal document ever dispute ambiguity promised client clarified
Once requirement established design software established
This involves preliminary main module overall picture part fit together
The language operating system hardware component known time
Then detailed design created perhaps firm requirement
part process actually code project
integral important phase software development process
This part process ensures recognized soon possible
In process generally known test may developed implementation serve guide implementation correctness
internal design software purpose future maintenance enhancement done throughout development
This may also include writing external internal
The software engineering process chosen developing team determine much internal documentation necessary
model generally produce documentation model
start directly code appropriately tested approved sold otherwise distributed production environment
This may involve installation customization setting parameter customer value testing possibly extended period evaluation
Software training important software effective used correctly
enhancing software cope newly discovered requirement take substantial time effort missed requirement may force redesign software
A framework provides used
It graphical representation underlying semantics view
The purpose viewpoint view enable human engineer comprehend organize element problem solution around domain
In physically intensive system viewpoint often correspond capability responsibility within engineering organization
Most complex system specification extensive one individual fully comprehend aspect specification
Furthermore different interest given system different reason examining
A executive ask different question system would system implementer
The concept viewpoint framework therefore provide separate viewpoint specification given complex system
These viewpoint satisfy audience interest set aspect system
Associated viewpoint viewpoint language optimizes vocabulary presentation audience viewpoint
current state information provides effective mean presenting information user system
Usually model created conducting interview referred
The interview consists facilitator asking series question designed extract required information describes process
The interviewer called facilitator emphasize participant provide information
The facilitator knowledge process interest important structured methodology question asked process expert
The methodology important usually team facilitator collecting information across facility result information interviewer must fit together completed
The model developed defining either current state process case final product called snapshot model collection idea process contain resulting model
Generation process data model used determine existing process information system sound need minor modification enhancement required corrective action
The creation business model way view automate information process
Analysis used fundamentally reshape way business organization conduct operation
CASE field scientific application set software tool method development result maintainable software product
It also refers method development together automated tool used software development process
The term software engineering CASE refer used automated development computer code
The CASE function include analysis design programming
CASE tool automate method designing documenting producing structured computer code desired
Two key idea Software System Engineering CASE Typical CASE tool exist
An IDE also known provides comprehensive facility software development
An IDE normally consists IDEs designed maximize programmer productivity providing component similar
Typically IDE dedicated specific provide feature set closely match language
A used express defined consistent set rule
The rule used interpretation meaning component structure
A modeling language graphical textual
Graphical modeling language use named symbol represent concept line connect symbol represent relationship various graphical annotation represent constraint
Textual modeling language typically use standardised keywords accompanied parameter make expression
Examples graphical modelling language field software engineering Not modeling language executable using necessarily mean programmer longer needed
On contrary executable modeling language intended amplify productivity skilled programmer address difficult problem
A fundamental style generally dictated project management methodology waterfall agile
Paradigms differ concept abstraction used represent element program object function variable constraint step comprise computation assignation evaluation continuation data flow
Sometimes concept asserted paradigm utilized cooperatively system architecture design case programming paradigm scope limited internal structure particular program module
A support
For example program written purely purely contain element paradigm
Software designer programmer decide use paradigm element
In programmer think program collection interacting object program thought sequence stateless function evaluation
When programming computer system many processor allows programmer think application set concurrent process acting upon logically shared
Just different group advocate different different advocate different
Some language designed support one paradigm support programming support functional programming programming language support multiple paradigm
Many programming paradigm well known method enable
For instance pure functional programming forbids using forbids using statement
Partly reason new paradigm often regarded doctrinaire overly rigid accustomed earlier style
Avoiding certain method make easier prove theorem program correctness simply understand behavior
Examples paradigm include

There different model software development
Testing major phase developing software
It important use test plan carry different type test
The name overall process developing start finish
When starting new software project important plan developed maintained
There different theory develop test software

submitted Hi currently wrapping undeclared year general bachelor degree university interested side education discovered trying various CP course
Now either go BSD BSC go BSC get grade
Basically wondering pro con bachelor technology software development v pro con BSC
Would lead mostly outcome
Link BSD information Edit Thank response
actually really got ball moving thanks help
Post comment
I would speculate technology degree going basically limited professional world
So pick one enjoy
I would guess comp sci part going theory math based dev part practical approach programming
write etc
Also wrong subreddit question would better answered
deleted deleted I would much rather hire programmer domain knowledge learn skill already knowing know versus programmer whose education primarily field knowledge How many year professional software development experience production setting
In experience Software Engineering module managing software project software architecture
The software engineering module mostly boring unchallening pointless opinion
These generally thing one truly learn job
Academic institution often better learning academic thing
Furthermore I feel like understand core principle computer science software engineering easily learned time
Here take FWIW
Programming getting computer want
Software development evolving valuable software team
Computer science theoretical understanding various aspect computing algorithm complexity networking data storage indexing etc
CS helpful necessary professional software developer
In fact CS largely omits teaching professional development skill
For example cover concept le part typical CS program
Which better
Unfortunately I ca say
If want know everything CS
If want dive practical development perhaps SD
However decent argument could made ca really learn SD job I would take academic SD training grain salt
Perhaps important degree choice build side
I sure I representative I see person code discus rationale behind project degree would far le relevant
I taught subject list different discipline CS course
Some mandatory I think view CS course purely theoretical outdated program evaluated independently
For example I available discipline I would say practical development neglected
I sure varies school mine Santa Clara University TA year UCLA
Also much experience around year ago could somewhat date I suppose
Either way understanding department emphasis CS curriculum theory practice intentional decision
The rationale make sense always presented student
Get CS degree
Otherwise going spend rest life trying explain software development degree
This based experience
But general trend CS usually better stepping graduate degree foundation tends cover theory
It usually challenging well depending school get pretty high washout rate
The main advantage strong fundamental translate variety field work especially like research versus corporate world
The SD curriculum look like practical occupational degree
The downside would extra foundation ever want go Masters program
So may limit option road
If care going route may better path learn applied side software terminal degree
deleted Completely understand saying
Definitely better place post question
Sorry new
I going master software engineering situation I say far I class done physical coding
Mostly made dealing software process dealing client need developing
Not say done logic work
For last project analyze project source forge say make better via pseudo code explanation proof
I think want low level go computer science
It practical different domain want write software business environment go sd
Look course description class decide
But experience CS teach Can compute Out infinity algorithmic efficiency hold
Software teach engineering process applied software development
So What development process use
How measure development process using
measure meeting measuring development process using
If option leaning towards dev I might recommend accredited software engineering program
The credential probably better technical degree
Take gain salt though since I know nuance university
deleted Your mileage may vary standard disclaimer etc
etc
You learn proving algorithm instead architecting large software project
In computer science degree program learned lot algorithm proving class like
But class like teach lot thing principle software engineering API design version control etc
Classes like obviously cover lot theory stuff still implement compiler
I know every school every degree program going different idea computer scientist learn designing working large project run counter experience experience computer scientist I work
We lot large project learn lot thing development process I grant program never dealt code base large I dealing first job graduation
deleted I required software engineering course
I think first one required program since I wanted get job software engineer I took second one fulfill one degree requirement three senior computer science course
I implement interpreter programming language class large software project
It completed single person final project
We prerequisite compiler class
And wrote assembler prerequisite class fairly small project
But compiler opinion fairly large project especially time constraint one semester needed understanding started organizing writing code
The focus program theory way I think
It science degree
I agree I really like program call u demonstrate understanding actually implementing thing talk I think uncommon
Also upvote taking time respond differing experience
deleted Again standard disclaimer apply experience biggest difference academic code enterprise code enterprise code terrible
Obviously huge surge lately automated unit test test driven development whole lot place still bunch human QA running list use case looking thing seem wrong
Writing test actually covered first computer science class though severely lacking I also stupidly fully appreciate year later tried least touch
You right course project undergrad going encounter academic career anywhere near size typical production code base I think simply single semester learn topic work code relevant
Working multiple sorting algorithm single large code base would obviously add anything value experience example
But I also seen Software Development themed academic program better job preparing people work large code base computer scientist world still seem wind job well enough create production quality software regardless opinion quality
deleted Of course CS grad usually figure stuff get first job usually learned school
Like pointed experience indicate seems lot program making sure least part learn school
As much I love theory side CS want bog much teaching latest development fad trend I also want leave engineering decision people spent time type thing learning Agile TDD building strong theory background
Relative lot field computer science still quite young software development even younger
It interesting see average curriculum look like another year whether see lot school degree discipline focus software engineering theoretical computer science program etc
deleted Aye
I much share concern
I would minded replacing history foreign language literature course two CS even software development instead theory I also fan making sure STEM folk take liberal type course
It already difficult complete degree four year experience sort
You quite right tacking class already busy schedule going make thing better

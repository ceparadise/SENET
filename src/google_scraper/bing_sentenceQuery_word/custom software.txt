also known specially specific organization user
As contrasted use software package developed COTS software existing
Since custom software developed single customer accommodate customer particular preference expectation
Custom software may developed iterative process allowing nuance possible hidden risk taken account including issue mentioned original requirement specification rule never perfect
In particular first phase may involve many department including general
Large company commonly use custom software critical function including otherwise fill gap present existing software package
Often software developed COTS free software package offering required functionality became available
Custom software development often considered expensive compared solution product
This true one speaking typical challenge typical solution
However always true
In many case COTS software requires customization correctly support buyer operation
The cost delay COTS customization even add expense developing custom software
Cost consideration however decision opt custom software often includes requirement purchaser source code secure possibility future development modification installed system
Additionally COTS come upfront license cost vary enormously sometimes run million term dollar
Furthermore big software house release COTS product revamp product frequently
Thus particular customization may need upgraded compatibility every two four year
Given cost customization upgrade also turn expensive dedicated product release cycle earmarked
The decision build custom software go COTS implementation would usually rest one following factor The construction industry us custom software manage project track change report progress
Depending project software modified suit particular need project owner design team general trade contractor
For example floor plan particular project unique project available mobile device project team consume custom software
In case floor plan use
Rooms space floor plan use SVG programmable room fill color change red instance room outstanding deficiency
data used way suit unique requirement project
Custom software accommodates project team particular preference expectation making suitable construction process challenge use various platform like design develop custom software construction industry industry
Hospitals keep data patient retrieve time
This enables doctor assistant transfer detail patient network
Keeping patient blood group hospital database make search blood easy
Hospitals also use billing software especially dispensary
Schools use custom software keep admission detail student
They produce Transfer Certificates also
Some government develop special software school
school management system project implemented Education Department Government Kerala India automate system process school state
These project brings uniformity school
Billing common use custom software
Custom software used small shop super market handle generate bill
Successful technology business based custom software included list
Failures cost overrun government IT project extensively investigated UK Members Parliament official rich seam failure examine including When business considering software solution option generally creating spreadsheet often done obtaining product custom software created specifically meet need
There five main criterion involved selecting correct solution Although initial assessment option according criterion may deviate sharply reality eventual solution put practice due factor cost overrun insufficient training poor product fit reliability solution etc
These factor need take account running business industry size turnover
As decision made basis determine warrant custom development well ownership software
Custom software generally produce efficient system provide support specific need business might available solution provide greater efficiency better customer service
Given suitable approach development custom software also produce best service improvement
Businesses tailor software customer want instead choose package caters generic market
For example one printing business may want software responds shortest time whereas another printing company may focus producing best result two objective often conflict package normally sit somewhere middle whereas custom software business focus target audience
Although always suitable larger complex project spreadsheet allows le technical staff business modify software directly get result faster
Custom software even flexible spreadsheet constructed software professional implement functionality wide range business need
The main disadvantage custom software development time cost
With spreadsheet software package user get benefit quickly
With custom software business need go may take week month bigger project year
Bugs accidentally introduced software developer thorough testing iron bug may impede process cause take longer expected
However spreadsheet software package may also contain bug moreover may deployed business without formal testing bug may slip cause error
Custom software often several time cost two option normally include ongoing maintenance cost
This often make custom software infeasible smaller business
These higher cost insignificant larger business small efficiency increase relate large labour cost saving custom software offer large efficiency boost
Particularly modern cloud software hybrid model custom software possible main focus COTS software mainly mismatch feature function business requirement preference expectation
The idea buy COTS software satisfies maximum number requirement develop custom software extension fill gap left
This standard approach used implementing example

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

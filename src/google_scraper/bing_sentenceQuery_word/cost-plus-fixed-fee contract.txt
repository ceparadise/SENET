Practical Building Remodeling Advice Search This Site contract often used job lot unknown hidden condition repair work
While generally used smaller job contract sometimes used large job well even new home
Whenever plan spec fuzzy whatever reason never good idea may way proceed
On job many unknown client benefit pricing theory contractor add big fudge factor fixed bid cover unknown
The homeowner pay actual work completed
Without adequate protection built bid however owner taking enormous risk job cost spiral control
There little incentive contractor get job done quickly cheaply
In general work open book process bill contractor include documentation hard cost
This would include invoice material subcontractor well work hour billing rate direct labor supplied contractor
This process ensure contractor keeping good record billing responsibly
In practice invoice often provided unless requested client
The two main variation approach bidding
In scenario contractor bill client direct cost labor material sub plus percentage cover overhead profit
The problem approach contractor real incentive complete job quickly cheaply longer take spends larger profit necessarily good deal owner
In scenario contractor bill client direct cost plus fixed fee overhead profit
In case contractor motivated complete job quickly cheaply overhead profit percentage keep dropping
If customer increase scope work change order changed scope work customer contractor would need renegotiate fixed fee follow prescribed formula
Nearly work come estimate cost
As bid estimate contain detailed plan scope work material specification along itemized breakdown cost
An exception would emergency repair time detailed estimate ballpark estimate
However made clear estimate best guess fixed bid
The greater unknown le precise estimate
When client concerned job cost spiral control contractor provide guaranteed maximum price
In one version contractor split saving customer job come maximum
In case contractor added incentive beat maximum price set maximum price high enough easily beat
A similar approach negotiate flat fee incentive bonus job come time budget
I also seen contract owner right terminate contractor owner budget certain percentage draw contractor
The goal build protection incentive help protect owner runaway budget
For approach work essential contractor make clear owner cost considered direct job cost therefore reimbursable
The obvious cost subcontractor material supply used job lumber nail along consumables plastic sheeting bit blade used job
For labor reimbursable rate typically includes labor burden employee tax benefit insurance
Incidental cost like dumpster fee permit fee equipment rental typically included
Other cost subject negotiation fee equipment owned contractor vehicle expense insurance cost
As owner I would expect covered contractor overhead either way clear billed job cost
A related issue contractor time spent job supervision
Generally reimbursable job site overseeing sub crew swinging hammer
Management time generally reimbursable unless specific task listed billable making plan revision
Some people love work hate
In theory save owner money job lot unknown since contractor pad estimate cover unknown potential cost
In case probably save money never know ahead time absorb risk cost overrun
In case easy contractor limited experience estimating want invest time producing detailed estimate
This dangerous neither contractor much idea project end costing
Also contractor little incentive hold cost ongoing battle job site
More often job end costing client money sometimes lot
Also client little leverage end job may disagreement
What exactly included original estimate
You hold back final check get work completed properly since never clear check final
You keep paying paying
For reason They simply carry many risk owner benefit
They often lead cost overrun dispute money
It better nail many cost possible starting job get
If plan incomplete slow get completed
If cut hole wall investigate
For unknown remain use reasonable
Where must use get fixed bid many unknown reduce risk safeguard
It best suited small job large cost overrun unlikely
To protect I recommend following On project cost include builder office administrative fee plus markup
Should builder continue hire employee project office staff add fee
If project forced shut builder continue charge administrative fee plus markup
We year project month shut even dried yet
I baffled charge
We contract
The project way budget forced totally shutdown
We open advice
Sorry hear situation
I big fan contract hear many problem similar
In general contractor office expense administrative cost typically reimbursable job
Administrative cost typically covered markup whether percentage direct job cost fixed fee
In case time spent job site supervisor considered billable spelled contract
For example AIA contract read follows The Cost Work shall compensation Contractor personnel stationed Contractor principal office site office except specifically provided contract In absence written contract exactly billable becomes matter negotiation
It sound like contractor charging wide variety administrative cost typically billable
It also sound like job badly mismanaged causing large
It unclear email whether started clear plan written estimate strongly recommended whether contract
As discovered job risky owner assume nearly risk cost overrun
Not written contract add risk
To terminate cleanly current contractor need determine legitimate charge make final payment terminate contract writing
Since written contract fairly straightforward except contractor may claim money
To avoid risk legal action always good idea consult lawyer
Going forward I strongly suggest get fixed bid complete job written contract along clear description plan specification

Best luck getting job back track
Thank much advise
I regret researching agreed building term
We really struggling approach terminate contract builder
Since I last wrote issue deal
The reason shutdown blasted major hail storm January destroyed roof house completed month install
Along broken window damage
We could proceed house roof window replaced
At time still completed
Our builder obtained builder risk policy course paid along mark
He file claim insurance share information u
I finally called insurance company claim paid paid double amount told u
So know double dipping
We upset situation
With contract sub within general contractor material labor estimate inaccurately
Is level error uncommon
Subcontractor estimate usually pretty accurate sub one type work familiar unit cost factor drive cost variation
For example roofer quickly estimate cost roof two story high steep slope requires staging roof
General contractor hand estimate wide variety job endless range variable
Estimating difficult part business many contractor especially limited experience business side business
That might capable craftsman lacking experience running business
Nonetheless unusually bad unless changed dramatically time estimating time completion
I know absolute amount error
For example estimate better estimate although percentage error
There many possible cause although primarily labor side material estimate usually pretty straightforward
I big fan contract often result cost overrun owner bear risk higher cost
The estimate guestimate contractor little incentive provide realistic number live
It possible original estimate unrealistically low intention accident final cost work line would paid
It also possible overpaying due contractor mismanagement project
To find job cost may need bring third party construction manager professional estimator
If originally received one fixed bid would also provide good benchmark
I think worth discussing contractor bid far
Perhaps could negotiate lower final price given gross inaccuracy estimate
Thank taking time respond I appreciate feedback
The breakdown quote follows contractor profit margin already
There general description well added amount sub budgeted also amount completed General
Total Budget Sub Contractors Labour Materials I waiting meeting general contractor almost month since finding job far trying find time review
I trying best frame mind angle come reasonable solution well affordable
Both material labor run
Thank time insight suggestion might Starting job general description work dangerous wallet especially job size
Neither contractor know exactly bid estimate cover without detailed scope work form
Without possible provide accurate estimate
I found lack detail plan lack written contract two common cause construction dispute I seen year
This true whether contract
Even discussed job length contractor without detailed written plan spec highly unlikely job mind
Each party make assumption aspect job fully described writing two set assumption almost never agree
Additionally without detailed description job way determine made change plan almost always require increase cost
In job change order typically used owner request change plan
contract typically use change order still make provision contractor document change plan respective change final project cost
Without clearly documented base case original plan spec hard say change scope work
When nothing price tag attached contractor keeping track cost easy client keep adding upgrade course job end huge surprise bill end
It bit like overeating buffet later finding many item la carte pricing
I know case job although common scenario
The contractor response may owner wanted expensive change trying accommodate request
Whether contractor required notify owner change project cost would depend contract language
However even absence clause Changes Work I believe contractor responsibility unless owner made clear job
In event sound like communication breakdown somewhere along way contractor done good job keeping informed job going badly budget
How negotiate point large portion job still complete tricky
I might try work rest project agreed party based clearly defined scope work complete project
Best luck
As general contractor estimated job client client made lot change decided go agreement coming end project client refusing pay supervision cost belief supervision cost included mark material etc job
Where stand
Since really standard approach issue best spelled contract
Some contractor charge supervisory time others charge none use high enough material labor subcontractor cover cost
In experience client would rather pay hourly office work see amenable paying supervisory hour job site spent lead carpenter job super contractor
Since sound like discus ahead time include contract need negotiate solution owner
Best luck working mutually agreeable resolution
Read On cost plus contact homeowner buy material contractor charge material
Every contractor handle work little differently term marking material labor charge
In experience contractor problem owner purchasing small amount specialty material generally add markup
Some actually appreciate chasing material
However buying large quantity material job change nature job contractor may need make pricing adjustment
Some contractor discourage owner buying material since contractor deal receiving storing installing possibly repairing replacing material problem
Contractors prefer work product material experience confidence
For reason I see contractor may want charge material provide
Whether supply material contractor need charge certain amount total markup cover
They try build price one way another
On job take longer contractor install unfamiliar material provide contractor bill extra labor hour
On however contractor option may leery using material
One big concern responsible problem associated material
If accept full responsibility material including delay extra labor cost associated warranty issue reduced contractor risk overhead associated material
Under scenario I think reasonable pay markup reduced markup material provide
However aware contractor may try recover lost overhead making pricing adjustment
A related issue whether contractor showing actual cost material sub showing retail price received discount
For example contractor may get substantial discount certain item window appliance plumbing electrical fixture
To keep everyone honest contractor provide actual invoice mark actual price
Otherwise adding markup twice
Best luck project
If signed contract yet discus contractor
Make sure spell contract item purchase affect
If already signed contract homeowner buy material without discussing contractor first
The contractor may already ordered material custom order could large fee restocking returning material order may returnable
Also contractor accepted job may counted entire material order part profit
You always discus contractor signed change term contract unless party agree
If contractor told u contract cost plus gave u sheet hourly rate men
For example per hour laborer
Then get bill Plumber plus agree Laborer hour time per hour plus
This agree
If wanted per hour said put laborer
Who right
Short answer It customary mark employee labor cost contract
However rate marked actual labor cost number picked air
Every contractor price job little differently whether working
With contract contractor cost exposed owner sometimes lead conflict especially labor markup describe
In case contractor mark subcontractor material labor job
They may mark cost category rate different rate
A markup work pretty typical
The contractor may bill management supervisory time labor cost include overhead mark
For labor rate contractor typically mark fully burdened labor base labor rate plus added cost hiring employee
Labor burden includes thing payroll tax worker comp insurance health insurance vacation employee benefit truck tool expense covered contractor
Labor burden typically add base pay rate may much high cost market
If contractor billing per hour laborer labor burden rate paying laborer base rate per hour x
That seems high laborer I think fair ask contractor basis billing rate
However skilled carpenter might make much market
While standard contractor mark fully burdened labor base rate actual labor expense number
So may fair billing rate may inflated
In case contractor double dipping marking labor twice
It definitely worth discussion contractor clear thing
It quite possible contractor confused issue calculate source much confusion much debate among building contractor
We working contractor signed time material contract
We agreed estimate reasonable amount set aside overage
As week paid agreed upon amount
Based original estimate still worth work done
Some original estimate tripled quadrupled
What action I available
Please help
Sorry hear situation
It tough one unfortunately uncommon contract
I rarely recommend contract homeowner assumes risk cost overrun contractor little incentive hold cost
I wish I better news essence contract agree pay labor material necessary complete job
The estimate typically
It fixed bid simply educated guess project cost
Since word estimate sometimes used refer frequent cause confusion
Some bid include maximum price cost control open ended
Since invoicing usually done regular basis obvious contractor final cost going far exceed estimate
At point contractor discussed matter good business practice
However legally obligated notify running budget unless specifically stipulated contract good idea common
Even cost increase due change plan spec work started still informed cost change
contract typically open book
The contractor supposed provide owner detailed record cost including actual invoice material subcontractor requested owner
Given size overage certainly justified asking full documentation cost paying additional invoice
You also free terminate current contractor find someone else complete work think get work done le money
You also try negotiate current contractor complete remainder job fixed price get cost surprise
If feel contractor intentionally mislead may want file complaint state contractor licensing board consumer protection agency
It may also worth consulting lawyer may idea I would surprised
Best luck tough situation
Read Thank much
Our house torn apart need come solution put back together
This contractor done work people know knew expensive
We several line item original estimate able complete
What I hard time understanding certain thing like brick work soffit fascia gutter price tripled
He knew size addition would number jump much
Is recourse feel low bid get job
Thank much time
Hopefully able find solution
Did make lot change plan contractor provided estimate
Assuming make huge change plan hard say estimate far
Either poor job estimate suggest may intentionally submitted unrealistically low bid get job
Did get estimate work line contractor original estimate
If feel contractor acted dishonestly file complaint state contractor licensing board state consumer protection agency often part attorney general office
In state agency help file complaint help resolve dispute Many job end arbitration based contract according construction arbitrator I know
In preparation form dispute resolution start documenting everything job
Take photo work completed keep copy written correspondence keep dated log conversation contract
critical presenting case type proceeding
You also contact lawyer see whether legal recourse
win contract constitute fraud public work project I sure hold true residential contract
Again best luck finding solution
Thanks
We made change original plan
We purchase upgraded sliding door thing may different original bid
We aware price increase said door
We account upgrade
In midst reconciling cost plus percentage contract
The owner provided four additional allowance built design build contract cover change order related cost
The GC used affiliate family member company perform general site maintenance task
The contractor affiliate company based two hour away project
It would appear number cost applied base contract rolled various allowance
In addition labor portion affiliate lump summed together nearly impossible allocate cost many task invoiced remotely within scope allowance
I found invoiced laser level purchased told common practice allow GC keep equipment would cheaper renting three week appeared use
I getting push back asking cost breakdown punchlist allocated fire sprinkler allowance
None task list remotely associated scope provided allowance
Why paying X amount debris cleared roof
Isn GC responsibility backcharge contractor failed clean
I thought transparent process sure anymore
In case I recommend contract large job often lead contractor
It always difficult distance untangle sort issue
For example I sure mean owner provided four additional allowance item
In general contract make use work billed basis
So clear work billed rolled allowance
Perhaps hybrid contract sort
There endless number possible variation I know particular contract
However sound like contractor done good job communication transparency billing underlying principle contract
Some contractor good others need asked see detailed invoice material delivered work completed
Some contractor disorganized easily provide good record case never confident billed fairly
There need certain level trust work job every day counting worked many hour
Being invoiced laser level definitely appropriate
While tool rental consumables drill bit blade often included billing purchase laser level way line
Sounds like bought unit expense
In general laser level basic tool contractor would expected
And even needed rent special equipment job rate well price quoted I would guess per week
Sounds like need schedule meeting contractor go billing procedure invoice
Don afraid ask explanation anything unclear
You may want friend advocate sitting think would helpful
If contractor provide clear record billable job cost need decide whether wish contest charge
At point would probably good idea speak lawyer
I think fee charged word cost plus basis cost labor product would charged client PRIOR tax added total charge
Is correct
There rule building contract contractor recipe coming price
work seems pretty cut dried always clear direct cost marked counted overhead especially supervision time owner
For example see link
The general concept however contractor marking direct cost attributable specific job
That typically would include sale tax pay material
It would also include labor burden true cost hiring worker hourly rate
That might include payroll tax worker comp employee benefit
So tax typically included direct cost marked describe
bid open You able see money going charged direct cost
It best discus issue clearly outset avoid misunderstanding half way job
You read
If go contract even labor cost go higher contract
Sorry say contract labor cost definitely go higher estimate
In fact labor cost biggest unknown
On job pretty straightforward price material
It labor contractor difficulty estimating
On job estimate really best guess
On contract people often use term estimate bid interchangeably causing confusion
The bid price fixed price agreed upon complete described work
It possible put limit price job form number contractor agree
However contractor work resist putting cap price
In general I would avoid large job whether new house large remodel
It risky owner hold risk cost spiraling control
On contractor little incentive hold cost
le common better owner contractor profit running budget

I client pushing u use cost plus fixed fee v time material subcontractor
They believe fixed fee profit would receive understanding top built rate let say rate would making rate build fixed fee
However Time material would get rate build
Any thought would appreciated
See Wifcon Analysis page
In addition Vern said financial analysis correct least accordance FAR may operating different regime
In contract subcontractor receives reimbursement allowable cost funding including allowable allocable indirect cost
In addition contractor receives fee estimated cost NOT actual cost
The amount fee negotiated may exceed certain percentage estimated cost certain circumstance
In T M contract subcontractor proposes hourly billing rate include indirect cost burden allocated direct labor dollar
In addition subcontractor proposed profit fully burdened labor cost
If prime subcontractor negotiate hourly billing rate subcontractor cost show M side T M equation prime contractor bill fee subcontractor cost see
But subcontractor certainly bill prime
So respect financial analysis possible make subcontractor project margin come regardless subcontract type chosen
To mind compliance risk propel party toward subcontract instead T M
In view T M subcontract risky party especially prime
What step prime taking ensure subcontractor working hour billing obtaining certified payroll data support invoice
What step taken ensure subcontractor personnel qualification bill labor category party defined
If security clearance required step taken ensure subcontractor personnel requisite clearance
Failure address risk prime contractor resulted allegation violation False Claims Act
Finally recent litigation indicates DCAA interested auditing T M subcontract poor job according ASBCA auditing subcontract
This easier catch issue see list question cost respect T M subcontract subcontract
I thank input
It interesting thought Time Material
I would interested hearing type contract would use labor material support
Would risk cost I bill cost contract
Plus I negotiate fee every time scope change long run could potentially issue
Just curious
Especially FFP possible
Im trying find good option
Would risk cost I bill cost contract
Plus I negotiate fee every time scope change long run could potentially issue
I disagree cost charged cost type contract
The rule charging contract change depending contract type
The labor would charged T M contract would also charged contract
With respect comment fee I may understanding point
To way thinking
add scope T M contract raise NTE value permit hour billed
Those hour contain profit component
More hour profit
On contract generally fixed fee add scope may need add fee depending negotiated
I must missing point two situation seem generally equivalent
Im trying find good option
In order find good pricing option must understand feature term various type contract obligation risk impose party
Coming understanding entail extensive study deep thinking
The label given contract describe work
Do thing Read FAR Part
Read key FAR clause contract type especially payment clause inspection clause
Read Vol Ch

Read Parts I II
Part I say among thing The general description various pricing arrangement appear FAR Part incomplete somewhat misleading
For instance strictly speaking price contract neither firm fixed contract reimburse contractor cost
The best way understand various pricing arrangement really work study term contract clause prescribed use arrangement
If thing never really understand contract type
I disagree cost charged cost type contract
The rule charging contract change depending contract type
The labor would charged T M contract would also charged contract
With respect comment fee I may understanding point
To way thinking
add scope T M contract raise NTE value permit hour billed
Those hour contain profit component
More hour profit
On contract generally fixed fee add scope may need add fee depending negotiated
I must missing point two situation seem generally equivalent
I agree
That I trying find one better
I trying better understand issue make best decision
I confused cost would better T M

Thank Vern
I read
I confused cost would better T M
Then need reread Wifcon article eliminate confusion
In short T M like requires contractor make best effort perform
Successful completion condition payment
As long contractor make best effort contractor paid whether finish work
But unlike T M pay profit additional hour labor
Thus addition penalizing contractor failure reward contractor inefficiency labor us profit make
Moreover fixed labor rate T M contract necessarily reflect contractor cost performance
Unless contractor proposing rate specific person contractor free use person meet set labor category criterion
There may one employee given labor category category necessarily paid
Just like paid
The contractor increase profit using le experienced qualified worker perform task lower rate pay included fixed labor rate
Even profit made fully absorbing fixed cost labor rate performance complete
Once happens every dollar included rate fixed cost potentially additional profit
THAT standpoint performance cost better T M
However explained article may administrative advantage T M offset performance cost disadvantage
Adding Vern said necessary contractor pay employee every hour worked charge government hour labor hourly rate
For example employee exempt overtime provision FLSA work T M contract hour week contractor necessarily required pay employee anything extra hour excess resulting uncompensated overtime
However bill government hourly rate excess hour
Under T M contract contractor overrun contract incur cost excess ceiling price government want contractor continue perform contractor receives profit additional hour
In contract cost reimbursement contract contractor incurs overrun estimated cost contract may increased contractor receives additional fee
Would CLIN structure clearly state T M contract price
Tomahawk I recommend ask contracting officer clarification part work FFP part work T M
Hopefully answer CLIN basis certain CLINs wholly FFP CLINs wholly T M generally easier blended CLINs
A prospective offeror never much time proposal due I suggest hurry
Under new FAR rule based DFARS rule blended CLINs impermissible
See FAR e
Tomahawk I recommend ask contracting officer clarification part work FFP part work T M

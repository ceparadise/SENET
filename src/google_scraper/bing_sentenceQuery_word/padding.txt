What mean data alignment structure packing padding
Predict output following program
Before moving write answer paper read
If urge see explanation may miss understand lacuna analogy
Also read Kartik
Every data type alignment requirement infact mandated processor architecture language
A processor processing word length data bus size
On bit machine processing word size byte
Historically memory byte addressable arranged sequentially
If memory arranged single bank one byte width processor need issue memory read cycle fetch integer
It economical read byte integer one memory cycle
To take advantage memory arranged group bank shown figure
The memory addressing still sequential
If bank occupies address X bank bank bank X X X address
If integer byte allocated X address X multiple processor need one memory cycle read entire integer
Where integer allocated address multiple span across two row bank shown figure
Such integer requires two memory read cycle fetch data
A variable deal way data stored bank
For example natural alignment machine byte
When data type naturally aligned CPU fetch minimum read cycle
Similarly natural alignment byte
It mean stored bank bank pair bank bank pair
A requires byte occupies two row memory bank
Any misalignment force two read cycle fetch data
Note variable allocated byte boundary bit machine requires two memory read cycle
On bit machine based number bank variable allocated byte boundary requires one memory read cycle
In structure used data pack
It provide data encapsulation data hiding feature case exception due semantic similarity class
Because alignment requirement various data type every member structure naturally aligned
The member structure allocated sequentially increasing order
Let u analyze struct declared program
Some time mandatory avoid padded byte among member structure
For example reading content ELF file header BMP JPEG file header
We need define structure similar header layout map
However care exercised accessing member
Typically reading byte byte option avoid misaligned exception
There hit performance
Most compiler provide non standard extension switch default padding like pragmas command line switch
Consult documentation respective compiler detail
There possibility potential error dealing pointer arithmetic
For example dereferencing generic pointer void shown cause misaligned exception It possible type code programming
If pointer aligned per requirement casted data type possibility get misaligned exception
Infact processor last two bit address decoding way access address
The processor generates misaligned exception programmer try access address
The pointer returned malloc
It converted data type per need programmer
The implementer malloc return pointer aligned maximum size primitive data type defined compiler
It usually aligned byte boundary bit machine
These specific operating system implementer compiler writer beyond scope article
Infact I much information
Yes
The stack also memory
The system programmer load stack pointer memory address properly aligned
Generally processor check stack alignment programmer responsibility ensure proper alignment stack memory
Any misalignment cause run time surprise
For example processor word length bit stack pointer also aligned multiple byte
Usually processor recognize data type based instruction
LDRB ARM processor
Depending bank stored processor shift byte onto least significant data line
Yes
The compiler help programmer making proper alignment
For example value pushed onto wide stack value automatically padded zero bit
Consider following program
The output bit machine
It character occupies byte due alignment requirement
It depends processor architecture
If access misaligned processor automatically issue sufficient memory read cycle pack data properly onto data bus
The penalty performance
Where processor last two address line mean access odd byte boundary
Every data access must aligned byte properly
A misaligned access critical exception processor
If exception ignored read data incorrect hence result
Yes
Compilers provide non standard extension need
For example Visual Studio help getting alignment requirement data type
Read MSDN detail
It important note processor math called Floating Point Unit FPU
Any floating point operation code translated FPU instruction
The main processor nothing floating point execution
All done behind scene
As per standard double type occupy byte
And every floating point operation performed FPU bit length
Even float type promoted bit prior execution
The bit length FPU register force double type allocated byte boundary
I assuming I concrete information case FPU operation data fetch might different I mean data bus since go FPU
Hence address decoding different double type expected byte boundary
It mean
It observed latest processor getting size byte
I yet read relevant documentation
I update I got proper information written expert hardware
On older processor AMD Athlon using set tool GCC I got size byte
The size depends memory banking organized hardware level

In tool conditionally prove equal bigger class also equal
The proof implies us padding
definition suffices show
Let language NEXP
Since NEXP decides time constant
Let symbol occurring
First show NP use deterministic polynomial time machine given P NP show EXP
polynomial time follows
Given input verify form reject
If correct form simulate
The simulation take time polynomial size input
So NP
By assumption P NP also deterministic machine decides polynomial time
We decide deterministic exponential time follows
Given input simulate
This take exponential time size input
The called padding language
This type argument also sometimes used space complexity class alternating class bounded alternating class

Consider The size structure respectively
Are structure padded packed
When padding packing take place
structure member natural address boundary say member would offset platform
Padding default
It insert following gap first structure hand prevents compiler padding explicitly requested GCC following would produce structure size architecture
A note though unaligned memory access slower architecture allow like explicitly prohibited like SPARC
Structure packing suppresses structure padding padding used alignment matter packing used space matter
Some compiler provide suppress padding make packed n number byte
Some provide keywords
Generally pragma used modifying structure padding format depends compiler For example ARM provides keyword suppress structure padding
Go compiler manual learn
Generally packed structure used save space format data structure transmit network using protocol good practice course need deal endianness I know question old answer explains padding really well trying understand I figured visual image happening helped
The processor read memory chunk definite size word
Say processor word byte long
It look memory big row byte building block
Every time need get information memory reach one block get
As seem image matter Char byte long since inside one block requiring CPU process word
When deal data larger one byte like byte int byte double way aligned memory make difference many word processed CPU
If chunk aligned way always fit inside block memory address multiple one word processed
Otherwise chunk could part one block part another requiring processor process word read data
The applies double except must memory address multiple guarantee always inside block
This considers word processor concept applies size word
The padding work filling gap data make sure aligned block thus improving performance reading memory
However stated others answer sometimes space matter performance
Maybe processing lot data computer much RAM swap space could used MUCH slower
You could arrange variable program least padding done greatly exemplified answer enough could explicitly disable padding
Padding packing two aspect thing In assuming default alignment member aligned multiple byte
Since size padding byte padding required already byte
It work way
Structure padding adding extra bit end structue structure completes word boundary
In find avoiding structure padding
Structure packing done tell compiler explicitly pack structure
Padding seeing
Your system padding field word alignment
If told compiler pack structure byte respectively
Do though
It portable make compiler generate much slower sometimes even buggy code
Data structure alignment way data arranged accessed computer memory
It consists two separate related issue data alignment
When modern computer read writes memory address word sized chunk
byte chunk system larger
Data alignment mean putting data memory address equal multiple word size increase performance due way CPU handle memory
To align data may necessary insert meaningless byte end last data structure start next data structure padding

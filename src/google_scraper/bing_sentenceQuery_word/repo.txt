By Reviewed Murray Anderegg Computer Services recommends Subversion Git CVS code repository
Computer Services still maintains CVS source code control system limited expertise answering question CVS
This page give brief introduction CVS including CVS repository need one creation CVS repository access CVS repository much space user get CVS repository repository available Computer Science Department
The book available
Other information available online recommendation good source welcome
The process getting started CVS may take bit time plan try CVS repository read online documentation get speed
Record keeping became necessary people wanted compare program current state point past
For example normal course implementing new feature developer may bring program thoroughly broken state probably remain feature mostly finished
Unfortunately time someone usually call report bug last publicly released version
To debug problem may also exist current version source program brought back useable state
Restoring state pose difficulty source code history kept CVS
The developer simply say effect Give program three week ago perhaps Give program time last public release
If never kind convenient access historical snapshot may surprised quickly come depend
Personally I always use revision control coding project saved many For collaboration CVS assumes developer equal status project provides ability check copy project modify check copy independently
At check CVS check file committed one currently repository case conflict alert developer conflict
When conflict second person committing resolve conflict repository accept new code
To create CVS repository departmental CVS server send request help asking creation personal CVS repository creation project repository related research group class department
Personal CVS repository created CVS server project repository created CVS server project name
After repository space created necessary initialize repository CVS
Login CVS server run cv repository directory init This create CVSROOT initialize file CVSROOT directory
If wish run multiple CVS repository CVS repository directory need run init command inside repository subdirectory
For example mkdir cv init mkdir cv init Access CVS repository currently ONLY using SSH
We strongly suggest use key authentication SSH prompted password file committed
This make process committing CVS change atomic le painful
A document describing setup key authentication Linux Windows available
The CVS repository currently residing Linux server filesystem running POSIX draft file ACLs
The process sharing repository collaborating others require modifying ACLs
For information Linux file ACLs see man page setfacl getfacl see two web page
Here example adding user anderegg repository
You need set extended ACLs repository Login cv cd repository setfacl user anderegg rwX
setfacl user anderegg rwX
To remove access user anderegg cd repository setfacl user anderegg
setfacl user anderegg
NOTE Both command need run make change permission everything existing without everything created future default
There cron job sweep repository performs chown owner repository everything within case different user creates file within repository
Users allocated space personal CVS repository
Projects allocated space CVS repository
The department offer recommends two repository manager Subversion Git
These repository manager generally robust CVS

About site A journal thought thing life Collection article I published Presentations I delivered recently Software I written My link collection My picture collection featuring cute little chihuahua Pico Quick introduction internals people scared word like
In simplified form git object storage DAG object handful different type object
They stored compressed identified hash incidentally content file represent representation git
The simplest object bunch byte
This often file symlink pretty much anything else
The object point determines semantics
Directories represented object
They refer content file filename access mode etc stored subdirectory
When node point another node DAG node exist without
Nodes nothing point garbage collected rescued much like filesystem inodes filename pointing
A refers represents state file time commit
It also refers parent
More one parent mean commit merge parent mean initial commit interestingly one initial commit usually mean two separate project merged
The body object commit message
References head branch like note slapped node DAG
Where DAG get added existing node mutated moved around freely
They get stored history directly transferred repository
They act sort bookmark I working
add node DAG move note current branch new node
The ref special actually point another ref
It pointer currently active branch
Normal ref actually namespace often skip part
Remote reference note different color
The difference normal different namespace fact remote ref essentially controlled remote server
update
A node DAG note yet another color
A point includes optional message GPG signature
The fast way access tag lost recovered DAG
The node DAG moved repository repository stored effective form pack unused node garbage collected
But end repository always DAG
So armed knowledge store version history visualize thing like merges differ tool try manage history linear change per branch
This simplest repository
We remote repository one commit
Here ed remote received one new commit remote merged yet
The situation
As merge new commits local branch thing happened moving note changing file working directory respectively
One local later
We new local commit new remote commit
Clearly merge needed
Results
Because new local commits actual new node created DAG
Note two parent Here tree look commits branch another merge
See stitching pattern emerge
The DAG record exactly history action taken
The stitching pattern somewhat tedious read
If yet published branch clearly communicated others base work alternative
You branch instead merging commit replaced another commit different parent branch moved
Your old commit remain DAG garbage collected
Ignore know way screwed totally
If extra pointing old commit remain pointing keep old commit alive indefinitely
That fairly confusing though
Do rebase branch others created new commits top
It possible recover hard extra work needed frustrating
The situation garbage collecting ignoring unreachable commit creating new commit top branch
also know rebase multiple commits one command
That end brief intro people intimidated computer science
Hope helped

Computer Services hard copy available
Subversion centralized system sharing information
At core repository central store data
The repository store information form typical hierarchy file directory
Any number connect repository read write file
By writing data client make information available others reading data client receives information others
So interesting
So far sound like definition typical file server
And indeed repository kind file server usual breed
What make Subversion repository special ever written change every file even change directory tree addition deletion rearrangement file directory
When client read data repository normally see latest version filesystem tree
But client also ability view state filesystem
For example client ask historical question What directory contain last Wednesday Who last person change file change make These sort question heart system designed track change data time
To create Subversion repository departmental CVS server send request help asking creation personal CVS repository creation project repository related research group class department
Personal CVS repository created CVS server project repository created CVS server
After CVS repository created subversion repository must created
Login create repository svnadmin create If wish run multiple subversion repository CVS server need create subdirectory repository create subversion repository subdirectory

lab
There two scheme currently popular revision control system centralized distributed
In traditional centralized model main server everyone pull push change
It keep revision organized nicely group project limited need contact server whenever want change
The working directory subset history
In distributed system pull change somewhere else make change tell people group pull change
This way everyone full copy tree making much easier work laptop disconnected environment
You see difference scheme work image
Distributed revision control system newer gaining traction
They add flexibility complex learn
These system set similar traditional centralized system subject limitation
We currently support three revision control system two centralized one distributed
If trying decide revision control system use recommend using GIT Subversion
The service provide GIT Subversion better able help problem might encounter
Both GIT Mercurial newer technology offer advantage Subversion
While Subversion successor CVS much easier work
None new project use CVS however still support

In formal naming definition type property interrelationship really exist particular
Thus basically
It draw philosophical discipline established antiquity
An ontology information science compartmentalizes variable needed set computation establishes relationship
The field create ontology limit complexity organize information
The ontology applied
The knowledge density knowledge graph average number issued given entity commonly measured
The term origin applied many different way
The word element come present participle verb
The core meaning within model describing world consists set type property relationship type
There also generally expectation feature model ontology closely resemble real world related object
What ontology common computer science philosophy representation entity idea event along property relation according system category
In field considerable work problem philosophy computer science debate whether ontology viable debate philosophy project AI
Differences two largely matter focus
Computer scientist concerned establishing fixed controlled vocabulary philosopher concerned first principle whether thing whether enduring object must ontologically primary process
Other field make ontological assumption sometimes explicitly elaborated explored
For instance also sometimes called hotly debated especially primary concern also subfields
Such concern intersect information science simulation model intended enable economic decision example determine risk much see
Some claim social science explicit ontology issue hard criterion like model physical science indeed lack widely accepted hard falsification criterion defines social soft science
Historically ontology arise branch known deal nature reality exists
This fundamental branch concerned analyzing various type mode existence often special attention relation
The traditional goal ontological inquiry particular divide world joint discover fundamental category kind world object naturally fall
During second half century philosopher extensively debated possible method approach building ontology without actually elaborate ontology
By contrast computer scientist building large robust ontology comparatively little debate built
Since researcher field AI recognized capturing knowledge key building large powerful AI system
AI researcher argued could create new ontology enable certain kind
In AI community began use term refer theory modeled world component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early widely cited Web page paper Toward Principles Design Ontologies Used Knowledge Sharing credited deliberate definition technical term
Gruber introduced term mean specification conceptualization An ontology description like formal specification program concept relationship formally exist agent community agent
This definition consistent usage ontology set concept definition general
And different sense word use philosophy
According Gruber Ontologies often equated taxonomic hierarchy class class definition subsumption relation ontology need limited form
Ontologies also limited definition traditional logic sense introduce terminology add knowledge world
To specify conceptualization one need state axiom constrain possible interpretation defined term
As refinement Gruber definition Feilmayr Wöß stated An ontology formal explicit specification shared conceptualization characterized high semantic expressiveness required increased complexity
Contemporary ontology share many structural similarity regardless language expressed
As mentioned ontology describe individual instance class concept attribute relation
In section component discussed turn
Common component ontology include Ontologies commonly encoded using
A domain ontology ontology represents concept belong part world
Particular meaning term applied domain provided domain ontology
For example word many different meaning
An ontology domain would model meaning word ontology domain would model meaning
Since domain ontology represent concept specific often eclectic way often incompatible
As system rely domain ontology expand often need merge domain ontology general representation
This present challenge ontology designer
Different ontology domain arise due different language different intended usage ontology different perception domain based cultural background education ideology etc
At present merging ontology developed common foundation ontology largely manual process therefore expensive
Domain ontology use foundation ontology provide set basic element specify meaning domain ontology element merged automatically
There study generalized technique merging ontology area research still largely theoretical
An foundation ontology model common object generally applicable across wide range domain ontology
It usually employ contains term associated object description used various relevant domain set
Standardized upper ontology available use include Unified Foundational Ontology UFO

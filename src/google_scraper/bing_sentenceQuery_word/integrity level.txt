Violations Cornell University Code Academic Integrity occurring Computer Science course taken seriously Computer Science faculty
Therefore necessary impress upon student gravity violation Code
The following excerpt longer version
The exclusion part excuse ignorance Code
Absolute integrity expected every Cornell student academic undertaking must way misrepresent work fraudulently unfairly advance academic status party another student failure maintain academic integrity
The maintenance atmosphere academic honor fulfillment provision Code responsibility student faculty Cornell University
Therefore student faculty member shall refrain action would violate basic principle Code
Unless otherwise specified individual professor work Computer Science course expected result individual effort use computer way modifies normal standard Code
You may discus work student give receive consulting help student permissible cooperation never involve one student possession copy part another student assignment regardless whether copy paper computer disk computer file
This implies legitimate reason send copy program one computer account another another student account
Discussion general strategy algorithm permissible may collaborate detailed development actual writing assignment
It also responsibility protect work unauthorized access
It inadvisable discard copy program public place
This applies programming assignment
The penalty violation Code Computer Science course may failure course
This includes collaboration providing copy accepting copy work expected individual effort

If new student think back probably remember given information school academic honesty policy first day class
This information likely addressed among thing school requirement submitting original work policy regarding cheating expectation student behavior
In giving information school suggesting cheat rather merely wanted inform expect student act certain degree integrity
term used describe person level honesty moral commitment willingness right
For example expect doctor honest u diagnosis wo try prescribe medication need generally work best interest health
We expect society doctor perceived people great integrity strong moral compass
Conversely doctor integrity might strongly influenced drug company bribe might talk getting test procedure need
When happens society take dim view case legal charge expected act integrity
One earliest encounter likely integrity outside family academic environment
Specifically teacher instructor expect every assignment turn work
This mean expected copying someone else idea word pas
In case plagiarism unintentional important certain word idea work completely
In academic context scholarly work integrity tremendous importance
For example college professor write book perform experiment expected theory assertion backed rigorous research provide citation
In case discovered someone falsified research data outright lied person face number consequence expected work honesty integrity
Among important people expect act integrity politician
For example politician campaigning public office make many promise claim elected
In general candidate elected precisely claim make integrity one important characteristic
Unfortunately though politician make lot claim campaign trail always follow
This call integrity question seriously weakens chance
Academics politics two major area integrity important integrity fundamental law enforcement justice system
Broadly speaking expect police officer judge impartial uphold law honestly regardless person race ethnicity characteristic
Recently however integrity law enforcement justice system increasingly called question
For example growing focus police brutality unfair practice United States particularly relate racial ethnic minority
For many Americans allegation hard believe even shocking
This expect law enforcement officer conduct honestly adhere moral principle people equal eye law

In many way idea integrity mean act integrity difficult pin universal term
This integrity mean something society culture created meaning change society evolves
For example fifteenth century person defending practice burning witch would likely seen great deal integrity whereas would consider act reprehensible
The complexity integrity largely related fact rooted shared value notion morality static universal
In fact considered moral behavior much mean depends individual perspective belief
Therefore concept morality honesty change society criterion integrity
Let review
In general word used describe person commitment honesty willingness right
For example person abstains cheating lying stealing would considered person act great integrity
In society integrity important aspect culture contributes strength community
In academic environment example student expected avoid submit work entirely
Other area integrity important include legal justice system politics
Despite importance though universal definition understanding integrity difficult locate
This often concept integrity tends change society culture evolve
After watching lesson able define integrity list example importance different social environment

qualification honest strong moral principle moral uprightness
It generally personal choice hold oneself consistent moral ethical standard
In integrity regarded many honesty one action
Integrity stand opposition judging standard integrity involves regarding internal consistency virtue suggests party holding within apparently conflicting value account discrepancy alter belief
The word evolved Latin adjective meaning
In context integrity inner sense wholeness deriving quality consistency
As one may judge others integrity extent act according value belief principle claim hold
Significant attention given subject integrity law conception law century philosophy law jurisprudence centering part research studied book
Dworkin position integrity law reinforces conception justice viewed fairness In discussing individual said posse virtue integrity individual action based upon internally consistent framework principle
These principle uniformly adhere sound logical postulate
One describe person ethical integrity extent individual action belief method measure principle derive single
An individual must therefore flexible willing adjust value maintain consistency value expected test result congruent observed outcome
Because flexibility form regarded well
An individual provides within individual act way consistent expected
Integrity seen state condition framework acting congruently within given framework
One essential aspect consistent framework avoidance unwarranted arbitrary exception particular person person group hold framework
In law principle universal application requires even position official power subject law pertain fellow citizen
In personal ethic principle requires one act according rule one would wish see universally followed
For example one steal unless one would want live world everyone thief
The philosopher formally described principle universal application
The concept integrity implies comprehensive corpus belief often referred
This concept wholeness emphasizes requiring one act time accordance individual chosen worldview
Ethical integrity synonymous good Zuckert Zuckert show When caught defended action term distinction
He scoffed like professor learned distinction still lived life value claim
He thought fool one courage integrity live consistent life light truth value judgment including command Thou shalt kill merely subjective assertion
Integrity important politician chosen appointed elected serve society
To able serve politician given power make execute control policy
They power influence something someone
There however risk politician use power serve society
Aristotle said ruler power tempted use personal gain
It important politician withstand temptation requires integrity
In book Muel Kaptein describes integrity start politician know position entail integrity related position
Integrity also demand knowledge compliance letter spirit written unwritten rule
Integrity also acting consistently generally accepted moral others think primarily ethical politician based reasonable argument
Furthermore integrity politician act certain way also politician
Questions person integrity cast doubt intention also source intention person character
So integrity right ethical virtue become visible pattern behavior
Important virtue politician faithfulness humility
accountability
Furthermore authentic role model
identified pride variously translated proper pride greatness soul magnanimity crown virtue distinguishing vanity temperance humility
Dworkin argues moral principle people hold dear often wrong even extent certain crime acceptable one principle skewed enough
To discover apply principle court interpret legal data legislation case etc
view articulating interpretation best explains justifies past legal practice
All interpretation must follow Dworkin argues notion make sense
Out idea law way Dworkin argues every situation people legal right controversial best interpretation involves right answer thesis thesis exists right answer matter law judge must discover
Dworkin opposes notion judge discretion difficult case
Dworkin model legal principle also connected Hart notion
Dworkin reject Hart conception master rule every legal system identifies valid law basis would process identifying law must uncontroversial whereas Dworkin argues people legal right even case correct legal outcome open reasonable dispute
Dworkin move away separation law morality since constructive interpretation implicates moral judgment every decision law
The procedure known integrity test confrontationally honesty test aim identify prospective employee may hide perceived negative derogatory aspect past criminal conviction drug abuse
Identifying unsuitable candidate save employer problem might otherwise arise term employment
Integrity test make certain assumption specifically The claim test detect fake answer play crucial role detecting people low integrity
Naive respondent really believe pretense behave accordingly reporting past deviance thought deviance others fearing answer truthfully untrue answer reveal low integrity
These respondent believe candid answer higher integrity score
Disciplines field interest integrity include philosophy
Popular psychology identifies personal integrity professional integrity artistic integrity intellectual integrity
The concept integrity may also feature context beyond issue honesty ethical behavior notably marketing branding context
The integrity brand regarded desirable outcome company seeking maintain consistent unambiguous position mind audience
This integrity brand includes consistent messaging often includes using set graphic standard maintain visual integrity
Kaptein Wempe developed theory corporate integrity including criterion business dealing moral dilemma
Another use term integrity appears work academic paper Integrity A Positive Model Incorporates Normative Phenomenon Morality Ethics Legality
In paper author explore new model integrity state whole complete unbroken unimpaired sound perfect condition
They posit new model integrity provides access increased performance individual group organization society
Their model reveals causal link integrity increased performance quality life entity provides access causal link
According Muel Kaptein integrity concept
In book present multifaceted perspective integrity
Integrity relates example compliance rule well social expectation morality well ethic action well attitude
Electronic signal said integrity corruption information one domain another disk drive computer display
Such integrity fundamental principle
Corrupted information yet uncorrupted information value

Referential integrity database feature relational database management system
It ensures relationship table database remain accurate applying constraint prevent user application entering inaccurate data pointing data exist
use table organize information contain
They similar spreadsheet Excel vastly capable advanced user
Databases function use primary key foreign key maintain relationship table
The database table unique identifier assigned record
Each table one column designated primary key
A Social Security number primary key database listing employee Social Security number unique
However privacy concern assigned company ID number better choice function primary key employee
Some database Microsoft primary key automatically random key real meaning
It better use key meaning record
The simplest way enforce referential integrity allow change primary key
A identifier table match primary key different table
The foreign key creates relationship different table referential integrity refers relationship table
When one table foreign key another table concept referential integrity state may add record table contains foreign key unless corresponding record linked table
It also includes technique known cascading update cascading delete ensure change made linked table reflected primary table
Consider situation two table Employees Managers
The Employees table foreign key attribute entitled ManagedBy point record employee manager Managers table
Referential integrity enforces following three rule Using relational system referential integrity offer several advantage There error

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
also known model designed guide policy information security within organization
The model also sometimes referred AIC triad availability integrity confidentiality avoid confusion Central Intelligence Agency
The element triad considered three crucial component security
In context set rule limit access information assurance information trustworthy accurate guarantee reliable access information authorized people
Confidentiality roughly equivalent
Measures undertaken ensure confidentiality designed prevent sensitive information reaching wrong people making sure right people fact get Access must restricted authorized view data question
It common well data categorized according amount type damage could done fall unintended hand
More le stringent measure implemented according category
Sometimes safeguarding data confidentiality may involve special training privy document
Such training would typically include security risk could threaten information
Training help familiarize authorized people risk factor guard
Further aspect training include strong password best practice information method prevent bending rule good intention potentially disastrous result
A good example method used ensure confidentiality account number routing number banking online
Data common method ensuring confidentiality
User IDs constitute standard procedure becoming norm
Other option include
In addition user take precaution minimize number place information appears number time actually transmitted complete required transaction
Extra measure might taken case extremely sensitive document precaution storing computer disconnected storage device highly form
involves maintaining consistency accuracy trustworthiness data entire life cycle
Data must changed transit step must taken ensure data altered unauthorized people example breach confidentiality
These measure include file permission user
Version control maybe used prevent erroneous change accidental deletion authorized user becoming problem
In addition mean must place detect change data might occur result event electromagnetic pulse server
Some data might include even verification integrity
redundancy must available restore affected data correct state
Availability best ensured rigorously maintaining performing hardware repair immediately needed maintaining correctly functioning operating system environment free software conflict
It also important keep current necessary system
Providing adequate communication preventing occurrence equally important
even mitigate serious consequence hardware issue occur
Fast adaptive essential worst case scenario capacity reliant existence comprehensive disaster recovery plan
Safeguards data loss interruption connection must include unpredictable event natural disaster fire
To prevent data loss occurrence copy may stored location perhaps even fireproof waterproof safe
Extra security equipment software firewall proxy server guard downtime unreachable data due malicious action attack network intrusion
pose extra challenge CIA paradigm sheer volume information need safe guarded multiplicity source come variety format exists
Duplicate data set disaster recovery plan multiply already high cost
Furthermore main concern big data collecting making kind useful interpretation information responsible data oversight often lacking
Edward Snowden brought problem public forum reported NSA collection massive volume American citizen personal data
special consideration required protect information individual exposure environment almost physical logical entity object given ability communicate autonomously Internet similar network
The data transmitted given endpoint might cause privacy issue
However even fragmented data multiple endpoint gathered collated analyzed yield sensitive information
also special challenge IoT consists many device computer often go unpatched often configured default weak password
Unless adequately protected IoT could used separate attack vector part

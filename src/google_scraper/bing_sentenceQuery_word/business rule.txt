I asked time
What difference business rule business requirement
It simple really
Business rule list statement tell whether may may something give criterion condition making decision
One factor business requirement need enable implementation compliance business rule
Believe daughter turning thirteen summer
She definitely twelve year old going
One Saturday morning breakfast got conversation rule old enough go I say around sixteen seventeen dad would say
Here rule daughter So I said rule take prepared stay home teenage year
She thought little said ok
However said one requirement
She need car
There go requires car order comply rule
Here question reader Consider following example Rule A Driver Vehicle must valid Driver License
Rule A Driver License must considered valid following true Any one requirement enforce rule different degree efficiency effectiveness
Which business requirement appropriate largely depends corporation business strategy business risk tolerance budget
The important point remember business rule need guide behavior
However choose implement enforce rule different matter
Do confuse two
A Customer must Email Address
Capability enter email address customer
This easily implemented providing GUI enter email address
Now consider simple change business rule Revised Rule A Customer must Email Address
A second rule required define email address
Rule An Email Address must considered Valid email sent Email Address return within minute
Capability immediately send email customer email address received
Notice change one word business rule mean different additional requirement
Keep mind one affect
The question I want leave What need manage
The rule requirement
Plainly speaking main thing need remember Gladys

Welcoming new visitor process workflow consisting step taken whereas saying every new visitor must welcomed business rule
Further business logic procedural whereas business rule declarative
For example website might allow visitor add item shopping cart specify shipping address supply payment information
The business logic website might include workflow There also business rule website The web site software also contains code considered part business logic business rule Business logic could anywhere program
For example given certain format address database table could created column correspond exactly field specified business logic type check added make sure invalid data added
Business logic often change
For example set allowable address format might change online retailer start shipping product new country
Thus often seen desirable make code implement business logic relatively isolated
This make likely change business logic require small set code change one part code
Distant strongly coupled code also creates risk programmer make necessary change miss part system leading incorrect operation
A formalizes decoupling creating separate tier layer
Each layer know minimal amount code layer enough accomplish necessary task
For example paradigm controller view layer might made small possible business logic concentrated model
In example controller determines sequence web page checkout sequence also responsible validating email address payment information satisfy business rule rather leaving database database access code
Alternative paradigm possible
For example relatively simple business entity generic view controller could access database object contain relevant business logic format accept change possible known
Some tiered scheme use either distinct consider business logic layer one
Business logic extracted procedural code using BRMS
The software development us BRMSs enforces strong separation business logic code

Ilana DeBare Chronicle Staff Writer Caption Close College student graduating field computer science business finding great job market second consecutive year
But year market quite hot last year sizzler career placement adviser say
Meanwhile student field English likely end significantly lower salary fewer offer techie peer
Last year lot employer hungry even liberal art major getting multiple offer much case year said Employers gather data job offer college grad
The hot field computer science health care medicine finance medium entertainment said president undergraduate recruiting
With unemployment low percent nationally percent San Francisco company continuing scramble hire notch worker
Beneficiaries scramble include many estimated million college business school graduate entering workforce summer
Take Zakiyyah Langford
A computer science major Stanford received five job offer ranging winter settling technical position Merrill Lynch
In addition company offered signing bonus
I heard anyone computer science complaining job market Langford said
Or take economics major
Chun felt secure enough job prospect turn several offer paid much exactly wanted
I trying rush thing said
There lot opportunity
It matter patient
My ideal job would equity analyst evaluates company
The strong job market limited university like Berkeley Stanford
At Hayward accounting major choosing multiple job offer ranging
Computer science student also well said coordinator campus recruiting CSU Hayward
I seen company like Bank America offering company offering
I stunned
But liberal art grad matter college go garnering salary comparable student computer financial skill
A national NACE survey released week concluded English major offered average psychology major offered average
That much le average computer science major
What English major realize game advised Woolley
In short term engineering major get better compensation
But long term company looking people manage people mean looking people good analytical presentation motivation skill
College career adviser noted one big new development Students company use Internet ever part recruiting
UC Berkeley system allows student post resume career center Web page resume individual employer
Everything convenient You push button said Chun economics major
The Internet also similar impact firm conducted interview year past year
It fewer firm recruiting student It many used Internet initial search screening
Then asked chosen candidate come interview company site
Schools like Berkeley Stanford Harvard probably always recruiting said manager employer relation
State career office
But school like
State getting much recruiting
Eventually Web student go campus interview
What new grad looking job
Salary important course
But well aware going stay one job one company life many member class say priority job build skill
Langford instance chose Merrill Lynch firm AT T IBM American Express training program
The company train Langford two month security industry work four month technology system
After rotate four different position two year including rotation overseas
People looking employer help develop portfolio skill since see staying first job many year said director career center UC Berkeley
Jobs startup goal growing number student especially school like Stanford close tie Silicon Valley
At Stanford engineering student even organized job fair solely focused startup firm
I see lot student avoiding big company like looking excitement startup said assistant director Stanford career development center
Everybody want next agreed Stanford sophomore referring founder Yahoo
For much money excitement feeling like part team making contribution development something
Not student course focused Choi Langford
I completely lost I graduating May said English major UC Berkeley
And focused making money launching career
Ciel Yogis another Berkeley English major plan look time work allow continue tutoring high school student poetry
I know I sacrificing big buck I love said

A rule defines constrains aspect always resolve either true false
Business rule intended assert business structure control influence behavior business
Business rule describe operation definition constraint apply organization
Business rule apply people process corporate behavior computing system organization put place help organization achieve goal
For example business rule might state
Other example business rule include requiring rental agent disallow rental tenant credit rating low requiring company agent use list preferred supplier supply schedule
While business rule may informal even unwritten documenting rule clearly making sure conflict valuable activity
When carefully managed rule used help organization better achieve goal remove obstacle market growth reduce costly mistake improve communication comply legal requirement increase customer loyalty
tell organization detail strategy tell focus business macro level optimize result
Put differently strategy provides direction organization
Business rule provide detailed guidance strategy translated action
Business rule exist organization whether ever written talked even part organization consciousness
However fairly common practice organization gather business rule
This may happen one two way
Organizations may choose proactively describe business practice producing database rule
While activity may beneficial may expensive
For example might hire consultant comb organization document consolidate various standard method currently practice
More commonly business rule discovered documented informally initial stage project
In case collecting business rule incidental
In addition business project launching new product complex process might lead definition new business rule
This practice incidental emergent business rule gathering vulnerable creation inconsistent even conflicting business rule within different organizational unit within organizational unit time
This inconsistency creates problem difficult find fix
Allowing business rule documented course business project le expensive easier accomplish first approach rule collected consistent manner valuable
In order teach business people best way gather document business rule expert business analysis created
This methodology defines process capturing business rule natural language verifiable understandable way
This process difficult learn performed empowers business stakeholder manage business rule consistent manner
Gathering business rule also called rule harvesting
The consultant extract rule IT documentation like use case specification system code
They may also organize workshop interview subject matter expert commonly abbreviated SMEs
Software technology designed capture business rule analysis legacy source code actual user behavior accelerate rule gathering processing
According white paper Business Rules Group statement business rule fall one four category The basic element business rule language used express
The definition term business rule describes people think talk thing
Thus defining term establishing category business rule
Terms traditionally documented entity
The nature operating structure organization described term fact relate term
To say customer place order NOT business rule
documented natural language sentence relationship attribute generalization structure graphical model
Every enterprise constrains behavior way closely related constraint data may may updated
To prevent record made many case prevent action taking place
Business rule including law nature define one form may transformed knowledge possibly different form
Business rule gathered situation This lack consistent approach mostly due cost effort required maintain list rule While newer software tool able combine business rule management execution important realize two idea distinct provides value different
Software package automate business rule using
The term sometimes used interchangeably however latter connotes engineering practice former intrinsic business practice
There value outlining organization business rule regardless whether information used automate operation
One pitfall trying fill gap rule management execution trying give business rule syntax logic merely describing logical construct natural language
Translation engine easier business user longer able write rule
Business rule expressed using modeling approach SBVR
Business rule encoded computer code operational program known

Okay okay yes true country around world still experiencing recession yes mean fewer job
But fear
Computer Science IT seems exception rule
In fact job market constantly growing
This one related reason number
Not constant stream job offer Computer Science IT position job also offer excellent competitive pay starting salary
That right
Money bonus getting job Computer Science IT
This sector one highest rate job satisfaction around
It true job satisfaction taken big hit recently even recent study UK found double national average work sector
Still pretty positive ask
Yep desktop PCs
Even within mainstream computing industry huge range career option programming database management networking desktop support
But graduate programme also prepared specialise far wider area interest
Computer technology part nearly everything nowadays
Ever thought biotechnology nanotechnology robotics
A degree computing could lead one field
Just check many
So much computer science practical
But mean heavy lifting manual grunt work
You learn understand theory often get make thing change thing actually apply learned everywhere
Every single day people world use thing help create understand exactly work
Go freelance
You start picking key skill computing right beginning
So set local area IT support web development whatever else gain even skill study
It nice money maker managing punishing student budget
If want focus job consider
What I say help think
Try pick argument computer scientist I dare
Logic help everyday life
And computer science sharpen skill every day
Okay day sound like positive reason
But field family friend admire knowledge count fix computing problem
Help mom Google please
I geek friend geek
But true computing cool
The stereotype nerd geek holed dark room headset mouse monitor sipping mountain dew munching crisp okay fair would fit image
But computing student professional diverse huge range personality interest
We even real life friend
Take test find country fit best
Are sure English language level

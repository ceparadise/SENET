A also referred Contract Work Breakdown Structure CWBS breakdown project smaller component
A work breakdown structure key project deliverable organizes team manageable section
The PMBOK defines work breakdown structure A hierarchical decomposition total work carried accomplish project objective create required deliverable
A structure element may combination thereof
A WBS also provides necessary framework detailed cost estimating control along providing guidance development control
WBS hierarchical incremental decomposition project phase deliverable work package
It show subdivision effort required achieve objective example
In project contract WBS developed starting end objective successively subdividing manageable component term size duration responsibility system subsystem component subtasks work package include step necessary achieve objective
The work breakdown structure provides common framework natural development overall planning control contract basis dividing work definable increment developed technical schedule cost labor hour reporting established
A work breakdown structure permit summing subordinate cost task material successively higher level parent task material etc
For element work breakdown structure description task performed generated
This technique sometimes called used define organize total
The WBS organized around primary product project planned outcome instead work needed produce product planned action
Since planned outcome desired end project form relatively stable set category cost planned action needed achieve collected
A WBS make easy assign project activity one one terminal element WBS
In addition function cost accounting WBS also help map requirement one level system specification another example requirement cross reference matrix mapping functional requirement high level low level design document
The WBS may displayed horizontally form vertically tree structure like organization chart
The development WBS normally occurs start project precedes detailed project task planning
The concept work breakdown structure developed PERT DoD
PERT introduced Navy support development missile program
While term work breakdown structure used first implementation PERT organize task category
By June DoD aerospace industry published document system described WBS approach
This guide endorsed Secretary Defense adoption service
In DoD issued Work Breakdown Structures Defense Materiel Items requiring use work breakdown structure across DoD
The document revised several time recently
The current version document found Work Breakdown Structures Defense Materiel Items
It includes WBS definition specific defense materiel commodity system address WBS element common system
Defense Materiel Item category The common element identified Appendix L Integration assembly test checkout Systems engineering Program management System test evaluation Training Data Peculiar support equipment Common support equipment activation Industrial facility Initial spare repair part
The standard also includes additional common element unique Space Systems Launch Vehicle Systems Automated Information Systems
In PMI documented expansion technique across organization
The PMBOK Guide provides overview WBS concept Practice Standard Work Breakdown Structures comparable DoD standard intended general application
An important design principle work breakdown structure called rule
It defined follows In addition rule important overlap scope definition different element work breakdown structure
This ambiguity could result duplicated work miscommunications responsibility authority
Such overlap could also cause confusion regarding project cost accounting
If WBS element name ambiguous WBS dictionary help clarify distinction WBS element
The WBS Dictionary describes component WBS deliverable activity scope sometimes date cost quality
If work breakdown structure designer attempt capture detail WBS designer likely include either many action action
Too many action exceed parent scope fall short parent scope
The best way adhere rule define WBS element term outcome result action
This also ensures WBS overly prescriptive method allowing greater ingenuity creative thinking part project participant
For new product development project common technique ensure WBS use
may use similar technique employ feature breakdown structure
When project provides professional service common technique capture planned deliverable create WBS
Work breakdown structure subdivide work project phase
preliminary design phase critical design phase must ensure phase clearly separated deliverable also used defining entry
approved preliminary critical
One must decide stop dividing work smaller element
This assist determining duration activity necessary produce deliverable defined WBS
There several heuristic rule thumb used determining appropriate duration activity group activity necessary produce specific deliverable defined WBS
A work package activity level task It common work breakdown structure element numbered sequentially reveal hierarchical structure
The purpose numbering provide consistent approach identifying managing WBS across like system regardless vendor service
For example example identifies item Level WBS element since three number separated
A coding scheme also help WBS element recognized written context allows mapping WBS Dictionary
A practical example WBS coding scheme The lowest element terminal element one subdivided
In Work Breakdown Structure element activity also known work package item term linked scheduled
At juncture WBS element organization unit control account work package established performance planned measured recorded controlled
A WBS expressed level interest
Three level minimum recommended additional level item high cost high risk two level detail case system engineering program management standard showing example WBS varying depth software development point going level system level
The higher WBS structure consistent whatever norm template mandate exist within organization domain
For example shipbuilding Navy must respect nautical term hierarchy structure put embedded Naval Architecture matching Navy office procedure built match naval architecture structure significant change WBS element numbering naming hierarchy would unacceptable
The figure left show work breakdown structure construction technique demonstrates rule progressive elaboration technique
At WBS Level show unit work total scope project design build custom bicycle
At WBS Level unit divided seven element
The number unit allocated element work based effort cost estimate task duration
The three largest element WBS Level subdivided Level
The two largest element Level represent total scope project
These larger element could subdivided using technique described
WBS design supported software
allow automatic rolling point value
Estimates effort cost developed discussion among project team member
This collaborative technique build greater insight scope definition underlying assumption consensus regarding level granularity required manage project

The work breakdown structure WBS vehicle breaking engineering project subproject task subtasks work package
It important planning tool link objective resource activity logical framework
It becomes important status monitor actual implementation completion subtasks measured project plan
Whereas WBS widely used many engineering application seemingly rarely formally applied software project various reason
Recent success software project WBSs however clearly indicated technique applied shown benefit tool management project
This paper advocate summarizes use WBS software implementation project
It also identifies problem people generating software WBSs need standard checklist item included

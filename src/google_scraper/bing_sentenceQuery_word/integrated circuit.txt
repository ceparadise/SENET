RFICs analog circuit usually run frequency range kHz GHz hertz billion hertz circuit would work THz trillion hertz development
They usually thought ASICs even though may configurable several similar application
Most circuit operate MHz million hertz cause electronic component connecting path interfere unusual way

A special type RFIC known monolithic microwave IC MMIC also called microwave monolithic IC
These circuit usually run range frequency used system power amplifier cellular telephone
Just travel faster velocity different type semiconductor material
offer much resistance circuit GaAs often used MMICs
Unfortunately GaAs mechanically much le sound silicon
It break easily GaAs wafer usually much expensive build silicon wafer
Any material classified one three type
A conductor salt easily conduct abundance free
An insulator dry conduct electricity poorly free electron
A semiconductor arsenide somewhere conductor insulator
It capable conducting electricity much
Most ICs made abundant ordinary beach sand
Pure crystalline silicon semiconducting material high electrical current normal room temperature
However addition certain impurity known dopants silicon made conduct usable current
In particular doped silicon used switch turning current desired
The process introducing impurity known doping implantation
Depending dopant atomic structure result implantation either negative positive semiconductor
An semiconductor result implanting dopant electron outer bonding shell silicon
The resulting semiconductor crystal contains excess free electron available conducting current
A semiconductor result implanting dopant atom fewer electron outer shell silicon
The resulting crystal contains bonding structure electron would normally located
In essence hole move crystal conducting positive charge
A semiconductor useful
However joining opposite material creates called junction
A junction form barrier conduction material
Although electron material attracted hole material electron normally energetic enough overcome intervening barrier
However additional energy provided electron material capable crossing barrier current flow
This additional energy supplied applying positive voltage material
The negatively charged electron highly attracted positive voltage across junction
A junction conduct electricity energy added material called electron move forward hole
If voltage applied opposite positive voltage connected side current flow
The electron material still attracted positive voltage voltage side barrier electron
In state junction said
Since junction conduct electricity one direction type
Diodes essential building block semiconductor switch
Bringing negative voltage close centre long strip material repel nearby electron material thus form transform strip middle material
This change polarity using give transistor name
While voltage applied exist two junction along strip back
One two junction always
Since junction conduct current flow strip
The field effect used create switch transistor turn current simply applying removing small voltage nearby order create destroy diode material
A transistor created using field effect called FET
The location voltage applied known gate
The gate separated transistor strip thin layer insulation prevent flow electron semiconductor input source output drain electrode
Similarly switch made placing positive gate voltage near strip material
A positive voltage attracts electron thus form region within strip
This creates two junction diode
As one diode always stop current flowing
FETs good building logic circuit require small current switching
No current required holding transistor state voltage maintain state
This type switching help preserve battery life
A FET called unipolar one polarity main conduction method either hole electron
There two basic type FETs
The type described previously FET since region depleted natural charge
The field effect also used create called FET region appear similar surrounding region
An FET made two region material separated small region
As FET naturally contains two normally switched
However positive voltage placed gate voltage attracts electron creates material middle region filling gap previously material
The gate voltage thus creates continuous region across entire strip allowing current flow one side
This turn transistor
Similarly FET made two region material separated small region
The gate voltage required turning transistor negative
FETs switch faster FETs require change near surface gate rather way material
Recall placing positive voltage gate FET turn switch
Placing voltage gate FET turn switch
Likewise placing negative voltage gate turn
These FETs always respond opposite complementary fashion given gate voltage
Thus gate FET connected voltage applied common gate operate complementary pair turning one leaving
A pair transistor way called complementary semiconductor CMOS
Because complementary transistor pair quickly switch two logic state CMOSs useful logic circuit
In particular one circuit time CMOSs require le power often used device special memory hold date time system
Bipolar transistor simultaneously use hole electron conduct hence name two polarity
Like FETs bipolar transistor contain material configured input middle output region
In bipolar transistor however region referred emitter base collector
Instead relying FETs secondary voltage source change polarity beneath gate field effect bipolar transistor use secondary voltage source provide enough energy electron punch junction
As electron energized jump collector complete circuit
Note even highly energetic electron middle section material must extremely thin electron pas junction
A bipolar base region fabricated much smaller CMOS gate
This smaller size enables bipolar transistor operate much faster CMOS transistor
Bipolar transistor typically used application speed important ICs
On hand although bipolar transistor faster FETs use le current
The type switch designer selects depends benefit important application speed power saving
This one many decision engineer make designing circuit
All ICs use basic principle voltage
In particular equation based determine many circuit design choice
Design engineer must also familiar property various component needed different application
As mentioned earlier analog circuit take infinitely variable voltage current modifies useful way
The signal might amplified compared another signal mixed signal separated signal examined value otherwise manipulated
For design type circuit choice every individual component size placement connection crucial
Unique decision instance whether one connection slightly wider another connection whether one oriented parallel perpendicular another whether one lie top another
Every small detail affect final performance end product
When integrated circuit much simpler component value could calculated hand
For instance specific amplification value gain could typically calculated ratio two specific resistor
The current circuit could determined using resistor value required amplifier gain supply voltage used
As design became complex laboratory measurement used characterize device
Engineers drew graph device characteristic across several variable referred graph needed information calculation
As scientist improved characterization intricate physic device developed complex equation took account subtle effect apparent coarse laboratory measurement
For example transistor work differently different frequency size orientation placement
In particular scientist found parasitic component unwanted effect usually resistance way device built
Parasitics become problematic circuitry becomes sophisticated smaller run higher frequency
Although parasitic component circuit accounted sophisticated equation calculation hand
For work computer become indispensable
In particular program developed Berkeley SPICE Simulation Program Integrated Circuit Emphasis various model designed use course industry analog circuit design
SPICE equation component well length wire turn wire reduce calculation circuit interaction hour month formerly required hand calculation
Since digital circuit involve million time many component analog circuit much design work done copying reusing circuit function especially using digital design software contains library prestructured circuit component
The component available library similar height contain contact point predefined location rigid conformity fit together regardless configures layout
While SPICE perfectly adequate analyzing analog circuit equation describe individual component complexity digital circuit requires approach
Therefore digital analysis software ignores individual component mathematical model entire preconfigured circuit block logic function
Whether analog digital circuitry used depends function circuit
The design layout analog circuit demanding teamwork time experience particularly circuit frequency get higher though skilled digital designer layout engineer great benefit overseeing automated process well
Digital design emphasizes different skill analog design
For design contain analog digital circuitry chip standard analog digital simulator sufficient
Instead special behavioral simulator used employing simplifying idea behind digital simulator model entire circuit rather individual transistor
Behavioral simulator designed primarily speed simulation analog side
The difficulty behavioral simulation making sure model analog circuit function accurate
Since analog circuit unique seems though one must design system design circuitry design model simulator

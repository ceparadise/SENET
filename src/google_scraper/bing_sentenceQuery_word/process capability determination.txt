Harry run factory make cell phone
His customer expect certain thing Harry cell phone
They want phone simple use long battery life reliable
Customers always want certain thing product buy
For example Harry customer want cell phone never drop call though settle one rarely drop call
How Harry make sure meeting customer expectation
Process capability one way company make sure making product meet customer demand
To help Harry understand use process capability let look closer element used calculate
Harry want make sure company cell phone meet customer expectation
Specifically know ca make every single cell phone perfect want make sure whole cell phone dropping many call customer go different brand
Since Harry run factory particularly interested way process manufacturing meet customer expectation
ability company produce product meet customer demand
Let say Harry option two different manufacturing process factory
Process make cell phone automatically drop every phone call
That phone call dropped
Instead process Harry could use process make phone randomly drop call
Which process meet Harry customer demand
Possibly know sure Harry need statistical analysis
That lead u another important point process capability
It statistical analysis whether process used company capable meeting customer demand
If paying attention already know process capability using statistic analyze effective company process
But element go statistical analysis
To calculate process capability Harry need certain information
Specifically need important piece information
First need minimum maximum customer put
For example perhaps Harry customer willing put phone drop call
Then customer tolerance range
Get FREE access day create account
In addition Harry need know variation within process much difference one outcome another
For example remember process make phone randomly drop call
That range difference phone
The production variation curve usually expressed term one standard deviation mean
For example production mean process might sigma
In case average mean phone drop call
A phone one sigma standard deviation mean might drop call
A phone two standard deviation mean drop call
Generally production variation curve includes value three sigma three sigma mean
So process production variation curve call dropped call dropped
In ideal world want production variation curve much smaller customer tolerance range
That way something go wrong customer satisfied
If production variation curve customer tolerance range identical wiggle room
ability company produce product meet customer demand
It statistical analysis whether process used company capable meeting customer demand
The two main element go calculating process capability minimum maximum customer put variation within process
The production variation curve usually six sigma one standard deviation mean
Ideally production variation curve much smaller customer tolerance range

concept design system one existing
A known system communicable unforgeable authority
It refers value along associated set
A must use capability access object
security refers principle designing user program directly share capability according operating system infrastructure necessary make transaction efficient secure
security contrasted approach us
Although operating system implement facility resembles capability typically provide enough support allow exchange capability among possibly mutually untrusting entity primary mean granting distributing access right throughout system
A system contrast designed goal mind
Capabilities discussed article confused
The latter privilege transferred process
Capabilities achieve objective improving system security used place forgeable
A forgeable reference example identifies object specify access right appropriate object user program hold reference
Consequently attempt access referenced object must validated operating system based requesting program typically via use ACL
Instead system capability mere fact user program posse capability entitles use referenced object accordance right specified capability
In theory system capability remove need access control list similar mechanism giving entity capability actually need
A capability typically implemented consists section specifies access right section uniquely identifies object accessed
The user access data structure object directly instead via
In practice used much like traditional operating system traditional handle access every object system
Capabilities typically stored operating system list mechanism place prevent program directly modifying content capability forge access right change object point
Some system also based hardware support capability
Programs possessing capability perform function passing program converting version deleting
The operating system must ensure specific operation occur capability system order maintain integrity security policy
A defined protected reference virtue possession user process grant process capability hence name interact object certain way
Those way might include reading data associated object modifying object executing data object process conceivable access right
The capability logically consists reference uniquely identifies particular object set one right
Suppose user process memory space exists following string Although identifies unique object system specify access right hence capability
Suppose instead following two value This identifies object along set access right
It however still capability user process value say nothing whether access would actually legitimate
Now suppose user program successfully executes following statement The variable contains index file descriptor process file descriptor table
This file descriptor capability
Its existence process file descriptor table sufficient know process indeed legitimate access object
A key feature arrangement file descriptor table directly manipulated user program
In traditional operating system program often communicate storage using reference like first two example
Path name often passed parameter sent via socket stored disk
These reference capability must validated used
In system central question whose given reference evaluated
This becomes critical issue especially process must act behalf two different entity
They become susceptible programming error known frequently resulting
In system capability passed process storage using mechanism known operating system maintain integrity capability
One novel approach solving problem involves use operating system
This realised
See
In system need entity discarded capability invalidated hence require mechanism restore capability later time
The operating system maintains integrity security capability contained within storage volatile nonvolatile time part performing task rather requiring user program case operating system
Because user program relieved responsibility need trust reproduce legal capability validate request access using mechanism
POSIX draft specifies concept permission called capability
However POSIX capability differ capability capability associated object process capability listen TCP port
In contrast Capsicum capability FreeBSD Linux hybridize true model UNIX design POSIX API
Capsicum capability refined form file descriptor delegable right process additional object type beyond classic POSIX process referenced via capability
In Capsicum capability mode process unable utilize global namespaces filesystem namespace look object must instead inherit delegated
Research commercial system employing security include following currently used POSIX capability Linux

A unique combination tool material method people engaged producing measurable output example manufacturing line machine part
All process inherent evaluated statistical method
The measurable property process specification expressed C C P P
The output measurement usually illustrated calculation predict many part produced specification OOS
Two part process capability measure variability output process compare variability proposed specification product tolerance
The input process usually least one measurable characteristic used specify output
These analyzed statistically output data show process described process average
A process need established appropriate place
A analysis used determine whether process statistical control
If process statistical control capability meaning
Therefore process capability involves
A batch data need obtained measured output process
The data included precise result however estimate achieved data point
This include normal variety production condition material people process
With manufactured product common include least three different production run including
The process mean average standard deviation calculated
With normal distribution tail extend well beyond plus minus three standard deviation interval contain production output
Therefore normal distribution data process capability often described relationship six standard deviation required specification
The output process expected meet customer requirement
Engineers conduct process capability study determine extent process meet expectation
The ability process meet specification expressed single number using assessed using
Either case requires running process obtain enough measurable output engineering confident process stable process mean variability reliably estimated
defines technique properly differentiate stable process process drifting experiencing change mean output process growing variable
meaningful process stable state

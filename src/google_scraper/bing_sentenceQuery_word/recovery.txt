In also called basic
A record collection possibly different data type typically fixed number sequence
The field record may also called particularly
Fields may also called though risk confusion element
A may may considered record vice versa depending convention specific programming language
For example date could stored record containing numeric field field represented string numeric field
A Personnel record might contain
A Circle record might contain instance center might represented record containing coordinate
Records distinguished fact number field typically fixed field name field may different type
A describes value variable
Most modern computer language allow programmer define new record type
The definition includes specifying data type field name label accessed
In field name generally preferred due simplicity proper record type studied language
Since record may contain field addition data express many feature
Records exist storage medium including
Records fundamental component data structure especially
Many computer organized array often grouped larger physical record efficiency
The parameter often viewed field record variable argument passed function viewed record value get assigned variable time call
Also often used implement procedure call entry containing procedure parameter local variable return address internal field
An object language essentially record contains procedure specialized handle record object type elaboration record type
Indeed language record special case object known PODSs contrast object use OO feature
A record viewed computer analog
In vein record type viewed computer language analog two implementation abstract specific language
A record may zero A key field set field record serf identifier
A unique key often called simply
For example employee file might contain employee number name department salary
The employee number unique organization would primary key
Depending storage medium file organization employee number might also stored separate file make lookup faster
The department code may unique may also indexed case would considered
If indexed entire employee file would scanned produce listing employee specific department
The salary field would normally considered usable key
Indexing one factor considered designing file
The concept record traced various type used since remote time
The modern notion record computer science field type size already implicit century mechanical calculator
The original medium used data opposed control used record punch card single record
Compare journal entry punch card
Records well established first half century data processing done using punched card
Typically record data file would recorded one punched card specific column assigned specific field
Generally record smallest unit could read external storage
card reader tape disk
Most implementation early special syntax record concept available extensively used use
Some early computer hardware support delimiting record field special instruction copying record
The concept record field central early file utility
first widespread programming language support record type record definition facility quite sophisticated time
The language allows definition nested record alphanumeric integer fractional field arbitrary size precision well field automatically format value assigned insertion currency sign decimal point digit group separator
Each file associated record variable data read written
COBOL also provides statement assigns corresponding field two record according name
The early language developed numeric computing support record type later version language add
The original lacking record except provided adequate surrogate
The one first language fully integrate record type basic type logically consistent type system
The programming language provided record
The programming language initially provided record concept kind template could laid top memory area rather true record data type
The latter provided eventually declaration two concept still distinct language
Most language designed Pascal also supported record
The selection field record value yield value
Some language may provide facility enumerate field record least field reference
This facility needed implement certain service
It requires degree
In system record subtyping operation value record type may also include In setting specific record type implies specific set field present value type may contain additional field
A record field would thus belong type record field would record field
The rationale passing record function expects record argument work since function find field requires within record
Many way practically implementing record programming language would trouble allowing variability matter central characteristic record type theoretical context
Most language allow assignment record exactly record type including field type name order
Depending language however two record data type defined separately may regarded distinct type even exactly field
Some language may also allow assignment record whose field different name matching field value corresponding field variable position within record example field called assigned record variable field
In alternative two operand still required sequence field type
Some language may also require corresponding type size encoding well whole record assigned uninterpreted
Other language may flexible regard require value field legally assigned corresponding variable field example field assigned field vice versa
Other language may match field value name rather position
These possibility apply comparison two record value equality
Some language may also allow order comparison using based comparison individual field
allows preceding type assignment also allows record structure terminology
In Algol array record integer field one could write obtain array integer consisting field element
As result statement would effect
In command would execute command sequence field record declared variable
So instead writing one could write
The representation record memory varies depending programming language
Usually field stored consecutive position memory order declared record type
This may result two field stored word memory indeed feature often used access specific bit word
On hand compiler add padding field mostly invisible programmer order comply alignment constraint imposed field must occupy single word
Some language may implement record array address pointing field possibly name type
Objects language often implemented rather complicated way especially language allow
A type record contains information identify record type locate information within record
It may contain offset element element therefore stored order may omitted
Alternatively various element record including element identifier simply follow one another order
The following show example record definition

As business become reliant tolerance decreased
A disaster devastating effect business
Studies shown many business fail experiencing significant data loss DR help
Recovery point objective recovery time objective two important measurement disaster recovery downtime
RPO maximum age file organization must recover backup normal operation resume disaster
The recovery point objective determines minimum frequency
For example organization RPO four hour system must back least every four hour
RTO maximum amount time following disaster organization recover file backup storage resume normal operation
In word recovery time objective maximum amount downtime organization handle
If organization RTO two hour longer
The RPO RTO help administrator choose optimal disaster recovery strategy technology procedure
Meeting tighter RTO window requires positioning accessed faster
one method restoring data quickly
This technology move backup data live state eliminating need move data across
It protect storage system failure
Before using organization need consider performance disk backup appliance time needed move data backup state live state
Since take minute organization may need perform want quicker recovery time
Preparing disaster requires comprehensive approach encompasses networking equipment power connectivity testing ensures DR achievable within RTO RPO target
While implementing thorough small task potential benefit significant
A disaster recovery plan provides structured approach responding unplanned incident threaten company IT including hardware software network procedure people
The plan provides disaster recovery strategy recovering disrupted system network minimize negative impact company operation
A identifies potential threat IT infrastructure DR plan outline recover element important company
SearchDisasterRecovery help facilitate initiation completion IT DR plan
According independent consultant Paul Kirvan component needed DR plan include following According Kirvan development team include following activity creating DR plan An organization consider disaster recovery plan living document
The DR plan need scheduled review update ensure accurate work recovery required
The plan ahould also updated whenever change business could affect disaster recovery
Testing critical DR planning helping identify gap providing chance rehearse action event crisis
A DR plan lot moving part testing help organization understand exactly employee disaster recovery scenario
SearchDisasterRecovery help organization build execute DR test
An organization schedule testing disaster recovery policy wary intrusive
DR testing frequently draining personnel organization le frequent schedule often delay testing
In addition organization test DR plan system change
One way testing run disaster mode period time example failing recovery site letting system run week failing back
Here way get disaster recovery testing While optimal perform comprehensive disaster recovery test may always possible lack funding time resource
In case organization still bring together key participant distribute relevant document perform walkthrough test
There risk DR testing approach technology thoroughly tested may work properly needed
Disaster recovery service method DR gained popularity recent year
Positives DRaaS include lower cost easier deployment ability test plan regularly
save company money running shared infrastructure
They flexible company sign service need
DR test completed simply spinning temporary instance
But disaster recovery may available disaster may enough room DR site run every DRaaS user application
Cloud DR also increase bandwidth need could degrade network performance complex system
Costs vary widely among vendor charge based network bandwidth consumption storage consumption add quickly
Before choosing organization conduct internal assessment determine disaster recovery need
Questions ask potential DRaaS provider include In cloud recovery situation organization plan failing workload back original location soon crisis resolved
However DRaaS provider support automated failback
At DR site organization recover restore technology infrastructure operation primary unavailable
DR site internal external
An organization set maintains internal disaster recovery site
Companies large information requirement aggressive RTOs likely use internal DR site typically second data center
Among consideration building internal site hardware configuration supporting equipment power maintenance heating cooling site layout design location staff
An organization may want perform risk assessment recovery site primary data center
The internal site option often much expensive external site major advantage control aspect disaster recovery process
An outside provider owns operates external disaster recovery site
External site
Distance key element disaster recovery site
A closer site easier manage far enough away impacted major disaster affecting primary data center
Sites farther away may require staff drive cost
A site another option
This method cheaper us le company resource infrastructure user need mindful bandwidth security
Regarding site organization consider site proximity internal external resource operational risk cost contracting disaster recovery service provider
In Share Technical working presented description disaster recovery service level using tier
Tier represents least amount recoverability tier represents
A tier later added include represents highest level availability disaster recovery scenario
In general ability recover improves next highest tier cost also increase

To format drive floppy disk etc
mean prepare chosen drive used deleting data setting
The popular file system support Windows also sometimes used
In Windows formatting partition usually done tool
You also format drive using like
It might help know partition usually encompasses entire physical hard drive
That often say format drive reality formatting partition drive happens partition may whole size drive
Formatting ca usually done accident worry delete mistake
However cautious formatting anything sure know
Here common thing might related formatting Some device like camera let format storage device
It similar format hard drive using computer thing possible digital camera maybe even gaming console device might need hard drive formatted
Formatting C drive whatever letter happens identify partition Windows installed must done Windows ca erase file currently using
Doing outside OS mean file actively running therefore deleted
See instruction
If looking information formatting existing hard drive install Windows worry manually format hard drive
Formatting hard drive part clean install method installing Windows
See information
If want format device change file system say NTFS one way saving data first copy file drive empty
You might able recover file partition even formatted
Some able many free definitely worth try accidentally formatted partition held valuable data
There two different type formatting high level low level
High level formatting involves writing file system disk data organized understood software reading writing
Low level formatting track outlined disk
This done manufacturer drive even sold
The word format also used describe way thing arranged structured file system
For example format associated visible property object like text image
Word processing program like Microsoft Word example format text make centered page appear different font type
Format term used describe way file encoded organized well usually identified

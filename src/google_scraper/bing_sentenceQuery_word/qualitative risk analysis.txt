Risk Analysis often conducted two different way Qualitative Quantitative
For proper risk assessment project plan project management system vital understand basic defining difference

A common assumption following completion project would sun would rise next day
Suppose moment sun rise
The severity risk would threaten completion project project
In word risk posed sun rising extremely high however likelihood happening relatively small
On hand consider different sort risk
Consider one billing system server destroyed
The likelihood happening considerably higher likelihood sun rising
Unless database recently backed severity risk relatively low
In word neither risk rise level would threaten completion project

Qualitative Risk Analysis Quantitative Risk Analysis This risk analysis used identify issue cause hindrance project become risk factor future
This risk analysis focused implementation measure established protect risk defined already
It important quantify threat frequency
Results facilitate management risk return security investment
Risk analysis result necessarily expressed monetary value
Risk analysis result expressed specific quantifiable term like monetary value easier understanding
It easier involve people even expert risk analysis participate
The accuracy risk analysis increase time organization build historic record data gaining experience
It difficult form control implementation basis analysis
The process reach credible result consensus time consuming
Results dependent skill team conducting risk analysis
The process requires expertise difficult train people

Known business quants quantitative analyst develop implement complex mathematical model financial firm use make decision risk management investment pricing
Part speculator part ruthless logician quant aim reduce risk generate profit
Start search respected program recruiting student around US
Responsibilities differ according employer
hedge fund investment bank product focus
security commodity level expertise
A quant may required There quants expert specific area statistical arbitrage derivative pricing quantitative investment management algorithmic trading electronic market making quants play specific strength
For example shy retiring back office quant
quantitative may deeply involved researching validating statistical model generating new financial strategy
A front office quant
quantitative trader could working trader designing stock market algorithm supplying colleague pricing trading tool
We spoke Micah Spruill like work quantitative analyst
Below Micah discus pro con quant frequently used programming language advice student
Cons The know realize know
What I mean deeper go path realize chance hidden risk
In finance especially relying model always thought back head Did miss something overlooking anything usually difficult question answer
Add responsibility managing large sum money always certain level stress exists
I like view healthy stress though may fall prey overconfidence
Quants ultimate finance geek major employer typically hedge fund investment bank
You also find opportunity security commodity trader brokerage firm accounting company commercial bank insurance company financial consulting firm
Hedge fund trading firm tend pay best although compensation package often dependent firm earnings
Wall Street money quants everyone else
According median pay NY quantitative analyst national average
Salaries quantitative trader also tend run high major fund center Chicago Boston Stamford
If want home base might try Hong Kong London Sydney Singapore Tokyo Beijing
per year per year per year Even quant position employer expect see master degree résumé
This could targeted program quantitative finance finance operation research financial engineering
Or could related quantitative field physic statistic math
Unless outstanding math computational skill experience financial analysis MBA going cut
To qualify position job opening top firm need PhD math statistic physic computer science financial engineering like
Employment candidate PhD demonstrated ability work independently complex research project valuable asset large hedge fund invested blue sky project
Be aware competition quant role extreme
Employers especially top tier fund investment bank business making money
They put rigorous process test key technical skill
Michael founder put together excellent
There many certification explicitly targeted quants
So invest CFA CQF ask professor professional mentor certification measurable benefit career
Offered credential geared towards investment professional
To become CFA charterholder candidate must complete independent study program pas exam
Each exam requires approximately six month preparation
In addition charterholders must prove four year qualified professional work experience investment
Is CFA worth
The jury still
Some quants
financial engineer without PhD want boost qualification choose pursue CFA order give edge peer
But often mentioned job requirement quantitative analyst
The CQF training course certification
Sometimes billed alternative MFE online financial engineering program targeted individual interested quantitative finance
That includes derivative quantitative trading insurance model validation risk management
Courses workshop final exam completed one six month program divvied two level
Quants spend lot time looking screen
If fascinated finance world would like broader set job task alternative include You also option retreat academia research pure Mathematician buff programming skill investigate engineering role
Opportunities quants include Quantitative developer usually advanced experience le math finance expertise quantitative analyst
That mean lower proverbial pecking order
As developer work closely quant take prototype optimize make highly fault tolerant production environment
They may also responsible routine task like statistical coding maintaining legacy system
Although quant developer paid le quant analyst The one extremely role sits quantitative development arena star developer understands Unix network programming system in out Linux Kernel
These individual often found working secretive world Ultra Trading UHFT trade order measured Since BLS track specialized data science role statistic quantitative analyst job ironically difficult source
At moment BLS projecting employment financial analyst rather broad category faster average occupation
This percentage could well higher quantitative analyst

When use qualitative risk analysis evaluate risk designate risk high medium low depending two criterion severity impact probability event occurring
Here
By The first part risk management process identify potential risk project
Of course time manage every possible risk
You triage determine one important enough spend time
You risk analysis technique
Most project use qualitative risk analysis technique determine risk important enough manage
The technique qualitative since quick approximation reflect rigor detailed numerical analysis
When use qualitative risk analysis evaluate risk designate risk high medium low depending two severity impact probability event occurring
Here step involved technique You define high medium low mean project
That definition make subjective risk analysis technique
The following bullet point show one way apply qualitative risk analysis
Notice first line show risk highly likely occur high impact project
This obviously high overall risk
On hand last line show risk low impact likely happen anyway
This would certainly considered low risk
The combination fall somewhere within continuum
This one example risk categorization
But simple type risk analysis used project
Once risk categorized would want build risk plan high risk
The risk evaluated individually see manage risk ignore
You ignore risk

Risk analysis component risk management
Risks part every IT project business endeavor
As risk analysis occur recurring basis updated accommodate new potential threat
Strategic risk analysis minimizes future risk probability damage
The risk management process involves key step
First potential threat identified
For example risk associated individual using computer either incorrectly inappropriately creates security risk
Risks also related project completed timely manner resulting significant cost
Next quantitative qualitative risk analysis applied study identified risk
Quantitative risk analysis measure expected risk probability forecast estimated financial loss potential risk
Qualitative risk analysis use number review threat determines establishes risk mitigation method solution
A contingency plan may used risk analysis
If risk presented contingency plan help minimize damage

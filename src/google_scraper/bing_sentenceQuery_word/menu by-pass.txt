In used describe fashion
First proposed computer scientist generalization arrow provide way expressing relationship step computation
Unlike monad arrow limit step one one input
As result found use among application
While arrow use recognized distinct class Hughes would publish first definition
Until monad proven sufficient problem requiring combination program logic pure code
However useful library certain efficient parser defied rewriting monadic form
The formal concept arrow developed explain exception monadic code process monad turned arrow
Since arrow active area research
Their underlying law operation refined several time recent formulation arrow calculus requiring five law
In form proper subset Hughes arrow
While believed arrow time since proven arrow even general
In fact arrow merely equivalent directly equal Freyd category
Like type class arrow thought set quality applied
In arrow allow represented Haskell symbol combine form
However actual term arrow may also come fact arrow correspond also known arrow category theory different Kleisli category
As relatively new concept single standard definition formulation logically equivalent feature required method strictly obey certain mathematical law
The description currently used Haskell two basic operation Although two procedure strictly necessary define arrow method derived make arrow easier work practice theory
As arrow third operation class category One helpful method derived combination previous three In addition procedure arrow must obey certain rule type may applied The remaining law restrict piping method behaves order composition reversed also allowing simplifying Arrows may extended fit specific situation defining additional operation restriction
Commonly used version include arrow choice allow computation make decision arrow allow step take output input
Another set arrow known arrow application rarely used practice actually equivalent monad
Arrows several benefit mostly stemming ability make program logic explicit yet concise
Besides avoiding creates opportunity
This turn theoretically lead better easier feature like
Although program strictly requires arrow generalize away much dense pure declarative code would otherwise require
They also encourage giving common linkage program step class definition
The ability apply type generically also contributes reusability keep simple
Arrows disadvantage including initial effort defining arrow satisfies arrow law
Because monad usually easier implement extra feature arrow may unnecessary often preferable use monad
Another issue applies many construct efficiently code arrow style used computer

In simplest term study information data manipulated algorithm solve problem mostly theory also practice
Computer science study computer strictly require use computer
Data algorithm possible compute using pen paper make computer science misnomer
Computer science akin mathematics prefer use term informatics instead
Computer science often get conflated three field related exactly All said people nowadays use computer science term field involves programming data analysis manipulation interaction software hardware
In word computer science many concentration If plan studying computer science know
Schools even agree computer science entail let alone agree discipline belong computer science heading
Here list common type computer science may encounter one specializes
As see computer science one broadest field today In order graduate college university computer science degree study likely include minimum I would tell somebody give computer science simply right trait characteristic
If want pursue mean pursue
Hard work perseverance overcome kind shortcoming field
A degree cost minimum four year life
Know getting minimize chance wasting precious year
Someone good fit computer science Problem solving core skill computer scientist software engineer information technologist
If naturally curious feel urge figure thing find joy computer science career guaranteed
Furthermore computer science one fastest advancing field world today
If desire keep new language new library new application etc
may soon overwhelmed unless stick legacy field
Computer science also highly creative
You literally creating code scratch unlike writer painter musician
You think outside box practice
need determination make side time time
If none applies
If computer science intrigue think take good fit congratulation
You waiting ahead
There one thing need know want In beginning taste explore many different area computer science
You might surprised one like best certain one fun actually
But know one focus become master
Dabbling many area rarely make far career
On hand specialized expert take far
Required field marked Great

With reference C language explain header file give example use
b Explain using appropriate example cast operator used C expression
c Demonstrate function used C writing program read voltage current pass value function
The function calculate resistance return result
The main program display value R
Explain line following two program
include const unsigned int SET void main void unsigned int b c float b sizeof b c SET printf b c unsigned int printf b continued overleaf
ii include void main void float float register long h long printf h h printf h
Using example program illustrate answer write note discussing following reference C programming language The usage break statement ii array

b What following program display screen
Explain answer
include void main unsigned long long int char printf x x printf printf z z printf printf Z z printf c An electronic device report internal fault displaying two digit hex number display
Five bit hex number represent type error indicated table overleaf
You required produce program assist technician find type error reported device
Write program used check number displayed report type error
Your program read hex number displayed report type error reported
If one bit set program list error
It repeat user decides quit
continued overleaf
Motor jammed Current overload Timeout No supply No connection Errors corresponding bit position With reference C language explain meant pas reference using appropriate example
b Write program implement simple calculator using switch statement
The program operate reading two number separated one following four operator appropriate calculation performed number result displayed
For example entered program display result
If operator ampersand program quit otherwise repeat
c Write program read word us function test see word palindrome
A palindrome word spelt forward backwards
NAVAN palindrome
With reference C language discus difference text binary file
b Write program display menu following option Display list TCPIP address test Test address Add new address list Quit Your program store list address text file called
These address form
four decimal number separated period
Option therefore read address text file display

In case awarded five year
In general computer science degree program emphasize mathematical theoretical foundation computing
The core curriculum may depending school result degree including In many institution degree introduced upgrade regular bachelor program usually requires least one additional year study
Because computer science wide field course required earn bachelor computer science degree vary
A typical list course requirement includes topic Some school may place emphasis require additional course Beyond basic set computer science course student typically choose additional course variety different field Some school allow student specialize certain area computer science

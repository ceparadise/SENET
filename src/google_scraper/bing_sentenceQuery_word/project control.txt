A vital part science experiment control
What control science experiment may ask
Learn control use experiment better accurate result
By definition control science experiment sample remains throughout experiment
The control must remain equal time order receive accurate result
You many control necessary achieve result
For instance determining far certain weight move based wind velocity wind would control staying matter weight
Controls vital part science experiment
If point variable could affect end result experiment considered control
Your control may change experiment change
For instance may need different sample prove different hypothesis
When following must independent dependent variable
A control another type variable
The three type variable confused completely different
change occurring due person experiment
change based upon change independent variable
Controlled variable outside variable may affect dependent variable
The three variable sometimes easily mistaken
If identified control science experiment may mistaking one control independent variable
Remember control never change
If independent variable always remains odds control
Now covered control science experiment time see work practice
Not science experiment require control many
You create control sample following simple step
One great example creating control relatively simple experiment
The basis determine plant grow different type soil mixture
The control pot us regular potting soil daily routine water sun
The pot different soil mixture may exposed varying light temperature
Depending science experiment determine variable sample set must remain time
The control may directly apply every portion experiment relative plant experiment
Another great example creating control determining fast object sink object density
The control would using amount water exact size container
Be sure use type water well filtered unfiltered
Once science experiment start document control along independent dependent variable
This allows better monitor keep track controlled variable
Controlled variable must carefully set monitored throughout experiment
Any change control greatly alter experiment result

Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

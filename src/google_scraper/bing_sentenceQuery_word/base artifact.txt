also called collection data specially organized rapid search retrieval
Databases structured storage retrieval modification deletion data conjunction various operation
A DBMS extract information database response query
A brief treatment database follows
For full treatment
A database stored set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Using keywords various sorting command user rapidly search rearrange group select field many record retrieve create report particular data
Database record file must organized allow retrieval information
main way user retrieve database information
The power DBMS come ability define new relationship basic one given table use get response query
Typically user provides string character computer search database corresponding sequence provides source material character appear user request example record content field person word
The many user large database must able manipulate information within quickly given time
Moreover large business organization tend build many independent file containing related even overlapping data activity often require linking data several file
Several different type DBMS developed support requirement flat hierarchical network relational
Early system arranged sequentially alphabetically numerically chronologically development storage device made possible random access data via index
In flat database record organized according simple list entity many simple database personal computer flat structure
The record organized treelike structure level record branching set smaller category
Unlike hierarchical database provide single link set record different level create multiple linkage set placing link pointer one set record another speed versatility network database led wide use within business
used association file record expressed link simple flat list becomes one row table relation multiple relation mathematically associated yield desired information
Various Structured Query Language widely employed DBMS relational database
database store manipulate complex data structure called object organized hierarchical class may inherit property class higher chain database structure flexible adaptable
The information many database consists text document database primarily contain information statistic table financial data raw scientific technical data
Small database maintained system may used individual home
These larger database become increasingly important business life part commonly designed office software including program
Typical commercial database application include airline reservation function medical record hospital legal record insurance company
The largest database usually maintained governmental agency business organization university
These database may contain text material abstract report legal statute wire service newspaper journal encyclopaedia catalog various kind
Reference database contain bibliography index serve guide location information book periodical published literature
Thousands publicly accessible database exist covering topic ranging law medicine engineering news current event game classified advertisement instructional course
Increasingly formerly separate database combined electronically larger collection known
Businesses government agency employ software analyze multiple aspect data various pattern
For example government agency might flag human investigation company individual purchased suspicious quantity certain equipment material even though purchase spread around country various subsidiary

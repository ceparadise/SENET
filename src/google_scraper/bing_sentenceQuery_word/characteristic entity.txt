In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

Attribute Definition A property characteristic
For example attribute person would name age height etc Search Attribute UK US Search Attribute rest Computing Students

Relational database allow data separated connected across several table
Tables connected primary foreign key increase efficiency
The main characteristic When working relational database user need try keep
Each entity primary key provide unique reference entity mean entity referenced another table without call detail entity
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
Matt Clark explains BBC Sport us relational database store access information appears website Entities relate three different way You represent relationship using entity relationship diagram ERD
For example person address
For example cinema customer

These problem procedure data space program representing procedure particular programming language computer
Problems procedure often confused
A problem defined criterion determines whether proposed solution accepted
One understand problem completely without method solution
Procedures usually built elementary procedure
What elementary procedure may complex procedure constructed one first topic computer science
This subject hard understand since precise notion computable function guide u computability relative given collection initial function easy define
Procedures operate member certain data space produce member data space using general still data space intermediate
A number operation known constructing new data space simpler one yet general theory representable data space comparable theory computable function
Some result given
Programs symbolic expression representing procedure
The procedure may represented different program different programming language
We shall discus problem defining programming language semantically stating procedure program represent
As syntax programming language rule allow u determine whether expression belongs language formalized part syntax relate closely semantics well studied
The problem translating procedure one programming language another much studied shall try give definition correctness translation
Computers finite automaton
From point view computer defined effect executing program given input state memory output
Computer science must study various way element data space represented memory computer procedure represented computer program
From point view current work automaton theory beside point

An entity singular identifiable separate object
It refers individual organization system bit data even distinct system component considered significant
The term used number programming database management system design arena
An entity common denominator considered separate whole posse unique set characteristic
The following example use entity different context General computing Refers user component organization System Refers discrete separate component Database system Refers individual thing including people concept object data first stored database management system DBMS attribute relationship entity Open Systems Interconnection model OSI model Refers discrete system component use different protocol communicate programming OOP Synonymous object

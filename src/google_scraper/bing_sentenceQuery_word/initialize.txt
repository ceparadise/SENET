In assignment initial value variable
The manner initialization performed depends well type storage class object initialized
Programming construct perform initialization typically called
Initialization distinct preceded although two sometimes conflated practice
The complement initialization primarily used object variable
Initialization done either statically embedding value compile time else assignment
A section code performs initialization generally known initialization code may include function opening file initialization code may part class method instance method
Setting memory location zero also sometimes known clearing often performed instruction operand specifying variable level since requires additional memory access
In optional part
It consists character followed list expression placed curly bracket brace
The latter list sometimes called initializer list initialization list although term initializer list formally reserved initialization member
A declaration includes initialization commonly called
Many find convenient draw distinction term declaration definition commonly seen phrase distinction implying declaration merely designates data object function
In fact according definition declaration
Still usage declaration definition although formally incorrect common
C example example In within definition prior constructor body
It important note use initialization list value assigned variable
They initialized
In example initialized im
Example Here construct initializer list
Sometimes term initializer list also used refer list expression array struct initializer
provides mean template called
Data initialization may occur without explicit syntax program
For example declared without initializer initialized value zero corresponding type static object class type initialized

In abbreviation special type called
It prepares new object use often accepting constructor us set required
A constructor resembles differs method explicit implicitly usually different rule scope modifier
Constructors often name declaring
They task object establishing failing invariant invalid
A properly written constructor leaf resulting state
must initialized constructor
Most language allow constructor one constructor class differing parameter
Some language take consideration special type constructor
Constructors concretely use single class create object return new instance class abstracted also create object various way using multiple class different allocation scheme
Constructors take least one argument termed parameterized constructor
For example When object declared parameterized constructor initial value passed argument constructor function
The normal way object declaration may work
The constructor called explicitly implicitly
The method calling constructor implicitly also called method
If programmer supply constructor instantiable class language provide
The behavior default constructor language dependent
It may initialize data member zero value may nothing
Some language Java C VB default construct array class type contain
Languages without null reference may allow default construction array non default constructible object require explicit initialization time creation define action performed compiler copying class object
A copy constructor one formal parameter type class parameter may reference object
It used create copy existing object class
Even though class count conversion constructor
While copy constructor usually abbreviated nothing used using abbreviation
Conversion constructor provide mean compiler implicitly create object belonging one class based object different type
These constructor usually invoked implicitly convert argument operand appropriate type may also called explicitly
In take value reference object class used implement ownership transfer parameter object resource
In Java C VB constructor creates object special memory structure called reference type
Value type int double etc
created sequential structure called
VB C allow use create object value type
However language even use new value type creates object stack
In constructor invoked without new object created stack
When object created using new created heap
They must deleted implicitly destructor explicitly call operator
In constructor differ method Java constructor perform following task following order Java permit user call one constructor another constructor using keyword
But must first statement
Java provides access constructor keyword
A constructor taking zero number argument called constructor
As direct constructor like many programming language
They written This instantiated The equivalent creating function instantiates object This instantiated way
In constructor use method declaration name
Example constructor In static data initializer
Static constructor also called
Since actual method generated name often also called cctors
Static constructor allow complex static variable initialization
Static constructor called implicitly class first accessed
Any call class static constructor call trigger static constructor execution
Static constructor implement
When used class static constructor called every new generic instantiation one per type
Static variable instantiated well
In name constructor name class
It return nothing
It parameter like
Constructor function usually declared public section also declared protected private section user want restrict access
The constructor two part
First follows method body
It start colon entry
The initializer list required offer opportunity provide value data member avoid separate assignment statement
The initializer list required reference type data member member parameterless constructor logic
Assignments occur according order data member declared even order initializer list different
The second part body normal method body enclosed curly bracket
allows one constructor
The constructor must different parameter
Additionally constructor contain parameter given default value must adhere restriction parameter given default value
This situation matter default constructor
The constructor base class also called derived class
Constructor function inherited address referenced
When memory allocation required operator called implicitly
A copy constructor parameter type passed reference example
If provided explicitly compiler us copy constructor member variable simply copy value case primitive type
The default implementation efficient class dynamically allocated member handle resource lead double call double release resource upon destruction
Example invocation On returning object function passing object value object copy constructor called implicitly unless applies
implicitly generates default copy constructor call copy constructor base class member variable unless programmer provides one explicitly deletes copy constructor prevent cloning one base class member variable copy constructor deleted accessible private
Most case calling customized
pointer also require customizing
This commonly referred
In constructor include statement defined class
statement define private field statement execute code
Additional constructor defined using keyword
In routine initialize new object called
Creation procedure following trait Although object creation involves subtlety creation attribute typical declaration expressed creation instruction consists following sequence step In first snippet class defined
The procedure coded keyword
The keyword introduces list procedure used initialize instance
In case list includes procedure empty implementation inherited class procedure coded within class
In second snippet class client declaration type
In procedural code created origin
Because creation procedure specified procedure inherited class used
This line could coded
Only procedure named creation procedure used instruction keyword
Next creation instruction providing initial value coordinate
The third instruction make ordinary instance call procedure reinitialize instance attached different value
us method named constructor method
Create instance cheese
Since ColdFusion CFML also supported specifying name constructor method In constructor similar
The syntactic difference regular method keyword front name instead
It name though convention prefix
Creating instance class work like calling static method class
In version default constructor method create return object concretely meaning create return blessed reference
A typical object reference hash though rarely reference type used
By convention constructor named though allowed name otherwise multiple constructor
For example Person class may constructor named well constructor read file Person attribute us another Person object template
With Perl boilerplate left default created attribute specified well whether set reset required
In addition extra constructor functionality included method Moose generated constructor call checked argument
A method specified handle constructor argument hashref key value form
In case Person class instiated like In version constructor method named notice double underscore keyword automatically call creating object
It usually used automatically perform initialization property initialization
Constructors also accept argument case statement written also need send constructor argument parameter
In constructor defined one method
A new instance created calling class function call method
If constructor method defined class next one found class called
In typical case method need defined
The common exception immutable object
Classes normally act new instance class callable object like function call constructor calling class return instance class
However method permitted return something instance class specialised purpose
In case invoked
In constructor created defining method called
This method executed initialize new instance

As begin writing real code one first thing must familiarize variable close cousin constant
A variable according name something allows value vary
In programming use variable store data run program
A variable contrasted constant whose value allowed change
In programming use constant store information know never going change
Even though variable constant may sound different semantically reality quite similar
We start studying constant look variable variable easier understand understood constant
My name Erik I think fair say constant never ever change
The absolute zero temperature also constant never change either
The number second one hour constant well never change always second hour
A constant purpose computer programming consists two thing name value
The name clearly illustrate constant le
The value actual value constant example absolute zero number second hour
In programming book name constant uppercase letter
This allows u clearly identify constant soon run code thus able distinguish variable written using lower case letter
A constant created using const reserved word followed constant data type followed constant name finally followed sign value
Let create constant see look like
What would appropriate name constant example
Names variable constant always programmer suggestion For worry meaning int uint
They data type explain later
When picking name constant variable want expressive order reduce risk ambiguity also absolutely fine use abbreviation long name take whole screen
For example NBR nbr common abbreviation number one see lot
There another rule pick name name must consist alphanumerical character
well underscore
You use underscore separate word become legible
In programming term initialize two constant
When initialize constant variable two thing Constants useful want set value repeat many location inside program
If use constant rather wrote several different location program wherever wanted refer absolute zero ever wanted change different number would change multiple location rather one
According Murphy law saying anything go wrong go wrong
This usually recipe disaster often even forgot change one value could lead strange error run program
By declaring constant allows u easily change value constant time run program change code one location opposed many reduces risk introducing error code
Variables similar constant main difference constant change assigned value variable oftentimes
We define variable similar fashion define constant instead using reserved word const use var
Let introduce concept called declaration
Declaration thought initialization without giving variable value
When declare variable simply inform computer intention use variable program computer allocate memory
Sometimes may prefer give variable value immediately language typically older language actually forced declare variable beginning code regardless code intend use
In modern language best practice indicate preferable declare initialize variable close possible first use concept declaration significant anymore used
Still educational purpose let declare variable designed store current temperature That variable available use code change value many time like
In fact variable value often changed many time program sometimes even million time
Let say programming teacher asked write program simulates rolling dice time end sum roll present number screen
Your teacher instructed keep track progress using variable
How many variable might need
In case would need one variable keep track sum one keep track many time rolled dice
We might therefore start initializing variable start program yet rolled dice hence sum Remember initialize variable declare give type name well give value
We would also initialize variable yet rolled dice
Each time program roll dice would add number displayed dice variable
After first dice roll might second might third might etc
The point always keep track total sum roll name indicates
Also time rolled dice would increment stop running program reached
It noted program stop running variable constant respective value lost
That typically program print information screen otherwise output save result run program preserve result
Just like may able describe word English certain type personal name number etc variable constant computer programming language
For example English might classified number whereas Steve Elon Larry Mark might classified name
Computers use similar type require bit granularity
We therefore familiarize two common data type programming integer string
Integers simply number without decimal
Integer variable take negative positive value referred signed integer
Signed refers fact minus sign front
Integer variable take positive value referred unsigned integer
When initialized wrote We picked unsigned integer type written uint know dice roll sum never negative
The reason picking unsigned integer choose roll dice many many time unsigned integer contain twice large number signed integer
The explanation simple signed integer unsigned integer allocated space memory signed integer however half capacity minus sign half unsigned integer capacity minus sign
Whether declare integer variable signed unsigned depend circumstance although time probably end using signed integer give flexibility
When learning programming theory however dealing large number worth noting difference signed unsigned integer
In example must use signed integer written int since must allow negative cash flow
We initialize signed integer variable following way The bit smallest unit information stored computer memory
A bit take one two value
An integer variable stored memory using one bit typically bit modern computer
The bit allocated integer higher largest value
The general formula many value integer take n equal number bit
This mean integer take two different value integer take four different value integer take value etc
The string second data type get know
Strings programming basically said equal text plain English
Here example string note use keyword string indicate declaring string All variable string variable set equal text surrounded quote
The quote fact one requirement string
Without quote would string
Whether use double quote single quote considered equivalent purpose book Pete equivalent Pete
We know properly refer left sign learned called either variable constant
This begs obvious question far right sign
The answer literal
In example say Pete string literal integer literal
A literal anything written directly code example text number
Literals show many location code right sign
Both integer string would somewhat uninteresting perform operation
By operation point referring arithmetic integer
adding subtracting dividing multiplying string concatenation string
joining two string together
A example operation performed integer follow We start initializing two unsigned integer data type uint number minus sign front
We purchase ice cream reduce accordingly
Note simply applying basic algebra
Our variable value
Let say get lucky find street proceed donate half wallet charity Our variable value
Let turn attention string operation
In section discus concatenation
Concatenation act combining two string
For example concatenated two string Programming class would end Programming class
Here concatenate two string value Erik Linde
As see simply use sign want concatenate string
Observe empty space inserted two string

Explain plain English variable

Explain plain English constant

Declare integer variable named designed hold large strictly positive number please pick appropriate data type one type possible

Declare integer variable named designed hold negative positive number

Initialize constant named

Initialize four variable respectively
Then create new variable set equal sum variable
In end please also write value

Write ending value x

Write ending value z

Write ending value z

ADVANCED What mistake find code

Explain plain English string concatenation

Please write ending value variable result
ADVANCED Please initialize new string variable named set value equal without using number anywhere code
A variable stored value whose data might vary based upon used computer program

A constant stored value whose data vary regardless used computer program

Declare integer variable named designed hold large strictly positive number please pick appropriate data type one type possible
The uint data type appropriate number roll never negative
Because value always positive data type unsigned
If recall int data type include value negative sign signed positive unsigned

Declare integer variable named designed hold negative positive number

Initialize constant named

Initialize four variable respectively
Then create new variable set equal sum variable
In end please also write value
When substitute number variable equal

Write ending value x
When substitute number variable final value x x x

Write ending value z
When substitute number variable final value z z

Write ending value z
When substitute number variable final value z
The data type int store decimal data
We need calculate final value x asked find value variable z x
Paying attention critical skill programmer

ADVANCED What mistake find code
The following thing wrong code In fourth line var int x z x variable x already initialized first line
Variables initialized
In fifth line var int q q x declare variable use variable assignment value variable

String concatenation joining data string type order specified code

Please write ending value variable result When substitute assigned string data variable answer The fantastic
Note integer quote mark signaling string integer
Please initialize new string variable named set value equal without using number anywhere code var string It important include blank space ensure code print exactly example

used store information referenced manipulated computer program
They also provide way labeling data descriptive name program understood clearly reader
It helpful think variable container hold information
Their sole purpose label store data memory
This data used throughout program
Naming variable known one difficult task computer programming
When naming variable think hard name
Try best make sure name assign variable accurately descriptive understandable another reader
Sometimes reader revisit program wrote month even year earlier
When assign variable use symbol
The name variable go left value want store variable go right
Here assigned value string variable
Now want reference variable
As see stored string memory use throughout program
Let try little something
Look following irb session
What value point
Take best guess type session irb find
You notice value remains
This show variable point value memory deeply linked
If confusing worry plenty exercise complete make information clear obvious
And doubt always try irb
Up able assign data variable within program
However wild want people able interact program interesting way
In order allow user store information variable well
Then decide like data
One way get information user call method
stand get string lot fun
When use program wait user type information press enter key
Let try
Type example irb get feel play around bit like
After code computer waited u type information
We typed Bob pressed enter program returned
The end newline character represents enter key
But want part string
We use chained get rid put string remove carriage return character end
There go
That much prettier
Now use variable please
A variable scope determines program variable available use
A variable scope defined variable initialized created
In Ruby variable scope defined
A block piece code following method invocation usually delimited either curly brace
Be aware pair imply
Now idea constitutes variable scope one rule want remember Looking code make clearer
Let say file called
What value printed screen
Try
The value
This available inner scope created allowed code value
In fact three time
Let try something else
We modify piece code
What result get running program
You gotten error tune This variable available outside method invocation block initialized
When call available within outer scope
Note key distinguishing factor deciding whether code delimited considered block thereby creates new scope variable seeing immediately follows method invocation
For example The answer yes
The reason code create new inner scope since part Ruby language method invocation
When use method invocation followed new block created
Before move aware five type variable
Constants global variable class variable instance variable local variable
While worry much topic depth yet brief description
Constants declared capitalizing every letter variable name
They used storing data never need change
While programming language allow change value assigned constant Ruby
It however throw warning letting know previous definition variable
Just mean change value
In fact
Constants declared method definition available throughout application scope
Example constant declaration Global variable declared starting variable name dollar sign
These variable available throughout entire app overriding scope boundary
Rubyists tend stay away global variable unexpected complication using
Example global variable declaration Class variable declared starting variable name two sign
These variable accessible instance class well class
When need declare variable related class instance class need value variable use class variable
Class variable must initialized class level outside method definition
They altered using class instance method definition
Example class variable declaration Instance variable declared starting variable name one sign
These variable available throughout current instance parent class
Instance variable cross scope boundary
You learn get OOP topic use instance variable know
Example instance variable declaration Local variable common variable come across obey scope boundary
These variable declared starting variable name neither well capitalizing entire variable name
Example local variable declaration In chapter talked use variable store information later use get information user
We also showed variable created equal scope variable defined change availability throughout program
Now know different type variable use let put knowledge practice exercise
Write program called asks user type name print greeting message name included
Write program called asks user old tell old year
Below output someone year old
Add another section onto print name user time
You must without explicitly writing put method time row
Hint use method something repeatedly
Modify first asks user first name save variable last name
Then output full name
Look following program What x print screen case
Do give error
Are error different
Why
The first print screen
The second throw error available created within scope block
What following error message tell
The program trying reference variable method named defined program outside scope called

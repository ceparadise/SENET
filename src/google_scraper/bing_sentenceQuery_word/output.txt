To interact computer use external device called peripheral device way computer receive give information user without computer practically useless need input output device first path computer organization
First input input device human communicate data computer various way therefor give task processed output
After input data done computer need store able process output le amount storage capacity CPU Central Processing Unit storage device purpose storing large amount data CPU access data easily faster
Output final step result given output device computer also need storage device
We see detail main us device
And way operates human computer
Definition An input device peripheral hardware device generally external connected remotely connected computer information appliance
Input device used provide input understood computer raw data information command order To process input computer absolutely need input device important part computer
Categories Input device category four category Typing device Pointing device Optical device Audio device These category represent way communicate computer first path phase
Typing Devices Typing device essentially keyboard used insert text command via button
They effective way input data computer
use method binary code input data
Typing device reliable text number data input
But ergonomically unsafe properly used inaccurate difficult bad typist paralysis handicapped user Basically computer posse keyboard primary input computer system
Pointing Devices Pointing device used input data movement example pointing device mouse joystick stylus touch screen
They usually used operate screen movement based information manually used easy manipulate due simple movement like mouse consist pointing clicking
One main disadvantage limited task mouse joystick mean limited work touch screen le responsive compared keyboard
Optical Devices Optical device mostly used recognition video image capture field recognition OMR optical mark recognition OCR optical character recognition many others optical device like barcode reader scanner handheld scanner digital camera The OMR reader used barcode reader scan mark indicate data information input send computer processed also used face recognition finger print scanner retina scanner
The OCR text character recognition scanning text document
Basically optical device faster device reading used security mean due accuracy reliability
The disadvantage lie raw data instance single change optical device may recognize therefor give wrong output user Audio Devices Audio device like name indicate mainly input audio data
The device microphone headset MIDI process analogue digital data convertor
It allows user send audio signal computer processing recording carrying command sometimes main purpose transfer input audio output audio
The disadvantage source audio bad signal process wrong
Definition Like input output device also peripheral hardware device used receive result processing date come input
All computer information system absolutely need output device
Output device also known way computer communicates human
Types Output There three principal type output device based way deliver output data Display output Physical output Audio output Display Output They commonly monitor screen light based device called Visual Display Unit VDU
It primary output device also used input device computer display content information screen permit user read see process done input data called soft copy mean temporary data copy
Display output device also wall without human ca understand computer try communicate
Usually display output called video display dimensional display like Television set Computer monitor Head mounted display But also called segment display composed several segment switch give appearance desired output display show numeric number alphanumeric character like calculator digital watch
The advantage display device see output computer program also use computer easily giving command Command Line Interface use Pointing device Mouse point click task Graphical User Interface GUI
It fast acquire economical easily transmittable
In another hand disadvantage output temporary need power supply cause visual problem user
Physical Output Physical output hard copy permanent output common way get printer
There two type printer Impact printer use typewriter approach impact ink ribbon paper

printer
printer use chemical technology produce colour printing

laser printer printer So printer principal output device term physical output produce printing produce large amount short time
The disadvantage cost printing expensive due hard copy compared soft copy need displayed
Audio Output Audio output device refer device attache computer purpose playing sound speech music
It also refer sound computer sound card
Here example audio output device us Speakers common type audio output device attached computer using variety audio plug
It requires separate energy supply operational
Headphones another type audio output device
Variations headphone concept include ear bud fit inside ear headset include headphone microphone
It requires separate power supply
Sound card computer component convert information digital audio file electronic sound signal
These signal passed audio output device speaker headphone
Although sound card play sound output audio signal
For reason considered audio output device
Without audio output device miss audio cue computer error beep important system message alerting system problem
This keep sync computer allowing effectively recognize identify issue
There real disadvantage audio output device need additional hardware sound card additional power supply possibility making noise
There primarily three type storage computer posse first primary storage popularly called simply memory secondary storage popularly referred simply storage finally offline storage referred movable storage
Primary Storage Primary storage computer store data temporary basis process data
Think primary storage short term memory
Primary storage type memory directly accessible computer processor volatile temporary nature erased power turned
The main primary storage RAM Random Access Memory ROM Read Only Memory Data computer currently processing data computer know need processing stored primary storage
Memory primary storage accessed quickly CPU
Its storage capacity however much smaller stored secondary tertiary storage
Computers need enough primary storage function temporarily hold anticipated amount data processing
Secondary Storage Secondary storage computer store data currently processing may need later time
Secondary storage thought long term memory storage nature data remains intact even power computer turned
Operating system document music file typically stored secondary storage device
They also external movement transport
The main device secondary storage hard disk drive HDD
The computer largest secondary storage location hard disk drive hard drive
Hard drive platter like dish stacked top middle bottom make one unit
Hard drive mechanical device store data magnetically
They considered permanent storage
Among advantage hard disk drive storage capability Megabyte Terabyte
Hard disk drive durable metal casing built around inner component
Hard disk drive
They read modified written
Offline storage Offline storage storage medium inserted computer used removed computer stored elsewhere
It also external source connected computer disconnected like floppy drive CD drive DVD drive USB flash drive drive
Floppy drive old form storage capacity Megabytes used nowadays categorised offline storage able read written
CD drive Compact Disk DVD drive Digital Video Disc store data shiny disc capacity CD drive Megabytes DVD drive Gigabytes Gigabytes double layer DVD compact portable storage good amount storage primary commercial storage device used video audio software game
But disadvantage infected virus used bad intention also layer disk get damaged like scratch computer able read anymore loss data
USB flash drive portable storage device great amount storage support Megabytes Gigabytes easiest way carry data place place due connectivity via USB port
Unfortunately USB flash drive fragile easily breakable easily get corrupted infected virus basically used short amount time useless
After describing explaining input output storage device see utilisation computer operation function process based within device without one work ca done
These interaction computer human necessary achieve perfect use computer studied field called interaction
Nowadays interaction appearing frequent daily life better speed accuracy due evolution technology human becoming reliable computer

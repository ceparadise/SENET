I work area pure Computer Science area Computational
Till I submitted paper well known venue journal field
I understand following situation paper submission field Submitted paper journal follow quick review procedure
submission editor assignment reviewer invited review review completed But pure CS Journals every step late except first step obvious
What infer given situation peer review world
Note In computer science unlike majority academic field research published article conference proceeding conference follow quick review process
I imagine pressure journal provide quick review process thus le strong
The time peer review highly complex variable depends many factor idea explored paper author time review focus referee dynamic journal editorial board
For example physic APS time review round may vary week month even longer
Hence time publishing vary one month one year
In mathematics example review time even longer natural referee report received time frame month one year
From see review time complex variable author minor effect one change much
The best thing author write clear manuscript would natural
Hence review time important aspect consider important idea novelty paper quality review process linked prestige journal
For conference proceeding review time shorter journal strong review made
For sure strength review highly depends editorial board referee

Nadine taught nursing year PhD Nursing research Have ever wondered scientific experiment get funded publisher decides accept scientific article publication
The process approval called
In science process evaluating scientific work group expert related field
It also known refereeing work project must critiqued published funded implemented
The work project may accepted considered acceptable revision rejected altogether
However peer review almost impossible operationally define
An mean people examined something would agree outcome
In fact different area science actually attempt operationally define peer review reviewer know exactly expected critique
However outcome peer review still extremely dependent person opinion much like love art
For instance really like abstract art critique may different someone like abstract art
This example subjective opinion
Peer review existence year current form process implemented journal
Are asking qualifies peer
Well good question
Could peer person interest author investigator
If would cause bias competitor
On hand reviewer scientific discipline make expert
The answer may may make expert
For instance nurse may conduct study effect physical activity dementia
Would another nurse expert child abuse good reviewer simply nurse
Not necessarily work different field may understand ramification study
Who actually pick reviewer peer review
Well depends work project
Most time reviewer picked author work project
There specific process choosing reviewer
Usually outlined policy author
However case author may suggest reviewer
The step needed peer review research grant proposal include What included review
Some reviewer may skim surface work project
For instance reviewer might state work project okay
Yet another reviewer may scrutinize every aspect work project thorough
Reviewers comment quality significance originality research
Reviewers decision maker
However comment inform decision maker
Some possible issue related peer review process include Get FREE access day create account
important scientific community
It mean expert related scientific field critique work project submitted publication funding implementation
Operational definition difficult achieve therefore many journal organization develop criterion peer review
However peer review process criticized subjectivity value held peer may differ greatly even within scientific area
Reviewers comment quality significance originality work project peer review however reviewer decision maker
Issues related peer review process include slow process cost potential bias inconsistency possibility abuse

According journal article published week How often read phrase
How often I phrase
If tried count would probably power involved
It clear context journal article hard currency science
But context le obliging why wherefore
Who peer reviewing
What precisely review
Does paper always deserve respect much trust place process peer review
If degree science particularly science Inside Baseball really reason know answer question
You ca expert everything something explicitly taught high school basic level college science course
And yet I rest science medium continue reference peer review like reader know exactly talking
I think high time rectify mistake
Ladies gentleman meet peer review What phrase journal article really mean
This part probably already figured
Journal article like book report usually written document methodology result single scientific experiment provide evidence supporting single theory
Another common type paper I talk lot meta analysis review report compare result lot individual experiment usually done compiling previously published paper specific topic
No single journal article meant definitive last word anything
Instead supposed improve understanding world looking balance evidence many experiment many article tell u
That I think review often useful laypeople
A single experiment may interesting always tell much world work review
Both individual report review published scientific journal
You think older fancier heavily edited version
The scientist read journal write content go journal
There hundred journal
Some publish lot different type paper broad range Science Nature others much much specific
Acute Pain say
Or Sleep Medicine Reviews
Often pay journal fee per page published
And institution work buy subscription journal pay steep price read individual paper
Peer review really mean scientist involved helping editor journal decide paper publish change need made paper publication
How peer review work
It may surprise learn standardized thing
Peer review evolved informal practice sending research friend colleague critiqued never really codified single process
It still done voluntary basis scientist free time
Such
And journal pay scientist work peer review
For part scientist formally trained peer review given continuing education better
And usually get direct feedback journal scientist quality peer reviewing
Instead young scientist learn advisor delegate grad student paper asked review
Your education really depends whether advisor good much time choose spend training
Meanwhile feedback usually indirect
Journals show review paper reviewer
So see scientist reviewed paper reviewed
That give chance see flaw missed compare work others
If really incompetent peer reviewer journal might stop asking review altogether
Different journal different guideline ask peer reviewer follow
But commonality
First journal weed lot paper submitted paper even put peer review
This different journal focus publishing different thing
No matter cool finding Acute Pain wo publish
Meanwhile journal like Science might prefer publish paper likely original important field particularly interesting general public
In case result accurate kind dull probably get shut
Second peer review normally done anonymously
The editor journal often give paper author opportunity recommend caution specific reviewer
But otherwise pick reviewing
Reviewers people decide paper published
Instead reviewer look big error reasoning methodology sign plagiarism
Depending journal might also asked rate novel paper finding important paper likely field
Finally make recommendation whether think specific paper right specific journal
After paper go back journal editor make final call
If paper peer reviewed mean correct
In word Nope
Papers peer reviewed turn wrong time
That norm
Why
Frankly peer reviewer human
And human trying work limited number hour pay
They make mistake
They rush worrying thing trying get done
They share lab guy whose paper reviewing like
They get frustrated paper reviewing contradicts research working
By sending every paper several journal try cancel inevitable bias imperfect system
Especially I said really way know whether good peer reviewer system improving
There evidence least medical field
Nobody know exactly could lack training tendency get set way age reviewer simply feeling burnt busy
It also worth noting peer review really set catch deliberate fraud
If fake result convincingly really good reason peer reviewer would catch
Instead usually something happens paper scientist try replicate fraudster spectacular result find research contradicts way make sense
If paper mean incorrect
Technically
But thing
Flawed peer review useful
It first line defense
It force scientist evidence back claim likely catch egregious bias flaw
It even mean fraud ca really fraud
Being peer reviewed mean result accurate
Not peer reviewed mean crank
But fact peer review exists weed lot crank simply saying There standard
Journals peer review tend one obvious agenda
White paper peer reviewed tend contain bias journal article
You think critically skeptically reviewed one submitted peer review tend wrong
What problem scientist peer review trying change
Scientists complain peer review
But let set one thing straight The biggest complaint scientist peer review stifle unpopular idea
You heard truthy factoid countless denier purveyor quack medicine
And peer review convenient scapegoat conspiracy theory
There enough truth make claim sound plausible
Peer review flawed
Peer review biased
In fact really new unpopular idea might well hard time getting published biggest journal right first
You saw example
But sort finding often published smaller obscure journal
And scientist keep finding evidence support claim keep submitting work peer review often going eventually convince people right
Plenty scientist including Harry Collins seen idea published widely
So scientist complain
This much surprise
It lack training lack feedback time constraint fact specific research get fewer people expertise accurately thoroughly review work
Scientists frustrated journal like publish research solid
They frustrated journal like publish study scientist hypothesis turned wrong
Some scientist would prefer peer review plenty others like feature
Journals like British Medical Journal require reviewer sign comment practice
There also scientist want see review research paper
Because peer review flawed say would helpful centralized place scientist go find critique paper written scientist official
Maybe crowd catch thing reviewer miss
We certainly saw happen earlier year
The website attempting something like
You go site look previously published paper see scientist saying
And basic thing year
So mean
Basically canonize everything journal article say journal article
But time peer reviewed sign paper author done level due diligence work
Peer review flawed value
There improvement could made
But like old joke democracy peer review worst possible system except every system ever come
If interested reading peer review scientist trying change improve I recommend checking
They recently stopped updating lot good information archived help dig deeper
Journals also commissioned study peer review work could better
The British Medical Journal one publication make

process restructuring existing computer changing external behavior
Refactoring improves attribute
Advantages include improved code reduced improve create expressive internal improve
Typically refactoring applies series standardised basic usually tiny change source code either preserve behaviour software least modify conformance
Many provide automated support performing mechanical aspect basic refactorings
If done extremely well code refactoring may help software developer discover fix hidden dormant system simplifying underlying logic eliminating unnecessary level complexity
If done poorly may fail requirement external functionality changed introduce new bug
By continuously improving design code make easier easier work
This sharp contrast typically happens little refactoring great deal attention paid expediently adding new feature
If get hygienic habit refactoring continuously find easier extend maintain code
Refactoring usually motivated noticing
For example method hand may long may near another nearby method
Once recognized problem addressed source code transforming new form behaves longer smell
For long routine one smaller subroutine extracted duplicate routine duplication removed replaced one shared function
Failure perform refactoring result accumulating hand refactoring one primary mean repaying technical debt
There two general category benefit activity refactoring
Before refactoring section code solid set automatic needed
The test used demonstrate behavior module correct refactoring
If test fails generally best fix test first done hard distinguish failure introduced refactoring failure already present
After refactoring test run verify refactoring break test
Unit test prove bug important point process good unit test catch enough error make worthwhile make refactoring safe enough
The process iterative cycle making small testing ensure correctness making another small transformation
If point test fails last small change undone repeated different way
Through many small step program move want
For iterative process practical test must run quickly programmer would spend large fraction time waiting test finish
Proponents describe activity integral part
Here example may apply certain language language type
A longer list found refactoring book website
Many development environment provide automated support
For instance programmer could click name variable select Encapsulate field refactoring context menu
The IDE would prompt additional detail typically sensible default preview code change
After confirmation programmer would carry required change throughout code
While term originally referred exclusively refactoring software code recent year code written HDLs also refactored
The term used shorthand term refactoring code hardware description language
Since HDLs considered hardware engineer hardware refactoring considered separate field traditional code refactoring
Automated refactoring analog hardware description proposed Zeng Huss
In approach refactoring preserve simulated behavior hardware design
The measurement improves refactored code processed standard synthesis tool original code
Refactoring digital HDLs albeit manual refactoring also investigated Mike Keating
His target make complex system easier understand increase designer productivity
Although refactoring code done informally year dissertation one first major academic work refactoring functional procedural program followed dissertation refactoring program although theory machinery long available system
All resource provide catalog common method refactoring refactoring method description apply indicator apply method
book canonical reference
The first known use term refactoring published literature September article
Griswold thesis Opdyke thesis published also used term
The term factoring used community since least early
Chapter Six book dedicated subject
In extreme programming Extract Method refactoring technique essentially meaning factoring Forth break word smaller easily maintained function
Refactorings also reconstructed posthoc produce concise description complex software change recorded software repository like CVS SVN
Many software automated refactoring support

I know refactoring changing structure program functionality changed
I talking guy I working final year project university I surprised much want better word view refactoring
I consider refactoring thing like extracting method renaming class
They also suggested thing like changing data structure like Java changing algorithm using merge sort instead bubble sort even rewriting large chunk code refactoring
I quite sure wrong I able give good reason suggesting change program presumably make better without changing behaviour
Am I right importantly
Martin Fowler perhaps THE reference Refactoring controlled technique improving design existing code base
Its essence applying series small transformation small worth
However cumulative effect transformation quite significant
By small step reduce risk introducing error
You also avoid system broken carrying restructuring allows gradually refactor system extended period time
Refactoring go unit testing
Write test refactor confidence level refactoring proportional coverage test
A good reference Fowler draw clean line change code affect behavior
He call refactoring
This important distinction divide work refactoring code modification activity Fowler call wearing different hat apply different technique
If making refactoring code modification If making code modification If lose sight distinction expectation given code modification task muddled complex rate muddled complex mindful
That word meaning important
To give view Cosmetic change directly related feature
billable change request
Rewriting large chunk clearly violates small incremental part
Refactoring often used rewrite instead improve existing
Replacing data structure algorithm somewhat border case
The deciding difference IMO small step ready deliver ready work another case
Imagine Report Randomizer Module slowed use vector
You profiled vector insertion bottleneck unfortunately module relies contigous memory many place using list thing would break silently
Rewriting would mean throwing Module away building better faster one scratch picking piece old one
Or writing new core fitting existing dialog
Refactoring would mean take small step remove pointer arithmetic switch
Maybe even create utility function wrapping pointer arithmetic replacing direct pointer manipulation call function switch iterator compiler complains place pointer arithmetic still used switch remove ultility function
The idea behind code get worse
When fixing bug adding feature quality decay small step meaning variable subtly change function get additional parameter break isolation loop get bit complex etc
None real bug ca tell line count make loop complex hurt readability maintenance
Similarly changing variable name extracting function tangible improvement
But alltogether fight slow erosion
Like wall pebble everyday one fall ground
And everyday one passerby pick put back
With Martin Fowler definition mind Refactoring disciplined technique restructuring existing body code altering internal structure without changing external behavior

I think clearly right
They also suggested thing like changing data structure like Java LinkedList ArrayList changing algorithm using merge sort instead bubble sort even rewriting large chunk code refactoring
Changing algorithm something much faster obviously refactoring external behaviour changed
Then effect never noticeable perhaps could call refactoring also premature optimisation
This pet peeve mine annoying people use term sloppily I even come across might casually use basically kind change fix
Yeah hip cool buzzword nothing wrong plain old term like
We use appropriate reserve case truly improving internal structure software
Within development team especially common language discussing work matter
I think right arguing meaning word particularly interesting productive
If interface piece code change I consider refactoring
The typical case refactoring This mean term refactoring relative interface discussing
could refactoring code behind one interface extensively changing code another lower level maybe distinction providing confusion colleague
Code refactoring process changing computer program internal structure without modifying external functional behavior existing functionality order improve internal property software example improve code readability simplify code structure change code adhere given programming paradigm improve maintainability improve performance improve extensibility
I agree refactoring code include breaking existing code
Just make sure unit test introduce bug rest code compiles
Using refactoring tool like Resharper C make easy
I In software engineering refactoring source code mean improving without changing overall result You already know precise term used subset refactoring yes general term
I think nobody benefit strong definition term
The border perceive colleague blurry closer view depending many fact
Since dynamic let try define
First define boundary system subsystem trying refactor
If method keep name input argument type returned value possibly throwing statement fixed
Apply change inside method without changing viewed outside
If refactor class fix public API using rename variable extract method available technique change class readable performant
If part code refactoring package module refactoring inside possibly renaming class deleting introducing interface code
If would like read tip refactoring important always dissatisfied old work I recommend new blog post
It answer concern refactoring convince bos important etc

If write software research likely experience looking code realizing become tangled mess
Perhaps even gotten point original author hard time remembering piece fit together
Don despair
This perfectly natural research software time
Code refactoring process restructuring existing computer code without changing external behavior order make easier understand reason extend
Much written refactoring software engineering computer science
The term use since least early canonical reference Refactoring Improving design existing code Martin Fowler published
Fowler even maintains specific type code transformation considered refactorings
Note though I use term refactoring post content also apply broader set code cleaning restructuring technique go beyond atomic code transformation
On surface seem hard justify spending time working code exact thing end day
Imagine student explaining advisor produced new result rather spending time making nebulous improvement code
However code restructuring investment make future development easier
The longer lifetime piece software people need read modify important refactoring becomes
In fact I argue computational scientist particular view refactoring valuable even inherent part research software development
There two reason In research collaboration cost refactoring often paid inherit responsibility piece code
For example graduate student I took responsibility software developed collaboration course three year
The code grown line included many unused code path relevant point development hindering understanding preventing u making necessary improvement
After several month work spent understanding code refactoring able reduce code base line make robust extensible process
This would taken far le time overall code refactored iteratively original development
How know refactoring needed
Typically notice code smell surface indication deeper design problem
Perhaps single function grown hundred line long perhaps function grown accept ten parameter
For inability quickly recognize given function class supposed often hint refactoring needed
In interest space I go specific refactor reference listed go great detail
I note however sort automated test helpful ensuring code still work expected refactoring
In research code general approach make initial design simple possible expect refactor I understand problem better new requirement become obvious
This based experience code code try anticipate future requirement required particularly detrimental understandability
Much research code Python
In Python approach generally mean I start mainly writing function
Later might become obvious certain data structure function grouped together
Or perhaps I realize would allow remove conditional statement spread throughout code
At time I abstract code class
There many aspect refactoring structure class function one I think
I found approach prevents prematurely choosing far costly refactoring
In course developing new piece software I often several refactorings touch large part code
By thinking refactoring natural part development process feel control code making future development enjoyable
The idea refactoring look code frozen construct susceptible change
Instead see capable maintaining code optimum shape responding efficiently new challenge changing code without Who know might even come find refactoring process enjoyable

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Code refactoring expression widely used programming community used describe work changing rewriting program code without changing code result
What root word Refactoring
Does come word factor like factor factory like refabricating
If use dictionary etymology see English word factor similar word like factory manufacture derive ultimately Latin verb facere broad field meaning mainly mean make
The root past participle facere
All basic Latin found Latin dictionary
According Online Etymology Dictionary turned Latin noun factor meaning doer maker
Personally I remember word I studied Latin long time ago
Thence word passed Old French facteur meaning doer author creator
So usage given seems fit quite well Latin root meaning
Julius Caesar would understood explained computer computer code
Early us refactor found searching google book show different meaning early
Before apart misspelling refractor refactory rare appearance associated finding factor factor since factor prime necessary refactor However seem related current meaning computer science
For look meaning iterative process
Particularly matrix form Newton method
In method matrix calculated step method new matrix need calculated
If partial derivative known exactly quick partial derivative evaluated numerically finding iteration matrix take long time
The process finding new iteration matrix called refactoring matrix various computer science text discus slow refactoring avoided discus consequence refactoring iteration matrix I understand method refactor stiffness matrix modified Newton Raphson method refactor stiffness matrix every awhile
The meaning improve code linked programming movement early book Smalltalk discus programming iteration As every facet application development several iteration required find optimum distribution design
Because design tend change implementation necessary refactor optimize infrastructure complete
It reasonable suppose word coined Latin root factor make describe process building new iteration matrix adopted iterative approach writing code
Forth programmer used word meaning turning common functionality function example Thinking Forth book first published
This could created analogy algebraic factoring expression
The closest get definitive answer rather indefinite note matter Martin Fowler access first people use term way When I asked around creator refactoring common answer idea
The term around know came
The one definite answer I got Bill Opdyke first thesis refactoring
He remembered conversation walk Ralph Johnson
They discussing notion Software Factory vogue
They surmised since software development like design like manufacturing would better call Software Refactory
Refactory gone name consulting organization Ralph colleague use
The foundation refer day refactoring come Smalltalk community
However metaphor factoring program also part Forth community
Bill Wake dug first known printed mention word refactoring Thinking Forth book Leo Brodie
We pretty sure usage pas Forth community Smalltalk community developed independently

Refactoring Software available

In degree interdependence software module measure closely connected two routine module strength relationship module
Coupling usually contrasted
often correlate high cohesion vice versa
Low coupling often sign good design combined high cohesion support general goal high readability maintainability
The coupling cohesion invented late part based characteristic good programming practice reduced maintenance modification cost
Structured design including cohesion coupling published article book latter subsequently became standard term
Coupling low also loose weak high also tight strong
Some type coupling order highest lowest coupling follows A module refers subroutine kind
set one statement name preferably set variable name
In recent work various coupling concept investigated used indicator different modularization principle used practice
Tightly coupled system tend exhibit following developmental characteristic often seen disadvantage Whether loosely tightly coupled system performance often reduced message parameter creation transmission translation
marshaling message interpretation might reference string array data structure require le overhead creating complicated message message
Longer message require CPU memory produce
To optimize runtime performance message length must minimized message meaning must maximized
One approach decreasing coupling seek limit responsibility module along functionality
Coupling increase two class Low coupling refers relationship one module interacts another module simple stable interface need concerned module internal implementation see
Systems allow object communicate without know anything object implementation
Both system even allow object communicate object written language
Coupling term occur together frequently
Coupling refers interdependency module cohesion describes related function within single module
Low cohesion implies given module performs task related hence create problem module becomes large
Coupling Software Engineering describes version metric associated concept
For data control flow coupling For global coupling For environmental coupling make value larger coupled module
This number range approximately low coupling highly coupled For example module single input output data parameter If module input output data parameter equal number control parameter access item global data

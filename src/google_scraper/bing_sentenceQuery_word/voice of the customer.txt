The Voice Process VOP process communicates organization performance customer need expectation
This communication take place process measure descriptor process performing current state
It critical understand current state operating define baseline attempting change improvement activity
It important change process understanding performance centered amount variation currently present
The common statistical measure process mean standard deviation
Once measure calculated conducting capability study possible
A capability study measure number standard deviation process mean nearest specification limit sigma unit
In general process standard deviation rise mean process move away center tolerance fewer standard deviation fit mean nearest specification limit
This proximity upper lower limit tolerable range increase likelihood item outside specification allowing error occur
Every stable process exhibit predicable range performance designed
A stable process one statistical control
This mean special cause variation removed process
The variation performance process expected within normal operation
Performance measure centered average outcome value reflecting expectation customer
Organizations must develop reliable process collect regular timely data performance important process
It imperative survival organization process satisfying internal external customer need
A quote Edwards Deming applicable VoP since often think know process performing intuition
Intuition good enough however
We need fact
To determine process capable satisfying customer two commonly used index Since process capability function specification process capability index good specification used
The concept process capability hold meaning process state normally distributed
Process capability index measure much process experience relative specification limit allows different process compared respect well organization control
Deming describes benefit stable process one process identity performance predictable therefore rational basis planning
The larger index stable process le likely item outside specification
A literature review place acceptable value range Cp process somewhere high
When Cpk le process considered incapable value greater considered capable
In general Cpk value range minimal industry standard acceptable level satisfy customer six sigma process
These acceptable range Cp Cpk index well vetted manufacturing process apply service industry process specification well established
To provide example study conducted health clinic service wait time four week period
The data collected process capability study indicates process centered variability
The clinic study showed service process mean wait time minute standard deviation minute delivering service study
How well process meet customer expectation
This question organization answer
Unless know customer tolerate upper lower time boundary waiting service nothing compare performance
Organizations spend lot time resource trying drive wait time zero may customer expects
The real question organization well process meet customer expectation
This question service organization answer since know customer upper lower boundary delivery service
In service industry healthcare public health many process defined customer specification
It important develop acceptable limit process without defined customer specification
This tolerable variation must identified actual customer process The author propose developing Upper Limit U L Lower Limit L L allow use either Run Charts Control Charts
This Upper Limit U L Lower Limit L L used place Upper Lower Control Limits specification calculating Cp Cpk
The question ask customer might How long willing wait doctor flu shot get registration hospital get service WIC clinic obtain permit get HIV test get meal fast food restaurant
Since many customer understand wait inevitable important compile average many customer Upper Limit would wait time
Everyone would like zero wait time realistically people accept minimal wait
Defining minimal acceptable wait Lower Limit important
A lot resource expended trying get wait time zero may expected customer
We need focus scarce resource improving process align customer expectation
Recent research demonstrates simply showing people taking long help customer tolerate wait time easily
If customer understands work done behalf waiting tend value service
Communicating reason wait something done behalf authorization copy form update record retrieve vaccine etc
help customer understand wait
Regular communication customer keep informed build relationship reduces complaint
Returning example previously mentioned organization surveyed customer using specific process one month period
The survey data indicated customer would accept average wait time get service Upper Limit minute Lower Limit minute
Based data process data collected earlier Cpcan calculated follows Cp
As stated earlier larger index stable process le likely item outside specification limit
The Cpk min CpU CpL process thus would equal CpL
For process minimum value would
This Cpkwould indicate process barely capable meeting customer need requires improvement centering
To obtain VoP must obtain Voice Customer VoC first understand customer expect obtain service organization
Then compare process output aligns customer expects
Obtaining VoC complicated process requires real diligence
It vital tounderstand customer service separate total customer population number category Once clear understanding customer need develop methodology obtain VOC
This easy process
A methodology must designed regularly track record want need customer base alert u change result
Some organization use survey telephone interview person person questionnaire touch point process
Others use market firm survey customer
It beyond scope article discus potential way capture Voice Customer
It imperative organization use one way capture VoC regular timely manner since depend customer satisfaction existence
Quality Function Deployment many unique feature used capture VoC
Organizations encouraged use customer process obtain valuable data regular basis
However obtainthe VOC need make sure understand customer word required The level detail potential VOC category must decided advance
One way think customer want need term Kano Model shown figure
The Kano Model defines three type quality Customer requirement shift time critical regular monitoring process catch shift want need
Figure The Kano Model Organizations must integrate VoP VoC process robust meet cost quality requirement
The VoP indicator capable process meeting customer requirement
In service industry must constantly monitor customer expectation requirement keep process aligned need
Cp Cpk value help u monitor alignment
Plotting data using Run Control chart keep data visible easy interpret help focus improvement effort
We must establish upper lower limit customer process using
In example although process right Cpk still need improvement allow breathing room expected variation highly behavioral nature service transaction
The organization study functioning well beginning quality journey
Now data focus core process improvement based fact rather intuition
Organizations service process use Cp Cpk index based customer limit subjective performance wait time guide process improvement effort
Over time performance management system develop reliable method establishing level index service oriented process rather level established manufacturing process
Is Cpk effective range customer acceptance service process
The answer come accurate data gathering validation service customer
The author invite additional paper documenting effective method measuring improving service process performance

Until recently idea holding conversation computer seemed pure science fiction
If asked computer open pod bay door movie
But thing changing quickly
A growing number people talk mobile smart phone asking send text message search direction find information Web
We transition point voice understanding suddenly forefront say Vlad Sejnoha chief technology officer Nuance Communications company based Burlington Massachusetts dominates market speech recognition Dragon software product
I think speech recognition really going upend current computer Progress come thanks part steady progress technology needed help machine understand human speech including machine learning statistical technique
Sophisticated voice technology already commonplace call center let user navigate menu help identify irate customer handed real customer service Now rapid rise powerful mobile device making voice interface even useful pervasive
Jim Glass senior research scientist MIT working speech interface since say today smart phone pack much processing power laboratory machine worked
Smart phone also data connection cloud server heavy lifting involved voice recognition understanding spoken query
The combination data computing power mean thing today say Glass
You use sophisticated statistical The prominent example mobile voice interface course Siri personal assistant come built latest iPhone
But voice functionality built Android Windows Phone platform mobile system well many apps
While interface still considerable limitation see Social Intelligence inching closer machine interface actually talk
Nuance heart boom voice technology
The company founded Visioneer acquired dozen voice technology business
It staff member location around world revenue second quarter million percent increase period
In recent year Nuance deftly applied expertise voice recognition emerging market speech interface
The company supply voice recognition technology many company widely believed provide speech component Siri
Speech ideally suited mobile computing say Nuance CTO partly user hand eye otherwise also single spoken command accomplish task would normally require multitude swipe press
Suddenly new building block new dimension bring problem say Sejnoha
And I think going designing basic modern device UI Inspired success voice recognition software mobile phone Nuance hope put speech interface many place notably television automobile
Both popular ripe innovation
To find show TV schedule DVR recording viewer currently navigate awkward menu using remote never designed keying text query
Products supposed make finding show easier Google TV proved complex people want relax evening entertainment
At Nuance research lab Sejnoha demonstrated software called Dragon TV running television living room
When colleague said Dragon TV find movie starring Meryl Streep interface instantly scanned channel listing select several appropriate movie
A version technology already television sold Samsung
Apple widely rumored developing television speculated Siri controller
The idea fueled Walter Isaacson biography Steve Jobs late CEO said claimed finally solved TV interface
Meanwhile Sync entertainment system Ford automobile already us Nuance technology let driver pull direction weather information song
About four million Ford car road Sync voice recognition
Last week Nuance introduced software called Dragon Drive let car manufacturer add feature vehicle
Both new context challenging
One reason voice interface become popular smart phone user speak directly device microphone
To ensure system work well television car background noise company experimenting array microphone technology
Nuance make number software development kit available anyone want include voice recognition technology application
Montrue Technologies company based Ashland Oregon used Nuance mobile medical SDK develop iPad app let physician dictate note
It astonishingly accurate say Brian Phelps CEO cofounder Montrue ER doctor
Speech turned corner gotten point getting incredible accuracy right In turn kit shore Nuance position helping company improve voice recognition language processing algorithm sending ever voice data server
As MIT Glass say saying community There data like data Nuance say store data anonymous format protect privacy
Sejnoha belief within year mobile voice interface much pervasive powerful
I able talk without touching say
It constantly listening trigger word calendar ready text message browser navigated want Perhaps people even speak computer wear like eyeglass development Google
Sources Nuance say actively planning speech technology would architected run wearable computer

The noise around growing
In fact balance see increase impact VoC strategy customer engagement loyalty
Not surprisingly technology marketing customer care service provider fighting piece VoC revenue pie
But take everyone consumer company service provider benefit VoC program
Here top five step company must take VoC truly resonate Much conversation VoC center customer
Yet many company erroneously define listening act capturing customer say say
That listening
That hearing
Listening involves concentration purpose intent take hear turn something meaning
The art lead learning
As company need evaluate customer listening skill ask Am I simply hearing customer saying I customer acting telling
If listening acting right path successful VoC strategy
Unstructured indirect data everywhere
There information spread across email text social medium site blog Twitter feed video photo online forum
Such source account percent collected business data
This data provides new view customer attitude sentiment behavior make sense
However business often fail analyze information successfully ineffective manual process required
Text analytics company want find customer voice needle unstructured data haystack
Text analytics transforms noise real business insight base business decision
Incorporating information customer experience program integrates customer engagement channel critical step turning active listening active
Organizations replacing point solution integrated solution enable capture single view customer across multiple channel Web email IVR mobile even paper
Point solution simply job need seamlessly integrate everything go
The reach mobile device continue rise
According Nielsen study percent mobile user aged smartphones making even easier access contribute online social medium conversation anytime anywhere
Your VoC strategy must include mobile engagement listening channel desire accurate robust picture customer true voice
Mobile also provides opportunity engage customer using yet unobtrusive method put power customer hand delivers insight back company
Voice customer standalone project
It must become integral part business
It vital VoC program integrates multiple channel also talk existing business system order combine feedback loyalty data financial operational data
This enables make sound business decision backed answer question value business increasing satisfaction percent
Your VOC program must ability push insight knowledge back hand key action owner across business
For example account manager need customer feedback fingertip day every day
If using CRM system day every day must present insight
To ensure data drive action need cater employee requirement make easy view interpret act voice customer
going exciting year voice customer leader
Great organization opportunity truly differentiate quality customer experience voice customer place start
Karine del Moro marketing director
Summer Street Floor Stamford CT USA

The chance business Voice Customer programme place
In fact likely several
Many organisation day multiple team around business capturing feedback across different channel support separate departmental goal
But often valuable insight never leaf department individual team benefit view customer voice could important organisation whole go begging
This difference series siloed tactical Voice Customer programme overarching VoC strategy
And organisation act fast tie disparate programme together broad strategy enjoy considerable benefit
A strategic VoC programme drive change across organisation tactical approach explains Karine Del Moro VP marketing
For example programme gather feedback customer single touchpoint enable business resolve customer issue
resolve customer dissatisfaction individual level help generate referral
But benefit limited narrow part business
Ultimately tactical programme tend plateau quite quickly mean interest wane becomes another legacy operation achieves much le promised
Building strategic VoC programme goal measure ensures business define success look like
Without hard build outlook programme likely abandoned initial quick win
A strategic programme allow company gain single view customer use analysis process drive change across board
All tactical benefit programme much ingrained within business
Ultimately helping create culture foster strong customer experience drive Keith Schorah founder add It fundamental VoC programme clear focused strategy directly aligned organisation commercial goal designed permeate aspect business every business unit every function segment every management level
If VoC programme success limited likely Whether building VoC programme ground connecting series disparate programme strategic framework number initial task organisation need execute foundation place Voice Customer strategy
With number VoC programme already place within organisation gathering feedback across multiple channel using number different VoC system important first get grasp exactly state play across entire business
The first thing I recommend company audit data source vendor using kind data getting vendor vendor communicate say Forrester analyst Adele Sage
Jim Davies research director Gartner add The chance got great tool already play capturing great feedback aware
But case auditing also whether access data often find big corporation quite reluctance department share data department
So taking stock definitely starting This crucial ensure budget also involvement stakeholder across business
There point collating VoC data know belief control dissemination say Steven Walden
Without least one executive sponsor VoC strategy become project able expand evolve need
Schorah recommends going straight top The successful VoC program owned CEO play instrumental part communicating importance customer feedback employee customer Fuelled reporting customer satisfaction market increasing maturity customer experience ultimate ownership VoC programme risen sharply amongst CEOs recognise ability cement customer base identify risk increased revenue stream
Schorah continues It essential senior exec engaged ensure VoC strategy directly aligned overall business strategy
Commercially clearly link financial goal VoC program must contribute embed inception clear picture success term customer retention satisfaction new customer acquisition average account revenue driven new cross But boardroom need persuading
Schorah add Particularly large international organisation entire business need buy VoC program
Just many VoC program fail engage business unit within group
Their inability build business case win business unit budget holder guaranteed recipe failure
Engage stakeholder across business
Spend time energy establish absolute clarity VoC programme need produce support business goal group level realistically deliver true value unit
Underestimate importance Del Moro say A mature VoC programme deliver value every part company department empowered provide input keep relevant You answer question point looking VoC information used say Walden
If measuring measuring sake taken action seriously A strategy word metric
And Schorah say heart VoC strategy must measured clear relevant metric
It imperative metric go beyond standard customer satisfaction measure NPS CES RPi etc VoC strategy must include commercial measure average customer spend share wallet account profitability etc
Without inclusion financial element VoC program struggle create resonance drive true cultural change He continues Reporting progress strategy must built management rhythm every part business
Over time permeate DNA business smooth way senior management migrate bonus payment profitability focus aligning customer satisfaction
This planned part agreed understood evolution becoming Not setting goal way measure success VoC programme also help achieve senior support
Businesses need look tangible goal rather fluffy aim Better customer experience enough emphasis Del Moro
It important try quantify wherever possible using metric NPS customer satisfaction score
In addition business seek financial target
VoC programme generate new revenue reduce cost sale decrease cost poor process increase customer retention important find way set goal around Most business interact customer multiple channel online store contact centre social medium mobile example developing clear view customer journey necessarily simple task say Del Moro
VoC specialist must take time really understand customer experience company put process channel place monitor measure report experience key Walden add Encourage customer immersion technique well get people around organisation experience customer going visiting customer
Think also internal problem company prevent often find activity controlled central customer experience department critically visible board level set target
Finally encourage company go beyond defining stage engage planning redesign would look like create pilot activity VoC While actionable strategy depends specific business broadly speaking number component considered The VoC strategy encompass technical aspect implementing programme across differing channel touch point must embrace coherent change plan staff enables empowers respond directly customer feedback say Schorah
All often VoC strategy hampered focusing metric technology establish measure without tackling cohesive approach engage staff support cohesive training coaching take ownership customer enquiry
A VoC programme year market insight survey
It need capture customer feedback
Its insight challenging viscous
It must demand company change incorporate finding management rhythm While customer feedback appear scary unsettling disruptive influence business essential robust strategy guide VoC journey
Without one programme stall
Schorah concludes Creating true change take time
Your VoC strategy must adapt cadence evolve company ability able effectively engage customer manage response ensuring business learns feedback responds right change improve commercial KPIs customer experience

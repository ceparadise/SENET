The Office Personnel Management OPM requested study preparation reauthorization hearing scheduled troubled Performance Management Recognition System PMRS
Our charge review research performance appraisal use linking compensation performance
To supplement research finding asked look practice well see successful compensation system based performance appraisal might provide guidance policy maker reforming PMRS
We construed charge requiring investigation whether condition performance appraisal context merit pay system could assist federal government managing performance fostering employee equity improving individual organizational effectiveness providing consistent predictable personnel cost legitimacy public service
The Civil Service Reform Act CSRA provides backdrop study
That act required development objective performance appraisal system result used basis training promotion reduction grade removal personnel decision
The act also created compensation system middle senior manager
Designed revitalize civil service part bringing management strategy federal bureaucracy reform measure fallen short expectation despite fairly substantial midcourse correction
Yet belief merit principle remains strong expectation performance appraisal linking compensation performance provide incentive excellence
Policy maker already extensive documentation problem employee dissatisfaction Merit Pay System MPS successor PMRS consistent underfunding merit pool lag merit salary behind salary employee still General Schedule widely held annually reinforced belief federal salary fallen far behind equivalent perceived politicization civil service merit pay system seemed outgrowth Civil Service Reform Act
This study intended supplement knowledge experience information drawn private sector beginning systematic investigation research performance appraisal pay performance system including assessment practice year since passage Civil Service Reform Act
We began report cautionary note difficulty inherent trying measure social phenomenon general particular evidentiary obstacle presented subject hand
Our research taken u literature variety discipline tried piece together fragmentary evidence best possible scientific understanding adequacy performance appraisal basis making personnel decision effectiveness using pay improve performance
Investigation effect linking compensation performance led u question individual effectiveness organizational effectiveness required examination merit variable pay plan
Recent research trend also broadened scope study beyond measurement instrument appraisal process examination context attempt identify condition performance appraisal merit plan operate best
In course investigation became clear theoretical empirical literature posited least four different type benefit discussing pay system positive effect work behavior individual employee including decision join organization attend perform remain increased effectiveness facilitating socialization communication enhancing perceived legitimacy organization important internal external constituency
We ecumenical pulling together evidence information speak criterion gauging effectiveness organization performance appraisal pay system
The preceding page taken account theory empirical research clinical study many discipline also research topic seemed relevant
The formal evidence supplemented information current practice firm
The study finding conclusion presented chapter follows
The first section deal science practice performance appraisal focusing first measurement research applied research ending overall finding conclusion
The second section cover pay system focusing first evidence research finding practice ending overall finding conclusion
The third section deal influence context performance appraisal merit pay system
The fourth section deal implication study finding conclusion federal policy making
The evaluation worker performance directed toward two fundamental goal
The first create measure accurately ass level individual performance something called
The second create performance measurement system advance one operational function organization personnel decision compensation policy communication organizational objective facilitation employee performance
Although performance appraisal system encompass goal two represented literature two distinct albeit overlapping line development theory research
In part difference approach performance appraisal reflects disciplinary orientation part historical development
One approach grows psychometrics measurement tradition emphasis standardization objective measurement psychometric property validity reliability bias etc
The come applied resource management industrial organizational psychology organization science focus organizational context usefulness performance appraisal thing promoting communication manager employee clarifying organizational goal performance expectation providing information manager guide retention dismissal promotion decision informing pay decision motivating employee
Both research field interested use rating scale evaluate job performance although tended focus different question different expectation performance appraisal
At risk overemphasizing distinction presented discussion report two part one focused measurement research second applied research
It however matter general orientation unrelated polarity
Of two goal accuracy organizational utility research measurement tradition concentrated aspect accuracy implicit assumption measure accurate functional goal met
Research applied field tends focus measurement instrument accuracy inference drawn measurement whole operational system part
The applied management perspective tends evaluate performance measurement component well whole operates whether system distributes pay designed whether system accepted player
Accuracy performance measurement tends ignored considered unimportant assumed least implicitly criterion met measurement component must sufficiently accurate
Apart convenience presenting finding measurement applied tradition separately important federal policy maker manager group employee understand difference tailor language expectation appropriately
Current federal policy couched language measurement tradition
In manner elaborates requirement Title VII Civil Rights Act Office Personnel Management regulation implementing Civil Service Reform Act called federal agency develop objective performance appraisal system
The regulation required performance standard critical job element specified consistent duty responsibility outlined employee position description
OPM suggested performance standard based job analysis identify critical element job agency develop method evaluating system ensure validity
Although court demanded performance appraisal system degree rigor required test selection instrument term drawn context psychological testing performance measurement
Psychometrics grows theory individual difference namely human posse characteristic trait height verbal ability upperbody strength posse characteristic amount amount measured
Drawing finding biological science distribution characteristic given plant animal population founder psychological measurement developed statistical technique expressing human mental characteristic relating standing one individual population individual
From beginning theory measurement technique thought hold great promise matching people job measuring job performance
They also particularly compatible concept meritocracy particularly American idea job ought allocated basis talent ability function family connection social class religious persuasion criterion irrelevant job performance
In realm psychometrics scientific imperative accuracy measurement
Standardized test familiar type instrument mode product drive precise measurement
Just test administration controlled provide high degree consistency uniformity condition testing format test constrain response possibility allow direct comparison performance test taker
Over year variety sophisticated statistical analytics developed evaluate consistency measurement reliability analysis accuracy relevance inference drawn measurement result validity analysis
Prior research performance appraisal generated within psychometric tradition
Performance appraisal viewed much way test evaluated criterion validity reliability freedom bias primary goal research reduce rating error
Our finding closely performance appraisal found conform aspiration measurement science follow
Applied psychologist used job analysis primary mean understanding describing job performance
There number approach job analysis year including job element method critical incident method Air Force task inventory approach method rely structured questionnaire describe job large organization
All method share certain assumption good job analysis practice based variety empirical source information
There enormous body job analysis research preponderance conducted relatively simple concrete enlisted job auto mechanic sale job characterized observable behavior tangible product
The literature complex interactive cognitively loaded job specifically managerial job comparatively sparse le conclusive
With exception analysis managerial performance cast high level abstraction far le attention given sort detailed definition typical simpler concrete job
This global focus reflected managerial appraisal instrument typically present broad performance dimension evaluation
A job may le routinized structured constrained requirement machinery defined training evaluation job performance always depend final analysis external judgment important number unit produced quality unit produced everyday performance response infrequent emergency pursuit profit avoidance environmental damage
As consequence describing job performance straightforward obvious process
Even simple job involves judgment inference combined careful study job mean interview observation collection data task performed skill required
For managerial job task adequate description becomes even difficult much manager fragmented amorphous involves unobservable cognitive activity
Job description appraisal system based reflect organizational value judgment well independent constellation job task performance requirement
To speak objectivity regard job analysis performance appraisal imply absence human judgment rather absence irrelevant inappropriate judgment
The commonly made dichotomy objective subjective measurement misleading useful field performance appraisal
Organizations use job analysis method specifying critical element performance standard replacement managerial judgment best procedure inform manager help focus appraisal process
The abstract character behavior leadership oral communication overall performance typifies much research managerial job performance conveys message research community nature managerial performance infeasibility capturing essence list task duty standard objectively counted quantified
Reliance global measure guarantee evaluation manager performance necessity based substantial degree judgment
An overly literal interpretation requirement Civil Service Reform mean treating opposite judgment would particularly destructive managerial appraisal
Reliability analysis provides index consistency measurement occasion occasion form form several version test measure intended measure thing rater rater
The type reliability analysis particularly pertinent performance appraisal
If measurement meaning one would expect rater reach judgment one week next assuming employee performance change significantly one would hope several raters would reach substantially decision single individual performance
Data reliability derive part operational setting part laboratory experiment research project undertaken field setting using special rating instrument developed purpose administered proviso operational decision based result
There substantial evidence research literature support premise supervisor capable forming reasonably reliable estimate employee overall performance level
For mostly nonmanagerial job studied year raters show substantial agreement rating worker performance
There also data showing interrater agreement managerial performance
It important remember however consistency among raters taken simply face value proof accuracy performance appraisal procedure also cloak systematic bias systematic error valuing performance
Systematic bias difficult detect product unexamined view conventional assumption
There evidence bias fragmentary suggestive small number study showing white supervisor tend rate white employee group somewhat higher black employee conversely black supervisor rate black employee higher average
The study able distinguish real performance difference rater bias suggest presence although variance accounted bias appears quite small
From psychometric perspective central question posed measurement system whether produce accurate assessment relevant performance
technical term used refer degree accuracy relevance characterizes measurement procedure
It meant imply static characteristic test rating scale rather term structure meaning built support assessment result
Validity therefore accretion evidence many source describes research process gradually lends confidence interpretation judgment made basis measure
In realm job performance validation begin important sense analysis job category job performance measure developed
If employment test appraisal system linked important aspect typing accuracy speed sonar technician skill recognizing one building block place
The evidence interrater reliability described provide another sort clue accuracy measurement system like performance rating job sample test procedure depend observer judge performance
Statisticians psychometricians developed array sophisticated statistical method explore relationship test measure study relevant variable correlational regression analysis multivariate analysis ANOVA technique
Performance appraisal lend full complement validation strategy found useful standardized test
validity example rarely useful evaluating performance appraisal selection test
The strength approach lie showing healthy relationship exists say test result independent operational performance measure college admission test average
When measure validated behavioral measure difficult find relevant operational measure comparison essential independence
As consequence frequently considered compelling type evidence validation research usually possible performance appraisal
Furthermore limited condition independent criterion exist job tend much simple straightforward appraisal typically used
It however possible compare performance appraisal measure job performance using conventional statistical method psychometric analysis
Recent military job performance measurement research example demonstrated moderate correlation supervisor rating type criterion measure developed test score training grade written job knowledge test lends credibility claim carefully developed performance appraisal bear meaningful degree relationship actual job performance
Supervisor rating used thousand study designed examine power cognitive ability test predict job word used validate employment test
These study consistently show low moderate observed correlation employment test supervisor rating job incumbent score well test tend also receive good rating low test score tend rated mediocre performer
While admittedly circular relationship provides indirect evidence supervisor rate employee degree mean perfect accuracy whether operational setting another matter
A wide variety rating scale format defining performance dimension varying level specificity exist
Commonly used rating dimension include personal trait initiative leadership perseverance job behavior follows safety procedure engine room financial management interpersonal relation performance result quality work quantity work
The number scale point ranged high appraisal scale
In term scale format general distinction made scale include specific behavioral example good average inadequate performance
The latter called graphic scale simply list dimension interest present number scale point along continuum
The scale point anchor numerical adjectival consistently superior average consistently unsatisfactory
Behaviorally anchored rating scale BARS developed reduce rating error typical graphic scale
Proponents thought BARS would help clarify meaning performance dimension used would help calibrate various raters definition constitutes superior average unsatisfactory performance dimension
It also felt behavioral description would discourage tendency rate broad general trait focusing attention specific work behavior
Mixed standard scale also behaviorally based went one step trying control rater error particularly bias leniency
These scale present behavioral description random order conjunction particular performance dimension
The rater response computed someone else performance score dimension measured
Reviews relevant research suggest behaviorally based scale met early expectation
Although research finding entirely consistent consensus seems scale format relatively little impact psychometric quality impact indexed interrater agreement rater error convergent discriminant validity rating
In word use behavioral versus nonbehavioral language physical arrangement scale appear critical term validity overall judgment performance
A weakness comparative research rating approach format however noted Landy Farr
It namely many study scale compared actually developed way
The performance dimension behavioral example developed according BARS methodology
This mean presentation mode actually compared
Many author also pointed lack rigor selection scaling anchor suggests final word spoken merit behavioral approach rating scale
It also case choice approach trait behavior format BARS graphic format may make difference usefulness accuracy rating
Scales containing specific behavioral example may useful providing feedback employee trait scale may useful ranking rated
This proposition given support research cognitive process involved performance appraisal done
This body research suggests distinction behavior trait salient thought
Raters appear rely le specific behavior general evaluation employee make rating regardless focus rating scale
These general evaluation substantially affect raters memory evaluation actual work behavior
In litigation dealing performance appraisal court shown clear preference dimension
There little research directly address validity rating obtained general global dimension
Indirect evidence suggests raters may work global level case
First evidence research cognitive process mentioned finding number
In addition substantial body research halo error rating show raters part distinguish conceptually distinct aspect performance rating worker
This suggests similar outcome expected rating scale use global performance dimension
The weight evidence suggests reliability rating drop fewer rating category
Recent work indicates little gained response category
Within range evidence one best number scale point term scale quality
The combination research job analysis research reliability appraisal result direct indirect evidence modest relationship performance rating sort measure employment test measure job performance lead u conclude performance appraisal process mean measurement achieve moderate level accuracy within assumption measurement tradition
The focus psychometric theory research tends rating instrument measurement property standardization raters reduce error
Researchers organizational science human resource management tradition attuned applied setting operational system concentrate appraisal system function serve organizational end
From point view performance rating equivalent testing technology concentration research energy question job analysis scale development scale format measurement precision misguided
There others closer measurement tradition also begun feel psychometric line inquiry become arid unlikely bring large additional improvement way performance appraisal used organization Banks Murphy Ilgen et
A number industrial psychologist last decade begun move away traditional view performance appraisal measurement problem rather treating measurement tool begun look performance appraisal social communication process Murphy Cleveland
Although scholar reject idea accuracy tend take commonsense approach talking appraisal job performance concentrate much contextual factor support distort appraisal system
From perspective interesting research question performance appraisal system whether enrich managerial judgment improve employee understanding organizational goal standard performance encourage communication manager employee communicate sense equity fair play distribution reward penalty making visible ground decision enhance employee trust acceptance
While none question divorced issue answer tend sought evidence outcome
Research effectiveness performance appraisal look question employee attitude toward system degree serf individual need feedback employee development organizational need communication mission meritocratic principle degree enhances destroys cohesion work unit organization
And many point emphasis indicate great deal emergent interest organizational context appraisal occur
Although reorientation quite recent among applied psychologist review literature included several body research organizational psychology management science contribute understanding appraisal system function part organization performance management system
These include performance appraisal motivation approach assisting supervisor making rating type source rating distortion anticipated organizational context particularly result performance appraisal linked decision employee pay increase
Information performance believed influence work motivation three way
First expectancy theory performance information thought provide basis employee form belief causal connection performance pay
Second performance information believed affect motivation creating sense accomplishment sense accomplishment provides incentive maintain high performance
Third proposed performance information provides cue employee behavior continued dropped modified
The empirical research needed support motivational model ambiguous well spotty
There survey data including data federal Performance Management Recognition System indicates feedback performance appraisal help employee understand job performance expectation better
Whether translates better performance unclear
At time survey evidence indicating appraisal information le likely accurate source information informal interaction supervisor talking coworkers specific indicator provided job personal feeling
The performance feedback literature also draw heavily survey data indicates credibility supervisor crucial acceptance appraisal information
That credibility appears depend heavily supervisor perceived degree knowledge employee job degree interest employee welfare
A frequent research finding employee rate performance higher supervisor
This supported evidence people likely accept positive information reject negative information
Both inclination would tend dilute motivational influence critical performance appraisal
Several approach used increase quality performance rating
These included developing training program supervisor responsible providing performance appraisal developing appraisal scale explicitly guide rater performance observation performance assessment
The research result rater training mixed
A number recent research review concluded rater training highly effective increasing accuracy rating
However contrary evidence suggesting training lead accurate training focus rating process use specific rating tool
Thus training seems indicated performance appraisal system involves scale require complicated procedure calculation
Performance rating subject distortion many quarter matter carefully designed appraisal instrument
The measurement research concentrated statistical analysis detect rater bias rater error halo leniency
The organizational context add greatly understanding likely source distortion
It widely assumed example us rating data organization influence appraisal process outcome
There also strain motivational literature suggesting supervisor distort rating among reason achieve outcome value bolster feeling fairness work group avoid demotivating employee brutal rating
There evidence laboratory field study support assumption intended use performance rating influence result
The consistent finding rating used make operational decision pay promotion lenient rating used research purpose feedback
While prediction motivational literature seem reasonable empirical research motivational factor rating distortion understandably rare
Little known factor actually considered raters decide fill rating form
There revealing clinical evidence however
A number researcher reported based interview data supervisor consciously manipulate appraisal achieve desired outcome maximizing chance deserving employee get promoted
Whatever exact nature environmental source rating distortion organization adopted number device deal
Some firm deal rating inflation requiring forced distribution majority rating allocated middle two three provides outstanding rating encourages rating
Some company decouple performance rating pay decision interposing negotiation among relevant supervisor rank employee similar job thereby hoping combat inflation lessen negative consequence disappointing pay outcome relationship supervisor employee
Our review performance appraisal practice private sector suggests organization focus process rather design aspect performance appraisal
For example organization conduct regular update job analysis job description fund validation study
Indeed validity reliability seem enter vocabulary human resource manager rule finding great surprise since larger company Sears AT T personnel testing measurement research capability
In contrast nearly universal use format manager professional format allows joint participation defining performance objective organization interim change objective according organization individual need
In addition organization use joint management meeting ranking employee initial performance rating completed meeting provide forum negotiating basic norm acceptable individual performance similar job job area
Such meeting recognize process aspect performance norm change raters change context important individual judgment need calibrated group norm
Our interview personnel manager suggested process emphasis also includes communication manager employee role performance appraisal context organization meritocratic practice culture insistence performance appraisal important ongoing part manager job
These company tend ass effectiveness performance appraisal via influence employee perception equity job satisfaction rather measure performance improvement cost reduction
All emphasis process use performance appraisal system reinforce idea meritocratic personnel context consistent current research interest performance appraisal social communication process rather measurement tool
However address question accuracy rating decision effect using appraisal system individual corporate performance
We extent caricatured two different approach performance one preoccupied psychometrics precision measurement focused utility acceptance performance appraisal
Clearly set consideration important
The appropriate balance devoting resource measurement issue versus process issue obviously depend specific situation
However wish call attention two set finding suggest may diminishing return focusing measurement property appraisal scale federal context
There compelling evidence one appraisal format significantly better another
The improvement accuracy precision one time anticipated use behaviorally anchored rating scale convincingly demonstrated way would justify expensive development scale federal job generally
Although far le evidence subject global rating appear produce different result rating
Assuming reasonable care taken development scale training raters reliability validity performance appraisal system appear improved format appraisal instrument number rating anchor used
The reliability validity performance appraisal system established context research laboratory setting necessarily expected translate directly operational setting
We know example performance rating used context merit pay allocation manager tend inflate rating
We know specifying behavior interest appraisal format BARS system lead manager ignore aspect job performance particularly difficult reduce concrete term may equally important successful performance
There virtually research establishing predictive validity performance appraisal measure tool approach measure organizational effectiveness aggregated level office division firm
This statement say state analytical tool available social scientist perhaps performance appraisal
Psychometrically sound performance measure based job analysis supported substantial empirical research base difficult costly generate maintain
One could infer current practice payoff trying maximize demonstrate scientific validity measure job performance perceived justify simply little felt need
Few organization attempt establish scientific validity performance appraisal using typical psychometric procedure
The focus applied setting appears performance appraisal mean supporting ethos meritocratic personnel decision development administration performance appraisal way foster employee perception equity goal setting format using joint management negotiation define job performance norm measuring employee perception performance appraisal fairness
There virtually measurement effect performance appraisal ongoing performance cost reduction measure
Given expense difficulty developing appraisal system conform exacting requirement measurement tradition given modest return investment documented empirically given widespread lack concern level precision among firm using performance appraisal given absence convincing evidence linking performance appraisal find impossible conclude federal policy maker commit vast new human financial resource job analysis development performance appraisal instrument system meet strict constructionist challenge measurement science
Many applied psychologist management expert feel search high degree precision measurement economically viable applied believe little gained level precision currently accepted sound practice
Policy maker need consider carefully spectrum psychometric measurement impressionistic measurement performance appraisal civil service aimed
The purpose appraisal system enter decision
There seems little doubt purpose communication feedback demand scientific precision overwhelm cost consideration
For controversial decision dismissal pay question becomes difficult
However important remember line supervisor usually position know employee well far information available consumer standardized test college admission committee
In context informed judgment mean demonstrable credible link performance individual rated supervisor evaluation performance
The label cover broad spectrum compensation system clustered two general category merit pay plan variable pay plan
The latter category divided two namely individual incentive plan currently popular group incentive plan
Although charge committee couched term merit pay plan extended scope review include pay performance compensation research generally
This part sake found virtually research effect merit pay system performance individual organization forced turn elsewhere explore question
But also rapidly realized effect pay plan individual organizational performance easily disentangled broader context organization structure management strategy personnel system
We distinguished pay plan along two dimension
The first represents design variation level performance payouts tied
The second represents design variation plan contribution base added base pay
In merit pay plan locus attention individual performance
As important element meritocratic personnel system merit pay plan link annual pay increase least part well incumbent performed job
As consequence performance appraisal heart merit plan
Payouts allocated merit plan commonly added individual base salary
The payouts typically large average percent range percent addition base pay offer potential significant salary growth
In common individual incentive rate plan sale added base salary
Although payouts large also carry risk individual payout performance threshold met
Group incentive plan differ two preceding type basing compensation decision unit system performance rather individual performance
Thus plan equity plan link employee payouts overall fortune firm measured indicator financial health
Although payouts large good time usually added base designation plan
All pay performance plan designed deliver pay increase employee based least part measure performance
In theory plan offer several potential benefit They support organization personnel philosophy helping communicate organization goal employee
For example financial goal paramount pay performance plan tied achievement financial goal plan help reinforce importance employee
Goal theory also suggests pay plan support certain level performance consistent organization mission
For example plan pay financial goal almost met percent sends different message employee one pay goal completely met percent
Likewise employee receive pay increase performance appraisal work force norm likely attend norm
They help ensure consistency distribution pay increase
For example plan tie pay increase specific financial goal payouts distributed goal met
Under merit plan pay increase distributed consistently employee pay grade position grade performance appraisal rating
This help organization predict regulate price tag merit increase
Motivation theory suggests pay performance positively influence individual achieve goal rewarded
To extent goal contribute organizational effectiveness infer pay performance influence individual organizational effectiveness
Before turning research finding important note pay one dimension employee compensation dimension include competitiveness salary marketplace benefit package consideration others
The effect merit variable pay plan depend good measure larger compensation context
Organizations design pay system accomplish three objective attracting retaining motivating employee perform advancing fair equitable treatment employee regulating labor cost
We reviewed research literature see pay performance plan particularly merit pay plan influence organization ability meet objective
The research directly related question impact pay plan individual organizational performance come theory empirical study work motivation
Motivation theory well tested empirically predict employee motivation enhanced likelihood desired performance increased pay performance plan employee understand performance goal view doable given ability skill restriction posed organization context clear link performance pay increase consistently communicated followed pay increase viewed meaningful
Most research examining relationship pay performance plan performance focused individual incentive plan piece rate
By design plan closely approximate ideal motivational condition prescribed expectancy theory
Empirical research indicates individual incentive plan motivate employee improve individual performance
Individual incentive plan likely improve performance simple structured job employee relatively autonomous b work setting employee trust management set fair performance goal c stable economic environment
Merit pay plan conform closely individual incentive plan theoretical condition thought conducive improved performance
Although merit plan also focus individual performance link performance pay increase le concrete pay increase guideline typically consider position time grade well performance rating pay increase tend small therefore clearly differentiate outstanding average even poor performance
These characteristic may dilute potential motivate employee
There little empirical research merit pay plan
What exists mixed defies firm conclusion relationship plan either individual group performance
There number field study suggesting manager professional merit pay system opposed straight seniority system formal system express job satisfaction perceive stronger tie pay performance
Other study suggest effect may tenuous
Some group incentive plan retain many motivational feature individual incentive plan quantitative performance goal relatively large frequent payouts easy individual see performance contributes measure motivational link weakened
More point payouts may occur good time dependent larger environmental economic force beyond control individual employee
There modest body research evidence drawn experience suggests gainsharing plan associated improved productivity financial performance
This research however allow u disentangle effect pay plan performance many contextual condition
We say group plan performance change specify
The empirical research examining relationship pay employer ability attract retain employee limited almost research impact pay performance plan objective
We found one experimental study involving worker Navy lab relates retention adoption merit pay system
The study reported considerable reduction turnover among superior performer
One study however sufficient support general finding
Organizations want pay system viewed fair multiple stakeholder employee manager owner top manager one remove union association regulatory agency public
Theories organizational justice distinguish distributive procedural justice
The former predicts employee judge fairness pay level pay raise comparison people group considered similar term contribution
Theories procedural justice link employee job satisfaction perception fairness procedure used design administer pay example fairness performance appraisal availability mechanism appealing pay decision
Research examining distributive procedural fairness theory pay context scarce study directly answer question perceived fairness different type pay performance plan
The existing research suggest employee perception fairness regard pay distribution design administration pay system affect job satisfaction trust management commitment organization
The research suggests least three group employee may ass fairness pay people similar job outside organization people similar job inside organization others job work group
The research show different belief pay increase allocated performance seniority equal percentage base etc
Several study suggest manager believe pay increase tied performance
Surveys federal manager shown support concept pay increase principle also tradition stemming concern protect bureaucracy political manipulation equates equity equal pay people grade step
All organization regulate labor cost
An organization choice pay system definition involves among performance equity cost
The various pay system studied report approach differently
The design merit pay plan appears emphasize predictability stability time
Pay increase administered via merit grid us performance rating position pay grade determine prespecified percentage increase
The increase typically modest since added base pay gradual accumulation year becomes significant
Variable pay plan intended immediately market sensitive
Many group incentive plan example tied clearly defined measure organizational productivity financial performance
Generally improvement performance measure generate bulk pay increase pool
Since increase added base pay employee pay tied closely fortune firm
In good time payouts relatively large bad time employee risk merit system
Although economic model provide conceptual basis understanding potential cost performance contextual factor might presumed favor one pay policy another research cost regulation associated pay performance plan sparse limited production job manufacturing setting
We evidence particular pay performance plan superior another regulating labor cost
Our review private sector practice revealed pay performance important part compensation philosophy overwhelming choice firm
Merit plan almost universally used managerial professional employee percent variable pay plan much le frequently used percent depending type plan increased competition worldwide appears kindling interest
Our interview personnel manager five Fortune company indicated merit plan viewed primarily mean guiding manager decision pay increase way consistent meritocratic personnel ensures pay increase least part tied individual contribution increase consistently distributed employee way fair predictable
This strong attachment meritocratic ethos explains predominance merit pay plan private sector
Merit plan pay performance plan currently used base pay increase decision combination individual contribution skill experience performance foundation meritocratic philosophy
The personnel manager interviewed noted major benefit performance appraisal merit pay identification top bottom performer
They emphasized flexibility manager bring top performer job position pay range comparative ease dismissing meet company performance standard
Surveys indicate organization evaluate effect merit plan performance rather focus employee perception plan fairness workability link pay performance
The personnel manager interviewed also emphasized importance communicating merit pay increase part overall pay system meritocratic personnel philosophy
For example manager emphasized competitiveness base pay benefit general excellence company work force pay communication employee
Notable also manager said organization share specific pay average annual increase percentage market competitor wage survey method organization spectrum pay employee
This contrast federal meritocracy employee appear information pay many different conflicting source
In contrast nearly universal presence merit pay plan survey review revealed le percent firm bonus plan middle manager le percent gainsharing plan place
Baseline data frequency distribution specific plan difficult obtain appears increase interest plan application group employee traditionally covered
There limited number survey use group incentive plan
They report organization adopt plan improve productivity financial outcome generally organization consistent business strategy
These survey report organization adopted plan believe achieved desired effect also acknowledge importance contextual factor employee involvement information sharing ongoing marketing communication employee covered
One survey acknowledged design implementation cost high
None survey reported employee perception equity efficacy variable pay plan
Taken together evidence research practice suggests following finding conclusion effect individual organizational performance pay performance plan
The evidence effect pay performance pieced together research theory clinical study survey practice suggests certain circumstance variable pay plan produce positive effect individual job performance
There insufficient research determine conclusively whether merit pay enhance individual performance allow u make comparative statement merit variable pay plan
We nevertheless infer merit pay positive effect individual job performance basis analogy research theory variable pay plan
These effect might attenuated fact many merit plan increase always clearly linked employee performance agreement evaluation performance always exist increase always viewed meaningful
However believe direction effect nonetheless toward enhanced performance
There evidence private sector suggesting gainsharing plan associated improved organizational performance
However possible existing research conclude plan cause performance change specify understand behavior individual plan aggregate organization level
Our review performance appraisal merit pay research practice indicate success failure substantially influenced broader feature context embedded
Research performance appraisal recently turned organizational factor might support hinder appraisal system functioning intended
Research pay plan stress context organization personnel system technological system strategic goal
There broad consensus among well research personnel system general performance appraisal pay system particular must exhibit fit congruence effective
Three category contextual factor particular relevance performance appraisal pay performance emerged review research practice nature organization work might called b broad feature organization structure culture c external factor economic climate presence union legal political force exerted external constituent
The strongest evidence congruence fit appraisal pay system nature work
The literature link pay individual motivation example demonstrates importance job independence concrete easily measured product production standard perceived fair doable effective individual incentive pay plan
Only limited number job mainly executive sale manufacturing work proved amenable sort performance measurement incentive pay
Conversely shown using highly specific individual performance appraisal incentive job complex interdependent multiple amorphous goal result employee ignoring important aspect job distorting performance order meet appraisal goal
This sort gaming particular danger appraisal system
Group incentive avoid problem
They recognize interdependent nature work focus performance
However suffer unclear link individual action result
Although little systematic evidence suggest precisely congruence pay system organizational culture look like growing body case study look organizational structure culture particularly study organization organizational innovation
The business policy literature example describes two archetypal strategic dynamic firm performance appraisal pay system appear go along
Firms pursuing innovation growth tend offer employee higher proportion pay form incentive firm steady state
The entrepreneurial firm tend evaluate manager professional quantitative performance goal offer high payouts strategic goal met
Studies organizational structure confirm pattern
They describe entrepreneurial firm emphasizing general skill higher investment recruiting training performance measure tied market outcome
Retention primary management goal
Firms pursuing maintenance strategy tend evaluate manager qualitative individual behavior
Their personnel practice emphasize internal skill development importance work force norm employee contribution
Such firm would seem well served traditional performance appraisal merit pay plan
There also theoretical literature suggest organization highly institutionalized sector rely greatly public trust may likely adopt formal precise performance appraisal system
In organization personnel pay system important legitimizing function
There considerable literature support general pattern association performance appraisal pay system one hand organizational strategy structure
However work theoretical descriptive viewed suggestive necessarily generalizable
The final dimension congruence external factor constrain organization choice evaluation pay system
One relevant federal policy maker widespread resistance union private sector performance appraisal pay performance system
Most survey show unionized employee far le likely nonunionized employee covered incentive system including merit plan
To extent changed incentive pay arrangement accepted union one differentiate among individual employee
Also particular salience issue pay performance role external law regulation
Fair labor standard occupational health safety equal employment opportunity area law prescribe internal structure policy procedure may le compatible organization chosen evaluation pay system
Federal equal employment opportunity policy enormous impact personnel management every organization size nation
In addition requirement federal government employer face set constraint imposed law regulation surrounding merit system
The desire shield civil servant exigency politics placed serious constraint managerial flexibility needed make pay performance work
Since formal adoption federal government performance appraisal merit pay matter continuing controversy periodic amendment
One view experience explicit criticism federal government inability get right widely used private sector least le criticism
While many feature merit pay system could improved attribute failing mismanagement stupidity implementation
Instead would emphasize constraint many derive feature unique federal sector
The federal government face special entirely intractable problem work easy transferability experience
The term merit pay carry far meaning context public civil service private absence partisan political consideration determination pay level career employee
Where practice relatively easily accepts exchange performance objective individual organizational practice public sector could perceived opening civil service partisan manipulation
Hence one difficult question facing federal policy maker whether experience organization performance appraisal pay performance plan applicable civil service organization
The portrait organization emerges case study highlight fundamental difference private firm pay seems work well typical government agency
In organization following condition appear obtain Pay performance would one part total management system provides full financial organizational support effective administration plan The organization would characterized emphasis managerial discretion flexibility recognition individual managerial authority critical effective performance appraisal The climate would characterized shared value high level trust throughout organization On basis value ability link individual performance activity organizational goal objective would strong There would widespread agreement individual organizational standard success There would low turnover managerial level
Most condition pose problem organization division leadership political career employee lack managerial control personnel resource system ambiguity goal performance criterion multiple authority center employee accountability
The publicness government creates organization open external influence le able respond
These condition led working environment manager frustrated ability make personnel decision employee distrustful performance appraisal pay allocation see link performance pay
The issue divided leadership provides particularly salient example inherent difficulty creating successful merit pay system federal context
A continuing theme modern government need make bureaucracy responsive chief executive
One tool available president appointing employee position outside career civil service
But presence political executive leadership position federal agency institutionalizes continuing mandate change authority communication structure within agency often create obstacle change Ingraham
For example dual executive characteristic many public agency tends create system decision made according policy goal upper level organization according program goal elsewhere
In many way federal agency function two loosely coupled organization authority control communication much tenuous prescribed classic paradigm
Even policy goal often diffuse unclear contradictory Heclo Ingraham ability communicate career bureaucracy attenuated lack experience short tenure many political executive Heclo
All often judgment expert federal management goal either articulated communicated organization career employee responsible implementation
Functioning two set manager make congruence coherence hard achieve
In model organizational fit single leadership creates coherent culture shared value necessary condition enable successful performance appraisal system
The issue organizational boundary controlling influence shift internal external actor particularly relates ability control direct organizational resource also central concern
Many observed public organization notable porosity boundary Waldo Kaufman Gawthrop
The federal government structured deliberately disburse authority among competing institution Allison member Congress administration official interest group concerned citizen others influence bureaucratic actor
This obfuscates goal objective within organization
Of equal significance fact many external influence notably Congress controlling influence resource available organization thus complicating authority issue
Other institutional influence profoundly shape federal agency activity include civil service law regulation impose great complexity rigidity system
Recruiting testing hiring firing rewarding constrained federal government National Academy Public Administration
As result externally imposed constraint managerial discretion traditionally limited fact discouraged provision merit system Ingraham
Although emerging evidence federal manager use whatever flexibility available including provided existing performance appraisal system also strong evidence procedural constraint deter strongest heart unpublished document General Accounting Office
A frequently cited example boundary problem demonstrated fact Congress retained statutory control development federal government performance appraisal system rather delegating development implementation component Office Personnel Management
The rationale balance managerial discretion employee right context system made easier agency fire incompetent employee result hobble decision making manager
On one hand Civil Service Reform Act legislation provided requirement detailed performance appraisal standard could used manager proof unsatisfactory performance
On hand manager ability act regarding unsatisfactory performance limited statute providing employee strong substantive right opportunity improve unacceptable performance action taken ability appeal performance appraisal rating within agency externally Merit Systems Protection Board
This led situation best number year required release inadequate employee cost borne manager serve strong disincentive appraising mediocre performance accurately
Another feature federal context warrant consideration whether dominant motivation among employee comparable worker work pay performance implemented
Although long tradition simply applying motivation theory technique public sector recent study finding different source motivation different motivational pattern among public employee
Perry Wise explore role public service motivator Rainey document fairly consistent pattern difference public private manager relation money job satisfaction security organizational commitment
In review article Perry Porter noted employee higher achievement need tend value economic wealth le entrant private sector
Furthermore evidence public manager particularly highest level organization keenly attuned public perception effectiveness overall usefulness policy program administer Ingraham Barrilleaux
Federal Employee Attitude Surveys demonstrated manager perceived generalized bureaucrat bashing personalized attack
More recent study Merit Systems Protection Board General Accounting Office indicate manager continue tie overall job satisfaction perception appreciation public
These finding suggest policy maker would well give attention nonmonetary motivator concert plan strengthen tie pay performance
Finally one important contextual factor governs new performance appraisal pay performance system likely function le satisfactory experience federal employee merit pay system implemented last year
We conducted study performance appraisal pay performance private sector help director Office Personnel Management federal policy maker rethink Personnel Management Recognition System
What learned provide blueprint linking pay performance federal sector even specific remedy ail PMRS
Instead conclude general suggestion priority
Performance appraisal rating influence many personnel decision thus care development use performance appraisal system warranted
There however obvious technical psychometric solution performance management issue facing federal government
Further refinement technology performance appraisal extensive new job analysis modification existing rating scale rater training program unlikely provide substantially valid accurate appraisal currently force particularly managerial professional job
There also evidence one particular appraisal format clearly superior others
For example know format managerial appraisal popular private sector yield le valid appraisal supervisory rating used government
There appears least much effort expended performance appraisal federal government elsewhere
More generally pursuit psychometric sophistication performance appraisal system used federal government unlikely contribute enhanced individual organizational performance
Where performance appraisal viewed successful private sector firmly embedded context management personnel system provide incentive manager use performance appraisal rating organization intends
These incentive include managerial flexibility discretion rewarding top performer dismissing continually perform standard
When performance appraisal rating used distribute pay merit plan size merit pay offered allows manager differentiate outstanding performer good poor performer thus provides incentive differentiate
For example top performer may receive percent base salary merit pay good performer percent poor performer merit increase
Finally manager assessed result performance appraisal activity
We struck apparent contrast incentive private federal manager use performance appraisal merit plan effectively
Whatever incentive federal manager seem currently dwarfed disincentive
In order motivate employee provide incentive perform merit plan pay performance plan must theoretically define communicate performance goal employee understand view doable b consistently link pay performance c provide payouts employee see meaningful
These condition seem straightforward notion pay performance thus becomes deceptively simple
Our review research practice indicate however selecting best pay performance plan implementing organizational context condition met currently much art science
We generalize pay performance plan work federal government considerable organizational work force diversity
We suggest given diversity importance matching pay performance plan organization context federal policy maker consider Decentralizing design implementation many personnel program including appraisal merit pay program within framework central policy guideline extent possible given government legitimate concern facilitating interagency mobility standardization comparability equity
Supporting careful controlled pilot study variety pay performance system variety agency
These study would serve identify important design implementation evaluation issue user policy maker research community along incentive investigate issue
They could take variety form useful must provide careful measure preand postintervention condition
Ensuring fair equitable treatment employee important objective personnel system
Yet heavily legalistic environment surrounding federal civil service led dependence formal procedure elaboration protection requirement procedure ultimately provide powerful disincentive manager use personnel system organization intends
Although protection meant ensure employee equity clear proliferation provides federal employee greater sense equity seen many organization
Effective reform personnel management pay system federal government may well need part fundamental rethinking past notion political neutrality merit protection civil service
Our entire review stressed importance viewing performance appraisal merit pay embedded broader pay personnel management organizational context
For example mean relevant contextual factor issue comparability federal base salary pay equivalent job may pose severe problem acceptance merit pay pay performance system promise recently enacted legislation prof illusory
We realize broader change suggested analysis context costly suggest making programmatic change Performance Management Recognition System isolation unlikely enhance employee acceptance system improve individual organizational effectiveness significantly long run may prove le costly
Pay performance become buzzword organization seek way boost employee productivity
The new emphasis performance appraisal merit pay call thorough examination effectiveness
best resource date issue whether concept work applied effectively workplace
This important book look performance appraisal pay practice private sector describes whether private industry experience revelant federal pay reform
It focus need federal government exploring federal pay system evolved available evidence federal employee attitude toward work pay reputation public complicating pervasive factor politics

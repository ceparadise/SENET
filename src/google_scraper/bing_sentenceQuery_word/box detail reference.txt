In science computing engineering device system object viewed term input output without knowledge internal working
Its implementation opaque black
Almost anything might referred black box
To analyse something typical black box approach behavior accounted infer unknown
The usual representation centered box
The opposite black box system inner component logic available inspection commonly referred sometimes also known clear box glass box
The modern term black box seems entered English language around
In electronic process led electronic circuit regarded black box characterized response signal applied traced published idea developed form
Although Cauer use term others followed certainly describe method analysis
put concept even earlier attributing explicit use black box argues component implicitly treated
In full treatment given
A black box described unknown system identified using technique
He saw first step able copy output behavior black box
Many engineer scientist epistemologist used perfected black box theory
The abstraction representing class concrete viewed solely term The constitution structure box altogether irrelevant approach consideration purely external phenomenological
In word behavior system accounted
The understanding based explanatory principle An observer make observation time
All observation input output written table form sequence time state various part input output recorded
Thus using example examining box fallen might lead protocol Thus every system fundamentally investigated collection long protocol drawn time showing sequence input output state
From follows fundamental deduction knowledge obtainable Black Box given input output obtained protocol nothing
If observer also control input investigation turn illustration hypothesis tested directly
When experimenter also motivated control box active feedback relation promoting called architecture
The construction predictive using existing historic data observation table
A developed validated model method ensures based solely element
With input past event used modeling effort entered model see well output match known result
thing defined term function
The term applied field otherwise inquiry definition made relation appearance something
specifically thing black box state related characteristic behaviour within
Specifically inquiry focused upon thing immediately apparent characteristic therefore factor consideration held within hidden immediate observation
The observer assumed ignorant first instance majority available held inner situation away investigation
The element definition shown characterised system observable element enter perhaps imaginary box set different output emerging also observable
In one us black box theory describe understand factor field marketing applied analysis
The state fully understood output
however even wider application professional study The child try open door manipulate handle input produce desired movement latch output learn control one without able see internal mechanism link
In daily life confronted every turn system whose internal mechanism fully open inspection must treated method appropriate Black Box
This simple rule proved effective illustration Black Box principle cybernetics used control situation gone deeply may seem complex
A example Black Box principle treatment mental patient
The human brain certainly Black Box great deal neurological research going understand mechanism brain progress treatment also made observing patient response stimulus

relation object one object designates act mean connect link another object
The first object relation said second object
It called second object
The second object one first object refers called first object

In case method used intentionally hide reference observer
References feature many sphere human activity knowledge term adopts shade meaning particular context used
Some described section
The word derived carry back formed bear
A number word derive root including
The verb derivative may carry sense link connect meaning described article
Another sense consult reflected expression etc
In reference generally construed relationship object named
Hence John refers person John
The word refers previously specified object
The object referred called word
Sometimes relation called word denotes object
The converse relation relation object word called object exemplifies word denotes
In syntactic analysis word refers previous word previous word called

A cell reference spreadsheet program like Excel Google Spreadsheets identifies location
A cell one structure fill worksheet cell located mean cell reference consisting letter number intersect cell location
When listing cell reference column letter always listed first Cell reference used function Excel command
One advantage using cell reference spreadsheet formula normally data located referenced cell change formula chart automatically update reflect change
If workbook set automatically update change made worksheet manual update carried pressing key keyboard
Cell reference us restricted worksheet data located
Cells referenced different worksheet
When occurs name worksheet included shown formula row image includes reference cell Sheet workbook
Similarly data located different workbook referenced name worksheet included reference along cell location
The formula row image includes reference cell located sheet name second workbook
While reference often refer individual cell also refer group cell
Ranges identified cell reference cell upper left lower right corner range
The two cell reference used range separated colon tell Excel Google Spreadsheets include cell start end point
An example range adjacent cell shown row image SUM function used total number range
There three type reference used Excel Google spreadsheet easily identified presence absence dollar sign within cell reference A second advantage using cell reference formula make easier copy formula one location another worksheet
Relative cell reference change copied reflect new location formula
For example formula copied cell reference would change formula would Their name come fact change relative location copied
This usually good thing relative cell reference default type reference used formula
At time though cell reference need stay static formula copied
To absolute reference A A used change copied
Still time may want part cell reference change column letter row number stay static vice versa formula copied
This mixed cell reference used
Whichever part reference dollar sign attached stay static part change copied
So copied column letter always A row number change
The decision use different cell reference creating formula based location data used copied formula
The easiest way change cell reference relative absolute mixed press key keyboard To change existing cell reference Excel must done double clicking cell mouse pointer pressing key keyboard
To convert relative cell reference absolute mixed cell reference There error

There many programming language
To execute compiled interpreted
An IDE integrated development environment used write code test error translate program
Translators usually included within programming convert
Translators
assembler translates assembly language machine code
language written mnemonic closely reflects operation
An interpreter CPU instruction interpreter move translate next instruction
Interpreted code show error soon hit problem easier code
An interpreter create independent final set source code created time run
Interpreted code slower execute compiled code
Interpreted language include JavaScript PHP Python Ruby
Interpreted language also called language
These ideal using within web application
They used coding small program executed within
A compiler
It difficult test individual line compiled code compared interpreted language reported program compiled
The saved stored separately code
Compilation slow machine code executed quickly

In explanation
They added purpose making source code easier human understand generally ignored
The various programming language varies considerably
Comments sometimes processed various way generate documentation external source code used integration system kind external
The flexibility provided comment allows wide degree variability formal convention use commonly part guide
Comments generally formatted either also called also called
Block comment region source code may span multiple line
This region specified delimiter delimiter
Some programming language allow block comment recursively nested inside one another others
Line comment either start comment delimiter continue end line case start specific column character line offset source code continue end line
Some programming language employ block line comment different comment delimiters
For example block comment delimited span multiple line line comment delimited
Other language support one type comment
For example comment line comment start continue end line
How best make use comment subject dispute different commentator offered varied sometimes opposing viewpoint
There many different way writing comment many commentator offer sometimes conflicting advice
Comments used form outline intention prior writing actual code
In case explain logic behind code rather code
If type comment left simplifies review process allowing direct comparison code intended result
A common logical fallacy code easy understand
Comments used summarize code explain programmer intent
According school thought restating code plain English considered superfluous need code may sign complex rewritten naming bad
Comments may also used explain block code seem fit convention best practice
This especially true project involving little development time bug fixing
For example Sometimes source code contains novel noteworthy solution specific problem
In case comment may contain explanation methodology
Such explanation may include diagram formal mathematical proof
This may constitute explanation code rather clarification intent others tasked maintaining code base may find explanation crucial
This might especially true case highly specialized problem domain rarely used optimization construct
For example programmer may add comment explain chosen instead former theory slower latter
This could written follows diagram consisting construction inserted source code formatted comment
Further notice embedded within source code comment
Binary data may also encoded comment process known although practice uncommon typically relegated external resource file
The following code fragment simple ASCII diagram depicting process flow script contained running
Although section marking code appears comment diagram actually appears section technically considered distinct comment serve similar purpose
Although identical diagram could easily included comment example illustrates one instance programmer may opt use comment way including resource source code
Comments computer program often store metadata program file
In particular many put submission guideline comment help people read source code program send improvement make back maintainer
Other metadata includes name creator original version program file date first version created name current maintainer program name people edited program file far URL documentation use program name program file etc
When algorithm section program based description book reference comment used give page number title book reference
A common developer practice meaning add comment syntax causing block code become comment executed final program
This may done exclude certain piece code final program commonly used find source error
By systematically commenting running part program source error determined allowing corrected
An example commenting code exclusion purpose The code fragment suggests programmer opted disable debugging option reason
Many allow quick adding removing comment single menu option key combination
The programmer mark part text want un comment choose appropriate option
sometimes store documentation comment
These may include insert position automatic header file inclusion command set file mode file
These functional control comment also commonly referred
Keeping documentation within source code comment considered one way simplify documentation process well increase chance documentation kept date change code
Examples documentation generator include program use Java
Forms supported
implement similar feature called XML Comments read compiled assembly
Occasionally syntax element originally intended comment convey additional information program
Such hot comment may practical solution maintains widely regarded
Sometimes comment source code used way relieve stress commenting development tool competitor employer working condition quality code
The occurrence phenomenon easily seen online resource track source code
There various normative view opinion regarding proper use comment source code
Some informal based personal preference others published promulgated formal guideline
Experts varying viewpoint whether comment appropriate source code
Some assert source code written comment basis source code
Others suggest code extensively commented uncommon character source code contained within comment
In view assertion comment neither beneficial harmful matter correct kept sync source code omitted superfluous excessive difficult maintain otherwise unhelpful
Comments sometimes used document contract approach programming
Depending intended audience code consideration level detail description may vary considerably
For example following Java comment would suitable introductory text designed teach beginning programming This level detail however would appropriate context production code situation involving experienced developer
Such rudimentary description inconsistent guideline Good comment clarify intent
Further professional coding environment level detail ordinarily meet specific performance requirement defined business operation
There many stylistic alternative available considering comment appear source code
For larger project involving team developer comment style either agreed upon project start evolve matter convention need project grows
Usually programmer prefer style consistent easy modify difficult break
The following code fragment C demonstrate tiny example comment vary stylistically still conveying basic information Factors personal preference flexibility programming tool consideration tend influence stylistic variant used source code
For example Variation Two might disfavored among programmer automate alignment visual appearance text comment
Software consultant technology commentator Allen Holub one expert advocate aligning left edge comment The use block comment delimiters inherited B programming language immediate predecessor C programming language
In form text ASCII character end line ignored
Different style chosen different area code individual line paragraph routine file program
If syntax support line comment block comment one method use line comment minor comment declaration block edits use block comment describe abstraction function class file module
Sometimes project try enforce rule like one comment every ten line
These kind rule counterproductive rigorous may provide useful standard measurement consistency project participant deem necessary
Inline comment using character part language
However Dennis Ritchie BCPL B language chose use block comment instead
This choice continued C language Ritchie successor Inline comment using reappeared successor C influenced adoption
Programmers may use informal comment assist indexing common issue
They may able searched common programming tool utility even within
These sometimes referred codetags token
Such tag differ widely might include Typographic convention specify comment vary widely
Further individual programming language sometimes provide unique variant
For detailed review please consult article
The programming language us indicate comment end line
For example This section code show two style comment used language
This code fragment completely functioning program REM keyword used add comment describe program
Any text line apostrophe character also treated comment BASICs including descendant
An example Visual Basic This code fragment demonstrates use prologue comment block comment describe purpose
The comment explains key term concept includes short signature programmer authored code
Since also possible use syntax indicating comment
The may used mark comment Cisco router configuration mode
Such comment however saved contains displayed show run command
By contrast following command insert content actually part configuration may saved The description command used add description configuration interface neighbor name parameter may used add remark static route
Access list may also contain remark
us comment similar instead two dash us three
These comment caught ColdFusion engine printed browser
This code fragment demonstrates comment used language
A letter C column cause entire line treated comment
Note column line otherwise treated four field label field cause line taken continuation previous statement declaration statement go
This code fragment demonstrates comment used language comment describing basic formatting rule
Line comment Haskell start two hyphen end line multiple line comment start end
Haskell also provides method commenting known
In line starting interpreted code everything else considered comment
One additional requirement always leave blank line code block Literate programming also done Haskell using
The code environment used instead Richard Bird style In style equivalent example code environment could defined LaTeX preamble
Here simple definition later This code fragment show block comment used describe method
The formatting consistent standard
The comment designed read Javadoc processor
us precede comment comment
The programming language us single line comment similar way language
Lua also block comment start run closing For example A common technique comment piece code enclose code In case possible reactivate code adding single hyphen first line In first example first line start long comment two hyphen last line still inside comment
In second example sequence start ordinary comment first last line become independent comment
In case outside comment
In case last line becomes independent comment start
Long comment Lua complex read section called Long string

In programming language character indicates comment
Multi line comment also available via bracket nested
us nestable comment useful commenting code block
In Niklaus Wirth family language including comment opened completed
example In modern dialect Pascal used instead
Line comment many begin hash symbol
Instead regular block commenting construct Perl us markup language instance Perl us line comment POD Documentation comment regular see Perl section add configurable block comment type embedded comment
These start hash character followed backtick opening bracketing character end matching closing bracketing character
The content span multiple line also embedded inline
Comments either style inline block use hash
style adapted Javadoc common standard documenting PHP code
Comments Comments use hash character two example code Specific block comment exist Python bare represented string could used
In example triple string act way comment also treated Comments
Single line commenting line start hash commenting comment go keywords begin end Comments SQL form using two dash The syntax also support alternative format specifying comment
One format supported syntax identical block comment style used syntax Java
comment begin two Multiline comment start followed asterisk end asterisk followed Multiline comment Swift nested inside multiline comment
You write nested comment starting multiline comment block starting second multiline comment within first block
The second block closed followed first block Comments HTML introduced spread several line terminator For example In comment viewable end user program
In case section code commented may present security

also known used measure size counting number line text program
SLOC typically used predict amount effort required develop program well estimate software produced
Many useful comparison involve line code project
Using line code compare line project line project far useful comparing line project line project
While debatable exactly measure line code discrepancy order magnitude clear indicator software complexity
There two major type SLOC measure physical SLOC LOC logical SLOC LLOC
Specific definition two measure vary common definition physical SLOC count line text program source code excluding comment line
Logical SLOC attempt measure number executable statement specific definition tied specific computer language one simple logical SLOC measure number semicolon
It much easier create tool measure physical SLOC physical SLOC definition easier explain
However physical SLOC measure sensitive logically irrelevant formatting style convention logical SLOC le sensitive formatting style convention
However SLOC measure often stated without giving definition logical SLOC often significantly different physical SLOC
Consider snippet C code example ambiguity encountered determining SLOC In example Depending programmer coding standard line code could written many separate line In example Even logical physical SLOC value large number varying definition
Robert Park Software Engineering Institute others developed framework defining SLOC value enable people carefully explain define SLOC measure used project
For example software system reuse code determining reused code include important reporting measure
At time people began using SLOC metric commonly used language language
These language developed time main form data entry programming
One punched card usually represented one line code
It one discrete object easily counted
It visible output programmer made sense manager count line code measurement programmer productivity even referring
Today commonly used computer language allow lot leeway formatting
Text line longer limited column one line text longer necessarily corresponds one line code
SLOC measure somewhat controversial particularly way sometimes misused
Experiments repeatedly confirmed effort highly correlated SLOC program larger SLOC value take time develop
Thus SLOC effective estimating effort
However functionality le well correlated SLOC skilled developer may able develop functionality far le code one program fewer SLOC may exhibit functionality another similar program
In particular SLOC poor productivity measure individual since developer develop line yet far productive term functionality developer end creating line generally spending effort
Good developer may merge multiple code module single module improving system yet appearing negative productivity remove code
Also especially skilled developer tend assigned difficult task thus may sometimes appear le productive developer task measure
Furthermore inexperienced developer often resort highly discouraged costly maintain result higher SLOC
SLOC particularly ineffective comparing program written different language unless adjustment factor applied normalize language
Various balance brevity clarity different way extreme example would require hundred line code perform task character
The following example show comparison written program written language known particularly verbose
Another increasingly common problem comparing SLOC metric difference code
Modern software tool often capability enormous amount code click mouse
For instance automatically generate source code simply dragging icon onto workspace
The work involved creating code reasonably compared work necessary write device driver instance
By token custom GUI class could easily demanding simple device driver hence shortcoming metric
There several cost schedule effort estimation model use SLOC input parameter including widely used Constructive Cost Model series model et Galorath
While model shown good predictive power good estimate particularly SLOC estimate fed
Many advocated use instead SLOC measure functionality since function point highly correlated SLOC automatically measured universally held view
According Vincent Maraia SLOC value various operating system product line follows studied distribution reported Red Hat Linux version released April contained million physical SLOC
He also extrapolated developed conventional proprietary mean would required development effort would cost billion year dollar
A similar study later made version also known Potato operating system originally released August
This study found Debian included million SLOC developed conventional proprietary way would required cost billion USD develop
Later run tool used report following release Debian million SLOC year newest release going include million SLOC
One find figure major operating system various Windows version presented table
In documentary Microsoft executive criticized use counting line code In IBM religion software say count thousand line code
How big project
Oh sort project
This
And
And IBM wanted sort make religion got paid
How much money made much
How many
And kept trying convince hey developer got good idea get something done instead make le money
Because made something smaller faster le

The fundamental equation computer Computer Powerful Stupid Computers powerful looking large amount data quickly
Computers literally perform billion operation per second
However individual operation computer perform extremely simple mechanical nothing like human thought insight
A typical operation language computer adding two number together
So although computer fast operation extremely rigid simple mechanical
Or put another way computer like HAL movie A Space Odyssey
If nothing else intimidated computer sort brain
The computer mechanical tool amazing thing requires human tell
Since computer totally mechanical stupid manage many useful thing
The gap computer something useful human programmer creates solution
Programming person using insight would useful could done breaking step code computer follow
refers language computer understand
For lecture write run short snippet code understand essential quality computer especially strength limitation
Experimenting code nature computer come clearly powerful way limited mechanical quality
IMHO mixed nature computer something everyone understand use well intimidated
Within hour lecture special effect image following But print
We going start learning programming element later recombine element solve many problem
These first element simple much look
Be patient soon put element together like lego brick make pretty neat project
For class use variant language known Javascript added feature course
The Javascript language work web browser experiment live right browser nothing else required
We look Javascript needed experiment full language one would see using Javascript professionally
That said Javascript real language code real code
Our small program show important feature code keeping thing fast small
Here code call print function
Click Run button computer run code output code appear right
Note recognized function code hello string passive data like verb noun
The computer ignores comment way write note code
Comments use temporarily remove line code commenting code placing left
The syntax shown must rigidly followed code work function name parenthesis string opening closing quote comma separating value function call
The rigidity syntax reflection limitation computer natural language fixed mechanical
This important absorb working computer I think many people get derailed getting started computer
You write something human could understand computer understand code fit computer mechanical syntax
When writing computer make trivial superficial syntax mistake code
The expert programmer earth make sort error time think nothing
The syntax error reflect flawed strategy author
It natural step translating thought mechanical language computer
As see fixing error fast
It important derailed little case
To help teach pattern many example showing typical error see error message look like see fix
For snippet code error
Sometimes error message generated computer point problem accurately sometimes error message reveals error deeply confused computer create accurate error message
Firefox currently produce helpful error message often pointing specific line problem
These syntax problem quick fix
Change code run produce following output For example problem shown lecture solution available shown
So revisit problem practice still see solution like

TMitTB fair clothes often dress like Weezer check every week
He brings document
Every document name
The functional specification set least thousand statement user clicking button
Upon accessing Web page user logged identified name welcomed logged encouraged log create account
See user registration workflow

From list various error message
It sort blueprint word occasional program exist
Some part functional specification refer user story tiny hypothetical narrative people using site As visitor website I want search product I quickly purchase I Then something TMitTB call wireframe picture website look created program make everything seem sketched hand little though produced computer
This one get wrong idea take seriously
Patronizing point taken
You rarely see TMitTB person often conference present panel
He tweet panel note LinkedIn page
Often take picture audience stage see assembly mostly men many beard majority seem peering laptop instead stage
Nonetheless tweet accompanies photo say something like AMAZING audience
panel microservice architecture He often tell important purpose recruiting
Who say wrong
It cost much hire senior programmer hire midlevel executive maybe going conference job two month hired four people
His two recent hire Boston Hungary neither place office
But matter
Every day standup meeting via something called Slack essentially like Google Chat sort plaid visual theme programmer seem agree wonderful fruitful way work
I watch commits TMitTB say
Meaning every day review code team writes make sure
No one pushing production without test passing
We Your meeting comparison go hour people arranged around
You wonder get programmer stand already use standing desk
Perhaps ticket
Honestly would like go conference sometimes panel
You could drink bottled water hold forth fine
Conferences
The website Lanyrd list hundred technology conference June
There event software tester Chicago Twitter conference São Paulo one enterprise content management Amsterdam
In New York alone Big Apple Scrum Day Razorfish Tech Summit entrepreneurship boot camp veteran conference dedicated digital mapping many conference digital marketer one dedicated one Ruby one Scala programming language couple breakfast conference cascading style sheet one text analytics something called Employee Engagement Awards
Tech conference look like expect
Tons people Sheraton keynote Ballroom Or enormous stream people wandering South Southwest Austin
People come together dozen thousand attend panel ostensibly learn attend presentation brush skill secondary conference function one acculturation
You go technology conference affirm tribal identity transfer throng dilettante zone professional
You pick swag talk vendor thing

There keynote people created technology hand crafted given language
There regular speaker often paid airfare present idea technique approach
Then panel group people lined row forced semblance interaction audience check
I little panel
They tend drift
I sure exist
Here thing technology conference There much sexual harassment much sexist content conference
Which stupid computer dumb rock lacking genitalia
Women software enough started write post blog
Other woman
The problem pervasive There lot conference many report harassing behavior
The language Ruby preferred language startup bros developed worst reputation
At Ruby conference someone gave talk subtitled Perform Like Star sexy slide
That dispiriting
There criminal incident
Conferences began develop code conduct rule algorithm people men really follow
If subject witness unacceptable behavior concern please notify community organizer soon possible php architect dedicated providing event experience everyone tolerate harassment offensive behavior form
The Atlanta Java Users Group AJUG dedicated providing outstanding conference experience attendee speaker sponsor volunteer organizer involved DevNexus GeekyNerds regardless gender sexual orientation disability physical appearance body size race religion financial status hair color hair amount platform preference text editor choice
When people started talking conference behavior also began talk larger problem programming culture
This always issue conference issue gave people point common reference
Why many men field
Why behave strangely
Why hard group female programmer behave typical adult way
I go work I stick like sore thumb
I mistaken administrative assistant
I asked I physical security despite security wearing distinctive uniform wrote Erica Joy Baker worked among place Google
Always woman meeting often first female R D engineer first female project lead first female software team company I worked wrote another woman magazine
Fewer fifth undergraduate degree computer science awarded went woman according National Center Women Information Technology
Less percent people computing woman
And number woman computing fallen since even market skill expanded
The pipeline huge problem
And yet unsolvable
I met manager built perfectly functional large team half female coder

Programming despite hype fantasy programmer world intellectually demanding task imaginable
Which lead one inescapable conclusion The problem woman technology woman
Many conference organized around specific programming language specific community PyCon Python programmer Strata conference big data Oscon coder ritual event people community
Attendees gather talk post video YouTube
Language matter
Programmers track success computer language way people track sport ranking commenting Web forum Reddit many language get subreddit currently reader run venture capital firm Y Combinator company named special kind function operates function named series paper written mostly influential programming language name nerdier subject matter
There hundred programming blog
Many large corporation let engineer blog generous gift given many recruiter hovering
Discussions programming go everywhere public time hundred language
There keen sense coming fading
It simply fashion one career programmer depends demonstrating capacity one language
So ranking frequently updated rarely shocking
As April world computer language according Tiobe index us variety indicator generate single ranking world programming Java C C followed JavaScript PHP Python
The ranking necessarily inexact another list consulting firm called RedMonk give JavaScript top spot followed Java
There many possible conclusion obvious one thing equal good Java programmer performs well interview career option similar candidate using obscure language
If code time language break top heard read blog post heard people lament terrible wonderful misguided possibly watched video tutorial played little
Taking new language spin good thing programmer
Often download file write couple line code decide want go
Most language free download use
Why people construct give away free language
Well creation good computer language work apex programmer
To produced successful language acknowledged monumental effort akin publishing multivolume history war fighting one
The reward glory
Changing language like fighting war language time trapped liminal state old busted self new promised version
Perl released language uniquely suited World Wide Web grew Web grew Perl supposed better every way redesign began grand pronouncement

Latest ETA Christmas
The Python language community keenly aware Perl community problem decided make necessary difficult change language part transition Version Version
They would modernize clean rough avoid grand reinventions
Development Python started first working version came transition ongoing
Making new language hard
Making popular language much harder still requires smile fortune

A language software making software
The standard library set premade software reuse reapply
Take Python battery included meaning come ton preexisting code organized module reuse
Its standard library function let copy Web page replace word document
What mean process text
Well might string text The Quick Brown Fox save variable called
So call standard method string
You say make word lowercase producing quick brown Truly understanding language standard library one way one becomes proficient language
Typically visit Web page read book
But standard library beginning
For many Python enormous library prewritten module available nearly instantaneous download using package manager software
A module library package code intended extend language capability
Let say work advertising agency need process picture scale sharpen
You type one command Pillow module downloaded compiled automatically placed correct directory later reuse
You know course modern language module image processing also need know Pillow commonly used toolkit
Knowing find part job coding
You might learn Googling
You might ask friend
You might get information book website like The Hitchhiker Guide Python
A coder need able quickly examine identify giant complex library one recently actively updated best match current need
A coder need good listener
But payoff
Now Pillow installed typing fingertip dozen routine function related image processing use code change color rotate number degree scale convert GIF image JPEGs forth
Or need complex numerical analysis statistic work download NumPy suddenly enormous range mathematical algorithm available hundred year science research boiled
Audio processing interacting peculiar hardware speaking package thing
But need know find called
Code obscure command file

It possible C programmer Java programmer read code harder make C code Java code work together
C Java represent world different way structure data different way address component computer different way
There true benefit everyone team using language

So Unix spread Bell Labs academia large industrial system eventually leached water supply computing everywhere
And everywhere Unix went C sure go
C simple language simple like shotgun blow foot
It allows manage every last part memory file hard great meticulous dangerous sloppy
Software made C known fast

C
Java
What many people code daily actually C one many Vulgates
Advocates language make various argument favor better large group programming These language say organize code library shareable reusable le likely cause pain suffering
These adaptation If going understand code work corporate environment need understand programming
There many definition
I wade provide face consequence
programming essence filing system code
As anyone ever shared networked organized physical filing without good shared filing system office implode
C people said great language
An excellent language
But really let organize thing
You end function
It mess
I mean data structure customer name address forth function manipulating data thing function related data except naming convention
C consistent way name thing
Which mean hard find later
programming gave programmer great way name mean building library
I could call run picture dog Internet address
That approach sloppy dangerous lead bug forebear reasoned without precedent make hard program big team keep track everything
So whaaaat made little box called Customer call class taxonomical sense like Customer subclass specie human subclass mammal etc
put data method relating customer box
And box literally anything inside relates particular class
I mean even need look inside box
You download large set class nested inside one another study available public method expected data start programming
Hey say let put data object take data
Every time new customer make new instance class
Code black box tentacle wire sticking need want inside box
You put couple box next touch tentacle together watch eldritch mating
This work well theory
The archetypal programming language Smalltalk created coterie genius Xerox PARC institution glorious glory day
After year gestation Smalltalk born year C gelled around
It inspired many big idea computer science also Platonism cell biology predecessor language called Simula first language per name designed simulate thing
While C created within New Jersey research facility Bell Labs industrial monolith AT T solve problem hand Smalltalk built California outpost different industrial monolith Xerox solve problem distant future
Thus Smalltalk represents world differently Smalltalk funny name friendly attitude specification ran page
It big system
C gave abstraction entire computer helping manage memory process inside machine
Smalltalk gave abstraction reality could start dividing world class method like
Where C tried make easier computer thing Smalltalk tried make easier human thing
This better worse
It different
Here Smalltalk code It print short sentence Transcript Window user screen

You type select mouse even early tell computer execute
It compiles bit code add rest running system
It look like The thing box manipulated

It almost powerful The boundary clear data code file executables operating system application closed open border fuzzed design
Smalltalk vision computer native medium
The whole system modified anyone
The dominant version called Squeak logo cute mouse modernized version called Pharo logo lighthouse
Both free easy download
As middling programmer I find Smalltalk environment fascinating never pull way looking glass
One day I promised I read skim intent huge Smalltalk specification seminal text grand attempt organize reality along computer principle
The problem Smalltalk requires one adopt method working also philosophy world everything organized hierarchy class
I love play I typically stumble back familiar approach
Being advocate Smalltalk little like Slovenian cinema free jazz
Some advocate particularly brilliant people
I one
Smalltalk history often described slightly tragic many best idea never permeated culture code
But still around still user anyone use Squeak Pharo
The number digital thing conceived still regular discussion quite small
It year Al Green
The world corrupts pure vision great idea
I pronounce Smalltalk raging wild global success
Python interesting language quite popular
It rigid
And widely understood easier C programmer use provides abstraction programmer reuse
It hide much weirdness computer many detail computation performed
Python usually slower C price pay sweet level abstraction
In vast majority case difference speed truly matter regardless much people protest
It consequence built system Python part run million billion time slowing thus requiring resource get work done
What
Does mean need throw away Python start language
Probably
Python deserved reputation glue language meaning take code language C Fortran yes year code close machine known sound write wrapper That embed older faster code newer slower system
A big part process wrapping old code nice Python function
In many way idiom language look also feel
Some language emphasize brevity
Some support long complex function others encourage break functionality small piece
Style usage matter sometimes programmer recommend Strunk White right one English language
Its focus efficient usage resonates programmer
The idiom language part communal identity
Python glue everything though
It hard connect Java fit C hand glove
There version Python designed run inside Java use Java code
That called Jython
If want version work Microsoft go IronPython
But another way interpret activity around Python People love want work everywhere everything
They spent ten thousand hour making possible given fruit labor away
That powerful indicator
A huge amount effort gone making Python practical well pleasurable use
There lot conference frequent code update vibrant mailing list
You pick language technical merit speediness job opportunity may present also culture
Python people generally pretty cool
There website dedicated language benchmark measuring fast certain language run compared others includes preface stave riot These compiler interpreter
These program could written
These task could solved
These tiny It sometimes appears everyone coding beef
You feel coming Web page

Lisp blur line code data way allows function refer
It work little much ask regular programmer see world infinitely programmable
We need clarity
Which mean really need talk data
In interest understanding work open invitation TMitTB attend meeting programmer
Two late bravely ask one already attendance explain going
He quickly gather limit information series question beginning Do know Web page Here show To gather address name make Web page using HTML
Here change
And look like On today agenda How make sure registration positive experience user also secure experience company
The question discussed programmer tell along line Where put data
Will put text file
What
How act upon Enter remaining two programmer
Programmer A senior take place whiteboard
Let start Can define valid A via regular expression test
according RFC RFC
Let assume library OK
Do send everyone submits form confirmation message
We right
Is spec
No
Then
Well wait maybe update spec
It best practice
Can I say worry

We need check confirmation
Got
What really really worry temporary service right
Like allows give disposable address
So let anyone enter Mailinator address
Right one address
It like
So get list
There list actually
You go reload Mailinator page make list cross finger
Yeah looked
There list
Can rathole Mailinator talk overall security
I mean counting library validation good enough
No one going enter
Russians
Very possibly
But set upload limit right
Sort also allow people upload large image megabyte
So
No right
Those come lump someone could enter need check
I take want going relate overall database schema
Can catch database
That I take
Someone take picture whiteboard
Sure
And talk account expiration
Is spec
No dependency admin tool
Who owns
And go whiteboard whiteboard punctuated sound mobile phone fake camera shutter
Do need keep track many time How remove system What someone enters twice Programmer A leader seems professional
She whiteboard scribbling erasing scribbling erasing
Lists arrow box line
She wrote RUSSIANS
board
But hour realize This
One field
One little bit data
You even hit name yet
What user one name
What Bono Cher sign account
What Chinese Bono
Do want allow Chinese
What browser need support
Do call center people need able manage account
It hard think barrel cash burning
Programmer B entering thing tracking system creating issue assigning task people
A flurry assignment emerging meeting
Programmer C young annoying programmery others seem like well enough
How ensure credit card valid physical address real
Will perform financial transaction
Which external system integrate system
Who get sale report
We talk mailing list software
We talk password length number letter symbol necessary password secure whether password strategy site fit overall security profile company responsibility different division
So work
It go day
It get turned specification user story reviewed TMitTB right away conference tell overjoyed attended meeting
Not line code written throughout process
Data come everywhere
Sometimes come third import big pile music file record label
Sometimes data like tweet Facebook post Word document
Sometimes machine create data Fitbit exercise tracker Nest thermostat
When work coder talk data time
When create website need get data database put Web page
If Twitter tweet data
If IRS tax return data broken field
Data management problem programming supposed solve
But course computer everywhere keep generating data requires programming forth
It hell problem end sight
This people technology make much money
Not sell infinitely reproducible nothing sell many actually come new category infinitely reproducible nothing handle happened last batch
That ended big I conference packed
It rare large task ever far database
Amazon Google Yahoo Netflix huge powerful database
The prevalent relational database using language called SQL Structured Query Language
Relational database represent world using table row column
SQL look like Implying table called BOOKS row table book resides ID
IDs important database
Imagine bookstore database
It customer table list customer
It book table list book
And clever table purchase row every time customer bought book
Congratulations
You built Amazon
Of course trying build bookstore actually built death seems happen lot business
You set something cool end destroying lot thing came
Relational database showed never left
There Oracle course
Microsoft SQL Server IBM
They speak SQL work similar manner enough difference make costly switch
Oracle make pay thousand dollar use commercial enterprise database world run free software database PostgreSQL MySQL
There even tiny little database called SQLite small permissively licensed basically every smartphone available apps help save load data
You probably powerful database pocket right
If walk programmer say Big corporate programming think Java

Only two Lisp
Java programming language born Sun Microsystems
product team led programmer named James Gosling
It also look lot like C people understood language fairly easy pick
It conceived eventually floating onto Internet massive cloud marketing proclaimed answer every woe ever beset programmer
Java ran every computer
Java would run right inside Web browser applet soon called crapplets would probably take Web time
Java
It ran slowly compared traditional language What
Java
They also computer terminal called JavaStations
Java
Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers even announced million Java fund
But excitement Java sort hung
The future look like Sun said would
Java running inside Web browser never worked well
It slow clunky loaded felt like teetering edge disaster paranoia frequently validated browser froze crashed
jewelry meant serve kind digital card also low success rate
But Java free download designed useful small large team alike
Here fact Java help understand slowly took world sheer power pretty good
It big language
It came ton code already class library class method need talk database deal complex document mathematics talk various network service
There ton class library waiting turned object brought life
It automatically generated documentation
This huge
Everyone say code deserves excellent documentation documentation truly matter principle mostly proven breach
Now could run tool called would make Web page listed class method
It lousy documentation better nothing pretty easy enhance took time clean code
There lot Java manual workshop training seminar certification
Programmers take class test officially certified many technology
Java programmer especially wide range choose
It ran virtual machine meant Java ran everywhere meant could run Windows Mac Unix machine would behave
It exceptionally compromise
Which made perfect big company
As kept going Java became popular application server
Creating content management system nongovernmental organization employee
Java fine
Connecting ten thousand people company one another
Java
Need help one bank talk another bank every day
Java
Charts diagram big stack paper project
Java
Not exciting hardly wearable predictable
A language building great big thing great big place great big team
People complain work
Of course Microsoft intolerable
You company creeping bank enterprise dumb language
You people choosing run stuff virtual machine running Windows machine God Bill Gates intended
Don ever count Microsoft
Its great corporate skill always take sheer weirdness computer idea translate corporation language Global Business Leadership
Whatever discussed issue Microsoft offer least one
Statically typed scripting ambiguous adjective Microsoft sell something delivers write Windows code live Windows life
And disparagement Microsoft product good better anything else market
Enterprise feared word among programmer enterprise programming lot work without much show
Remember first version total disaster
Perfect example enterprise coding
At time programmer respect big work
We respect ambition huge heavy machine running big blob code
We grew reading supercomputer
Big iron cool even future seems huge cloud platform hosting ton cheap computer
But Java also wide use Google
It language place General Electric Accenture
These startup product schedule slip revenue beholden public market
Gigantic organization structured around code around getting software made
But mean team example famous rule Never meeting two pizza feed entire These company culture know make software
They whole department dedicated testing
The process important many moving piece many invisible
Academic researcher often produce thing basically work interface
They need prove thesis publish move next thing
People free software community often code scratch itch release code digital common people modify manipulate
While often process go nowhere time project capture imagination others become part infrastructure world
Java interestingly profit
It designed big corporate project infrastructure support
It also useful language midsize task
So library need processing logging file appearing steady clip improving standard library supplanting entirely
Eventually people realized like Java language could write language compile Java bytecode run Java virtual machine JVM
So many language run top Java
Some version language Jython JRuby
Others totally new like Scala one language Twitter began use outgrew Ruby
There also Clojure Lisp
That Clojure take computer language born update give language ability reuse Java class world
Clojure created Rich Hickey decided wanted new modern version Lisp
Lisp may old language still revered classic model thought like Braun shaver Eames chair mind
Hickey worked Clojure many year eventually adapting run JVM
This dramatic choice meant Clojure access entirety Java class library
Now walk office sit computer write little code elegant trim comfortable access thousand thousand incredibly totally functional free library use get work done
Anything Java Clojure
And since built atop JVM computer
There already Lisp editing tool pretty easy modify Clojure
It joined Java like remora shark
Or accurately remora attached remora JVM fake machine running inside real machine
Clojure beloved widely used
Perhaps become popular
It show interesting place
It used Stores collect manage receipt data example
It ported world Microsoft run right inside Excel
It craziest thing
Take spreadsheet
Inside spreadsheet Clojure code running away addressing different cell column
Someone made version compiles well transpiles JavaScript blam Clojure running Web browser
Actually version called ClojureScript
The point thing fluid world programming fluid way industry seem
Languages liquid infrastructure
You download program whoa suddenly working Clojure environment
Which actually Java Runtime Environment
You grab old PC outlived usefulness put Linux suddenly powerful Web server
Now participate whole new culture
There meetups gathering conference blog people chatting Twitter
And welcomed
They glad new blood
Java supposed supplant C run smart jewelry
Now run application server host Lisplike language core language Android operating system
It run billion thing
It
C designed supplant also
A lot thing keep winning computer keep getting plentiful
It weird
A week later office meeting ask TMitTB way use component way buy way
He make face
Sort say making system integrate system around company set system nothing truly shelf
There tool package library wit already use free code thing validation obviates much
Everything edge case say
Testing edge You come conclusion The world broken
Remember Netscape first huge commercial Web browser
In Java blooming Netscape resolving problem
It displayed Web page lively
You could nice cartoon monkey Web page way make monkey dance moved mouse
Figuring make happen job language developer named Brendan Eich
He sat week created language called JavaScript
JavaScript relationship Java tenuous strongest bond language marketing linkage name
And early history JavaScript uninspiring
So monkey could dance
You could thing cursor make thing blink mouse touched
But browser proliferated Web grew platform platform JavaScript became arguably widely deployed language runtime world
If wrote JavaScript code could run wherever Web
JavaScript puttered around year wilderness Java
But without resolute support corporate entity like Sun
Then decade ago people began talk Ajax idea could build real software Web page document program could real work
Things could respond change according input
You could distribute software hundred million people way JavaScript would work
It controlled Java much slower natively compiled C terrible lack nicety
And yet Gmail Google Maps Flickr Twitter Facebook
Every single pixel Web page manipulated type changed word move around button pressed
As celebrity whole industry dedicated spackling deficiency making look good
There book good part JavaScript library make easier consistent program jQuery turn many line code necessary make paragraph disappear single
Back era iPod Macintoshes Apple took code Web browser called Konqueror modified create Safari Web browser compete Microsoft Internet Explorer
Then Google started make modification Web engine underneath Safari called Webkit made version called Chrome JavaScript engine called
They made JavaScript fast
Devs still approach performance JS code riding horse cart tweeted one developer horse long replaced fusion Google better JavaScript fast
In developer named Ryan Dahl modified engine free software made run outside browser
There freestanding version JavaScript including ran inside Java natch none fast
He called fork took
One day JavaScript ran inside Web page
Then broke browser prison
Now could operate anywhere
It could touch hard drive send erase file
It real programming language
And client become server
Here JavaScript squaring number In great sudden wave thousand developer began use create modular library
If knew JavaScript worked Web page could make work server
And interesting characteristic language made good writing software handle lot simultaneous user
JavaScript listened lot thing Web browser A mouse move key typed information come network
On server could listen dozen hundred people give information requested
Soon community developed huge library software specific thing reading file chattering database talking Amazon Web service tool
At writing package billion copy various package downloaded past month
NPM stand Node Package Manager
It software help install package well unwieldy honestly many package great
It lot searching testing sighing
But much stuff pick free complain
JavaScript hodgepodge designed hurry run well know let say device might well get program
Your customer may iPhones probably way running JavaScript
So might use JavaScript make interesting Web page
You might use make application like Google Docs run browser
You might use make Web server talk Web browser
Or might use make API serf data client sure client could laptop Web browser
But client quite probably app smartphone
You get site running PHP minute problem
It used terrible choice made needed get something done Web increasingly JavaScript replaced default terrible choice
PHP stand Personal Home Interpreter
The idea loaded Web page PHP code would run page went Internet
And PHP could say check whether logged
If could show top secret account detail could say Please log I know lot people program PHP smart good people
PHP power Etsy Facebook
It power Wikipedia God sake
WordPress
Out Web page enormous percentage created PHP
Coding PHP living death sentence
Lots people gotten rich PHP
It mean lot cutting pasting lot trip Google figure thing working
Poor sad misbegotten incredibly effective massively successful PHP
Reading PHP code like reading poetry poetry wrote freshman year college
I spent many hundred maybe thousand hour programming PHP back I know I neither PHP
Reloading Web page finger sore
I hear sympathetic sob
Everything always broken people always hacking site
PHP
I wish harm
I glad see well done
We good time together
I ever want go back
One privilege owning Mac download program Apple called Xcode
This IDE Integrated Development Environment
It enormous download gigabyte roughly size hour video
Xcode heart Apple
It company writes software tool everyone want write software Mac iPhone
Within Xcode whole world explore
For example one component iOS SDK Software Development Kit
You use make iPhone iPad apps
That SDK made dozen dozen APIs Application Programming Interfaces
There API keeping track user location one animating picture one playing sound several rendering text screen collecting information user
And forth
Maybe starting see strand
Remember way Smalltalk environment worked screen bunch window
There powerful echo Xcode
There way tend code text editor black background far le see first glance though actually right serious code life
You fill field wire thing together really sometimes done connecting virtual wire virtual hole start coding
When someone Apple stand onstage announces new thing end Kit ResearchKit WatchKit set routine specifically Apple kit land fully documented used make software
Some function reserved manufacturer
You know Apple touting track someone heartbeat using Apple Watch
Apple documented yet world
Maybe company worried misuse somehow
Perhaps heartbeat monitoring requires careful battery management watch already battery issue Apple want avoid making thing worse letting anyone
It likely people trying figure access heartbeat API right though
That way people
Apple really good
It publishes interface guideline give people tool arranging app interface predictable way end user find familiar
It set flow go
Let say making podcasting application playing audio file key feature
Great
Create object class AVAudioPlayer add button screen connect button code clicked button sends message There lot going want leave operating system keep track window
It IDE help connect idea massive massive world ten thousand method play song rewind song keep track song played meaning also need aware time zone keep track title song mean need aware language song know display
You also know length song mean need mechanism extracting duration music file
Once need divide get minute
But song podcast minute long
Do want divide get hour
So many variable
Gah
I guess problem solve
The IDE everything
The greatest commercial insight technology industry control computing environment move market
You change way people thing way listen music watch video respond advertising
People work technology company supposed take idea multiply million people yielding billion dollar
A great way wrap intention APIs SDKs IDEs
That much software make software free It stimulates development even software
Sometimes result corporate ambition Java much Sun product class library true C Microsoft
But much code world freely available created generous volunteer decade serve need
The corporation programming language complex
Some language developer hired work language Go Python funded varying degree Google creator PHP work Etsy
Most commonly used button Usually list grid Used filtering Mac Finder Mail Designed toolbars Usage mystery Used toggle button New style push button indicator Apple Microsoft Amazon Google factory factory
Their APIs product many thousand hour labor many programmer
Think work involved
Someone need manage SDK
Hundreds programmer need write code
People need write documentation organize demo
Someone need fight feature get funded finished
Someone need make sure translation German completed embarrassing mistake go viral Twitter
Someone need actually write software go making IDE work
The modern OS feast wonder fast video music player bucket button
Apple may best imaginary button maker history
Just bezel work behold
Today bezel style NSThickSquareBezelStyle NSSmallSquareBezelStyle
Freedom
Sort
They still bezel
Things used require labor map rotating giant done line code
When everyone go Apple annual Worldwide Developers Conference San Francisco stare rapturously man untucked expensive shirt talk core data context
Onstage presenting Kits Apple rearranging abstraction saying Look new reality defined way difficult thing easy drab thing colorful
Your trust platform dedication thousand hour time misplaced
They pitched variation annually year
In Xcode compile everything one command pop software testing
You see button made
You need click
It yearns click
It cry shrill signaling voice like nano cat microfence
Everything inside computer beseeches everything else
It racket
You click mouse button cat finally satisfied
Now computer increase volume change color bring talking paper clip
Destiny fulfilled many round test complete
When app done may sell app store
And user excited use app motivated buy apps
Loops upon loop feeding one another capital accruing coffer patient software giant
An ecosystem
Ecosystem another debased word especially given keep real physical one around u
But hundred thousand people raising kid making thing million people call
Odds kind programming especially Web programming adopted framework
Whereas SDK expression corporate philosophy framework like product pitch
Want save time
Tired writing old code
Curious next new thing
You use graphic framework build graphical application Web framework build Web application network framework build network server
There hundred framework every language one
Django Reinhardt guitar virtuoso namesake Django framework A popular Web framework Django used coding Python
Instagram bootstrapped
When sit first time Django run command make directory file configuration inside
This project directory
Now access library service add enhance library
Suppose still making bookstore Amazonesque one relational database started page back
With Django run command
You might tell start app called bookstore
Then set model meaning start define data look using Python idiom framework translate
So make book catalog
Obviously need add author like
The incredibly neat thing line configuration completely functional working article editor wit That called admin view always main feature Django
Your work programmer started soon moment conception building publishing platform alpha tester maybe testing frame start play baby entering book trying thing
Take moment
You learn programming language like Python
You need make website allows dozen people enter data
You write line Python code set account people using admin start enter data
If time get good sort work
You get team started project hour
Remember issue entering address
If use Django use many taken care
Ditto many security concern arise building website typical abuse people perpetrate
You entered pool many thousand programmer share framework use suggest improvement write tutorial write used accomplish task related password blogging managing spam providing calendar accelerating site creating discussion forum integrating service
You think term architecture
Magnificent
Wonderful
So downside
Well framework lock way thinking
You look website trained eye go Oh Ruby Rails Frameworks obvious influence kind work developer
Some people feel framework make thing easy become crutch
It pretty easy code hole find trying force framework something want
Django example right tool building giant chat application would want try competing Google Docs using Django backend
You pay price speed control convenience
The problem really knowing much speed control convenience need
Programmers talk premature optimization code know real problem describe people overthink programming architecture There another tendency NIH invented come lot
Frameworks feel little insulting anticipate problem used thousand people
They imply common everyday problem rather special amazing mystery require true genius solve
The opinion framework strong strong SDK
Those tightly bundled often commercial arrive PR trumpet blasting especially Apple Microsoft
Frameworks tend derived frustration first release bound tape thrust onto Web blog post
From
There Web application framework every major language show almost different framework Java alone almost PHP
Most good framework free released solve problem bring glory influence creator rather great rich control
They spread organically
People see video tutorial showing make blog minute
Then copy work say That easy show friend
Websites go live programmer talk quickly developed said website
If building Web app fool use Web framework first
There tiny one control freak focused URL routing massive one like Django Rails pursue goal first outlined large system Smalltalk day yore enable development large collaborative system data manipulated shared
Take work done
DRY repeat
In programming many way destroy something create something
One stray character required
Say forget semicolon use accented é somewhere code prepared
Or add two thing together one numeral string might use say blackbird baked To computer numeric significance
This sort thing really happens part job remembering
Programming debugging
It expectation thing work
This something people bring like bring medical history first date
Most language construct built catching failure trapping like wild animal examining well exterminating
In time relationship programming language blossom come realize truly characterizes language tell broke
Most programming life spent trying figure broke computer help maybe watch kid play soccer
When I started programming I felt time program crashed I failed
I found cringing desperate unable move forward
There even novel Ellen Ullman anxiety social complexity arise serious bug hard find
Eventually though I learned submit
I let drift computer remember math I know thing I understand type category list syntax
Sometimes bug cause error message pop sometimes cause program give ghost quit suddenly sometimes get caught terrible loop fill memory choke resource computer restarted
That called stack overflow
Sometimes request go hard example calling many time stack finite resource fill take anymore
Hence name website Stack Overflow programmer go answer question help solve bug
It website world trailing Craigslist spot
Randomly selected item Stack Overflow give taste programming Angular embedding nested
view working TheOncomingCode seems saying using AngularJS framework JavaScript another piece code called
Judging name latter help set route address component user help manage view data
But wait turn actually Oh man
I went looked tool describes Yeoman generator modular AngularJS apps Gulp optional Polymer support I mean come hell
But know
In pound
Let
A search Yeoman say scaffolding tool mean make little folder Web apps help get started programming
Useful
We know Angular framework
Gulp website say automate enhance You intuit using context clue tool help build software
Somehow
You never know salmon background site sometimes simply get tired
Polymer Web component library mean give little reusable code component use Web drawer menu button etc
OK
So know combination Angular Yeoman Gulp Polymer somehow working TheOncomingCode
All thing tool designed make easier code
But introduce complexity
This person trying make Web browser something JavaScript crapping
Someone came answer question
To able use header state home state wrote Stack Overflow user Matt Tester need nested chained
So obvious safely make one state parent another separate way registration So
There go
That solves
JavaScript right
Too much know today useless six month
Every factoid absolute best principled way use language fetid zoo garbage end year
And sniveling bearded looking slightly right pale eye awkwardly mumbling Yeah wow say lot Gulp Angular I guessing use Fleejob Grimmex Snurt extension

I sure gon na like working Anyway one question Stack Overflow
More month go
Nothing built
The old website remains showing age infuriating everyone
Pressure mount
Pressure
The failed
The new CTO charlatan
TMitTB apparently spent time conference time actually working
These thing spoken loud kind company
Things said eye roll shrug hallway ordering address via BCC
You let antenna work
You hear word boondoggle late phrase like operationally There lot compliance governance
Earlier career might panicked
Instead feel sense calm
You call CTO TMitTB office soon back vicinity
They come looking sheepish
The CTO braced shoulder firm
TMitTB oscillates sheepish angry
People believe say pointing upward time cut loss shut If hover near programmer hear talk writing test passing test
Some even program written test code hope write must pas
This called design
Tests code course
They check function code
They run hope automatically find day work break thing
Relentless testing one way keep eye make sure person bug bug find one wintry night everyone home fireplace crash server right Christmas setting kind automated alarm forcing programmer terrible apology loop deeply annoyed spouse
One piece code world called SQLite database mentioned earlier probably smartphone
It developed Richard Hipp working year
It totally open totally free test
It one widely used piece software one respected
Bugs original sin programming
They part life like unwanted body hair political campaign
The original sin programming people code new feature trying jam change main codebase ready
Automated testing way head bug also way suggest write respectable code code earns salute
In opinion version control one beautiful thing programming
It one code culture gift world
Version control like track change Microsoft Word
That shameful monstrosity make even powerful computer stutter something lawyer could love
No version control something different
What I told Go could record every change made many many document go codebase Well interesting
I mean I could use kind thing
I could use find bug entered system example
record made minute permanent record Well powerful
I could use review progress team making I manager looking change every day
every change could reviewed anyone totally transparent way Everyone keep change understand code evolving
Every change
bundle change turn branch anyone make many branch needed without violating integrity branch I say sound like insane fantasy
Someone completely change code without interfering work others
could merge finished branch back main trunk code reviewing fixing inconsistency go My God like hear inside brain
So even though code huge pile fragile interdependent component I code team working branch I spent time solid testing suite appropriate time merge change run automated test make sure everything still working
everyone history every change ever made code even codebase decade old
Shut shut take everything disembodied code voice take everything
Take
completely totally free download default way distributing source code throughout world
And everyone get excited GitHub
You go GitHub really
You poke around look thousand repository read README file
And look code look commits
A commit moment action captured stored
You compare one commit another see diff see added removed
See figure
Take look screen shot
First looking Django repository
This actual code make Django Web framework run
It people keeping eye people starred favorite people copied code repository intention manipulating adding changing
These number represent invested user
There likely hundred thousand downloaded code use
We see user claudep
He five hour ago adding commit message read Fixed filename max He working file called mean particular new code marked green prefixed beginning line probably either test code code support test
And thanks user claudep code better six hour ago
This experience using version control
It combination news feed backup system
GitHub invent version control
It took program called git developed first Linus Torvalds chief architect Linux started adding tool service around
The way git work copy code change ever made code one command That copy code local machine
Now go change code heart delight
When done changing type add file changed asks enter commit message explaining done cause error think come start pushing code node repository
But permission would push change master branch git repository hosted GitHub
These command part sense memory many programmer
They type variation dozen time day checking code keep record work done rewind point go deep screw many thing
Sometimes change pile point look say This good
We ready release new code Maybe every two week maybe year
Maybe like Facebook time
If software Version could bundle change tag code
Behold Version
A change come second later coder far away matter Version
You done Version
Version part permanent record
You might fix bug call Version
You might add another feature call Version
Tools git give programmer common language
Did check ask
Which commit That going pushed Because commit get unique identifier pinpoint commit space time feel confident record code change way rarely feel confident anything
A side effect confidence increased automation
Let say Web server program popular serf hundred million people every month
It run different computer cloud
Aren something
Your diligent decentralized team frequently writes new code run server
So problem What best way get code onto computer
Click drag mouse
God
What animal
You set continuous integration server install let robot serve
Programmers hardly talk code
They chat data
They chat requirement interesting approach
And chat constantly deployment
Which make sense goal code brain testing world Web app form
Programmers good one want ship move next problem
So lot policy ton deploying fresh code
For example See test version control trigger actually shipping code
If follow process like release software several time day software would folly
Often build done nightly big build server one would come next morning get score
But software released via Web app store wait
Why continually release software every day whenever something ready go
I mean company everything imaginable slow shipping TMitTB say CTO wince
That fine expected stressful meeting
First I needed pas everything security team five month review TMitTB say took week get working development environment I developer sneaking Starbucks check code
You listen way listened people criticize project
But people promised new exciting way working would cut problem experienced failed technology initiative yore
They would agile would use new tool would attract talent would ship code
They knew big company startup signed
And casual observer failure
TMitTB noticed gained weight
The CTO several project roughly footing scattered across organization lost weight
I told I could I right TMitTB say
So need done month He sits back chair shallow visitor chair lightly padded back intended dramatic effect diminished
One lesson TMitTB tried get across big message matter code never done shipping new platform longer website platform interlocking component team continue work forever
There always new bug new feature new need
Such thing side effect growth platform insists designed scale
What one engineering understand perceive static exhausting enemy corporate world surround world static
yes battleship leave port
What coder seeing come believe staid enterprise world fear consequence apathy rather détente
They see stability
Where see obstacle intransigence see huge complex dynamic system flow river money people deeply afraid move anything would dam river
You feel pity coder
Obviously inherit earth
But race summit missed lot memo
I want ship TMitTB say
By mean I want I asked But much company hears I want destroy everything I touch
For I Kali destroyer best OK say
I understand
Here going You look CTO nod
First His mouth open shuts
He afraid realize understand work see software thing golden braid forever weaving
But coming around
Finding way programmer meeting
It like smartphone constant update
Nothing ever done
That fine
You let help optic continue
I need every day walking hall big smile face
Giving
Looking sleepy
Second I need release date real Next The CTO say name shake head
We work say
For conference
And talk sprint
Don talk milestone release
Talk people platform exists working month
Ask updated product The time
The CTO asks TMitTB We clear Yes TMitTB say
He fact ask question indicates might learning
He done lot work time get corporate pretend work
And pick language ask
This
We TMitTB say
We using
With Express Great say
Can wait see Beware argument related programming speed
All thing equal faster better
But thing never equal
Do need kind speed let get website running quickly
Or kind allows rotate thousand polygon real time
Do need convert PDFs text per hour
Or million PDFs text
These different problem
What need many time need existing code use help u many time
Ask question
It possible spend productive month preparing project without deciding language
It may sign fine manager someone assumes people learn new thing someone built agile team capable experimenting new technology getting idea production
It could also person totally useless
You find
Let say programmer developing huge website serf million people visit five time month
Do use Python slower Go fast something
Trick question
million Web page visit big deal unless involve deep wizardry complex database query different page good example Facebook
Now number trivial take minute make page need year make many way slow
If take second make page still million second month
So need figure serve page per second
You probably want one computer little redundancy good server setup
It take planning
But done language
What going serve hundred thousand page month
Then got tremendous breathing room
You need many engineer create system architecture
You still need plan general read blog post follow along others done
You pretty sloppy honest
Again language
What want include live chat page expect thousand people use chat speaking
Now dipping hand godforsaken river
But exactly problem Go designed solve
It language creating highly available server use much computer processor possible
It feature well Go shine
Actually work pretty well sort server Clojure certainly capacity
Oh right Java work
If really needed could even PHP
This choice hard
Everything everything people tell use everything everything
So need figure kind team kind framework like using people productive stick around completion project
This hard
Most place
So go lowest common know people leave able get
And OK
The vast majority technology project require original research require amazing technological discovery
All language discussion work fine
There great coder
But choice main programming language important signaling behavior technology company engage
Tell program Java I believe either serious boring
In Ruby interested building thing quickly
In Clojure I think smart wonder ship
In Python I trust implicitly
In PHP sigh together
In C I nod humbly
In C I smile assume nothing common
In Fortran I ask see security clearance
These language contain entire civilization
You tell well code organized across room
Or squinting zooming
The shape code foot away incredibly informative
Clean code idiomatic brief possible obvious even heavily documented
Colloquial friendly
As written aka SICP seminal textbook programming taught year MIT A computer language way getting computer perform operation novel formal medium expressing idea methodology
Thus program must written people read incidentally machine A great program letter current future person inherits code
A generous humanistic document
Of course nice flowery need work
One day go pen keep programmer
Their standup start hold cup coffee
They actually stand
Mostly men woman
They go around room person say yesterday plan today blocker
Most people office standup person people traveling chat
Two people dialed new hire Boston Hungary strong accent
They tell story rest
Yesterday I worked account deletion user story Boston say
Number
Today I writing unit test account deletion code
I blocked
I nominate Istvan go The line unmutes thick Hungarian accent say Yes yesterday I worked catalog admin tool product upload
I completed image upload feature
Today I also write unit test
I TMitTB say Istvan update JIRA JIRA commercial service function official record project
It strange hear thing approve line item discussed real actual thing
But also pleasing
On Wikipedia page list link page TDD BDD FDD DDD MDD development development design Each one advocate critic
I include amusement
If want go deeper management methodology
The management programmer discipline unto
There subdisciplines deal coder communicate
The prominent Agile methodology call regular coordination among programmer providing set ritual norm follow make program work program others
The yep manifesto read follows There signatory
And many variation Agile
I terrible meeting life I sat two team one explained length Agile Kanban better Agile Scrum
You could smell money burning
Here Agile I seen done You break product set user story need
You file story system often commercial product JIRA
You divide work sprint week two week whatever suit management style give sprint name goal implement search user registration programmer take story go make happen
Every day team check try unblock one working tool sends server working tell everyone
Then someone else step help stick story best everyone need working toward sprint goal trying release software
And sprint done deliver something actually really work move next thing slowly bringing large complex system operation
That ideal case
Done well avoids magical thinking It work get everything done wired together
It critic seem many branch
Scrum Kanban Agile Discipline Protestantism
Programmers forever searching silver bullet worse always think found
Which Frederick Brooks famous early software methodologists wrote paper called No Silver Accident Software He wrote
He hopeful back programming would help fix thing
Into office come TMitTB
He hold large bottle sort laptop look sleepy
You tell smile
We got release say
Ran little last He open laptop brings secret website assures seen within confines office network via virtual private network
It plain homely thing new website
Squares bumping square
The catalog item catalog screen image
The text sort weird character strange bug
There product name fake product real product I hate There related item purchase even though critical feature one major revenue driver current site
You suppress question
It
There however way log username password
TMitTB done favor creating account
You say first nonengineering person test site
This real ask
Yes
This software
It speaks database
This Does speak customer service He squint second
In July say
My God date
You extracted month something positively
He asked
He managed outward began gum work familiar way
He started demanding document people immediately began providing
He asked relative stranger insight suggestion gave willingly
They asked logo bigger
They asked game could played inside app
He listened
He conference month
So real actual Yes say taking sip complicated fermented beverage label
A sticker bottle say Now next sprint say
We push July
And release He look tired man
But also look proud
The thing team put used good modern tool
That craft pleasure TMitTB made possible work
We finally say going They standups
And standups go work integrated development environment write JavaScript JavaScript
Then run test check code source code repository continuous integration server perform test check go well deploy even August cloud another
They insist every day continuous release
Then come report
Revenue report analytics list new market conquer manner new customer data parcel distribute
That role owner global database customer intent
Thousands million new fact help company plan sale product development cycle
A good thing
And hope new site generate revenue faster better deployed across platform Web mobile Web multiple apps
You decided cut BlackBerry support
It stung three BlackBerrys desk drawer home none pocket
Life move
When site introduced buy coder cake send JavaScript conference choice
You learned appropriate reward people write JavaScript JavaScript
TMitTB get bonus
The CTO already considering new thing
You like CTO
She become friend sort
You feel S distance coming toward
It arrive due time stick front VP title well
The coder smile hall sat code review feature discussion stood quietly middle standups
You know name even could better job pronouncing
Perhaps future software
I spoke friend spent career technology
I complaining
I said I mentor millennials God
Every job contract position
Nothing come health care
They carry much They looked perplexity
It took moment one said Not You probably already code

The industry twist turn often though know next year bring
The iPhone mobile general created brief renaissance people could program using language people could worry computer memory
Perhaps Internet Things turn everything sensor
Already wander Disney World wristband watch track whole place computer
This require yet thinking
And website make apps build
There likely work
But global industry thousand people India great degree
Some used work Microsoft Google IBM
The thing made programming massive ship nothing charge perfect globalized industry

The real world data messy constantly converting one type thing another shading subtle

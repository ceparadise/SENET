Software may also written strong correspondence computer machine language instruction translated machine language using
An outline would first piece software written century planned
However neither Analytical Engine software ever created
The first theory creation computer know proposed Alan Turing essay decision problem
This eventually led creation twin academic field computer science software engineering study software creation
Computer science theoretical Turing essay example computer science software engineering focus practical concern
However prior software understand stored memory digital yet exist
The first electronic computing device instead rewired order reprogram
On virtually computer platform software grouped broad category
Based goal computer software divided Programming tool also software form program application also known use create
improve fix otherwise software
Software written one programming language many programming language existence least one implementation consists set programming tool
These tool may relatively program combined together accomplish task may form IDE combine much functionality tool
IDEs may either invoking relevant individual tool functionality new way
An IDE make easier specific task searching file particular project
Many programming language implementation provide option using individual tool IDE
Users often see thing differently programmer
People use modern general purpose computer opposed usually see three layer software performing variety task platform application user software
Computer software loaded
Once software loaded computer able software
This involves passing system software hardware ultimately receives instruction
Each instruction cause computer carry carrying altering instruction
Data movement typically one place memory another
Sometimes involves moving data memory register enable data access CPU
Moving data especially large amount costly
So sometimes avoided using pointer data instead
Computations include simple operation incrementing value variable data element
More complex computation may involve many operation data element together
Software quality important especially system software like
If software faulty buggy delete person work crash computer unexpected thing
Faults error called often discovered alpha beta testing
Software often also victim known progressive performance degradation resulting combination unseen bug
Many bug discovered eliminated debugged
However software testing every bug programmer say every program least one bug Lubarsky Law
In method software development separate testing team typically employed newer approach collectively termed developer often testing demonstrate software regularly obtain feedback
Software tested method done manually commonly automatically since amount code tested quite large
For instance extremely rigorous software testing procedure many operating system communication function
Many operation interact identify command program
This enables many people work NASA check evaluate functional system overall
Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering system operation function much easier together
The software license give user right use software licensed environment case also grant right right make copy
divided two type hand come granting recipient right modify redistribute software
Software patent like type patent theoretically supposed give inventor exclusive license piece software component piece software
Ideas useful thing software could user supposed patentable concrete implementation
actual software package implementing patent supposed patentable latter already covered copyright generally automatically
So software patent supposed cover middle area requirement concrete implementation
In country requirement claimed invention effect physical world may also part requirement software patent held since useful software effect physical world requirement may open debate
Meanwhile American copyright law applied various aspect writing software code
Software patent controversial software industry many people holding different view
One source controversy aforementioned split initial idea patent seem honored practice patent example patent AOP purported claim right programming tool implementing idea AOP howsoever implemented
Another source controversy effect innovation many distinguished expert company arguing software field software patent merely create vast additional litigation cost risk actually retard innovation
In case debate software patent outside United States argument made large American corporation patent lawyer likely primary beneficiary allowing continue allow software patent
Design implementation software varies depending complexity software
For instance design creation took much time designing developing latter much basic functionality
Software usually designed created aka IDE like simplify process software applicable
As noted different section software usually created top existing software API underlying software provides like JavaBeans
Libraries APIs categorized purpose
For instance used implementing library used designing graphical user interface GUI application like used designing
When program designed relies upon API
For instance user designing Microsoft Windows desktop application might use Windows Forms library design desktop application call APIs like close open application write additional operation need
Without APIs programmer need write APIs
Companies like provide APIs many application written using usually numerous APIs
useful creating software
Computer software special economic characteristic make design creation distribution different economic good

In specialized used describe structure behavior commonly circuit
A hardware description language enables precise description electronic circuit allows automated analysis electronic circuit
It also allows HDL description specification physical electronic component connected together produce used create
A hardware description language look much like textual description consisting expression statement control structure
One important difference programming language HDLs HDLs explicitly include notion time
HDLs form integral part EDA system especially complex circuit
Due exploding complexity digital electronic circuit since see circuit designer needed description performed high level without tied specific electronic technology
HDLs created implement abstraction model data flow timing circuit
There two major hardware description language
There different type description dataflow behavioral structural
Example dataflow hdl HDLs standard expression structure electronic system behaviour time
Like language HDL syntax semantics include explicit notation expressing
However contrast software HDLs also include explicit notion time primary attribute hardware
Languages whose characteristic express circuit connectivity hierarchy block properly classified language used electric design
HDL used express design structural behavioral architecture circuit functionality latter two case decides architecture logic gate layout
HDLs used write executable specification hardware
A program designed implement underlying semantics language statement simulate progress time provides hardware designer ability model piece hardware created physically
It executability give HDLs illusion precisely classified
Simulators capable supporting digital analog modeling exist HDLs targeted available
It certainly possible represent hardware semantics using traditional programming language operate semantics opposed although function program must augmented extensive unwieldy
Generally however software programming language include capability explicitly expressing time thus function hardware description language
Before introduction integration one way use hardware verification
System Verilog first major HDL offer object orientation garbage collection
Using proper subset hardware description language program called synthesizer infer hardware logic operation language statement produce equivalent netlist generic hardware primitive implement specified behaviour
Synthesizers generally ignore expression timing construct text
Digital logic synthesizer example generally use way time circuit ignoring timing construct
The ability synthesizable subset language make hardware description language
The first hardware description language appeared late looking like traditional language
The first lasting effect described Allen Newell text
This text introduced concept first used ISP language describe behavior DEC
The language became widespread introduction DEC Modules RTMs book describing use
At least two implementation basic ISP language ISPL ISPS followed
ISPS well suited describe relation input output design quickly adopted commercial team DEC well number research team USA among NATO ally
The RTM product never took commercially DEC stopped marketing new technique particular VLSI became popular
Separate work done produced language called KARL KAiserslautern Register Transfer Language included design calculus language feature supporting VLSI chip floorplanning structured hardware design
This work also basis KARL interactive graphic sister language ABL whose name A Block diagram Language
ABL implemented early Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni Torino Italy producing ABLED graphic VLSI design editor
In VLSI design framework implemented around KARL ABL international consortium funded Commission European Union
By late design using PLDs became popular although design primarily limited designing
The work used device design commercial need began grow language could map well
By introduced ABEL fill need
As design shifted VLSI first modern HDL introduced later acquired right HDL simulator would become de facto standard next decade
In request Department Defense led development Hardware Description Language
VHDL based well experience gained earlier development ISPS
Initially Verilog VHDL used document simulate circuit design already captured described another form file
HDL simulation enabled engineer work higher level abstraction simulation schematic level thus increased design capacity hundred transistor thousand
The introduction HDLs pushed HDLs background foreground digital design
Synthesis tool compiled HDL written constrained format called RTL manufacturable netlist description term
Writing synthesizable RTL file required practice discipline part designer compared traditional schematic layout synthesized RTL netlists almost always larger area slower performance
A circuit design skilled engineer using would almost always outperform equivalent productivity advantage held synthesis soon displaced digital schematic capture exactly area problematic RTL synthesis extremely asynchronous circuitry
Within year VHDL Verilog emerged dominant HDLs electronics industry older le capable HDLs gradually disappeared use
However VHDL Verilog share many limitation neither suitable analog simulation neither posse language construct describe logic structure
Specialized HDLs Confluence introduced explicit goal fixing specific limitation Verilog VHDL though none ever intended replace
Over year much effort invested improving HDLs
The latest iteration Verilog formally known IEEE SystemVerilog introduces many new feature class random variable address growing need better randomization design hierarchy reuse
A future revision VHDL also development expected match SystemVerilog improvement
As result efficiency gain realized using HDL majority modern digital circuit design revolves around
Most design begin set requirement architectural diagram
Control decision structure often prototyped application entered editor
The process writing HDL description highly dependent nature circuit designer preference coding style
The HDL merely language often beginning algorithmic description mathematical model
Designers often use scripting language automatically generate repetitive circuit structure HDL language
Special text editor offer feature automatic indentation coloration expansion declaration
The HDL code undergoes code review auditing
In preparation synthesis HDL description subject array automated checker
The checker report deviation standardized code guideline identify potential ambiguous code construct cause misinterpretation check common logical coding error floating output
This process aid resolving error code synthesized
In industry parlance HDL design generally end synthesis stage
Once synthesis tool mapped HDL description gate netlist netlist passed stage
Depending physical technology ASIC HDLs may may play significant role flow
In general design flow progress toward physically realizable form design database becomes progressively laden information stored generic HDL description
Finally integrated circuit manufactured programmed use
Essential HDL design ability simulate HDL program
Simulation allows HDL description design called model pas important milestone validates design intended function specification code implementation HDL description
It also permit architectural exploration
The engineer experiment design choice writing multiple variation base design comparing behavior simulation
Thus simulation critical successful HDL design
To simulate HDL model engineer writes simulation environment called
At minimum testbench contains instantiation model called device test DUT declaration model clock waveform
The testbench code event driven engineer writes HDL statement implement model interface transaction monitor DUT output
An HDL simulator program executes testbench maintains simulator clock master reference event testbench simulation
Events occur instant dictated testbench HDL coded testbench reaction model stimulus triggering event
Modern HDL simulator complete suite debug tool
These allow user stop restart simulation time insert simulator breakpoints independent HDL code monitor modify element HDL model hierarchy
Modern simulator also link HDL environment library defined interface
Linking HDL simulator user library compiled linked outside HDL environment
Design verification often portion design process due disconnect device designer interpretation specification imprecision HDL language
The majority initial cycle conducted HDL environment early stage design subject frequent major circuit change
An HDL description also prototyped tested hardware often used purpose
Hardware prototyping comparatively expensive HDL simulation offer view design
Prototyping best way check interfacing hardware device hardware prototype
Even running slow FPGAs offer much shorter simulation time pure HDL simulation
Historically design verification laborious repetitive loop writing running simulation design test
As chip design grown larger complex task design verification grown point dominates schedule design team
Looking way improve design productivity industry developed
In term property factual statement expected assumed behavior another object
Ideally given HDL description property property proven true false using formal mathematical method
In practical term many property proven occupy unbounded
However provided set operating assumption constraint property checker prove disprove certain property narrowing solution space
The assertion model circuit activity capture document designer intent HDL code
In simulation environment simulator evaluates specified assertion reporting location severity violation
In synthesis environment synthesis tool usually operates policy halting synthesis upon violation
verification still infancy expected become integral part HDL design toolset
A HDL grossly similar software major difference
Many programming language inherently limited syntactical semantic support handle
HDLs hand resemble language ability model multiple parallel process automatically execute independently one another
Any change process input automatically trigger update simulator process stack
Both programming language HDLs processed compiler usually called synthesizer HDL case different goal
For HDLs compiling refers logical synthesis process transforming HDL code listing physically realizable gate netlist
The netlist output take many form simulation netlist information handoff netlist generic EDIF subsequent conversion file
On hand software compiler convert listing object code execution target microprocessor
As HDLs programming language borrow concept feature boundary becoming le distinct
However pure HDLs unsuitable general purpose development undesirable modeling hardware
Yet electronic system grow increasingly complex become increasingly common growing desire industry single language perform task hardware design software programming
example hardware modeled architectural block modeled signal input output driver
The target application written C natively compiled system opposed targeting embedded CPU requires embedded CPU emulated CPU
The high level abstraction SystemC model well suited early architecture exploration architectural modification easily evaluated little concern implementation issue
However threading model used SystemC reliance shared memory mean handle parallel execution lower level model well
In level abstraction HDLs compared
There move raise abstraction level design order reduce complexity programming HDLs creating called
Companies Agility Design Solutions promoting way combine language concurrency model allow faster design cycle possible using traditional HDLs
Approaches based standard library extension allowing parallel programming found tool tool Impulse Accelerated Technologies
LabVIEW FPGA provide graphical approach design entry language SystemVHDL seek accomplish goal aimed making existing hardware engineer productive rather making FPGAs accessible existing
It also possible design hardware module using using HDL Coder tool Xilinx System Generator XSG formerly Accel DSP
The two widely used HDL variety used industry
Several project exist defining connectivity using language based method

Computer science also strong connection discipline

Thus computer scientist often become proficient subject
Finally computer science wide range specialty
These include computer architecture software system graphic artifical intelligence computational science software engineering
Drawing common core computer science knowledge specialty area focus particular challenge
Finally importantly computer scientist computer scientist fun

How much hardware understanding one need fully comprehend Operating System Computer Architecture course one take computer science student
Two thought First everything going parallel
one thing another
There oodles issue around caching memory architecture resource allocation etc
Many know metal better
Second number representation hardware
This old computer science still trip everyone
Not sure said prefect Mapping infinity numberrs onto finite number bit involves approximation
Understanding numerical analysis general save bacon time
Serialization etc
Besides fun
At level know better bare necessity boolean logic design computer architecture
Understand design register adder multiplexer flip flop etc
basic logic unit clock
You probably understand operating system starting basic understanding ASM memory mapped IO interrupt
EDIT I certain mean hardware consider logic design hardware
Or talking transistor
I suppose would hurt understand basic semiconductor architecture abstracted real hardware level
I would also say operating system abstracted architecture
At basic level know map onto computer
Above better
And OS garbage collected VM language heap stack instruction work executed know perform bad improve get best architecture
Computer science computer astronomy telescope
It help trying optimize hardware targeting
Take hard drive example help write software take advantage locality minimize seek time
If treat hard drive work stick file data place run severe fragmentation issue result lower performance
A lot taken consideration designing operating system since trying maximize performance
So short learning something help certainly ca hurt way
A good way determine baseline knowledge set hardware knowledge generally needed Comp Sci study visit curriculum website wide range prestigious university
For I check Comp Sci curriculum MIT Stanford University Illinois UIUC Georgia Tech etc
Then I get average understanding
Furthermore could also personally phone guidance counselor Universities either attending applying order get personalized view need
They would available guide based desire
Professors even

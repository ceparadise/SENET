Next These utility execute interactive command command vi
To execute interactive command use utility
For execute remote command remote host must running either RSH REXEC server program
The RSH server program called rshd UNIX host REXEC server program called rexecd UNIX host
Both RSH REXEC utility also require workstation remote host list respective HOSTS hostname database file
Your workstation access DNS name server file HOSTS directory remote host access either DNS name server host table
The host table UNIX
Although RSH require enter password require either following condition met Do enable file access authorization workstation secure authorization mechanism
Use mechanism
If access authorization serious issue use FTP transfer file operate remote host REXEC execute remote command
If set local username root server use file validate remote host
Instead us mechanism
The following table describes RSH option parameter
For example execute operating system command UNIX host finance VMS host SALES type following command You execute command using remote account specifying option
For example print file receivables account UNIX host finance entering following command workstation The following example show include RSH command DOS batch file
This file format DOS text file UNIX host print DOS printer
The remote UNIX host called remotehost
When run file specify input filename entering PAGEPR command following format Example show create batch file us RSH utility list file host redirect list content file To execute remote operating system command REXEC utility use RSH command following format Before REXEC executes command must enter password remote account
The following table describes REXEC option parameter
For example execute command UNIX host finance VMS host SALES REXEC type following command The REXEC utility prompt password executing command
You also execute command using account specifying option
For example could print file receivables account UNIX host finance typing following command REXEC prompt password account using
REXEC normally terminates remote command concludes
However abort command execution pressing either Ctrl C Ctrl Break
The RSH REXEC utility send remote command intact remote host except metacharacters include command
If include metacharacters RSH REXEC command line interpreted DOS
The RSH REXEC utility assume name specify right metacharacter specifies file workstation
You redirect local file input remote command typing one following command The REXEC command interprets first line password remote host requires order execute command
You redirect output remote command local file typing one following command You append output remote command local file typing one following command You redirect output one remote command input used another remote command typing one following command The remote host operating system use metacharacters differently DOS
If want remote host interpret metacharacters enclose redirected part command quotation mark
This cause host redirect input output
You redirect remote file provide input used remote command typing one following command You redirect output remote command remote file typing one following command You append output remote command remote file typing one following command If must include exclamation point
part metacharacter type two exclamation point
RSH REXEC interpret single exclamation point
You remote host redirect output one remote command input used another remote command typing one following command You execute UNIX date command remote host finance workstation redirect output file workstation RSH REXEC create overwrite file
REXEC wait type password use remote host executes date command
You execute UNIX date command remote host finance remote host redirect output datefile file remote host
You execute UNIX cat command remote file earnings remote host finance pipe output cat command UNIX grep command redirect output grep command remote file You execute UNIX date command remote host finance append output datefile remote file

A command specific instruction given computer application perform kind task function
In Windows command usually entered via like
Commands must always entered command line interpreter exactly
Entering command incorrectly wrong misspelling etc
could cause command fail worse could execute wrong command right command wrong way creating serious problem
There many different kind command many phrase use word probably actually command
Yes kind confusing
Below popular kind command might encounter Command Prompt command true command
By true command I mean program intended run command line interface case Windows Command Prompt whose action result also produced command line interface
See complete list command detail ever want check without explanation command
DOS command correctly called command might considered purest Microsoft based command since graphical interface command life completely command line world
Do confuse DOS command Command Prompt command
Command Prompt may appear similar true operating system Command Prompt program run within Windows operating system
Both share many command certainly
See interested command available latest version Microsoft DOS
A run command simply name given executable particular program
A run command command strictest sense like shortcut
In fact shortcut live Start Menu Start Screen usually nothing icon representation executable program basically run command picture
For example run command Paint painting drawing program Windows run Run box Search box even Command Prompt Paint obviously command line program
Some example bit confusing
The run command Remote Desktop Connection example run command command line switch make opening program specific parameter easy
However Remote Desktop Connection program designed really command
See article list program executables
Another command see referenced really command Control Panel applet command
A Control Panel applet command really run command control parameter instructing Windows open specific
For example executing open Date Time applet Control Panel directly
Yes execute command Command Prompt Control Panel command line program
See complete list command
Recovery Console command also true command
Recovery Console command available within Recovery Console command line interpreter available troubleshooting problem Windows XP Windows
I also keep detail example command
There error
Please try

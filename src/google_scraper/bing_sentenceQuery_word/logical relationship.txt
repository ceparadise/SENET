cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet
This layer called
used reasoning

Logical equivalence type relationship two statement sentence propositional logic algebra
The relation translates verbally symbolized double arrow pointing left right
If A B represent statement A B mean A B
The statement A B exactly A B B A asterisk represents logical operation arrow represents logical implication
Logical equivalence work way
Thus A B B A Logical equivalence important design digital circuit
Several circuit may logically equivalent identical The goal engineer find circuit performs desired logical function using least possible number gate
This result optimal operating efficiency reliability speed

Want read Slashdot mobile device
Point keep reading
I also took lot physic math doubt help degree philosophy I feel study various logical abstraction helped widen perspective
Not mention trained diagram set also quite useful
My diagram consistent grammer I sure I trained create legend map directly real concept
arrow mean something used truly identical relationship
Of course arrow might mean different thing different diagram within given diagram consistency
I sure Philosophy program rigerous logic one thing thing philosopher agreement
Except undergraduate philosophy little problem solving
From I seen analyzing argument finding solution
Logical dissection useful skill especially testing debugging
The problem wit From Philosophy lot logical people would assume first glance
You presupposing teleological explanation preview button
I look existential perspective preview button simply u find meaning
I could read post massive wall text hurt eye I guessing mention English class taking
Holy shit
You went entire little diatribe without using single p
That kind record Longest post somebody stupid break post paragraph
For fuck sake man
If want people read write learn use paragraph
I currently undergraduate Muhlenberg College notably unhappy program
What appeared friendly small liberal art college I applied year half ago far rather disappointing
As matter background I note w But lot interesting hang
I think basic study philosophy would probably widen people perspective life generally worthwhile experience
Also study different type logic numerical system useful professionally could considered branch philosophy though probably commonly found mathematics curriculum experience anyway
However interesting may right I never found Hegelian dialectic basic epistemology really helped build distributed data model network traffic prediction algorithm
On hand I working say AI research I see working knowledge epistemology might useful YMMV
I sure I agree say right economics useful thing study
I majored CS got minor econ math I use econ stuff much CS stuff
I know minoring entirely worthwhile going intermediate microeconomics intermediate macroeconomics possibly smartest thing I college
Some philosophy teacher surely turn course
I imagine GT EVERYTHING subjugated engineering need could one first already
You could make one required elective
Of course real philosophy person rain parade telling u already class offering different name change name pandering
Now hell people
Abandon hope ye enter Please God make stop
We also one zero know make perform calculation u
Calculating seems start true intelligence making connection thinking Aha
I figured
Look intelligent I
It necessarily follow complex calculator going Take look kind discourse design pattern pattern language
Pure philosophy
Also I say computer science people totally different take Descarte problem
As problem
And I think bunch thing CS change outlook
After class might encounter considerably interesting philosophy interesting controversial
The big one philosophy Freedom advocated folk RMS The tragedy nearly half century computer science much involving relational system RDBMS one real Considering average student get nearly half question wrong impressive feat
Let know get right I admit equal
grin You leave politics alone wo leave alone
That necessary
Because Turing machine hard program
Or fast big memory hard build
I ca really understand answer want
And I agree may person I sure kook
The problem post like take long sort kook making invalid point people reasonable person making detailed valid point something I time care moment people
I guess upshot This century ago physic commonly called natural philosophy
In English If say say clearly
If ca say shut
Lo
Men become tool tool
Henry David Thoreau

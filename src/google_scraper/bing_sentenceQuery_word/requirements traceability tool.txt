Traceability general term defined IEEE Systems Software Engineering Vocabulary degree relationship established two product development process especially product relationship one another identification documentation derivation path upward allocation flowdown path downward work product work product hierarchy degree element software development product establishes reason existing discernable association among two logical entity requirement system element verification task
Requirements traceability particular defined ability describe follow life requirement forward backwards direction origin development specification subsequent deployment use period ongoing refinement iteration phase
In requirement engineering field traceability understanding requirement objective goal aim aspiration expectation need transformed requirement
It therefore primarily concerned satisfaction relationship layer information aka artefact
However traceability may document relationship many kind development artefact requirement specification statement design test model developed component
For example common practice capture verification relationship demonstrate requirement verified certain test artefact
Traceability especially relevant developing system therefore prescribed
A common requirement guideline critical requirement must verified verification must demonstrated traceability

Requirements come different source like business person ordering product marketing manager actual user
These people different requirement product
Using requirement traceability implemented feature traced back person group wanted
This used development process prioritize requirement determining valuable requirement specific user
It also used deployment user study show feature used see required first place

Not requirement traced also requirement relationship artefact associated model analysis result test case test procedure test result documentation kind
Even people user group associated requirement traceable
Requirements realized design artefact implementation finally verified
Artefacts tied latter stage traced back requirement well
This typically done via requirement
Establishing traceability beyond requirement design implementation verification artefact become difficult
When implementing software requirement instance requirement may tool design artefact may tool
In case including little project requirement may included MS Word PDF document managed tool like
Furthermore implementation artefact likely form source file link established various way various scope
Verification artefact generated internal test formal verification tool Repository tool stack integration present significant challenge maintaining traceability dynamic system
The usage traceability especially tracing beyond requirement artefact located tool chain bring several benefit A complete overview development activity supported traceability relevance given
Extensive study document effectiveness also difficulty capturing traceability information One goal traceability visualize relationship artefact
As number complexity trace link increase technique traceability visualization necessary
A visualization include information artefact
artefact type metadata attribute link
link typ metadata link strength
Common visualization traceability information
Visualizations combined overcome specific limitation
Traceability realized capturing trace either entirely manual tool supported
spreadsheet
Though widely applied process cumbersome often lead traceability information insufficient quality due various involved development tool typically high number artefact traced
traceability requires development information distributed across whole chain development tool homogenized aggregated
The following approach exist reaching state tool chain cover whole system manage artefact development process holistic approach
Issue tracker implementing requirement template used successfully distributed environment
The advantage approach homogenization artefact allows manage analyze easily dedicated tool tool
The disadvantage necessary implement whole tool chain
If introduced difficult replace specific tool tool chain
RM tool allow storing organizing managing requirement system specification typically arrange link requirement parent requirement higher specification
Commercial RM tool traceability support Cradle CASE Spec
Freely available tool
Typical analysis function based recorded traceability information completeness check
system level requirement go equipment level without modification assessment requirement deviation level qualification status presentation
In order ensure traceability artefact type beyond requirement RM tool often allow import artefact surrogate requirement traced tool requirement tracing method
For example element model imported surrogate module related requirement
The disadvantage approach different adapter converter different artefact type necessary need consistent version data format
In contrast ALM tool consistency must carried oneself

Software production activity also known software development process improving due demand quality increase product
The demand quality cost decrease added introduction new technology naturally force process improvement
Those fact new occurs several production area employ different technique increase development process
In particular software research area involved process improvement Software Engineering Bauer IEEE IEEE
The first model ever employed software development process proposed work segmentation waterfall model
It able allow structured overview software development structure foundation stone propose new process new necessity required
There development model prototyping incremental evolutionary spiral
It interesting observe common point model start Requirements Engineering
Generally speaking Requirements Engineering process identify stakeholder need documenting way make analysis communication subsequent implementation feasible time leading product quality reliability Nuseibeh Easterbrook
The fact Requirements Engineering first activity within software production process better explored analyzing following statement Antoniou et
Nuseibeh Easterbrook
The first statement refers definition purpose inherent characteristic initial activity project research methodology Basili et Solingen Berghout
The second refers meet intended purpose
If software development basis come solution given problem fundamental importance knowledge exact dimension problem solved
Requirements initially discovered project understand basic condition next phase
Thus one get idea importance respect requirement Requirements Engineering occurs initial phase within development process
Requirements engineering activity divided five category Elicitation Analysis Negotiation Documentation Validation Management
These definition alternate among different author Jarke Pohl Sawyer et Graham Kotonya Sommerville Sommerville concept similar Individuals organization involved affected system influence requirement
They could manager supplier customer
The process identification analysis documentation management requirement useful implementation consistent need stakeholder provide software product quality
The main resource used maintain represent traceability relationship
A link establishes explicit relationship two artifact
Technical managerial procedure aid evaluation improvement software development process
The ability define trace requirement artifact throughout development process follow trace direction
A set element describing something built purpose subject particular form analysis
A parallel process support requirement engineering activity identification change management requirement traceability throughout development process

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
So I taking sample scope management test online Question stumped traceability matrix
Can someone please explain b better c
Below direct question quoted A It describes WBS Dictionary entry traced work package work package decomposed deliverable B used make sure Project Management Plan created C It help understand source requirement requirement verified later deliverable D used trace source every change keep track entire Control Scope process verify change properly implemented Here explanation right answer The Requirements Traceability Matrix tool use trace requirement back specific business case forward rest scope deliverable like specific WBS work package well part project product design like specific level Cows Gone Wild test strategy like test plan Ranch Hand Games tester use make sure game work
I sure I understand
Can someone explain greater detail
I probably would picked C well see trying get selected answer
I agree I see point
It academic answer probably aligns something PMBOK mean either great question great answer
Most test especially prep test often contain ambiguous question answer wrong perspective
This necessarily deliberate practice hone skill often select question pool allowed precisely mirror test question often protected NDAs copyright
Even actual test often question iffy selected answer reflect academic rather practical bent part test creator
This pervasive problem test writer academic rather practitioner good test normed response
As singular example I sat CISSP many year ago I remember particularly horrible question virus security
The question something along line What best way prevent introduction virus onto computer system
The use system option security practitioner would select I knew test expected certify medium correct answer particular test
Unless understood test written academic focus abstruse government practice bound get answer wrong
Unless fail actual exam I would lose sleep question like
Depending exam also strategy consider
Finally remember sample test sample rarely drawn actual test material
They really help confidence level material
Sometimes knowing sample test contains invalid question iffy answer good way measure domain knowledge anything else
By mean find question merit additional study part
However sometimes important know answer one employer would pay perform regardless answer key sample test say
Maybe C discus subset B
Answer C indicates two item source requirement link final deliverable
Answer B mention indicate argumentation also includes link design testplan
Since C actually cover everything might able link requirement complete answer And therefore answer
My cent Brian I tell better I tell wrong
The reason correct due little
It help understand source requirement requirement verified later deliverable would describe process
The Requirements Traceability
As function trace back verified
I think great answer explanation even worse
Hope help
The answer B becuase need think PMBOK would say
First thing need understand input output Program Management Plan Chapter PMBOK
The PM plan much encompassing answer C Traceability Matrix would
Take plus requirement consideration
I teach PMP session PMP exam course
It turn HR one item I teach
I sure B right answer I tell A C D
Option A talk decomposition WBS nothing traceability matrix
Option C D read line talk requirement verified later deliverable verify change properly implemented
Now traceability matrix NOT focus verification implementation requirement change
It simply help u track change respect various parameter
Hence A C D clearly discarded correct answer B
Although I personally appreciate B best answer question
By posting answer agree

A document usually form table used assist determining completeness relationship correlating two using relationship comparison
It often used often consist marketing requirement detailed product matching part detailed design
A requirement traceability matrix may used check current project requirement met help creation various deliverable document project plan task
Common usage take identifier item one document place left column
The identifier document placed across top row
When item left column related item across top mark placed intersecting cell
The number relationship added row column
This value indicates mapping two item
Zero value indicate relationship exists
It must determined relationship must made
Large value imply relationship complex simplified
To ease creation traceability matrix advisable add relationship source document backward traceability forward traceability
That way item changed one easy see need changed

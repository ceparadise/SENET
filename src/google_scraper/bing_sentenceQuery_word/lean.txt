This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Being completely self taught programmer I would like I could better computer science course taught typical CS grad
Finding different resource internet easy course Coursera course Stanford university
There numerous open resource scattered around Internet good book repeatedly recommended
I learning lot study heavily fragmented really bug
I would love If somewhere I could find path I follow stack I limit I sure part computer science I studied systematically approach I
The problem Wikipedia tell essential insists complete reference
Computer science Electrical Engg
huge list course also telling course essential optional per person
I found mention order one study different subject
What I would love create list I follow like dummy one As clearly see I little idea specific subject computer science consists
It would hugely helpful even someone pointed essential course MIT Course ware essential subject present MIT OCW recommended order study
I list Posts I already went I get I looking top answer say worth studying cse point MIT OCW Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
I seen course material MIT
They teaching material required bunch implicit global variable passing colour Blue instead ARGB let alone float sort thing
I would trust curriculum code come university
My CS degree university top UK CS consisted First year Second year Third year As notice pretty much everything basic something almost nothing covered useful depth
The stuff actually worth essential The stuff worth optionally Stuff essential I cover anyway The rest complete waste time
Unfortunately nine point I either already knew picked useful part elsewhere
If read thing like rapidly becomes apparent actually need know much top fortunate since degree many material I seen online degree really teach much
Open Course ware list course made available
If want know student would taken swing MIT non OCW website look actual program
They list required considered prereq
Try Computer Science curriculum recommendation linked along CS update
Page report handy chart underline core knowledge still list elective
An undergraduate program would time cover even course considered core recommendation lump category together let student pick amongst eg Operating Systems Programming Languages Software Engineering get lumped Software student pick track
You find required coursework CS department website pretty much school version
If I may I like suggest joining learning process
Then search around code real world application interested clone work code get know eventually start submit patch back source project line working open source project vested interest
And course get familiar git better
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

Thanks TC Team Only computer science major woman
funnel problem balance gender tech Sheryl Sandberg starting
Potential current woman computer science engineering join chapter connect advising support
We believe come together support woman field change number change stereotype change Lean In CS E Chapter partnership Facebook Linkedin Anita Borg Institute apply momentum Sandberg book turn female empowerment discussion action
University Of Tennessee Lean In Circle founder Denise Gosnell tell I glad see discussion moved towards develop effective strategy see woman computer science
There plenty awareness problem point
A year sexism incident lopsided diversity report made crystal clear woman underrepresented technology
And getting worse
In woman made CS major compared today
The cause identified
Women get enough encouragement mentorship young age stick hard science discipline like coding
And bro culture misogyny permeates tech company drive woman away make far
Even Sandberg Facebook suffers engineering culture
Just company global tech worker female
Sandberg book Lean In teach woman assertive work home view bossiness virtue flaw ask responsibility compensation hard work merit
She launched Lean In Circles program give woman mentorship ally across industry
Since Circles formed country college campus Sandberg say
But denying economy rapidly shifting towards technology without computer programming skill left behind
If woman get engineering education support tech job income gap men widen
For professional matter personal one well
Growing dad would always tell I could anything I set mind
I tell thing two young daughter
I like grow world word ring true So Lean In CS E Chapter target tech gender problem directly hope spurring real action result
First want woman form CS E Circles thing get tough road engineering degree job someone call
Then role tech get guidance navigating issue like sexual harassment misogeny wage disparity attaining leadership position
Gosnell say woman join CS E Circle immediately get group people reach
Once get initial hump asking someone I think discussion situation happened
How handle
Did work
Sandberg say Circles encourage woman speak enroll class afraid take apply job even sure They provide mentorship
At University Tennessee Circle woman engineer supporting also raising fund send woman technical conference around US Sandberg note
The plan eradicate inequality could equip woman resource handle dismantle time
If tech going diversity perspective sheer volume talent necessary keep growing need woman feel welcome writing code
Latest headline delivered daily

Freelance Writer Think thing every day posting status update downloading song checking class schedule online Do think would cool design technology make device work better
To invent new one
To help make people life job easier
Then maybe right path
But first let set thing straight
Computer scientist people call printer stop working
And sit dark cubicle day without talking anyone
Whatever think computer science wrong say Dianna Xu Chair Computer Science Department Bryn Mawr Pennsylvania
So
Computer scientist use technology solve problem
They write software make computer new thing accomplish task efficiently
They create application mobile device develop website program software
And find everywhere big tech firm government agency startup nonprofit
It everyday computing say Liz Burd Chancellor Learning Teaching University Newcastle Australia
It building tool enable everyday One biggest thing computer science major learn logically think problem find way solve
Chris Stephenson Executive Director Computer Science Teachers Association add good computer scientist also understand teamwork good communicator
They work people time say including come CS background
No matter brilliant point explain someone product work code Stephenson say
Bobby Schnabel Dean School Informatics Computing chair Association Computing Machinery Education Policy Committee say student go computer science like working computer
Others want solve problem technology
Whatever passion CS degree great foundation kind job
Anokwa nine year old first programmed computer
It father used teaching journalism Indianapolis Anokwa allowed touch anyway entering online competition win faster modem
In high school started business repairing computer classmate parent
In college earned two degree one computer science Butler one electrical engineering
There Anokwa began think people could use computing change world better
After computer everywhere desk pocket inside device use every day
Software powerful say
During graduate school Anokwa spent six month volunteering public health organization Rwanda helped introduce electronic medical record system used nationwide
That experience inspired Anokwa develop Open Data Kit platform replaces paper form smart phone tablet computer
Its tool used world
Election observer use monitor poll Egypt health worker Kenya use track effort combat HIV Brazilians use measure illegal logging rainforest
Anokwa partner eventually started company called Nafundi consults client using tool like Open Data Kit
These day I lot programming Anokwa say
Those skill head
All skill I need I learned first couple year Brown meant study philosophy enrolled Lexington Virginia
But also liked tinkering computer
He took class logic class computer programming
It might seem like two subject anything common Brown liked relied logical thinking
It seems like straightforward correlation say
The summer graduating computer science degree went back hometown Memphis Tennessee got job lifeguarding country club
Through someone met found next job helped company find new employee department
Outside work joined informal group programmer
That met founder website called MyRepresentatives
The site make easy people live Memphis area find represents local state federal government
Brown started working site lead developer
It unpaid valuable position
He working MyRepresentatives month landed paid job Lindsey Software company design program public housing agency work today
The computer programming class Lynch took high school one favorite
I liked knowing logic understanding thing work say
How work solve problem She majored computer science Colchester Vermont learned little bit everything computing programming language mathematical principle behind technology managing website attack problem system
The biggest thing degree gave perfect foundation build career Lynch say
In experience general degree
A technical degree general Now technical analyst Esri software company us sophisticated mapping technology called geographic information system GIS
Lynch even know GIS joined Esri imagine working industry
Among thing company software used map damage Hurricane Sandy left East Coast illustrate federal government sent money different project
Lynch design application company use Esri software
In job help customer work colleague develop test application
She like different thing every day
Every month something change I get cutting edge happening field say
Umali might playing day since company Turbine develops world popular online game sometimes need play make sure everything work correctly
Turbine make game like Dungeons Dragons The Lord Rings
Umali work behind scene keep game running smoothly making sure user sign want play list top player date
It energetic dynamic environment say
Umali graduated computer science degree Troy New York
Since several job software industry managing data people access need
Technology changed lot since college Umali say computer science major taught timeless skill like examine process information
They taught u principle break problem manageable piece say
Then prepared learn innovation field like new programming language
Overall Umali say studying computer science lead cool job wide range industry

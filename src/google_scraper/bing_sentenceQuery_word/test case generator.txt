In special used control behaviour
In fact generator
A generator similar function return array generator parameter called generates sequence value
However instead building array containing value returning generator yield value one time requires le memory allows caller get started processing first value immediately
In short generator function
Generators implemented term expressive construct
Generators also known semicoroutines special case weaker coroutines always yield control back caller passing value back rather specifying coroutine jump see
Generators usually inside loop
The first time generator invocation reached loop iterator created encapsulates state generator routine beginning argument bound corresponding
The generator body executed context iterator special action encountered time value provided action used value invocation expression
The next time generator invocation reached subsequent iteration execution generator body resumed action yet another action encountered
In addition action execution generator body also terminated action time innermost loop enclosing generator invocation terminated
In complicated situation generator may used manually outside loop create iterator used various way
Because generator compute yielded value demand useful representing sequence would expensive impossible compute
These include
infinite sequence live data stream
When eager evaluation desirable primarily sequence finite otherwise evaluation never terminate one either convert use parallel construction creates list instead generator
For example Python generator evaluated list via F evaluates lazily generator sequence evaluates eagerly list
In presence generator loop construct language reduced single loop end loop construct usual loop construct comfortably simulated using suitable generator right way
For example ranged loop like implemented iteration generator Python
Further implemented sending generator using loop
Generators first appeared prominent feature string manipulation language available later version ECMAScript language
In CLU C generator called Ruby
The final standard natively provide generator yet various library implementation exist documented
A yield statement used implement iterators data abstraction
Every expression including loop generator
The language many generator even implement logic semantics using generator mechanism OR done way
Printing square achieved using writing However time custom generator implemented suspend keyword function exactly like yield keyword CLU
As Icon every expression generator
The infinite generator prime serve example It possible introduce generator using macro
The resulting code might aspect different native
generator syntax uncluttered
A good example found
The set macro defined source allow generator defined syntax following example This iterated using Moreover allows applied class provides function
It possible write class defining iterable method iterator method class
For example possible write following program A basic range implementation would look like Perl natively provide generator support provided module us framework
Example usage In generator mechanism founded named
In model everything generator every datum created data constructor generated demand
For example list constructor operator used parenthesization
This us standard adaptor function value agreeable predicate stop requesting new value soon one encountered
The shared storage access used universal mediator Haskell
List comprehension freely used provides several related facility generator
First form work kind producer sequence also value Some sequence implemented imperatively private state variable implemented possibly infinite lazy list
Also new struct definition property specifies used sequence
But directly Racket come generator library traditional generator specification
For example Note Racket core implement powerful continuation feature providing general continuation composable also delimited continuation
Using generator library implemented Racket
The community PHP implemented generator PHP
Details found original
Ruby support generator starting version form Enumerator class
Java standard interface implementing iterators since early day since Java foreach construction make easy loop object provide interface
The collection framework typically provide iterators collection
However generator built language
This mean creating iterators often much trickier language generator especially generation logic complex
Because state must saved restored every time item yielded iterator possible store state local variable use looping routine generator available instead must manually simulated using object field hold local state loop counter
Even simple iterators built way tend significantly bulkier using generator lot
The original example could written An infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written int Iterator Also infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written using Stream interface Or get Iterator BaseStream Stream interface
An example C generator available since C version Both example utilise Generics required
It possible use multiple statement applied sequence iteration In iterators basis loop provides generator via since version
These define sequence lazily evaluated sequential access via list eagerly evaluated sequential access via array eagerly evaluated indexed access via contain code generates value
For example form sequence square number filtering number range number
Generators added version
An example generator In Python generator thought contains frozen
Whenever iterator method called Python resume frozen frame executes normally next statement reached
The generator frame frozen yielded value returned caller
PEP implemented Python add expression allowing generator delegate part operation another generator
Python syntax modeled called generator expression aid creation generator
The following extends example using generator expression compute square countfrom generator function
Harmony feature generator function
An infinite Fibonacci sequence written using function generator The iterators package used purpose

I looking tool framework either generate test case aid software testing
So far I found following Java MuClipse Java MuJava Java JTest Java Commercial Java QuickCheck Randoop UnitCheck Java Java Pathfinder Java UDITA Java Korat Java Java Java Reported working Agitar Java Comercial ensures line coverage ReAssert Java Repairing Unit test Daikon Invariant Detector Jaca Java Pex These tool apply mostly Java also looking language
Can anyone propose tool This question appears
The user voted close gave specific reason Dotnet Testdatagenerator We used tool successfully minimize amount testcases still reasonable confident case covered
reasoning behind testing simplest bug program generally triggered single input parameter
The next simplest category bug consists dependent interaction pair parameter caught Bugs involving interaction three parameter progressively le whilst time progressively expensive find exhaustive testing limit exhaustive testing possible input

A set test input execution condition expected result developed particular objective exercise particular program path verify compliance specific requirement
A test case could simply question ask program
The point running test gain information example whether program pas fail test
Test case cornerstone developed verify quality behavior product
In order fully test requirement application met must least two test case requirement one positive test one negative test
If requirement must least two test case
Keeping track link requirement test frequently done using
Written test case include description functionality tested preparation required ensure test conducted
A formal written characterized known input expected output worked test executed
The known input test expected output test
For application system without formal requirement test case written based accepted normal operation program similar class
In school testing test case written activity result reported test run
In hypothetical story used help tester think complex problem system
These scenario usually written detail
They simple diagram testing environment could description written prose
The ideal scenario test story motivating credible complex easy evaluate
They usually different test case test case single step scenario cover number step key
A test case usually single step occasionally sequence step test correct feature application
An expected result expected outcome usually given
Additional information may included Larger test case may also contain prerequisite state step description
A written test case also contain place actual result
These step stored word processor document spreadsheet database common repository
In database system may also able see past test result generated result system configuration used generate result
These past result would usually stored separate table
often also contain Besides description functionality tested preparation required ensure test conducted time consuming part test case creating test modifying system change
Under special circumstance could need run test produce result team expert would evaluate result considered pas
This happens often new product performance number determination
The first test taken base line subsequent test product release cycle
use variation written test case commonly performed group client system ensure developed system meet requirement specified contract
User acceptance test differentiated inclusion positive test case almost complete exclusion negative test case

This difficult question I know I thought I throw floor see anyone interesting suggestion
I developed take python interface code generated via SWIG generates code needed expose WebServices
When I developed code I using TDD I found test brittle hell
Because test essentially wanted verify given bit input code happens header I get given bit outputted code I wrote small engine read test definition XML input file generates test case expectation
The problem I dread going modify code
That fact unit test complex b brittle
So I trying think alternative approach problem strike I perhaps tackling wrong way
Maybe I need focus outcome IE code I generate actually run I want rather code look way I want
Has anyone got experience something similar would care share
I started writing summary experience code generator went back question found already touched upon issue focus execution result instead code
Problem hard test generated code might suited actually run environment unit test system encode expected result
I found need break code generator smaller piece unit test
Unit testing full code generator like integration testing unit testing ask
Recall unit testing one kind testing
You able unit test piece code generator
What really looking system level testing
regression testing
It semantics different mindset approach expectation etc
It certainly work probably need bite bullet set regression test suite fixed file SWIG interface python module known output
You really want check known input fixed code expected output come final Python program
Checking code generator result directly would like diffing object file
Yes result ONLY thing matter
The real chore writing framework allows generated code run independently spend time
If running might consider dumping unittest framework favor bash script makefile
window might consider building shell run generator us code another process unittest
A third option would generate code build app includes nothing unittest
Again would need shell script whatnot run input
As encode expected behavior occurs could done much way would code using generated interface rather one
Just wanted point still achieve testing verifying result test individual chunk code nesting inside setup verification code Provided generated code assembled smaller chunk chunk change frequently exercise condition test little better hopefully avoid test break change specific one chunk
Unit testing testing specific unit
So writing specification class A ideal class A real concrete version class B Ok I noticed afterwards tag question includes Python principle Because System A injects interface system B C unit test system A without real functionality executed system
This unit testing
Here clever manner approaching System creation completion different When specification piece behaviour So conclusion single unit specification multiple behaviour specification grows develop unit system system test depends concrete system within watch
My recommendation would figure set known result simpler case already place
It entirely possible change generator exact string produced may slightly different really care whether interpreted way
Thus test result would test code feature find succeeds way want
Basically really want know whether generator produce expect without physically testing every possible combination also impossible
By ensuring generator consistent way expect feel better generator succeed situation
In way also build suite regression test unit test need keep working correctly
This help make sure change generator breaking form code
When encounter bug unit test catch may want include prevent similar breakage
I find need test generating generate
In case program generates many type code C HTML SCSS JS etc
compile web application
The best way I found reduce regression bug overall test web application testing generator
Do get wrong still unit test checking generator code biggest bang buck UI test generated app
Since generating also generate nice abstraction JS use programatically test app
We followed idea outlined The great part really test system code generation actually generating
Once test fails easy track back generator broke
It pretty sweet
Good luck

A test case document set test data precondition expected result postconditions developed particular test scenario order verify compliance specific requirement
Test Case act starting point test execution applying set input value application definitive outcome leaf system end point also known execution postcondition
Test Case ID Test Scenario Test Case Description Test Steps Prerequisite Test Data Expected Result Test Parameters Actual Result Environment Information Comments Let u say need check input field accept maximum character
While developing test case scenario test case documented following way
In example first case pas scenario second case FAIL
If expected result match actual result log defect
The defect go defect life cycle tester address fix

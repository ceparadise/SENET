It actually considered relative measure considered individual value
The factor calculated based specific time period
Hence obvious impact factor actually calculated published
To calculate impact factor first consider number proceeding article published period
That Impact factor Number time published article previous year cited journal year The total number article published last year It used classify journal according quality impact
If journal cited often popular influential journal considered authoritative particular field
Using author impact factor understand scientific value given author researcher
The actual impact productivity author defined term value
The Journal Citation Reports JCR considered reliable measure field
It published Thomson Reuters journal thoroughly examined check quality influence respective area
It outline relationship journal cited well citing journal leading journal evaluated effectively

In parameter describes oscillator characterizes resonator relative centre frequency
Higher indicates lower rate energy loss relative stored energy resonator oscillation die slowly
A pendulum suspended bearing oscillating air high pendulum immersed oil low one
Resonators high quality factor low ring vibrate longer
Q factor parameter describes behavior underdamped resonator
driven higher factor greater amplitude resonant frequency smaller range frequency around frequency resonate range frequency oscillator resonates called bandwidth
Thus radio receiver would difficult tune would would better job filtering signal station lie nearby spectrum
oscillator oscillate smaller range frequency stable
See
The quality factor oscillator varies substantially system system depending construction
Systems damping important damper keeping door slamming shut near
Clocks laser resonating system need either strong resonance high frequency stability high quality factor
Tuning fork quality factor around
The quality factor cavity used accelerator reach high higher
There many alternative quantity used physicist engineer describe damped oscillator
Important example include bandwidth measured
The concept originated Johnson Engineering Department evaluating quality coil inductor
His choice symbol time letter alphabet taken
The term intended abbreviation quality quality factor although term grown associated
In context resonator two common definition necessarily equivalent
They become approximately equivalent becomes larger meaning resonator becomes le damped
One definition ratio resonator resonant frequency Δ FWHM
bandwidth power vibration greater half power resonant frequency resonant frequency Δ angular bandwidth
The common equivalent definition ratio energy stored oscillating resonator energy dissipated per cycle damping process The factor make expressible simpler term involving coefficient differential equation describing resonant system electrical mechanical
In electrical system stored energy sum energy stored lossless lost energy sum energy dissipated per cycle
In mechanical system stored energy maximum possible stored energy total energy
sum energy point time lost energy work done external per cycle maintain amplitude
More generally context reactive component specification especially inductor definition used stored energy power loss measured
This definition consistent usage describing circuit single reactive element capacitor inductor shown equal ratio

The factor determines behavior simple oscillator
For mathematical detail system behavior see
In system dominant response often system
The system set quality factor system phase margin decrease approximate system made oscillatory higher quality factor
Physically speaking time ratio total energy stored divided energy lost single cycle equivalently ratio stored energy energy dissipated one radian oscillation
It dimensionless parameter compare decay physical system oscillation
Equivalently compare frequency system oscillates rate dissipates energy
Equivalently large value factor approximately number oscillation required freely oscillating system energy fall original energy
This mean amplitude fall approximately original amplitude
The width bandwidth resonance given Δ width range frequency energy least half peak value
The resonant frequency often expressed natural unit radian per second rather using The factor related expressed The envelope oscillation decay proportional expressed The energy oscillation power dissipation decay twice fast square amplitude
For lowpass filter filter For system system underdamped two complex pole
That attenuation parameter represents rate oscillation output system
A higher quality factor implies lower attenuation rate system oscillate many cycle
For example bell approximately long time struck hammer
For electrically resonant system factor represents effect electromechanical resonator mechanical
The bandwidth relative resonant frequency Hz
For example antenna tuned value centre frequency kHz would dB bandwidth kHz
In audio bandwidth often expressed term
Then relationship bandwidth bandwidth octave
In ideal series TRF factor tuned circuit respectively
The larger series resistance lower circuit
For parallel circuit factor inverse series case Consider circuit parallel
The lower parallel resistance effect damping circuit thus lower
This useful filter design determine bandwidth
In parallel circuit main loss resistance inductor series inductance series circuit
This common circumstance resonator limiting resistance inductor improve narrow bandwidth desired result
The individual reactive component depends frequency evaluated typically resonant frequency circuit used
The inductor series loss resistance resonant circuit using inductor including series loss perfect capacitor
The capacitor series loss resistance resonant circuit using capacitor perfect inductor In general resonator involving series combination capacitor inductor determined value component whether loss come series resistance otherwise For single damped system factor represents effect simplified damping damping force drag force proportional velocity
The formula Q factor mass spring constant damping coefficient defined equation velocity
The musical instrument critical excessively high amplify multiple frequency instrument produce evenly
For reason string instrument often curvy soundbox complex shape amplify range frequency fairly evenly
The need high enough pick one frequency buzzing lip reed
A made flexible plastic therefore low brass instrument giving muddy breathy tone
Instruments made stiffer plastic brass wood
An excessively high make harder hit note
instrument may vary across frequency may desirable
high Q designed picking single frequency
In factor given resonant frequency stored energy cavity power dissipated
The optical equal ratio resonant frequency bandwidth cavity resonance
The average lifetime resonant cavity proportional cavity
If factor cavity abruptly changed low value high one laser emit light much intense laser normal continuous output

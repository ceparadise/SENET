Historically spreadsheet accounting ledger page show various quantitative information useful managing business
Electronic spreadsheet replaced version end century
Spreadsheets limited financial data however frequently used represent scientific data carry computation
The first spreadsheet program written Apple II computer
In view many user application vividly showed utility small case turning bookkeeping chore minute data entry
For example simple spreadsheet might hold payroll information column employee name address number hourly pay hour worked tax deduction net pay
Cells last column could formula attached compute pay cell three preceding column employee
The spreadsheet would show net pay upon request formula
If rate changed net pay cell would recomputed
Spreadsheets also invaluable computation
Once set formula generated data spreadsheet cell function cell one experiment changing one price part observe effect cost product
With appropriate forecasting formula market product hence total profit expect old new price projected
Used way spreadsheet serve need manager economist anyone work relationship type quantitative information
Since spreadsheet programmed also used general computation
They used modeling science engineering well suited educational example display synthesis sound simple audio waveform
Furthermore since grid cell readily programmed system cell whose state depends state neighbour

A interactive organization analysis storage form
Spreadsheets developed computerized simulation paper accounting
The program operates data entered cell table
Each cell may contain either numeric text data result automatically calculate display value based content cell
A spreadsheet may also refer one electronic document
Spreadsheet user adjust stored value observe effect calculated value
This make spreadsheet useful analysis since many case rapidly investigated without manual recalculation
Modern spreadsheet software multiple interacting sheet display data either text numeral graphical form
Besides performing basic modern spreadsheet provide function common operation
Such calculation applied tabular data function formula
Spreadsheet program also provide conditional expression function convert text number function operate text
Spreadsheets replaced system throughout business world
Although first developed accounting task used extensively context tabular list built sorted shared
LANPAR available first electronic spreadsheet mainframe time sharing computer
LANPAR acronym LANguage Programming Arrays Random
first electronic spreadsheet microcomputer helped turn popular widely used system
leading spreadsheet dominant operating system
largest market share platform
A spreadsheet program standard feature since advent office suite also exist web app form
relatively new category
A spreadsheet consists table arranged row column referred X Y location
X location column normally represented letter A B C row normally represented number etc
A single cell referred addressing row column instance
This electronic concept cell reference first introduced LANPAR Language Programming Arrays Random Rene Pardo Remy Landau variant used VisiCalc known notation
Additionally spreadsheet concept group cell normally contiguous
For instance one refer first ten cell first column range
LANPAR innovated forward order calculation Lotus Microsoft MultiPlan Version
In modern spreadsheet application several spreadsheet often known simply gathered together form
A workbook physically represented file containing data book sheet cell sheet
Worksheets normally represented tab flip page one containing one sheet although change model significantly
Cells book add sheet name reference instance Sheet
Some system extend syntax allow cell reference different workbook
Users interact sheet primarily cell
A given cell hold data simply entering formula normally created preceding text equal sign
Data might include string text number date
A formula would begin equal sign would normally invisible display show calculation case formula
This may lead confusion case
The key feature spreadsheet ability formula refer content cell may turn result formula
To make formula one simply replaces number cell reference
For instance formula would produce result multiplying value cell number
If hold value result
But might also hold formula referring cell
The ability chain formula together give spreadsheet power
Many problem broken series individual mathematical step assigned individual formula cell
Some formula apply range well like function add number within range
Spreadsheets share many principle trait spreadsheet database thing
A spreadsheet essentially one table whereas database collection many table semantic relationship
While true workbook contains three sheet indeed file containing multiple table interact lack database
Spreadsheets database database become table within database query exported spreadsheet analysis
A spreadsheet program one main component usually also contains management system
Programs within suite use similar command similar function
Usually sharing data component easier collection functionally equivalent program
This particularly advantage time many personal computer system used display command instead
The word spreadsheet came spread sense newspaper magazine item text graphic cover two facing page extending across center fold treating two page one large one
The compound word came mean format used present column category expenditure across top invoice listed left margin amount payment cell row column traditionally spread across facing page bound ledger book keeping accounting record oversized sheet paper termed analysis paper ruled row column format approximately twice wide ordinary paper
A spreadsheet indistinguishable batch compiler added input data producing output report conventional batch computer program
However concept electronic spreadsheet outlined paper Budgeting Models System Simulation
The subsequent work Mattessich Chpt
companion volume Mattessich applied computerized spreadsheet accounting budgeting system programmed
These batch Spreadsheets dealt primarily addition subtraction entire column row input variable rather individual
In concept spreadsheet called BCL Business Computer Language implemented Brian Walsh
This program written
Primitive available machine
In BCL ported Walsh timesharing machine
It used assist teaching business student
Students able take information prepared manipulate represent show ratio etc
In book entitled written Kimball Stoffells Walsh book program copyrighted year later copyright renewed Applied Data Resources FORTRAN preprocessor called Empires
In late Xerox used BCL develop sophisticated version timesharing system
A key invention development electronic spreadsheet made Rene Pardo Remy Landau filed spreadsheet automatic natural order calculation
While patent initially rejected patent office purely mathematical invention following year appeal Pardo Landau landmark court case Predecessor Court Federal Circuit CCPA overturning Patent Office establishing something cease become patentable merely point novelty algorithm
However ruled patent unenforceable
The actual software called LANguage Programming Arrays Random
This conceived entirely developed summer following Pardo Landau recent graduation Harvard University
Rene Pardo recall felt one manager Bell Canada depend programmer program modify budgeting form thought letting user type form order electronic computer calculate result right order Forward Order Calculation
Pardo Landau developed implemented software
LANPAR used Bell Canada AT T operating telephone company nationwide local national budgeting operation
LANPAR also used General Motors
Its uniqueness Pardo incorporating forward order calculation one first computer language opposed top bottom sequence calculating result cell used VisiCalc first version Multiplan
Without forward order calculation user manually recalculate spreadsheet many time necessary value cell stopped changing
Forward order calculation compiler cornerstone functionality required spreadsheet practical successful
The LANPAR system implemented Honeywell online timesharing system enabling user program remotely via computer terminal modem
Data could entered dynamically either paper tape specific file access line even external data base
Sophisticated mathematical expression including logical comparison statement could used cell cell could presented order
In three former employee computer company headquartered set start
Leroy Ellison Harry Cantrell Russell Edwards found large number calculation making table business plan presenting venture capitalist
They decided save lot effort wrote computer program produced table
This program originally conceived simple utility personal use would turn first software product offered company would become known
AutoPlan ran GE service afterward version ran introduced name
offered similar product CSSTAB moderate timesharing user base early
A major application opinion research tabulation
spreadsheet program simple scripting language spreadsheet
The user defined name label row column formula defined row column
In advertised extending original maximum The IBM Financial Planning Control System developed Canada
It implemented IBM least country
It ran among first application planning developed completely hid programming language
Through IBM among first program copy new version released
Users could specify simple mathematical relationship row column
Compared contemporary alternative could support large spreadsheet
It loaded actual drawn legacy batch system user spreadsheet monthly basis
It designed optimize power APL increasing program efficiency much fold traditional programming approach
An example early industrial weight spreadsheet APLDOT developed IBM running The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Laurel MD
The application used successfully many year developing application financial costing model US Congress
APLDOT dubbed spreadsheet financial analyst strategic planner used solve problem addressed paper spreadsheet pad
Because implementation spreadsheet concept became widely known late early
VisiCalc first spreadsheet combined essential feature modern spreadsheet application except forward order recalculation interactive user interface automatic recalculation status formula line range copying relative absolute reference formula building selecting referenced cell
Unaware LANPAR time magazine called VisiCalc first electronic spreadsheet
Bricklin spoken watching university professor create table calculation result
When professor found error tediously erase rewrite number sequential entry table triggering Bricklin think could replicate process computer using blackboard model view result underlying formula
His idea became VisiCalc first turned hobby computer enthusiast business tool
VisiCalc went become first application compelling people would buy particular computer use
VisiCalc small part responsible success
The program later number early computer notably machine various platform
Nevertheless VisiCalc remains best known Apple II program
SuperCalc spreadsheet application published Sorcim originally bundled along WordStar part software package included Osborne portable computer
It quickly became de facto standard spreadsheet ported
The acceptance following introduction August began slowly program available translation computer model
Things changed dramatically introduction November release sale January
Since written especially IBM PC good performance became killer app PC
Lotus drove sale PC due improvement speed graphic compared VisiCalc Apple II
Lotus along competitor soon displaced VisiCalc
Lotus released January started outselling year number year leading spreadsheet
released first version Macintosh September ported Windows first version numbered synchronize Macintosh version released November
The Windows platform early made possible Excel take market share Lotus
By time Lotus responded usable Windows product Microsoft begun assemble suite
By Excel market leader edging Lotus IBM discontinued altogether
With advent advanced technology circa new generation emerged
Equipped user experience best web based online spreadsheet many feature seen desktop spreadsheet application
Some also strong collaboration feature offer update remote source currency
spreadsheet program part Free Software Desktop Project
closely related using license free spreadsheet
Notable current spreadsheet software Discontinued spreadsheet software A number company attempted break spreadsheet market program based different paradigm
Lotus introduced likely successful example saw commercial success notably financial world powerful capability remain well respected day
attempted dramatically simplify formula construction generally successful
The main concept grid called sheet either raw data called value formula cell
Formulas say mechanically compute new value existing value
Values generally number also pure text date month etc
Extensions concept include logical spreadsheet
Various tool programming sheet visualizing data remotely connecting sheet displaying cell dependency etc
commonly provided
A thought box holding
A single cell usually referenced column row would represent cell containing value example table
Usually row representing referenced starting column representing use using letter numeral
Its physical size usually tailored content dragging height width box intersection entire column row dragging
An array cell called
It analogous array conventional although certain unchanging value entered could considered analogy
In implementation many worksheet may located within single spreadsheet
A worksheet simply subset spreadsheet divided sake clarity
Functionally spreadsheet operates whole cell operate within spreadsheet variable access except containing cell
A cell may contain may simply left empty
By convention formula usually begin sign
A value entered computer keyboard directly typing cell
Alternatively value based formula see might perform calculation display current date time retrieve external data stock quote database value
Computer scientist used term summarize spreadsheet operation cell value relies solely formula user typed cell
The formula may rely value cell cell likewise restricted data formula
There effect calculating formula output display calculated result inside occupying cell
There natural mechanism permanently modifying content cell unless user manually modifies cell content
In context programming language yield limited form
A standard spreadsheet since optional feature eliminates need manually request spreadsheet program recalculate value nowadays typically default option unless specifically large spreadsheet usually improve performance
Some earlier spreadsheet required manual request recalculate since recalculation large complex spreadsheet often reduced data entry speed
Many modern spreadsheet still retain option
Recalculation generally requires spreadsheet
A graph vertex object updated edge connecting two object whenever one need updated earlier
Dependency graph without circular dependency form representation partial ordering case across spreadsheet relied upon give definite result
This feature refers updating cell content periodically value external cell remote spreadsheet
For shared spreadsheet applies immediately updating cell another user updated
All dependent cell must updated also
Once entered selected cell entire spreadsheet optionally locked prevent accidental overwriting
Typically would apply cell containing formula might applicable cell containing constant conversion factor eight decimal place
Even though individual cell marked locked spreadsheet data protected feature activated file preference
A cell range optionally defined specify value displayed
The default display format usually set initial content specifically previously set example Dec would default cell format
Similarly adding sign numeric value would tag cell cell format
The cell content changed format displayed value
Some cell format numeric also specify number
This allow invalid operation multiplication cell containing date resulting illogical result without appropriate warning
Depending capability spreadsheet application cell like counterpart style separately formatted using either content point size color bold italic cell border thickness background shading color
To aid readability spreadsheet cell formatting may conditionally applied data example negative number may displayed red
A cell formatting typically affect content depending cell referenced copied worksheet application formatting may carried content
In implementation cell group cell column row named enabling user refer cell name rather grid reference
Names must unique within spreadsheet using multiple sheet spreadsheet file identically named cell range sheet used distinguished adding sheet name
One reason usage creating running macro repeat command across many sheet
Another reason formula named variable readily checked algebra intended implement resemble Fortran expression
Use named variable named function also make spreadsheet structure transparent
In place named cell alternative approach use cell grid reference
Most cell reference indicate another cell spreadsheet cell reference also refer cell different sheet within spreadsheet depending implementation cell another spreadsheet entirely value remote application
A typical style consists one two letter identify column column followed row number range
Either part relative change formula moved copied absolute indicated front part concerned cell reference
The alternative reference style consists letter R row number letter C column number relative row column number indicated enclosing number square bracket
Most current spreadsheet use style providing style compatibility option
When computer calculates formula one cell update displayed value cell cell reference cell naming cell cause computer fetch value named cell
A cell sheet usually addressed A cell different sheet spreadsheet usually addressed Some spreadsheet implementation allow cell reference another spreadsheet current open active file computer local network
It may also refer cell another open active spreadsheet computer network defined shareable
These reference contain complete filename In spreadsheet reference cell automatically update new row column inserted deleted
Care must taken however adding row immediately set column total ensure total reflect additional row often
A occurs formula one cell indirectly chain cell another cell refers back first cell
Many common error cause circular reference
However valid technique use circular reference
These technique many spreadsheet recalculation usually converge correct value cell
Likewise instead using named range cell range reference used
Reference range cell typically form specifies cell range
A formula would add cell specified put result cell containing formula
In earliest spreadsheet cell simple grid
Over time model expanded include third dimension case series named grid called sheet
The advanced example allow inversion rotation operation slice project data set various way
A formula identifies needed place result cell contained within
A cell containing formula therefore two display component formula resulting value
The formula normally shown cell selected clicking mouse particular cell otherwise contains result calculation
A formula assigns value cell range cell typically format consists When cell contains formula often contains reference cell
Such cell reference type variable
Its value value referenced cell derivation
If cell turn reference cell value depends value
References relative absolute mixed absolute absolute
The available option valid formula depends particular spreadsheet implementation general arithmetic operation quite complex nested conditional operation performed today commercial spreadsheet
Modern implementation also offer function access function remote data application
A formula may contain condition nested condition without actual sometimes used purely identify
In example assumed sum column percentage tested validity explicit message put adjacent cell
Further example The best way build conditional statement step step composing followed trial error testing refining code
A spreadsheet fact contain formula case could considered merely collection data arranged row column like calendar timetable simple list
Because ease use formatting capability many spreadsheet used solely purpose
Spreadsheets usually contain number supplied arithmetic operation example summation average forth trigonometric function statistical function forth
In addition often provision
In Microsoft Excel function defined using supplied Visual Basic editor function automatically accessible worksheet
In addition program written pull information worksheet perform calculation report result back worksheet
In figure name function introduced using editor supplied Excel
display spreadsheet definition named variable
Functions write worksheet simply return evaluation
However Microsoft Excel write value text found within subroutine directly spreadsheet
The figure show Visual Basic code subroutine read member named column variable calculates square writes value corresponding element named column variable
The column contains formula value calculated subroutine spreadsheet simply written
Whenever reference made cell group cell located within current physical spreadsheet file considered accessing remote spreadsheet
The content referenced cell may accessed either first reference manual update recently case web based spreadsheet near real time value specified automatic refresh interval
Many spreadsheet application permit generated specified group cell dynamically cell content change
The generated graphic component either embedded within current sheet added separate object
In late early first appeared
Unlike model conventional spreadsheet utilized model built object called variable data cell report
These spreadsheet enabled viewing data various way including simultaneous multiple synchronized view
For example user Javelin could move connection variable diagram seeing logical root branch variable
This example perhaps primary contribution earlier concept traceability user logic model structure twelve view
A complex model dissected understood others role creation
In program variable object collection cell happen appear row column
Variables could many attribute including complete awareness connection variable data reference text image note
Calculations performed object opposed range cell adding two time series automatically aligns calendar time time frame
Data independent therefore data could destroyed deleting row column entire worksheet
For instance January cost subtracted January revenue regardless whether either appears worksheet
This permit action later used except flexible manipulation report table one many capability supported variable
Moreover cost entered week revenue month program could allocate interpolate appropriate
This object design enabled variable whole model reference variable name perform multidimensional analysis massive easily editable consolidation
Trapeze spreadsheet Mac went explicitly supported table column also matrix operator
Spreadsheets formula language based upon expression rather expression known
Such spreadsheet used reason cell value
Just early programming language designed generate spreadsheet printout programming technique evolved process table also known spreadsheet data efficiently computer
Spreadsheets popular tool
EUD denotes activity technique people professional developer create automated behavior complex data object without significant knowledge programming language
Many people find easier perform calculation spreadsheet writing equivalent sequential program
This due several trait spreadsheet
A designed perform general computation task using spatial relationship rather time primary organizing principle
It often convenient think spreadsheet mathematical spreadsheet cell edge reference cell specified formula
This often called dependency graph spreadsheet
References cell take advantage spatial concept relative position absolute position well named location make spreadsheet formula easier understand manage
Spreadsheets usually attempt automatically update cell cell depend change
The earliest spreadsheet used simple tactic like evaluating cell particular order modern spreadsheet calculate following minimal recomputation order dependency graph
Later spreadsheet also include limited ability propagate value reverse altering source value particular answer reached certain cell
Since spreadsheet cell formula generally invertible though technique somewhat limited value
Many concept common sequential programming model analogue spreadsheet world
For example sequential model usually represented table cell similar formula normally differing cell reference
Spreadsheets evolved use programming language like tool extensibility beyond spreadsheet language make easy
While spreadsheet represented major step forward quantitative modeling deficiency
Their shortcoming include perceived unfriendliness cell address
Other problem associated spreadsheet include While tool desktop spreadsheet application address shortcoming awareness use generally low
A good example professional know spreadsheet audited invest solution Spreadsheet risk risk associated deriving materially incorrect value spreadsheet application utilised making related usually decision
Examples include valuation determination calculation medicinal dos size beam structural engineering
The may arise inputting erroneous fraudulent data value mistake incorrect change within logic spreadsheet omission relevant update date
Some error exceeded US billion
Because spreadsheet risk principally linked action inaction individual defined
In report lack control spreadsheet used critical financial function cited factor trading loss six billion dollar reported result gone bad
Despite research carried ClusterSeven revealed around half senior manager firm reporting annual revenue said either usage control poorly applied manual process use spreadsheet firm
In graduate student economics found major coding flaw spreadsheet used economist influential journal article
The Reinhart Rogoff article widely used justification drive European austerity program

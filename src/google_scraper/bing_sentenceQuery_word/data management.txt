Your gift make difference

In computer science anything form suitable use computer
Data often distinguished program
A program set instruction detail task computer perform
In sense data thus everything program code
A collection information organized easily accessed managed updated
In one view database classified according type content bibliographic numeric image
In computing database sometimes classified according organizational approach
The prevalent approach relational database tabular database data defined reorganized accessed number different way
A distributed database one dispersed replicated among different point network
An programming database one congruent data defined object class subclass
As one oldest component associated computer computer software program designed mean managing database currently installed system hard drive network
Different type database management system exist designed oversight proper control database configured specific purpose
Here example various incarnation DBMS technology currently use basic element part DBMS software application
In database management system DBMS data file file store database information whereas file index file data dictionary store administrative information known metadata
system achieve organized store large number dynamical associated data facilitate accessing computer hardware software data computer system database technology

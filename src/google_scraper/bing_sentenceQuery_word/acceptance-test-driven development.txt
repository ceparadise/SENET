Test Driven Development TDD amalgam two programming technique Development TFD Refactoring
Looking first TFD literally mean write functional code whatever programming language happen favor first write small piece code test outcome result functional code yet exist
It might sound bizarre testing something yet exist exactly point want test fail
Don worry become clear end tutorial
So might want use TDD
Well firstly need get different mindset
Consider Object thinking David West good developer learn concentrate problem space leap instinctively solution Take example Problem extract UK postal area code given full UK postcode
Example Input output SS input output B Instinctively probably already declaring string variable head
But better approach analyzing problem identify object responsibility result discipline help produce solution
There obviously Postcode object required responsibility output postal area
Objects equal class responsibility method solution involve postcode class postalArea method
So test contain something like assuming c All need unit testing framework put test
So actually
Let u look example using SharpDevelop Nunit integrate nicely
At basic Nunit DLL assembly referenced project
OK open SharpDevelop click Solution button start page
Select Class Library template name Postcode
Click A new solution project created class file
Set namespace necessary usually company personal name subgrouping applicable Rename class
Expand project solution explorer left hand side rename class file
Right click reference solution explorer choose Add Reference
Scroll entry list reference GAC tab
This assuming downloaded nunit msi installer URL installed
Right click project solution explorer choose Item dialogue box appears choose Test name Right click project solution explorer choose Item dialogue box appears choose Test name get new file solution explorer rename namespace necessary
Note TestFixture Test attribute see Started documentation release Nunit attribute explained
Now ready demonstrate test first development
With expectation class able return part UK postcode represents Postal Area case add code test class exercise real class manner
In file add following line code How know write
Easy problem
Look back problem statement earlier article two postcode two corresponding postal area
They sample data need couple string array hold common method hold small amount data memory
There two postcode problem multiple instance postcode object required
Therefore might well array
To test possibility problem need iterate set loop
In instantiate instance class postcode example call postalArea method
The Assert class AreEqual method provided Nunit framework added reference project TestFixture Test attribute
So go ahead press select Build Solution build menu
You get two build error
Good test fails want first time around
If two error check typed syntax correctly
The first build error tell overload method Postcode need constructor string parameter accept postcode see solution emerging
The second compiler error tell postalArea method exist need create
So switch amend code look like Bear mind following anecdote amount thing choose find memorable better still remember
Ok time time project build
Now time run unit test
Fire Nunit GUI shortcut added program menu installed Nunit
From File menu choose open browse dll file SharpDevelop built
Once loaded click Run button
A sea red meet eye home time yet
But look informative error see length output expected
Not tell difference index put little ASCII hat symbol showing index
What need pas test
Easy need private string member variable hold postcode passed constructor logic postalArea method extract postal area
Amend follows Build solution file menu Nunit GUI choose
It still fails
A common mistake parameter substring method index see easy common developer error picked without unit test long might looking line code build
Right easy replace thus And build reload run see getting iterative
Still fails
On second postcode substring enough still simple need cope fact UK postcode single character identify
Amend code follows A sea green
Excellent job done deploy go home sleep soundly knowing support call come
Oh get support call
Curses
What postcode customer using
Tsk Postal Service obviously heard KISS either
Anyway problem first thing next morning open project add expected area W West London test
Your logic error exposed implementation still little simple side need take different approach
Rather length postcode need look second character test number letter
Add following private method Postcode class Now amend statement postalArea method like Build Reload Run
The test pas
So TDD may initially seem like hard work really save time frustration line
This tutorial scratched surface come advantage developing application way
So recommendation reading useful link Kent Beck Cynthia Andres Extreme Programming Explained Embrace Change Second Edition ISBN David West Object Thinking Microsoft Press ISBN Fixed formatting Interesting informative post

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

The pure Taylorism saw end October Black Thursday Wall Street Stock Market crashed yet time violence Henin
Years later Michael Porter popularized idea value chain focused maximizing value creation minimizing cost Porter end exactly goal Taylor
As example Ford Motor Company applied methodology able implement production called Factory since demanded almost inexistent warehouse stock
Now wrong Taylorism value chain
Nothing
The problem model rather Ford others applied
Among problem Ford failed create value chain starting customer ending supplier culminating super production crisis
Japan understood chain issue back met astonishing growth known Japanese Miracle
As example middle past century Toyota Motor Company implemented new methodology building car also smaller economic lot size important targeted flexible factory capable shifting production matter day
More recently success example Zara able create flexible production parameterized demand collected daily basis
As odd might seem usually marketing discipline market value chain basic pillar
Only view competitive advantage sustained
Even odder constantly assisting dummy first dictatorship
For instance take example third generation mobile communication
As soon first communication operator introduced service others followed investing heavily infrastructure
However still market demand Hearts
Bottom line company need flexible provide customer product meet ever changing need
Unfortunately mankind deal well flexibility started accentuating evolution year ago got sedentary thus stable Neolithic
The process information system developed recurring package solution sold product
Used required information system specific product applicable information system need flexible cope change fuzzy requirement
Denotes potential impact attribute value future event may cause
In finance represents variability return given investment may
In context chapter risk reflected among variable uncertainty requirement custom enterprise application may need fulfill future
A measure variation given asset may price given time period
In context chapter volatility percentage needed change extension custom enterprise application may need compared initial state
The APV extends basic NPV account related investment impact capital structure
Is usually calculated adding basic NPV investment related investment NPV
Is contract give holder right obligation buy sell underlying asset certain price certain date
An opportunity becomes available particular investment made
The opportunity exercised thus leading impact investment value
The ability adapt expected unexpected change environment
In context chapter flexibility quantifiable amount change introduced custom enterprise application given time period measured complexity
Is present value investment future usually calculated difference present monetary value cost benefit investment

This program accredited
Students interested entering Honours program consult advisor department concerned registering second year
Of credit unit required
Honours degree least credit unit must senior level
Application admission Honours considered successful completion least credit unit Cumulative Weighted Average least overall least subject Honours
For detail please see section
There two version program
Students choose Major one discipline combine Major another
The prerequisite structure course Majors Requirement program assumes credit unit Mathematics Statistics credit unit required
Students wishing combine program another double honour program need least additional credit unit Mathematics Statistics recommended
Students wishing combine program Double Honours Major Type C program requires additional Mathematics Statistics beyond stated able meet prerequisite course program
However student specialization minimal mathematics requirement may able meet prerequisite course without taking additional Mathematics Statistics
For student recommended course
The prerequisite structure course Majors Requirement program assume credit unit Mathematics Statistics
The recommended course
This degree program ideally suited degree another field
It provides comprehensive training Computer Science Minor
However program include enough training Computer Science meet requirement accreditation therefore sufficient preparation many career high tech industry
A Minor Computer Science obtained taking credit unit Computer Science course conjunction major different subject interdisciplinary program
A good choice want show taken significant amount Computer Science outside chosen major

used attribute various type
In field system design refers design adapt external change occur
Flexibility defined differently many field engineering architecture biology economics etc
In context engineering design one define flexibility ability system respond potential internal external change affecting value delivery timely manner
Thus flexibility engineering system ease system respond manner sustain increase value delivery
Uncertainty key element definition flexibility
Uncertainty create opportunity system existence uncertainty flexibility becomes valuable
Flexibility especially thoroughly studied system
For manufacturing science eleven different class flexibility identified Browne Sethi Sethi These definition yield current condition system major setup conducted investment made except
Many flexibility type linked increasing one flexibility type also increase another

It also refers mobility muscle allows movement around joint
distance direction joint move ability move without restriction
There several benefit flexibility training
It increase range motion
Flexibility training help improve range motion joint muscle
Next decrease risk injury
When muscle flexible le likely become injured physical activity
It also reduces muscle soreness
Flexibility training help reduce muscle soreness
Stretching exercise keep muscle loose relaxed
Lastly improves athletic performance
When joint muscle flexible use le energy motion improves overall performance
Flexibility often overlooked conditioning program important fitness aerobics strength training
One way improve flexibility incorporate stretching fitness routine
Stretching workout help ward stiffness keep limber
Here thing remember stretching Another way improve flexibility perform specific exercise designed help better mobility

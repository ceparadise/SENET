I asked work portlets portal
I want know difference portlet servlet
How portlet differ may functionally servlet
Portlets part standard regulates portal container component
This different standard standard web container servlets
Though definitely strong parallel two standard differ container APIs life cycle configuration deployment etc
The main difference portlet servlet could servlet always responds single type action portlet due nature life cycle stronger container binding respond two type action
There course I found core difference two I studied portal development
Servlets Portlets web based component use Java implementation
Portlets managed portlet container like servlet managed servlet container
Both static dynamic content generated Portlets Servlets
The life cycle portlets servlets controlled container The model used servlets portlets The packaging deployment essentially
Application Session exists Servlet Portlet container
It one way sharing data crude Communication render phase action phase lower phase portlet container
Servlets render complete web page whereas portlets render html fragment
These fragment aggregated portal complete web page
The content type JSR portlets cHTML XHTML WML
It support content type
Portlets allowed generate HTML code contains tag body frame frameset head html title
A Portlet unlike servlet URL attached accessed directly
Access portal page hold portlet
Portlets provided control manipulate window state portlet mode
Multiple instance single portlet placed onto page
Portlets support persistent configuration customization profile information
Portlets two type request viz
render request action request
Portlets two scope within session application scope communication across portlets portlet scope intra portlet communication
Portlet set character set encoding response set HTTP response header
Portlets access request URL
So access query parameter appended URL
Portlets set cooky
Typical method Portlet API servlet
Deployment Portlets involves Servlet application
Some Providers support portlets without need restart server possible case servlets without modularizing application using special library OSGi
A Portlet container built Servlet container
So ultimately said portlet run Servlet Container
But developing apps view portlet container separately EE container
Both portlets servlets receive http request return response usally HTML rendered browser
A portlet used context Portal idea single page seen user lot part think tile coming different portlet
Now get tiled effect normal servets See Struts Tiles example extra bit portlets portlets richer environment provided Portal extra APIs provided displayed portlet configured individual user preference porlets communicate press button one something happens another
Servlets java definition application handle HTTP request portlets user interface component performing specific function similar window vista widget lot component used stackoverflow
They need necessarily backed servlets server side
But Portlet standard developed alongside java
nice
Essentially Servlets provide content normally take whole page browser unless using frame portlets provide content wrapped window
With portlets multiple portlets side side one another one provide content functionality different
A portlet provide complete interaction one type application another portlet provide content another type application
The portal provide house keeping functionality secured single point entry portlets page
As particular please continue reading
Here similarity Servlets portlets web based component utilize Java implementation Portlets managed portlet container similar servlet container Both component generate content static dynamic By posting answer agree

The root web application context XML file associated portlet application
The web application context XML file portlet contains bean whereas root web application context XML file contains bean accessible portlets portlet application
A bean defined root web application context XML overridden application context XML file ing bean bean ID
It written Portles In Action
It said use bean defined portlet application root web application context XML file
Any example
I defined test bean Portlet A Sping Framework
The Code applicationContext I get testA Portlet A It success
When I create Portlet B The empty
So I ca get testA Portlet I want know config root application context liferay By posting answer agree

Java EE tutorial Radouane Roufid take time understand basic Liferay file especially following These file automatically generated use eclipse Liferay Plugin located folder
Where file located
Let detail file
Table content The first important file define standard configuration
In file portlet name portlet class handle invocation
Bellow basic configuration Properties definition After Portlet definition come Portlet registration
The done file tell Liferay Portal use Portlet defined
Many property definable file Css Js file required Portlet whether portlet appear multiple time page trigger job scheduling much
A complete listing file setting DTD definition folder Liferay Portal source code
The default content Understand default property The aim file organize deployed portlets category window
The default content id portlet property must match defined file
Without definition portlets organized category
Liferay Portlet category Radouane Roufid If want hide deployed portlet window declare category file
A system portlet property system set true appear category even well configured
This file plugin packaging
It cover set property allowing set information plugin specify required jar plugin specify context dependency one
Below example content Properties definition In file create hook
What hook
A hook tool allowing
By creating hook ability override native Liferay function example performing custom action portal startup user login overwriting extending portal JSPs replacing portal service custom implementation updating strut action servlet filter servlet filter mapping
You see portal property overridden via hook In basic portlet project created hook override default Language property file setting Since use JSF Liferay portlet file generated
It deployment descriptor describes resource configuration application web server us serve web request
Bellow short explanation property Instantiate FacesServlet startup application
File generated used JSF multiple purpose
used set navigation rule declare bean want use annotation register validators

Either way corporate portal winning mind share boardroom promise frontend enterprisewide integration
For corporate portal promise fulfilled application component based Sun Microsystems Java Platform Enterprise Edition Web application model
These portal deliver business content user browser
To date vendor constructed APIs framework portlet development
At time Java Specification Request JSR strives produce common specification would enable portlet interoperability corporate portal application different vendor
You review detail JSR Java Community Process JCP Website see
The specification public release planned April
Until best source Java developer gain initial experience portlet development portal vendor proprietary APIs
German software vendor SAP offer excellent place start
The SAP offering includes comprehensive development deployment runtime fit computer
All necessary software free download either open source project directly SAP
In addition ready availability startup SAP also produced robust API development framework dynamic portlets SAP call iViews
The content portlet include anything simple Webpage personalized view complex data multiple system
Portals usually pretend offer true backend integration without support complete enterprise application integration EAI suite instead enable integrated backend information user
In article example I build portal component iView query remote database render result within SAP proprietary framework
Even though simplified version solution example still relatively complex
While extremely basic HelloWorld stock ticker example might provide simpler start ultimately fail utilize full range functionality offered vendor APIs
The example iView pictured Figure display list JIT electronic data interchange EDI call automotive industry
The download bundle see accompanies article includes source code JIT iView well additional resource support development process
I used open source MySQL database server store data example work Java Database Connectivity JDBC database driver
The name database I created contains single table
While article describe process install set example database download bundle includes SQL flat file dummy data import MySQL
Access MySQL database system requires authentication user ID password I created user password
I also assigned password default user eliminate anonymous login
These configuration detail summarized sidebar
The complete DOS output table including full authentication user depicted Figure
You probably worked traditional JDBC example covered Sun see
The standard construct access database passing user ID password clear text SQL method Instead explicitly passing user ID password though JIT iView employ SAP portal service user management enables authenticated user portal access remote data source via single SSO
By mean concept called user portal map user ID password backend system
When portal user access back end mapped credential sent authentication without prompting additional login information
In example I map default user portal user MySQL database system
To prepare portal environment SSO access remote system must complete following three activity SAP provides Portal Development Kit PDK separate offline development deployment platform Java iViews
The PDK development environment based Java SDK deployment environment implemented Web component inside Apache Tomcat servlet container
A set custom APIs provides development framework portal component global service enable additional functionality including access remote data source user management easy data rendering portal
Java developer immediate access full SAP Enterprise Portal EP implementation also use PDK deploy test iViews
SAP also offer wizard Borland JBuilder open source Eclipse platform
The wizard work integrate fully featured IDE PDK platform
SAP however plan discontinue support JBuilder portal next release
For simple portal component project I prefer use Apache Ant build tool portlet application archive
After initial registration PDK freely available SAP iViewStudio Webpage see
PDK installation inside Tomcat described SAP Installation Administration Guide
When start Tomcat iView Runtime Java IRJ deploys Java Web component ultimately serf PDK platform
After deployment default start page PDK http log default user ID password
To facilitate testing PDK style page navigation structure mirror productive SAP EP
Figure depicts PDK dancing Welcome page
As part download bundle I created custom JavaWorld tab PDK
Install tab copying folder JW Tools content directory structure
When refresh PDK browser new tab navigation bar
I introduce tab component first use next section
Once PDK installed configured custom JavaWorld tab must register MySQL backend system portal
Information different data source portal landscape maintained file located folder
By default XML file contains many standard SAP entry must add new system tag MySQL
All required entry JIT iView example included file part download bundle
The parameter freely definable must include attribute exactly example
The attribute value register system portal user management service enable user mapping After changing default file must upload modified file portal server persistent layer Portal Content Directory PCD
Move JW Tools tab PDK entry page display System Landscape Cockpit
The Landscape Upload Status report uploaded shown Figure
Click Upload Portal button open PCD Upload tool right side cockpit
Browse modified file upload Figure
The resulting message read Upload successful File uploaded PCD location
Refresh Landscape Upload Status compare PCD persistence layer IRJ shown Figure
If PCD IRJ synchronized click Refresh Landscape Service button
The Landscape Upload Status report uploaded Figure report discrepancy
As described user mapping enables authenticated portal user access remote data source via single
To assign mapping move UserMappingAdmin page JW Tools tab shown Figure
First change list Users search default portal user named wp
As result modification landscape file remote system MySQL visible via list Data Source Settings section
Make sure data source selected click Edit link alongside wp user
Now enter user ID password MySQL system
For user ID password gcoe
Finally save entry
You receive message Logon data saved green check appear left wp user table
Once portal user mapped MySQL user look application architecture portal component JIT iView
For basic portlet portal component project consists three general type file Usually Web resource JavaServer Pages JSP technology used display portlets JIT example us special portal service SAP automates rendering process
JavaBeans component also function helper file pas data within portlet session
More robust complex portal component integrate full gamut technology many customer currently working iViews incorporate Enterprise JavaBeans EJB component particular
The portal component overall structure best viewed project file structure level Figure
The download bundle includes development project folder called MySqlProject contains Java source file example
I describe project file section
Since I use Ant instead JBuilder Eclipse I must manually maintain required project build file separate folder called AntProject
The Ant tool serf compile Java source build application archive file based instruction set file
The resulting application archive portal archive PAR file deployed IRJ expose component portal
The project relies two additional file also saved AntProject folder At runtime iView triggered controlled parameter portal component profile property file
These file saved project folder
A profile named required contains property apply every portal component archive multiple portal component delivered single PAR
The default profile example requires single parameter IDG Communications Inc

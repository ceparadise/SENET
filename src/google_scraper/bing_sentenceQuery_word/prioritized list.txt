In like regular data structure additionally element priority associated
In priority queue element high priority served element low priority
If two element priority served according order queue
While priority queue often implemented conceptually distinct heap
A priority queue abstract concept like list implemented priority queue implemented heap variety method unordered array
A priority queue must least support following operation In addition context often called return element modify queue frequently implemented nearly always executes time
This operation performance crucial many application priority queue
More advanced implementation may support complicated operation inspecting first element clearing queue clearing subset queue performing batch insert merging two queue one incrementing priority element etc
One imagine priority queue modified one would get next element queue element retrieved first
Stacks queue may modeled particular kind priority queue
As reminder stack queue behave In stack priority inserted element monotonically increasing thus last element inserted always first retrieved
In queue priority inserted element monotonically decreasing thus first element inserted always first retrieved
There variety simple usually inefficient way implement priority queue
They provide analogy help one understand priority queue
For instance one keep element unsorted list
Whenever element requested search element one highest priority
In insertion time pull time due search
To improve performance priority queue typically use backbone giving log performance insert removal build initially
Variants basic heap data structure provide better bound operation
Alternatively used insertion removal also take log time although building tree existing sequence element take log time typical one might already access data structure standard library
From standpoint priority queue congruent sorting algorithm
The section describes efficient sorting algorithm create efficient priority queue
There several specialized either supply additional operation outperform implementation specific type key specifically integer key
For application many operation every operation time complexity peek action reduced tree heap implementation caching highest priority element every insertion removal
For insertion add constant cost since newly inserted element compared previously cached minimum element
For deletion add additional peek cost typically cheaper deletion cost overall time complexity significantly impacted
specialized queue optimized case item ever inserted lower priority case item previously extracted
This restriction met several practical application priority queue
In following asymptotic upper bound asymptotically tight bound see
Function name assume
The priority queue naturally suggest sorting method insert element sorted priority queue sequentially remove come sorted order
This actually procedure used several layer provided priority queue removed
This sorting method equivalent following sorting algorithm A sorting algorithm also used implement priority queue
Specifically Thorup say We present general deterministic linear space reduction priority queue sorting implying sort key time per key priority queue supporting time constant time
That sorting algorithm sort time per key function one use given procedure create priority queue pulling element time inserting new element deleting element time
For example one log log sort algorithm one create priority queue pulling log log insertion
A priority queue often considered
The STL standard specifies one STL
However specify two element priority served indeed common implementation return according order queue
It implement three parameter comparison object sorting function object default le T unspecified underlying container storing data structure default std T two iterators beginning end sequence
Unlike actual STL container allow element strictly adheres abstract data type definition
STL also utility function manipulating another container binary
The also implementation library heap
Python module implement binary top list
library contains class implement
library contains module implement top compatible data structure
The extension contains class
Apple framework contains structure implement
Priority queuing used manage limited resource transmission line
In event outgoing queuing due insufficient bandwidth queue halted send traffic highest priority queue upon arrival
This ensures prioritized traffic traffic
stream connection forwarded least delay least likelihood rejected due queue reaching maximum capacity
All traffic handled highest priority queue empty
Another approach used send disproportionately traffic higher priority queue
Many modern protocol also include concept priority queue MAC ensure application experience lower latency application served service
Examples include amendment provides standard using existing home wiring phone line
Usually limitation policer set limit bandwidth traffic highest priority queue take order prevent high priority packet choking traffic
This limit usually never reached due high level control instance programmed inhibit call would exceed programmed bandwidth limit
Another use priority queue manage event
The event added queue simulation time used priority
The execution simulation proceeds repeatedly pulling top queue executing event thereon
When graph stored form adjacency list matrix priority queue used extract minimum efficiently implementing although one also need ability alter priority particular vertex priority queue efficiently
requires one repeatedly obtain two tree
A priority queue
algorithm like find shortest path two trying promising route first
A priority queue also known used keep track unexplored route one estimate lower bound case total path length smallest given highest priority
If memory limitation make search impractical variant like algorithm used instead allow removal item
The Optimally Adapting Meshes algorithm computes dynamically changing triangulation terrain
It work splitting triangle detail needed merging le detail needed
The algorithm assigns triangle terrain priority usually related error decrease triangle would split
The algorithm us two priority queue one triangle split another triangle merged
In step triangle split queue highest priority split triangle merge queue lowest priority merged neighbour
Using find one achieve good running time
This min heap priority queue us min heap data structure support operation
In implementation edge used decide priority
Lower weight higher priority higher weight lower priority

In represents countable number ordered value may occur
An instance list computer representation concept finite potentially infinite analog list
Lists basic example contain value
If value occurs multiple time occurrence considered distinct item
The name also used several concrete used implement abstract list especially
Many provide support special syntax semantics list list operation
A list often constructed writing item sequence separated within pair delimiters
Some language may allow list type like case data type accurately described array
In list usually provided subclass generic list class traversed via separate
List data type often implemented using linked list sort may appropriate application
In context programming term list may refer specifically linked list rather array
In abstract list usually defined two operation yield empty list add item beginning list
Implementation list data structure may provide following Lists typically implemented either either singly doubly linked usually variable length
The standard way implementing list originating programming language element list contain value pointer indicating location next element list
This result either depending whether list nested sublists
Some older Lisp implementation Lisp implementation also supported compressed list using special internal representation invisible user
Lists manipulated using
The former often preferred latter norm
Lists implemented holding pair providing access element
residing fringe internal node storing child index used guide search taking time logarithmic list size long change much provide illusion enable swap prefix append operation logarithmic time well
Some language offer list offer use kind table emulate list
For example provides table
Although Lua store list numerical index array internally still appear dictionary
In list fundamental data type represent program code data
In dialect list first three prime number could written
In several dialect Lisp including list collection pair consisting value pointer next pair null value making singly linked list
As name implies list used store list element
However unlike traditional list expand shrink stored dynamically memory
In computing list easier implement set
A finite mathematical sense realized list additional restriction duplicate element disallowed order irrelevant
Sorting list speed determining given item already set order ensure order requires time add new entry list
In efficient implementation however set implemented using rather list
Lists also form basis including variation
The abstract list type element type list defined following function axiom element list
It implicit Note first nil rest nil defined
These axiom equivalent abstract data type
In definition simply regarded defined term constructor
In algebraic term represented transformation
obtained constructor separately handling case
The list type form following function using rather represent monomorphic list element type defined Alternatively monad may defined term operation Note since applied progressively deeper argument recursive call
The list type additive monad monadic zero monadic sum
Lists form operation
The identity element monoid empty list
In fact set list element

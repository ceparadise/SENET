In data type defined behavior point view data specifically term possible value possible operation data type behavior operation
This contrast concrete representation data point view implementer user
Formally ADT may defined class object whose logical behavior defined set value set operation analogous mathematics
What meant behavior varies author two main type formal specification behavior correspond respectively
Some author also include cost term time computing operation space representing value
In practice many common data type ADTs abstraction perfect user must aware issue like due representation
For example integer often stored fixed width value binary number thus experience maximum value exceeded
ADTs theoretical concept computer science used design analysis algorithm data structure software system correspond specific feature computer language directly support formally specified ADTs
However various language feature correspond certain aspect ADTs easily confused ADTs proper include
ADTs first proposed Stephen Zilles part development language
For example ADT defined value operation addition subtraction multiplication division together greater le behave according familiar mathematics care independently integer represented computer
Explicitly behavior includes obeying various axiom associativity commutativity addition etc
precondition operation divide zero
Typically integer represented data structure often might user abstracted concrete choice representation simply use data integer
An ADT consists operation also value underlying data constraint operation
An interface typically refers operation perhaps constraint operation notably constraint relation operation
For example abstract structure could defined three operation insert data item onto stack remove data item access data item top stack without removal
An abstract structure would also three operation insert data item queue remove first data item access serf first data item queue
There would way differentiating two data type unless mathematical constraint introduced stack specifies pop always return recently pushed item popped yet
When algorithm use stack one may also specify operation take time matter many data item pushed stack stack us constant amount storage element
Abstract data type purely theoretical entity used among thing simplify description abstract algorithm classify evaluate data structure formally describe programming language
However ADT may specific many way many programming language described
ADTs often implemented module declares procedure correspond ADT operation sometimes describe constraint
This strategy allows implementation module changed without disturbing program
The term abstract data type also regarded generalized approach number algebraic structure lattice group ring
The notion abstract data type related concept important methodology
An abstract data type defined mathematical model data object make data type well function operate object
There standard convention defining
A broad division may drawn imperative functional definition style
In philosophy language abstract data structure conceived entity may different different time
Some operation may change state ADT therefore order operation evaluated important operation entity may different effect executed different like instruction computer command procedure imperative language
To underscore view customary say operation rather
The imperative style often used describing abstract algorithm
See detail definition ADT often depend concept may regarded simplest ADT
An abstract variable mutable entity admits two operation constraint As many programming language operation often written similar notation implied whenever variable used context value required
Thus example commonly understood shorthand
In definition implicitly assumed storing value variable effect state distinct variable
To make assumption explicit one could add constraint More generally ADT definition often assume operation change state one ADT instance effect state instance including instance ADT unless ADT axiom imply two instance connected sense
For example extending definition abstract variable include abstract operation selects field record variable must yield variable aliased part
The definition abstract variable may also restrict stored value member specific set called
As programming language restriction may simplify description improve readability
Note definition imply anything result evaluating performing operation
An algorithm usually considered invalid effect defined
However important algorithm whose efficiency strongly depends assumption legal return arbitrary value variable range
Some algorithm need create new instance ADT new variable new stack
To describe algorithm one usually includes ADT definition operation yield instance ADT usually axiom equivalent This axiom may strengthened exclude also partial aliasing instance
On hand axiom still allows implementation yield previously created instance become inaccessible program
As another example definition abstract stack could specify state stack modified operation constraint Since assignment definition change state condition implies restores state
From condition property abstract variable follows example sequence value pairwise distinct variable equivalent Here implicitly assumed operation stack instance modify state ADT instance including stack An abstract stack definition usually includes also function operation return stack instance axiom equivalent Sometimes ADT defined one instance existed execution algorithm operation applied instance explicitly notated
For example abstract stack could defined operation operate existing stack
ADT definition style easily rewritten admit multiple coexisting instance ADT adding explicit instance parameter like previous example every operation us modifies implicit instance
On hand ADTs meaningfully defined without assuming multiple instance
This case single operation take two distinct instance ADT parameter
For example consider augmenting definition abstract stack operation check whether stack contain item order
Another way define ADT closer spirit consider state structure separate entity
In view operation modifies ADT modeled take old state argument return new state part result
Unlike imperative operation function
Therefore order evaluated immaterial operation applied argument including input state always return result output state
In functional view particular way need define abstract variable semantics imperative variable namely operation
Instead storing value variable one pass argument function
For example complete definition abstract stack could use three operation In definition need operation
Indeed notion stack instance
The stack state thought potential state single stack structure two stack state contain value order considered identical state
This view actually mirror behavior concrete implementation
Instead definition abstract stack may assume existence special stack state designated special symbol like Λ define operation take argument return special stack state
Note axiom imply In definition stack one need predicate instead one test whether stack empty testing whether equal Λ
Note axiom define effect unless stack state returned
Since leaf stack two operation undefined hence invalid Λ
On hand axiom lack side effect imply
As branch mathematics customary assume also stack state whose existence proved axiom finite number step
In abstract stack example rule mean every stack sequence value becomes empty stack Λ finite number By axiom exclude existence infinite stack ed forever time yielding different state circular stack return state finite number
In particular exclude state
However since one obtain stack state given operation assumed exist
Aside behavior term axiom also possible include definition ADT operation
designer included complexity guarantee STL specification arguing The reason introducing notion abstract data type allow interchangeable software module
You interchangeable module unless module share similar complexity behavior
If I replace one module another module functional behavior different complexity tradeoff user code unpleasantly surprised
I could tell anything I like data abstraction still would want use code
Complexity assertion part interface
provides promise implementation ADT certain property ability knowing required make use ADT object
The user need technical knowledge implementation work use ADT
In way implementation may complex encapsulated simple interface actually used
Code us ADT object need edited implementation ADT changed
Since change implementation must still comply interface since code using ADT object may refer property ability specified interface change may made implementation without requiring change code ADT used
Different implementation ADT property ability equivalent may used somewhat interchangeably code us ADT
This give great deal flexibility using ADT object different situation
For example different implementation ADT may efficient different situation possible use situation preferable thus increasing overall efficiency
Some operation often specified ADTs possibly name In ADT definition one often find also The operation normally relevant meaningful since ADTs theoretical entity use memory
However may necessary one need analyze storage used algorithm us ADT
In case one need additional axiom specify much memory ADT instance us function state much returned pool
Some common ADTs proved useful great variety application Each ADTs may defined many way variant necessarily equivalent
For example abstract stack may may operation tell many item pushed yet popped
This choice make difference client also implementation
An extension ADT computer graphic proposed AGDT
It introduced
AGDTs provide advantage ADTs facility build graphical object structured way
Implementing ADT mean providing one abstract operation
The ADT instance represented concrete manipulated procedure according ADT specification
Usually many way implement ADT using several different concrete data structure
Thus example abstract stack implemented
In order prevent client depending implementation ADT often packaged one whose interface contains signature number type parameter result operation
The implementation body procedure concrete data structure hidden client module
This make possible change implementation without affecting client
If implementation exposed known instead When implementing ADT instance definition state definition usually represented sort
Modern language support form abstract data type
When class used type abstract type refers hidden representation
In model ADT typically implemented instance ADT usually class
The module interface typically declares constructor ordinary procedure ADT operation class
However approach easily encapsulate multiple representational variant found ADT
It also undermine extensibility program
In pure program us interface type type refer behavior representation
As example implementation abstract stack
An interface might This interface could used following manner This interface implemented many way
The implementation may arbitrarily inefficient since formal definition ADT specify much space stack may use long operation take
It also specify whether stack state continues exist call
In practice formal definition specify space proportional number item pushed yet popped every one operation must finish constant amount time independently number
To comply additional specification implementation could use linked list array dynamic resizing together two integer item count array size
ADT definition appropriate functional programming language vice versa
However one provide interface even imperative language like For example Many modern programming language Java come standard library implement several common ADTs listed
The specification programming language intentionally vague representation certain data type defining operation done
Therefore type viewed ADTs
Examples array many scripting language regarded implementation abstract list

In technique arranging complexity computer system
It work establishing level complexity person interacts system suppressing complex detail current level
The programmer work idealized interface usually well defined add additional level functionality would otherwise complex handle
For example programmer writing code involves numerical operation may interested way number represented underlying hardware
whether detail suppressed said leaving simply programmer work
In addition task sending email message across continent would extremely complex programmer start piece fiber optic cable basic hardware component
By using layer complexity created abstract away physical cable network layout presenting programmer virtual data channel task manageable
Abstraction apply control data abstraction action
The notion programming viewed way combine abstraction data code
The abstract definition used common family object different implementation behavior share meaning
The mechanism programming used define common interface
The recommendation programmer use abstraction whenever suitable order avoid duplication usually known
The requirement programming language provide suitable abstraction also called abstraction principle
Computing mostly operates independently concrete world The hardware implement interchangeable others
The software structured enable human create enormous system concentrating issue time
These architecture made specific choice abstraction
architecture inevitable complex
A central form abstraction computing language abstraction new artificial language developed express specific aspect system
help planning
processed computer
An example abstraction process generational development
Each stage used stepping stone next stage
The language abstraction continues example
Within programming language feature let programmer create new abstraction
These include
Some abstraction remain invisible operate design system
Some abstraction try limit range concept programmer need aware completely hiding abstraction turn built
The software engineer writer criticised effort claiming abstraction never completely hide detail however negate usefulness abstraction
Some abstraction designed interoperate abstraction example programming language may contain making call language
Different programming language provide different type abstraction depending intended application language
For example Analysts developed various method formally specify software system
Some known method include Specification language generally rely abstraction one kind another since specification typically defined earlier project abstract level eventual implementation
The specification language example allows definition class waterfall project remain abstract architecture specification phase project
Programming language offer control abstraction one main purpose use
Computer machine understand operation low level moving bit one location memory another location producing sum two sequence bit
Programming language allow done higher level
For example consider statement written fashion To human seems fairly simple obvious calculation
However step necessary carry evaluation return value assign value variable actually quite subtle complex
The value need converted binary representation often much complicated task one would think calculation decomposed compiler interpreter assembly instruction much le intuitive programmer operation shifting binary register left adding binary complement content one register another simply human think abstract arithmetical operation addition multiplication
Finally assigning resulting value variable labeled used later involves additional step looking variable label resultant location physical virtual memory storing binary representation memory location etc
Without control abstraction programmer would need specify step time simply wanted add multiply couple number assign result variable
Such duplication effort two serious negative consequence Structured programming involves splitting complex program task smaller piece clear interface component reduction complexity potential
In simple program may aim ensure loop single obvious exit point possible single exit point function procedure
In larger system may involve breaking complex task many different module
Consider system handle payroll ship shore office These layer produce effect isolating implementation detail one component assorted internal method others
programming embrace extends concept
Data abstraction enforces clear separation property detail implementation
The abstract property visible client code make use data data concrete implementation kept entirely private indeed change example incorporate efficiency improvement time
The idea change supposed impact client code since involve difference abstract behaviour
For example one could define called uniquely associate value may retrieved specifying corresponding key
Such lookup table may implemented various way even simple linear key value pair
As far client code concerned abstract property type case
Of course relies getting detail interface right first place since change major impact client code
As one way look interface form agreed behaviour data type client code anything spelled contract subject change without notice
In theory involves facility define object represent abstract actor perform work report change state communicate object system
The term refers hiding detail extending concept earlier programming language associate strongly data standardizing way different data type interact beginning
When abstraction proceeds operation defined enabling object different type substituted called
When proceeds opposite direction inside type class structuring simplify complex set relationship called
Various programming language offer similar facility abstraction support general strategy programming includes substitution one another similar role
Although generally supported image package may predetermine great many
This would leave minimum binding change
example feature le distinction use delegation
Individual object function abstracted flexibly better fit shared functional heritage
exemplifies another extreme relies heavily static binding turn certain flexibility problem
Although example offer alternate strategy achieving abstraction fundamentally alter need support abstract noun code programming relies ability abstract verb function noun data structure either process
Consider example sample fragment represent common farm animal level abstraction suitable model simple aspect hunger feeding
It defines class represent state animal function With definition one could create object type call method like In example class abstraction used place actual animal abstraction case generalisation
If one requires differentiated hierarchy animal differentiate say provide milk provide nothing except meat end life intermediary level abstraction probably DairyAnimal cow goat would eat food suitable giving good milk MeatAnimal pig steer would eat food give best
Such abstraction could remove need application coder specify type food could concentrate instead feeding schedule
The two class could related using stand alone programmer could define varying degree two type
These facility tend vary drastically language general achieve anything possible others
A great many operation overload data type data type effect degree inheritance mean achieve polymorphism
The class notation simply coder convenience
Decisions regarding abstract keep control coder become major concern design determining relevant relationship real world concern
In general determine appropriate abstraction one must make many small decision scope domain analysis determine system one must cooperate legacy analysis perform detailed analysis expressed within project time budget constraint design
In simple example domain barnyard live pig cow eating habit legacy constraint detailed analysis coder must flexibility feed animal available thus reason code type food class design single simple Animal class pig cow instance function
A decision differentiate DairyAnimal would change detailed analysis domain legacy analysis would entirely control programmer refer abstraction programming distinct abstraction domain legacy analysis
When discussing refers act considering le detailed safe definition observed program behavior
For instance one may observe final result program execution instead considering intermediate step execution
Abstraction defined precise model execution
Abstraction may respect property one answer question property equally well concrete abstract model
For instance wish know result evaluation mathematical expression involving integer worth need perform operation modulo familiar form abstraction
Abstractions however though necessarily
That possible get sound answer though abstraction may simply yield result
For instance may abstract student class minimal maximal age one asks whether certain person belongs class one may simply compare person age minimal maximal age age lie outside range one may safely answer person belong class one may answer I know
The level abstraction included programming language influence overall
The framework includes concept formalism
This framework allows designer programming language study abstraction characteristic design change abstraction influence language usability
Abstractions prove useful dealing computer program property computer program essentially see
As consequence automatic method deriving information behavior computer program either drop termination occasion may fail crash never yield result soundness may provide false information precision may answer I know question
Abstraction core concept
generally take place abstract version studied system
Computer science commonly present le commonly abstraction wherein level represents different model information process varying amount detail
Each level us system expression involving unique set object composition apply particular domain
Each relatively abstract higher level build relatively concrete lower level tends provide increasingly granular representation
For example gate build electronic circuit binary gate machine language binary programming language machine language application operating system programming language
Each level embodied determined level beneath making language description somewhat
Since many user database system lack familiarity computer database developer often hide complexity following level The lowest level abstraction describes system actually store data
The physical level describes complex data structure detail
The next higher level abstraction describes data database store relationship exist among data
The logical level thus describes entire database term small number relatively simple structure
Although implementation simple structure logical level may involve complex physical level structure user logical level need aware complexity
This referred
must decide information keep database use logical level abstraction
The highest level abstraction describes part entire database
Even though logical level us simpler structure complexity remains variety information stored large database
Many user database system need information instead need access part database
The view level abstraction exists simplify interaction system
The system may provide many database
The ability provide different level abstraction use
Some specifically generate design contain various level abstraction
Layered architecture partition concern application stacked group layer
It technique used designing computer software hardware communication system network component isolated layer change made one layer without affecting others

In extensible creating providing initial value state implementation behavior member function
In many language class name used name class template name default class creates object object generated class distinct concept easily conflated
When object created constructor class resulting object called class member variable specific object called contrast shared across class
In language class feature new class declared runtime language class generally object typically type similar
In language class creates class called
In casual use people often refer class object narrowly speaking object interface namely type member variable signature method property satisfy
At time class implementation specifically implementation method create object given type given implementation
In term type theory class collection type
Different concrete class produce object abstract type depending type system example type might implemented two class fast small stack scale poorly scale well high overhead small stack
Similarly given class may several different constructor
Types generally represent noun person place thing something class represents implementation
For example type might represent property functionality banana general class would represent way producing banana say banana supplier data structure function represent draw banana video game
The class could produce particular banana instance class would object type
Often single implementation type given case class name often identical type name
Classes composed structural behavioral constituent
Programming language include class programming construct offer support various feature syntax required use feature varies greatly one programming language another
A class contains field description
These usually field type name associated state variable program run time state variable either belong class specific instance class
In language structure defined class determines layout memory used instance
Other implementation possible example object use associative container
Some programming language support specification part definition class enforce type system
state necessary able enforce invariant class
The behavior class instance defined using
Methods ability operate object class
These operation may alter state object simply provide way accessing
Many kind method exist support varies across language
Some type method created called programmer code special constructor destructors conversion created called code
A language may also allow programmer define call special method
Every class interface providing behavior
Structure consists data state behavior consists code specifies method implemented
There distinction definition interface implementation interface however line blurred many programming language class declaration define implement interface
Some language however provide feature separate interface implementation
For example define interface without providing implementation
Languages support class inheritance also allow class inherit interface class derived
In language support interface class considered set public member class including method attribute via implicit private member internal data structure intended depended external code thus part interface
programming methodology dictate operation interface class independent
It result layered design client interface use method declared interface
An interface place requirement client invoke operation one interface particular order
This approach benefit client code assume operation interface available use whenever client access object
The button front television set interface electrical wiring side plastic casing
You press power button toggle television
In example particular television instance method represented button button together comprise interface
Other television set model would interface
In common form interface specification group related method without associated implementation method
A television set also myriad size whether support color together comprise structure
A class represents full description television including attribute structure button interface
Getting total number television manufactured could television class
This method clearly associated class yet outside domain individual instance class
Another example would static method find particular instance set television object
The following common set Although many language support access specifier semantics may differ
design us access specifier conjunction careful design public method implementation enforce class state object
A common usage access specifier separate internal data class interface internal structure made private public used inspect alter private data
Access specifier necessarily control even private member may visible client external code
In language inaccessible visible member may referred example pointer returned member function attempt use referring name member client code prevented type checker
The various programming language enforce member accessibility visibility various degree depending language compilation policy enforced either
For example language allow client code access private data class compile
In language private method visible accessible interface however may made invisible explicitly declaring fully abstract class represent interface class
Some language feature accessibility scheme In addition design standalone class programming language may support advanced class design based upon relationship class
The relationship design capability commonly provided
Classes composed class thereby establishing compositional relationship enclosing class embedded class
Compositional relationship class also commonly known relationship
For example class Car could composed contain class Engine
Therefore Car Engine
One aspect composition containment enclosure component instance instance
If enclosing object contains component instance value component enclosing object similar
If component contained reference may similar lifetime
For example This class instance object array object
Classes one existing class thereby establishing hierarchical relationship class derived class
The relationship derived class class commonly known relationship
For example class could derived class
Therefore Button Control
Structural behavioral member parent class child class
Derived class define additional structural member data field behavioral member method addition therefore superclass
Also derived class inherited method language allows
Not language support multiple inheritance
For example Java allows class implement multiple interface inherit one class
If multiple inheritance allowed hierarchy DAG short otherwise
The hierarchy class node inheritance relationship link
Classes level likely class different level
The level hierarchy called
Example Simplified code iPhone SDK In example UITableView UIScrollView UIView UIResponder NSObject
Conceptually superclass subclass
For example common class hierarchy would involve superclass would subclass
These set theory well square rectangle rectangle square
A common conceptual error mistake relation subclass
For example car truck kind vehicle would appropriate model subclass vehicle class
However would error model component part car subclass relation
For example car composed engine body would appropriate model engine body subclass car
In modeling kind relation typically modeled object property
In example Car class would property called
would typed hold collection object instance
Object modeling language UML include capability model various aspect part kind relation
Data cardinality object constraint input output value etc
This information utilized developer tool generate additional code beside basic data definition object
Things error checking get set method
One important question modeling implementing system object class whether class one superclass
In real world actual set would rare find set intersect one set
However system Flavors CLOS provide capability one parent run time introduces complexity many community consider antithetical goal using object class first place
Understanding class responsible handling message get complex dealing one superclass
If used carelessly feature introduce system complexity ambiguity class designed avoid
Most modern language Smalltalk Java require single inheritance run time
For language multiple inheritance may useful modeling implementation
However application object multiple superclass
The volatility Internet requires level flexibility technology standard designed support
A similar issue whether class hierarchy modified run time
Languages Flavors CLOS Smalltalk support feature part
Since class object possible dynamically alter structure sending appropriate message
Other language focus strong typing Java allow class hierarchy modified run time
Semantic web object capability run time change class
The rational similar justification allowing multiple superclass Internet dynamic flexible dynamic change hierarchy required manage volatility
Although language commonly assumed support inheritance inheritance intrinsic aspect concept class
Some language often referred support class yet support inheritance
Examples language include earlier version
In two class represents collaboration class corresponding instance
Associations direction example association two class indicates class aware relationship
Associations may labeled according name purpose
An association role given end association describes role corresponding class
For example subscriber role describes way instance class Person participate association class Magazine
Also Magazine subscribed magazine role association
Association role multiplicity describes many instance correspond instance class association
Common multiplicity specifies number instance
There many category class overlap
In language support inheritance ABC class instantiated either labeled abstract simply specifies
An abstract class may provide implementation method may also specify virtual method via implemented direct indirect descendant abstract class
Before class derived abstract class instantiated abstract method parent class must implemented class derivation chain
Most programming language allow programmer specify class considered abstract allow instantiated
For example keyword used
In abstract class class least one abstract method given appropriate syntax language pure virtual function parlance
A class consisting virtual method called Pure Abstract Base Class also known user language
Other language notably Java C support variant abstract class called via keyword language
In language allowed class implement multiple interface
Such class contain abstract publicly accessible method
A class opposed abstract class
In language class declared global scope
There various type class
An class defined within another class
The relationship inner class containing class also treated another type class association
An inner class typically neither associated instance enclosing class instantiated along enclosing class
Depending language may may possible refer class outside enclosing class
A related concept also known generalization concept inner class
example language support inner class inner type via declaration
Another type class defined within procedure function
This limit reference class name within scope class declared
Depending semantic rule language may additional restriction local class compared one
One common restriction disallow local class method access local variable enclosing function
For example local class may refer static variable declared within enclosing function may access function automatic variable
class whose instance class
A metaclass describes common structure collection class implement describe particular kind class
Metaclasses often used describe
In language class also object thus class instance unique metaclass built language
The CLOS provides MOPs implement class metaclasses
class allow programmer design class hierarchy class level hierarchy derivation prohibited
A class may also designated preventing formation hierarchy
Contrast class imply encourage require derivation order used
A class implicitly
A class created declaring class C Java PHP
For example Java class designated
class may allow compiler compiled language perform optimization available subclassable class
Some language special support though language multiple inheritance mixin simply class represent relationship
Mixins typically used add method multiple class example class might provide method called included class share common parent
In language supporting feature class whose definition may split multiple piece within single file across multiple file
The piece merged making compiler output class
The primary motivation introduction partial class facilitate implementation
It otherwise challenge compromise develop code generator manage generated code interleaved within code
Using partial class code generator process separate file partial class within file thus alleviated intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing increasing compiler efficiency eliminating potential risk corrupting developer code
In simple implementation partial class compiler perform phase unifies part partial class
Then compilation proceed usual
Other benefit effect partial class feature include Partial class existed name considerable time
With arrival introduced partial class supported
also support partial class
This simple example written show part class defined two different file
When compiled result two file written one like In partial class also known may even spread multiple library executables like example In Foundation header file In library separate binary Foundation framework header file And app yet another separate binary file source code file The dispatcher find method called NSData instance invoke correctly
allow programmer group together field method accessible runtime without instance class
Indeed instantiation prohibited kind class
For example C class marked static instantiated static member field method may
An class bound name identifier upon definition
This analogous named versus
The benefit organizing software object class fall three category Object class facilitate rapid development lessen semantic gap code user
System analyst talk developer user using essentially vocabulary talking account customer bill etc
Object class often facilitate rapid development environment come powerful debugging testing tool
Instances class inspected run time verify system performing expected
Also rather get dump core memory environment interpreted debugging capability developer analyze exactly program error occurred see method called argument argument
Object class facilitate ease maintenance via encapsulation
When developer need change behavior object localize change object component part
This reduces potential unwanted side effect maintenance enhancement
Software also major benefit using Object class
Classes facilitate via inheritance interface
When new behavior required often achieved creating new class class inherit default behavior data superclass tailor aspect behavior data accordingly
via interface also known method occurs another object want invoke rather create new kind object class
This method remove many common error make way software one program code another
These benefit come cost course
One serious obstacle using object class performance
Interpreted environment support language Smalltalk CLOS provided rapid development resulting code nearly fast could achieved procedural language This partly addressed development language interpreted Java
Also due processing power computer increased point efficient code critical system past
Still matter well designed language always inevitable bit required extra overhead create class rather use procedural code circumstance especially performance memory required optimal using object class may best approach
Also getting benefit object class requires used appropriately requires training
Without proper training developer may simply code procedural program environment end worst world
As data type class usually considered construct
A language may also support represent information class even represent metadata provides access facility ability manipulate data structure format
Many language distinguish kind class class basis information needed
Some dynamic language make strict distinction construct therefore may distinguish metaobjects class
For example Human representing class Person instance class Person created using facility Human

In programming language abstract class generic class type object used basis creating specific object conform protocol set operation support
Abstract class instantiated directly
Abstract class useful creating hierarchy class model reality make possible specify invariant level functionality method leave implementation method specific implementation class derived class needed
In programming OOP language class represent object domain problem software intended solve
Classes include collection attribute property behavior method based class
Programmers use inheritance derive specific implementation abstract class
Classes derived abstract class called derived class
When principle applied many time succession result hierarchy class
In context abstract class root hierarchy used enforce method need overridden derived class thus avoiding potential runtime error
An abstract class least one abstract method

The abstract method derived class implemented access modifier number type argument return type base class
Objects abstract class type created code instantiate object abstract class type result compilation error

Subversion centralized system sharing information
At core repository central store data
The repository store information form typical hierarchy file directory
Any number connect repository read write file
By writing data client make information available others reading data client receives information others
So interesting
So far sound like definition typical file server
And indeed repository kind file server usual breed
What make Subversion repository special ever written change every file even change directory tree addition deletion rearrangement file directory
When client read data repository normally see latest version filesystem tree
But client also ability view state filesystem
For example client ask historical question What directory contain last Wednesday Who last person change file change make These sort question heart system designed track change data time
To create Subversion repository departmental CVS server send request help asking creation personal CVS repository creation project repository related research group class department
Personal CVS repository created CVS server project repository created CVS server
After CVS repository created subversion repository must created
Login create repository svnadmin create If wish run multiple subversion repository CVS server need create subdirectory repository create subversion repository subdirectory
Access Subversion repository currently ONLY using SSH available user account Department Computer Science
Access web http based repository currently managed Computer Services requested sending email help
We strongly suggest use key authentication SSH prompted password file committed
This make process committing Subversion change atomic le painful
A document describing setup key authentication Linux Windows available
The Subversion repository currently residing Linux server filesystem running POSIX draft file ACLs
The process sharing repository collaborating others require modifying ACLs
For information Linux file ACLs see man page setfacl getfacl see two web page longer active
Here example adding user anderegg repository
You need set extended ACLs repository
Login cv cd repository setfacl user anderegg rwX
setfacl user anderegg rwX
To remove access user anderegg cd repository setfacl user anderegg
setfacl user anderegg
NOTE Both command need run make change permission everything existing without everything created future default
There cron job sweep repository performs chown owner repository everything within case different user creates file within repository
It far beyond scope document describe detail using Subversion
The department longer local copy tutorial
There tutorial available online
Recommendations tutorial welcome submitted maintainer document
The process getting started Subversion may take bit time plan try Subversion repository try tutorial get speed
Users allocated space personal Subversion repository
Projects allocated space Subversion repository
As late department added support accessible Subversion repository
These repository accessible SSH
Instead repository accessed URL beginning Users need request web based Subversion repository time repository creation based different part filesystem
Access permission web based repository managed Computer Services
Therefore request access change directed help
If wish share Subversion repository user two option Buy Computer Science cvsonly account allows SSH access CVS server
Request Subversion repository beginning

A colloquially known repo short storage location may retrieved installed computer
Many software publisher organization maintain server purpose either free charge subscription fee
Repositories may solely particular program programming language entire
Operators repository typically provide tool intended search install otherwise manipulate software package repository
For example many use APT commonly found based distribution found based distribution
There also multiple independent package management system pacman used equo found
As software repository designed include useful package major repository designed free
If computer configured use repository reputable vendor coupled appropriate significantly reduces threat malware system
As side effect many system capability require software
Most major many repository around world mirror main repository
A different
A typical use package management system facilitate integration code possibly different source coherent operating unit
Thus package management system might used produce possibly distribution tailored specific restricted application
A package development process contrast used manage code documentation collection function routine common theme producing thereby package software function typically complete usable
A good package development process help user conform good documentation coding practice integrating level
The table provides example package development process
The following table list language repository contributed software
The Autochecks column describes routine check done
Very people ability test software multiple different version core code contributed package may use
For run test routinely
To see valuable suppose Sally contributes package Sally run current version software one version Microsoft Windows tested environment
At le regular interval CRAN test Sally contribution dozen combination operating system version core R language software
If one generates error get error message
With luck error message may suffice allow fix error even replicate hardware software
Next suppose John contributes repository package B us package A
Package B pass test made available user
Later Sally submits improved version A unfortunately break B
The autochecks make possible provide information John fix problem
This example expose strength weakness R system CRAN support kind automated testing contributed package package contributed CRAN need specify version contributed package use
Procedures requesting specific version package exist contributor might use procedure
Beyond repository CRAN running regular check contributed package actually provides extensive test suite development version core language
If Sally example get error message understand think inappropriate especially development version language often R ask core language help
In way repository contribute improving quality core language software
Parts table copied List Top Repositories Programming Language Software manage repository repository manager includes

Contents The following basic introduction Subversion
For full online instruction book use Subversion visit available website
Programmers used version control year manage change software checking debugging
It introduced prevent programmer working file overwriting others software possibly reintroducing bug poor programmer spent age removing
It similar reason Computer Laboratory introduced
You right
Subversion going make simple editing work challenge various reason introducing Subversion introduces system remembers every change ever written repository addition deletion rearrangement file directory
Files stored central similar ordinary file server except remembers every change ever made file directory
This allows recover older version file examine history data changed changed
To manage multiple file version Subversion us model alternative locking
In model user client read repository creates personal working copy file project
Users work parallel modifying private copy
Finally private copy merged together new final version
The version control system often assist merging ultimately human responsible making happen correctly
This much efficient method mean one person editing file time
The may sound bit chaotic practice run extremely smoothly user work parallel never waiting one another

Published Updated Software essential component science workflow yet often receives little attention formal scientific publication
Software citation one way encourage wider recognition software role scientific analysis
In published Arfon Smith Daniel Katz Kyle Niemeyer Software Citation Working Group
The article established consolidated set citation principle may encourage broad adoption consistent policy software citation across discipline venue
Software citation today scientific research requires discoverability accessibility software may still iterative development stage small feat
Here author Academic Editor follows discussion taken place since principle first published provides direction way scientific community implement
described recent really interesting ambitious project started least announced last summer
Its mission collect preserve share software publicly available source code form
And project
For example currently store public repository GitHub plus bunch thing working Bitbucket
It currently hold almost billion source code file almost billion commits million project
This mean public code stored indexed made available currently via eventually simply browse
The Software Heritage project describes three use case archive This includes reproducibility surprisingly include citation credit perhaps archive sufficient allow credit could bit effort community
As citation process involved two element making something citable actually citing
And two element involved three step example paper The first two step make paper citable third step cite paper
The second step key making paper citable making recoverable
The distinguishes recoverable unrecoverable data recoverable data accessed reader via citation information unrecoverable data accessed via citation information
The APA Manual go recommend recoverable data cited formal citation unrecoverable data referred within text author personal communication date
But software distinction recoverable published unrecoverable available work
All version software GitHub even never published recoverable default le barring project deleted GitHub though even could recovered local repository
The try force issue recommending insertion Step process
Today creator develops software GitHub software never really complete though may released different stage version development
The say creator also publish software release example
This finished process making software citable allows someone else cite
This reasonable solution many case allows reader paper recover access software cited
But case work add step software developer workflow may care enough implement
Even get future time developer routinely published software release happens existing software
For software archive mostly remove need Step
If I user software want cite software I used I need Of course quite simple sound could future
Here three thing I think missing provides basic answer additional work still needed The remaining gap one solve alone
It asked two related question The question appropriate metadata software purpose citation partially addressed paper specifically though really tested practice
drafted new version add update element reflect principle though public yet
It also important note paper say Similarly software metadata recorded part data provenance overlap metadata recorded part software citation software used work
The data recorded reproducibility also overlap metadata recorded part software citation
In general intend software citation principle cover minimum necessary software citation purpose software identification
Some use case related citation provenance reproducibility might additional requirement beyond basic metadata needed citation show
One way think metadata describe property software source code author language license version number location etc
Let call software creation metadata
And also metadata describe code used possibly including built compiler version operating system parallel computing platform option etc
Let call software usage metadata
The say software creation metadata needed citation software usage metadata needed provenance reproducibility
While person us software research determine software usage metadata person determine software creation metadata
This done software creator
So provide metadata needed software citation gap
But author software want cited fill gap could relatively easily
They would need create single metadata file root repository agreed upon name
The first time I heard suggested Martin Fenner based work done goal creating minimal metadata schema science software code JSON XML
Martin provided example could done file repository
According Martin process DataCite today could generate DOI citation involves using DataCite XML generation
If code developer created file repository started working project would need keep data much like README description project CONTRIBUTORS contributed project file might need create CITATION project cited file
Or CONTRIBUTORS CITATION file could generated part continuous integration part releasing packaging
Since Software Heritage would keep version corresponding version software code would relatively easy retrospectively build proper citation metadata version software
This still leaf portion gap How build citation code author care credit provided
This also need answered cite almost software built
Most metadata needed see extracted repository directly
The one thing author
While would argue author contributor repository I agree
There contributor software project may contribute repository
person get funding resource enable project person provides training software contributor repository author software administrator add license information source code file
Therefore I think best thing simply identify project author author CodeMeta Project author feel incorrect create codemeta json file provide correct information
To put together I really excited see emerge archive source code enable lot understanding software project claim
And I also excited better enable software citation anything today
Finally also open path software author create maintain single file repository provide metadata needed make software citation almost automatic

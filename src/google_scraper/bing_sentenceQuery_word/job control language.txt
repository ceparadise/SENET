name used operating system instruct system run start subsystem
More specifically purpose JCL say program run using file device input output time also indicate condition skip step
There two distinct IBM Job Control language They share basic syntax rule basic concept otherwise different
For DOS OS unit work
A job consists one several step request run one specific program
For example day job produce printed report management might consist following step program select appropriate record copy temporary file temporary file required order usually using utility program present information way easy read includes useful information program format selected page information display monitor terminal
In DOS OS JCL first card must JOB card Procedures commonly called JCL step group step inserted job
Both JCLs allow procedure
Procs used repeating step used several time one job several different job
They save programmer time reduce risk error
To run procedure one simply includes JCL file single card copy procedure specified file insert jobstream
Also procs include customize procedure use
Both DOS OS JCL maximum usable line length character first used main method providing new input computer system
It later became possible submit job via disk tape file longer record length operating system job submission component ignored everything character
Strictly speaking operating system family use character per line
Characters usually card sequence number system printed report useful identifying location error reported operating system
Character usually left blank contain nonblank character indicate JCL statement continued onto next card
All command parameter name value capital except filename
All line except input see begin slash line operating system process begin two slash always starting
However two exception delimiter statement comment statement
A delimiter statement begin slash asterisk comment statement OS JCL begin pair slash asterisk asterisk DOS JCL
Many JCL statement long fit within character extended indefinite number continuation card The structure common type card DOS OS JCL allow input
card processed application program rather operating system
Data kept long time normally stored disk use terminal became common way create edit disk file supplying new data card
DOS OS JCL different way signaling start input end input column card following last data card
This make operating system resume processing JCL card following card
Much complexity OS JCL particular derives large number option specifying information
While file operating system abstracted arbitrary collection byte detail handled large part OS datasets successor expose file type size record type length block size information density label information
Although system default many option still lot specified programmer combination JCL information coded program
The information coded program le flexible information usually supplied JCL
For example user enters command like JCL like following might used copy file A second explanation complexity JCL different expectation running job found environment
Later version operating system retain feature original simplification made avoid forcing customer rewrite JCL file
Many user save set JCL statement likely used twice
The syntax OS JCL similar syntax would therefore familiar programmer time many program coded assembly language
DOS JCL parameter positional make harder read write easier system parse
DOS JCL extent mitigates difficulty positional parameter using statement fewer parameter OS JCL
In example ASSGN DLBL EXTENT statement work specifying new disk file stored single statement OS JCL
In original version one specify model number device used disk tape existing file temporary file would deleted end job
This meant customer upgraded modern equipment many JCL file changed
Later member family reduced number situation device model number required
originally required programmer specify location size file
The card specifies volume extent resides starting absolute track number track
file extent different volume
OS JCL consists three basic statement type Right start JCL OS family including flexible easier use
The following example use old style syntax provided right launch
The old syntax still quite common job running year minor change
Each JCL Statement Divided field
concatenated
space
All major parameter OS JCL statement identified keywords presented order
A contain two much disk space allocate new file detailed specification file layout example
sometimes positional complex parameter keyword
Positional parameter must precede keyword parameter
Keyword parameter always assign value keyword using equal sign
The statement used reference data
This statement link program internal description dataset data external device disk tape card printer etc
The DD may provide information device type
number tape disk description data file called subparameter DCB program used identify file
Information describing file come three source The DD card information dataset label information existing file stored tape disk DCB macro coded program
When file opened data merged DD information taking precedence label information DCB information taking precedence
The updated description written back dataset label
This lead unintended consequence incorrect DCB information provided
From beginning JCL OS family operating system offered high degree device independence
Even new file kept end job one could specify device type generic term
Of course mattered one could specify model number even specific device address
permit grouping one statement invoking procname simply EXEC procname A facility called Procedure Library allowed procedure
Procedures tested sandwiching statement invoking already procedure library
For example OS JCL procedure parameterized start making rather like even simple thus increasing wide range situation
In example value beginning ampersand parameter specified job request procedure used
The PROC statement addition giving procedure name allows programmer specify default value parameter
So one could use one procedure example create new file many different size layout
For example In job later step use instead specifying full file already specified earlier step
For example Here us file identified step mean dataset name specifies name file
In job contain mixture JCL procedure call step refer back file fully specified procedure example mean use file identified step procedure used step job
Using name step called procedure rather name procedure allows programmer use procedure several time job without confusion instance procedure used referback
JCL file long complex language easy read
JCL described user hostile
OS JCL allows programmer include two type explanatory comment OS JCL allows programmer concatenate chain input file appear program file example The third statement value name field OS treat concatenation
The file must basic type almost always sequential must record length however block length need
In early version OS certainly block length must decreasing order user must inspect instance append named DD statement maximum block length found example In later version OS certainly appropriate selectable unit OS allocation would inspect instance concatenation would substitute maximum block length found
A usual fallback simply determine maximum possible block length device specify named DD statement example The purpose fallback ensure access method would allocate input buffer set large enough accommodate specified datasets
OS expects program set return code specifies successful thought
The common conventional value OS JCL refers return code condition code use decide whether run subsequent step
However unlike modern programming language conditional step OS JCL executed specified condition giving rise If true pas without running code
To complicate matter condition specified step refers
For example mean This translates following Note reading step containing statement backwards one understand fairly easily
This example
However IBM later introduced IF condition JCL thereby making coding somewhat easier programmer retaining parameter avoid making change existing JCLs used
Jobs use number assist processing data
Utilities useful batch processing
The utility grouped three set On IBM mainframe system set control statement provide information subsystem
JECL statement may specify network computer run run job send resulting output
JECL distinct JCL instructs run job
There different version JECL three environment
An early version Job Entry Control Language Remote Job Entry Program Number used identifier column input record consisted single control statement Job Entry Definition
Workstation Commands also began
Although term yet developed similar functionality would become JECL including syntax
For JECL statement start start except remote command
The command two system completely different
The following JECL statement used
The following JECL statement used For VSE JECL statement start note space
The Job Entry Control Language defines start end line JCL job
It advises job handled
JECL statement define job name used class job processed disposition job

Example Other mainframe system form job control language whether called syntax completely different IBM version usually provided similar capability
system include file PCDOS file run usually provide robust environment running unattended job JCL
On computer system job control language interactive command language may different
For example system us command language along JCL batch work
On system may

A computer application controlling unattended background program execution
This commonly called execution job often called though traditional distinguished contrasted see page detail
Other synonym include commonly today
The data structure job run known
Modern job scheduler often termed typically provide graphical user interface definition monitoring background execution distributed network computer
Increasingly job scheduler required orchestrate integration business activity traditional background IT processing across different platform business application environment
confused assignment currently running process
Basic feature expected job scheduler software include If software completely different area includes feature software considered job scheduling capability
Most provide basic job scheduling capability notably respectively
provide job scheduling capability
Many program also include relevant capability
Operating system OS point program supplied usually provide ability schedule beyond single OS instance outside remit specific program
Organizations needing unrelated IT workload may also leverage advanced feature job scheduler These advanced capability written developer often provided supplier specialize software
There many concept central almost every job scheduler implementation widely recognized minimal variation Beyond basic single OS instance scheduling tool two major architecture exist Job Scheduling software
An important niche job scheduler managing cluster computer
Typically scheduler schedule job queue sufficient resource cluster node become idle
Some widely used cluster batch system Job Scheduling long history
Job Schedulers one major component since early mainframe system
At first stack processed one hence term
From historical point view distinguish two main era Job Schedulers In term type scheduling also distinct era Various scheme used decide particular job run

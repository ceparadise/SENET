The course taught Java assume prior experience writing computer program
If programming knowledge experience Java Python etc
might find introductory course easy
We accelerated introductory course might better fit
CS cover material two course introductory sequence cover one semester rather two
We developed CS Knowledge Assessment
This series question designed help u place course best fit unique combination experience knowledge
The assessment supported online course used refresh knowledge computer science time passed since last programming experience

In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


Created GLOSSARY OF EDUCATION REFORM comprehensive online resource describes widely used term concept strategy journalist parent community member
In education term refers wide variety method tool educator use evaluate measure document academic readiness learning progress skill acquisition educational need student
While assessment often equated traditional developed testing company administered large population use diverse array assessment tool method measure everything readiness kindergarten student comprehension advanced physic
Just academic lesson different function assessment typically designed measure specific element level knowledge student already concept skill teacher planning teach ability comprehend analyze different type text reading
Assessments also used identify individual student weakness strength educator provide specialized educational programming social service
In addition assessment developed wide array group individual including teacher district administrator university private company state department education group include combination individual institution
While assessment take wide variety form education following description provide representative overview major form educational assessment
Assessments used wide variety purpose school Formative assessment commonly said learning educator use result modify improve teaching technique instructional period summative assessment said learning evaluate academic achievement conclusion instructional period
Or assessment expert Paul Black put When cook taste soup formative assessment
When customer taste soup summative Assessments also designed variety way different purpose The purpose assessment generally drive way designed many way assessment used
A standardized assessment assessment example form assessment standardized test
A portfolio student work used formative summative form assessment
assessment may also created team teacher commonly used single course grade level school assessment almost never Screening assessment may produced university conducted research specific area child development skill attribute student entering kindergarten increase likelihood successful pattern behavior strength challenge suggest child particular learning disability
In short assessment usually created highly specialized purpose
While educational assessment test around since day schoolhouse increasingly assumed central role effort improve effectiveness public school teaching
score example arguably dominant measure educational achievement United States also commonly reported indicator school teacher performance
As school become increasingly equipped computer tablet wireless internet access growing proportion assessment administered school either online test assessment still common widely used school
New technology software application also changing nature use assessment innumerable way given system typically offer array feature traditional test assignment
For example system may allow student log take assessment time may make performance result available student teacher immediately assessment completed historically might taken hour day week teacher review score grade assessment class
In addition digital online assessment typically include feature analytics give educator detailed information student performance
For example teacher may able see long took student answer particular question many time student failed answer question correctly getting right answer
Many advocate digital online assessment tend argue system used properly could help teacher many digital online system provide far detailed information academic performance student educator use information modify educational program instructional approach way address distinct learning need interest aspiration cultural background individual student
In addition many standardized test administered online though state typically allow student take test computer unavailable student prefer option student technological skill literacy required perform well online assessment
Given assessment come many form serve many diverse function thorough discussion purpose use assessment could fill lengthy book
The following description however provide brief illustrative overview major way assessment used attempt improve school teaching In education widespread agreement assessment integral part effective educational system program
Educators parent elected official policy maker employer public want know whether student learning successfully progressing academically school
The complex wide ranging frequently center assessment used including frequently administered whether assessment beneficial harmful student teaching process
While comprehensive discussion debate beyond scope resource following representative selection major issue debated The Glossary Education Reform welcome comment suggestion

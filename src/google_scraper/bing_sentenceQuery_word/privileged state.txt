In computer science state program defined condition regarding stored input
The term state used similarly used science whereas state object instance gas liquid solid show current physical makeup state computer program show current value content
The stored input computer program stored variable constant
In analyzing state program developer may go look value stored input
As program executed state may change variable change value stored memory also change
For example control variable variable used loop change state program iteration
Looking state program considered testing method way analyzing code base
Developers also talk different type state example contrasting two complementary state contradictory one another contrasting two different state resulting different operation

In defined delegation authority
A privilege allows user perform action
Examples various privilege include ability create read delete file access read write communicating
Users delegated extra level control called privileged
Users lack privilege defined unprivileged regular normal user
Privileges either automatic granted applied
An automatic privilege exists requirement permission perform action
For example system people required log system use logging require privilege
Systems implement file protection essentially give unlimited privilege perform action file
A granted privilege exists result presenting credential privilege granting authority
This usually accomplished logging system username password supplied correct user granted additional privilege
A privilege applied either executed program issuing request advanced privilege running program apply additional privilege
An example user applying additional privilege provided command run command user authentication system
Modern processor architecture multiple allows OS run different
Some processor two level processor four level least privilege
Tasks tagged privilege level
Resources segment page port etc
privileged instruction tagged demanded privilege level
When task try use resource execute privileged instruction processor determines whether permission protection fault interrupt generated
This prevents user task damaging OS
In computer programming exception related privileged instruction violation may caused array accessed bound invalid pointer dereferenced invalid memory location referenced privileged location one controlling device
This particularly likely occur programming language C use pointer arithmetic check array bound automatically
On system commonly known owns privilege
Ordinary user granted enough permission accomplish common task
UNIX system security feature
Most user set new user account administrative procedure
The user root special user something called anything system
This high degree power necessary fully administer UNIX system also allows user make mistake cause system problem
Unprivileged user usually On system privilege delegated varying degree
These delegation defined using
The following abbreviated list default assignment Windows defines number administrative privilege assigned individually user group
An account user hold privilege granted either directly indirectly group membership
Upon installation number group account created privilege granted
However grant changed later time though
Unlike Linux privilege implicitly permanently granted specific account
Some administrative privilege
taking ownership restoring arbitrary file powerful used malicious intent could allow entire system compromised
With default since Windows Vista Windows strip user token privilege login
Thus user log account broad system privilege still system privilege
Whenever user want perform administrative action requiring system privilege process
When launching process user made aware administrative privilege asserted prompt requiring consent
Not holding privilege actually required keeping
Elevated process run full privilege full privilege
Even privilege user may still required particular process thus completely
The Windows ME Windows Windows previous version Windows operated FAT filesystem support filesystem therefore privilege effectively defeated Windows system use file system
The name used Windows source code end either Privilege LogonRight
This led confusion full set Rights Privileges called
Microsoft currently us term User Rights
In past term also used Microsoft Privilege Rights logon user right

Photo courtesy Philip Guo started programming I first Logo BASIC
The picture age horrible posture
By time photo taken I already written several BASIC game I distributed shareware local BBS
I fast growing bored parent software engineer gave original grad school day
That I started learning C writing simple interpreter compiler
My early interpreter BASIC time I entered high school I already created nontrivial subset Throughout high school I spent weekend coding assembly obsessed code newly released
When I started freshman year MIT computer science major I already year programming experience
So I felt right home
OK lie
With one exception That photo
When taken I even know
My parent like Quick pose front new computer Look closely
My finger even right position
My parent humanity major single programming book house
In sixth grade I tried teaching BASIC week quit hard
The real exposure I programming prior college taking AP computer science grade taught math teacher learned material
Despite shortcoming class inspired major computer science college
But I started freshman year MIT I felt bit anxious many classmate actually year childhood programming experience I le one
Even though I grow household could code way paper bag I one big thing going I I good programming
Here freshman year college Photo courtesy Philip Guo As Asian male student MIT I fit society image young programmer
Thus throughout college nobody ever said said CS student I knew Although I started complete novice like everyone I never faced impeded intellectual growth
Throughout college grad school I gradually learned via class research internship incrementally taking harder harder project getting better better programming falling deeper deeper love
Instead age I mine age
And nobody ever got way even I looked like sort person would good thing
The software engineer Tess Rinearson writes dynamic different perspective essay Instead facing implicit bias I privilege implicit endorsement
For instance whenever I attended technical meeting people would assume I knew I regardless whether I treat accordingly
If I stared someone silence nodded talking would assume I understood I clueless
Nobody ever talked I always got benefit doubt technical setting
As result I able fake till I made often landing job whose posting required skill I yet learned knew I could pick spot
Most interview research assistantships summer internship quite gave chance try
And enough round practice I actually start knowing I
As I gained experience I able land meaningful programming job led virtuous cycle improvement
For every white Asian male expert programmer know imagine parallel universe another ethnicity gender
This kind privilege I people looked like possessed silent manifested people said u rather say
We spend enormous amount time developing technical expertise without anyone interference implicit discouragement
Sure worked really hard effort directly translated skill improvement without much loss due interpersonal friction
Because looked part
In contrast ask computer science major majority demographic white Asian male I guarantee encountered discouraging comment You know everyone cut computer They probably still remember word action hurt even though often trying harm
For example one good friend took course freshman year enjoyed
She wanted get better Java GUI programming got summer research assistantship MIT Media Lab
However instead letting build GUI like job ad described supervisor assigned task audio clip summer long
He assigned new male student build GUI application
And like student programming also freshman amount limited experience
The student spent summer getting better GUI programming grinded away mindlessly transcribing audio
As result grew resentful shied away learning CS
Thinking story always anger
Here someone natural interest took initiative learn denied opportunity
I doubt friend could gotten good really enjoyed opportunity I
It help accepted MIT son saying Well got MIT Over decade later programming research job wish learned back college
However negative association everything hard motivate fear shot
One trite retort Well friend tougher given easily
If wanted badly enough tried even knowing might face These sort remark aggravate
Writing code living like Navy SEAL
Programming seriously demanding need superhero enter profession
Just look photo software engineering summer internship Photo courtesy Philip Guo Even though I hacking hardware simulator sound mildly I actually pretty squishy chillin cubicle often taking extended lunch break
All guy around yes programmer men exception one older woman hang u also fairly squishy
These guy made fine living good superheroes
The hardship one guy faced summer staying late playing rolling office next morning
Anyone enough practice motivation could done job programming job well
Seriously company looking hire next Steve want ship code work
It frustrates people majority demographic often need tough nail succeed field constantly bearing lasting effect thousand
according one researcher Mary Rowe In contrast people look like kinda programming work want switch later work quietly suck rock whatever
And nobody make remark appearance whether truly dedicated hacker behavior might reflect badly kind people
silent technical privilege
Ideally want spur interest young people underrepresented demographic might never otherwise think pursue CS STEM study
There great people organization working toward goal
Although I think increased broader participation critical immediate concern reducing attrition already field
For instance according That I plan start taking step encourage retain already want learn
So thought experiment For every white Asian male expert programmer know imagine parallel universe another ethnicity gender exact initial interest aptitude level
Would still willing devote hour deliberate practice achieve mastery face dozen hundred instance implicit discouragement would inevitably encounter year
Sure outlier would many would
Many u would quit even though potential interest thrive field
As older Black male life go extra mile reach others starting line I could prouder author empathy
I hope live future people already interest pursue CS programming field
I want people experience I privileged enough gotten college beyond unimpeded opportunity develop expertise something find beautiful practical fulfilling

Want watch later
In information technology used describe right user system granted perform particular action manipulate particular object
Jane work bank teller legal access
As teller key access privilege enter cubicle key enter bank server room vault access privilege
Her user privilege allow access cubicle alone
The server room vault important sensitive environment require higher level access privilege
For Jane access right key vault privilege would formally escalated
term used describe intrusion attack system cyber impersonator hacker online criminal
The intruder gain illicit access system engages activity capitalize programming error weakness system
These activity enable intruder achieve greater higher level access system data resource developer system administrator intended
Privilege escalation two stage process
First successful initial intrusion
access every level data resource automatically achieved stage activity privilege escalation attack engaged intruder allow achieve greater access
The initial intrusion may achieved number way
The intruder could access system using user account someone carelessly exposed username password use guest account
In case ordinary user enjoy low limited system access privilege
These limited privilege used gain complete control system data resource first step towards achieving
Once initial access achieved take skill malicious code gain escalated access ultimately complete system control
There two type privilege escalation attack horizontal vertical escalation
escalation intrusion attack system attacker gained access normal low access level account seek gain access similar access account
The initial access may necessarily accomplished illicitly
It could someone seeking exploit system using legal access
In instance intruder gain additional access privilege simply seek impersonate someone digitally gain access account
Get FREE access day create account
For example hacker access social medium platform legitimately signing later try use illicit technique gain access user account
If succeed executed horizontal escalation attack social medium platform
The attack horizontal traverse account similar privilege
escalation another type intrusion attack attacker gained limited privileged access system driven gain higher level access even complete control system
When attacker able elevate user access level access higher administrative superuser access level carried vertical escalation attack
An example would Jane bank teller achieving access server room vault stealing key bank manager
Those determined exploit computer system never satisfied
Their limitation lack capability skill
Once attacker gain access system may use tool technique capitalize existing weakness flaw system
This enables achieve higher level access system data application resource order carry malicious exploit
This attack known privilege escalation
They two form escalation limited lateral low access level attack transcend higher user access level ultimately facilitate complete system control

Privileged instruction instruction usually executed operating system specific mode
An instruction statement acted upon computer language
Examples privileged instruction used include operation involving management coordinated effort provide sufficient memory process computer system
The existence privileged instruction specifically allow operating system perform certain operation allowed perform
To allow privileged instruction mode added computer software indicate one two dual mode monitor mode user mode
The privileged instruction executed running monitor supervisor mode mode enables execution instruction
Thus operating system contains routine execute particular privileged instruction
The monitor mode normal operating state computer
If attempt made execute privileged instruction user state microprocessor execute instruction
The user mode least privileged state state application program run

designed collaborative research communication effort establish comprehensive understanding nation current high school computer science CS teaching population support context teach
The study five major component Professional Development PD Landscape Study Teacher Capacity Study Stories Field CS Schools Study Design Studio
While component study examined independently considered together complement providing broad view issue affecting CS education viewed lens different stakeholder
The study includes perspective teacher PD provider school administrator community leader others
This section highlight five major challenge repeatedly surfaced across five study component
The order challenge presented indication importance priority important consider effort improve state CS education
Computer science commonly accepted definition teacher student school leader PD provider interpret different way
Some view computer science computer application others consider programming still others describe logic modeling
These different point view contribute lack coherence instructional resource support provided teacher inconsistency instruction information communicated parent policy decision made school administrator
These different point view make challenging set goal metric necessary spread CS teaching learning leading intentionality clarity
Recommendation The CS education community need come agreement worth knowing CS learned student academic career
It invest development robust measure student learning use help describe quality CS teaching learning look like
While effort establish standard CS education widely embraced standard one piece needed
To build foundation CS education community need develop widely agreed upon standard student CS learning way measure
This would guide CS educator toward quality curriculum assessment professional development teaching practice turn enable clearly communicate advocate CS education
Instructional resource refers coherent set curriculum pedagogical resource inform instruction teacher knowledge student progress
CS teacher access range quality instructional resource teacher subject enjoy
Recommendation Support development comprehensive instructional material
Like subject many case even student entering CS course typically bring vastly different background level experience
A variety instructional resource support school teacher making decision best meet need CS student
These instructional material reflect growing knowledge student learn informed knowledge design implementation instructional resource large scale though research needed aspect
In discipline instructional material help student learn also help teacher improve practice
Instructional material support specific teacher professional development provide teacher assessment tool inform teaching daily basis
There little incentive school district include CS course
There requirement college level state requirement basic course material computer expensive purchase maintain
The decision include CS course fall individual school district level
Coupled lack instructional material result vastly different experience student across country
CS course also tend ephemeral leaving school funding reduced CS teacher leave school phenomenon directly tied CS course lack priority
Recommendation Establish policy enable school district prioritize CS coursework student access quality CS education
These policy developed careful consideration student learning requirement student schedule pay careful attention change management issue arise within school result implementation
There pathway become CS teacher
Furthermore little incentive teacher commit teaching CS school district generally prioritize CS coursework
Individuals CS experience many career option teaching
Those interest teaching find resource education leading certification support related subject mathematics
Recommendation In short medium term develop deploy strategy help existing teacher become excellent CS teacher
In long term one expect CS course prioritized accompanied robust standard curriculum teacher professional development CS teaching emerge viable path
These change may increase number teacher entering CS teaching career
CS teacher colleague close share idea information discipline provide instructional support coaching
The lack colleague collaborator source new information CS instruction compounded low prioritization CS school lack instructional material lack criterion quality CS instruction
This make improving instruction difficult affect motivation
Recommendation Dedicate resource build sustain online network CS teaching learning leading including teacher school PD provider
If well designed network potential support improvement across school district state line
September To Computer Science Education Community It privilege pleasure engage computer science community developing component study Building Operating System Computer Science This community strikingly thoughtful committed seemingly tireless effort bring quality computer science education student
We hopeful work done create foundation next step continue work within community realize goal
We came work collective decade experience mathematics science education teaching research evaluation administration scientific research little knowledge computer science education computer science education community
We deeply appreciate community willingness orient u key information issue concern get u back track strayed forthcoming knowledge experience essential ensuring effort would valuable
This kind collaboration openness taken granted appreciate support community provided
As reflect particular piece work come close look forward continuing work inspiring community
Over next month year hope u keep following mind History show destructive debate content pedagogy mathematics teaching learning stifled progress school student
Likewise science education suffered lack prioritization insufficient clarity purpose
The computer science community avoid similar history bringing clear coherent committed message computer science education policy maker public decision maker
A unified voice aligned action aspect community practicing scientist researcher university faculty teacher foundation corporate interest essential
Computer science education beginning take benefitting population enamored part technology industry much like science education moved public consciousness Sputnik
With support may easier convince district state give computer science education attention
More attention however equal higher quality sometimes work
It essential define quality computer science education look like shared way measure develop common language communicate
Without clarity others bring meaning agenda discussion
There groundswell energy commitment momentum computer science teaching learning leading
Having watched trend come go discipline see unprecedented opportunity establish norm computer science education
Given newness discipline setting right foundation pave way tremendous gain future something contemporary mathematics science education community never opportunity
Our hope research useful community
We welcome comment question time look forward continuing work move computer science education agenda forward

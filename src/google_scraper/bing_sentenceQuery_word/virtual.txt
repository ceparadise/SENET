In computing computer system
Virtual machine based provide functionality physical computer
Their implementation may involve specialized hardware software combination
There different kind virtual machine different function Some virtual machine designed also emulate different architecture allow execution software application operating system written another architecture
allows resource computer partitioned via support multiple isolated instance usually called may look feel like real machine
A VM originally defined efficient isolated duplicate real computer machine
Current use includes virtual machine direct correspondence real hardware
The desire run multiple operating system initial motive virtual machine allow among several operating system
In respect system virtual machine considered generalization concept historically preceded
IBM first system allow implemented providing user operating system CMS
Unlike virtual memory system virtual machine entitled user write privileged instruction code
This approach certain advantage adding device allowed standard system
As technology evolves virtual memory purpose virtualization new system may applied manage memory sharing among multiple virtual machine one computer operating system
It may possible share identical content among multiple virtual machine run physical machine may result mapping physical page technique termed
This especially useful page holding code segment case multiple virtual machine running similar software software library web server middleware component etc
The guest operating system need compliant host hardware thus making possible run different operating system computer prior version operating system support future software
The use virtual machine support separate guest operating system popular regard
A typical use would run simultaneously preferred complex operating system Linux Windows
Another use would novel unproven software still developmental stage run inside
Virtual machine advantage operating system development may include improved debugging access faster reboots
Multiple VMs running guest operating system frequently engaged server consolidation
A process VM sometimes called MRE run normal application inside host OS support single process
It created process started destroyed exit
Its purpose provide programming environment abstract away detail underlying hardware operating system allows program execute way platform
A process VM provides abstraction compared ISA abstraction system VM
Process VMs implemented using performance comparable compiled programming language achieved use
This type VM become popular implemented using
Other example include run VM called
All serve computer language
A special case process VMs system abstract communication mechanism potentially heterogeneous
Such VM consist single process one process per physical machine cluster
They designed ease task programming concurrent application letting programmer focus algorithm rather communication mechanism provided interconnect OS
They hide fact communication take place attempt present cluster single machine
Unlike process VMs system provide specific programming language embedded existing language typically system provides binding several language
Examples PVM MPI
They strictly virtual machine application running top still access OS service therefore confined system model
Both system virtual machine process virtual machine date continue area active development
grew notably implemented CTSS
allowed multiple user use computer program appeared full access machine one program executed time system switching program time slice saving restoring state time
This evolved virtual machine notably via IBM research system used used early example
The first widely available virtual machine architecture see detail
An important distinction using multiple virtual machine one host system using one virtual machine host system prototyping SIMMON
hardware emulation earlier system compatibility date back software emulation simulation predates
arose originally abstract platform used program early example date around
An early example virtual machine executes object code emitted compiler
This abstraction allowed compiler easily ported new architecture implementing new took existing compiled machine code underlying physical machine
The language used similar design intermediate language named portable
This popularized around notably system compiler termed resulting machine
This influential virtual machine sense often generally called machine
In addition intermediate language Pascal also executed directly interpreter implementing virtual machine notably influenced later interpreter notably JVM
Another early example written SNOBOL Implementation Language SIL assembly language virtual machine targeted physical machine transpiling native assembler via
Macros since fallen favor however approach le influential
Process virtual machine popular approach implementing early microcomputer software including adventure game implementation engine like argues possibly portable virtual machine ever created
Significant advance occurred implementation particularly implementation pushed forward implementation approach us process virtual machine
Later notable Smalltalk VMs
A related language produced lot virtual machine innovation programming language pioneered
These technique proved commercially successful Java virtual machine
Other innovation include virtual machine better match underlying hardware rather virtual machine closer match programming language pioneered language
In full virtualization virtual machine simulates enough hardware allow unmodified guest OS one designed run isolation
This approach pioneered IBM predecessor family
Examples outside mainframe field include discontinued formerly called GSX Server vBlade technology
In virtualization hardware provides architectural support facilitates building virtual machine monitor allows guest OSes run isolation
virtualization first introduced IBM use first virtual machine operating system
In provided additional hardware support virtualization
Sun Microsystems added similar feature processor
Examples virtualization platform adapted hardware include
In hardware support found rarely offer performance advantage software virtualization
In virtualization physical server virtualized operating system level enabling multiple isolated secure virtualized server run single physical server
The guest operating system environment share running instance operating system host system
Thus also used implement guest environment application running given guest environment view system
The pioneer implementation example include AIX Parallels Virtuozzo Containers

Virtual reality mean creating immersive environment convincing user react way would real life
The idea block sensory input outside use visual auditory cue make virtual world seem real
While concept simple actually building virtual reality system proven difficult recently
The big difference sensory deprivation say game developer Eric Giz Gewirtz chief creative officer Seismic Games Los Angeles
You susceptible real experience primitive level tuning everything
The term virtual reality date back far though case referring theater
In Morton Hellig cinematographer invented machine called Sensorama
The machine used wraparound screen viewed device get effect seat moved vent blow air viewer stereo sound simulate activity like riding motorcycle
The Sensorama remained novelty though
Once modern computer appeared along television early movie science fiction writer picked possibility creating environment would look feel real Ray Bradbury short story The Veldt describes nursery run artificial intelligence run amok
That concept virtual reality world mimic reality one earliest instance concept recognize today
Yet meaning virtual reality enter popular lexicon
Science fiction author William Gibson one early popularizer term famously novel Neuromancer
Even clear concept simulating world Bradbury Gibson Star Trek holodecks
Better computer sophisticated graphic processor got video game designer interested making game real
A famous example Atari Battlezone version involved looking viewer
Virtual reality headset would wait
Sega tried introducing one managed get arcade
The headset could track user motion keep field view aligned head would virtual landscape
The headset called Sega VR failed break home market however
Even military got act Department Defense attempted use virtual reality simulation pilot training
It turned traditional flight simulator superior people using VR headset would get nauseous
Virtual reality headset seemed go way earlier gimmick like Oculus VR built Oculus Rift HTC created Vive
Both new headset considerable advance earlier effort
The visuals realistic design headset better blocking outside stimulus
Gewirtz add dealing nausea go long way well
Changing frame rate animation helped well designing movement gradual
It lateral movement say
Your eye telling one thing brain via balance sensor inner ear telling something else
That said new headset got better part focused hearing sight two sens people engaged
Early idea virtual reality included suit still people working
In general though technology gotten smaller portable
We really gone opposite direction full suit Gewirtz say though possible could change future
This make current VR different even earlier video game allowed sit pilot seat since distraction outside world
Those game always quietly aware booth Gewirtz say
Virtual reality offer option game developer even best ordinary console game
Since VR headset track one eye focused allows character make eye contact
That provokes visceral response player
character also feel closer
They invasion personal space Gewirtz say That make people uncomfortable
Another thing virtual reality simulate somewhere else also known telepresence
One could imagine making environment simulates mountaintop example offering kind vicarious travel peak Everest Grand Canyon
Already Oculus VR showcasing Oculus Rift conjunction HBO Ascend Wall traveling exhibit us Rift simulation capability give fan experience riding elevator top foot wall ice
The possibility endless Gewirtz say
There real language making interactive content VR
No one know like traditional cinema game

In sometimes produce
In general sense object code sequence instruction computer language usually language intermediate language RTL
Object file turn form
In order used object code must either placed executable file library file
Object code portion machine code yet linked complete program
It machine code one particular library module make completed product
It may also contain placeholder offset found machine code completed program linker use connect everything together
Whereas machine code binary code executed directly CPU object code jump partially parameterized linker fill
An used convert machine code object code
A linker link several object library file generate executable
Assemblers also assemble directly machine code executable file without object intermediary step

In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

Source code object code refer version computer compiled see ready run computer
The source code consists programming statement created programmer visual programming tool saved file
For example programmer using language type desired sequence C language statement using text editor save named file
This file said contain source code
It ready compiled C compiler resulting output compiled file often referred object code
The object code file contains sequence processor understand difficult human read modify
For reason even debugged program often need later enhancement source code permanent form program
When purchase receive operating system application software usually form compiled object code source code included
Proprietary software vendor usually want try improve code since may created additional service cost
Lately movement develop software example improvement anyone want improve source code provided
In large program development environment often management system help programmer separate keep track different state level code file
For noncompiled interpreted program language term apply since one form code

Learn something new every day email Computers machine run million line code
Programmers write code various language code basic feature matter language used
A program always two set code
Source code created beforehand language us give instruction computer order make program run
The result compiler compiling source code instruction called object code
The term intuitive source code beginning source operation object code desired result object whole exercise
It stored file created computer compiler become ultimate end intended programmer
Once source code compiled file continue computer processor executes final instruction
Commonly available software application huge collection object code altered fundamentally since source code included
It like solution problem step used arrive
Changing code without source code exercise frustration
This process needed computer execute instruction written machine language
That ultimate result executed version object code
So consumer get software application consumer getting executed version source code became machine language transformed final project
Given current emphasis code application released avenue source code
Diligent programmer coder access source code change around meet need create new object code fulfills purpose may different intended original programmer
Mammmood They totally different
Object code refers binary created compiled code
Object oriented coding style programming organizes program logic object easily manipulated
All program compile object code source code follows object oriented programming style
NathanG What difference object code object oriented coding
Are
There reason anyone mess object code opinion
My first introduction computer programming involved VBA code I mess compiled code way
Then I got C could see resulting object file created code
It nice see compiled object I suppose ultimately thing matter end final executable program
Even today someone post open source project online I prefer download completed binary file rather try recompile code native compiler
One editor review suggestion make change warranted
Note depending number suggestion receive take anywhere hour day
Thank helping improve wiseGEEK

Source code list instruction programmer word processing developing program
The source code run turn machine code also called object code computer understand execute
Object code consists primarily
Source code object code state computer program compiled
Programming language compile code include C Delphi Swift Fortran Haskell Pascal many others
Here example C language source code You computer programmer tell code something printing Hello World
Of course source code much complex example
It unusual software program million line code
Windows operating system reported million line code
Source code either proprietary open
Many company closely guard source code
Users use compiled code see modify
Microsoft Office example proprietary source code
Other company post code internet free anyone download
Apache OpenOffice example open source software code
Some programming language JavaScript compiled machine code instead
In case distinction source code object code apply one code
That single code source code read copied
In case developer code may intentionally encrypt prevent viewing
Programming language interpreted include Python Java Ruby Perl PHP Postscript VBScript many others
There error
Please try

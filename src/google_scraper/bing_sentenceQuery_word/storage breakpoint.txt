Breakpoint Definition A point program reached trigger event
Breakpoints usually used either pause program execution dump value program variable
Breakpoints may part program may set programmer

There many programming language

A program usually included within
If section code give different result would expect try make section code work isolation
You may give value make work
If something find section code responsible make sure running expect
If something happening find section code make particular thing happen
When computer program expect likely designed flawed
Go back algorithm separate part see relates program created
Being able see happening inside program useful debugging
You use print statement see value held variable remove later use specifically designed debugging tool
Python includes logging module allows print value analyse error
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip

In intentional stopping pausing place put place purpose
It also sometimes simply referred
More generally breakpoint mean acquiring knowledge program execution
During inspects test log etc
find whether program functioning expected
In practice breakpoint consists one condition determine program execution interrupted
Breakpoints commonly used interrupt running program immediately execution
This often referred
Other kind condition also used reading writing modification specific location area memory
This often referred
Breakpoints also used interrupt execution particular time upon keystroke etc
When breakpoint hit various tool used inspect state program alter
may used see chain call led paused instruction
A list allows one view value selected
There may also tool show content loaded program information
Many include support breakpoints typically instruction data breakpoints
As example instruction set architecture provides hardware support breakpoints
Such hardware may include limitation example allowing breakpoints instruction located
This kind limitation imposed processor varies processor processor
Without hardware support multitasking environment implement breakpoints software
For instruction breakpoints comparatively simple task replacing instruction location breakpoint either This technique may difficult implement multitasking system using shared program storage interrupt may occur different thread requiring resurrection original instruction thread
Also program resides protected memory overwriting instruction may prevented
Alternatively Some debugger allow register program variable memory modified resuming effectively allowing introduction temporary assignment test purpose
Similarly program instruction often skipped determine effect change program logic enabling question program execution answered direct way
without assumption guesswork
In many case may practical method testing obscure error subroutine rarely ever get executed without added risk leaving temporary source change
Manually changing resume location within paused program used enter otherwise rarely executed section code specific hardware condition handler
Implementing data breakpoints software however greatly reduce performance application debugged since using additional resource processor
However normally acceptable testing amount information available debugger restricted limitation debug data known hardware
For instance software implementation collect logical path data level considerably augment might stored particular hardware platform inspection
The instruction set simulation method considerably reduces overhead compared repeated instruction replacement method also reducing
Some programming language implementation debugging function use program
For example dialect statement originally intended act instruction breakpoint
implement debugger accessible Python program
These facility abused act like statement
Breakpoints invented one earliest digital computer programmer
Early mainframe computer console allowed breakpoints specific instruction storage address provided single cycle operation permitting content register memory observed directly console light
The advent multitasking limited use option since entire machine halted
Programmers used machine code patch implement single destructive breakpoints cause since early day computer
The core dump provided state register memory exact moment deliberate crash
The advent console allowed interactive debugging capability early arrival ubiquitous connected fully interactive full screen debugging multitasking environment became reality
This also permitted program execution true manner optional register memory alteration simultaneously displayed
Initially type animation level machine code later advanced source level animation

I implemented Memory Read Access hardware breakpoint C code
It work perfect provides next instruction memory read
I using BeaEngine disassemble instruction
I need find previous executed instruction effectively one accessed memory question For example like Cheat Engine
How I accomplish
This tricky question
On platform maximum length instruction byte
You read byte backwards current EIP pas function BeaEngine
This return length disassembled instruction
If equal found previous instruction
If le pas byte le byte length buffer passed BeaEngine equal length disassembled instruction
This represented pseudo code Note algorithm generic nature
use find previously executed instruction given current
This work execution sequence linear without jump
In case hardware breakpoints access execution sequence linear algorithm applicable
Even case hardware breakpoints access execution sequence may linear following case A hardware breakpoint read set
In case hwbp would hit
If use algorithm previously executed instruction turn incorrect
For case use instruction tracing memory breakpoints

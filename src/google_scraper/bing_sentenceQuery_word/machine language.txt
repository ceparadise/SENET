set executed directly CPU
Each instruction performs specific task load operation unit data memory
Every program directly executed CPU made series instruction
The phrase executed need qualification machine code definition lowest level programming detail visible programmer internally many processor use optimise transform machine code instruction sequence sophisticated way
Numerical machine code may regarded representation primitive
While possible write program directly numerical machine code tedious error prone manage individual bit calculate numerical address constant manually
For reason program almost never written directly machine code modern context
Three exception low level program would called absence assembly machine language available
All practical program today written assembly language
The source code translated executable machine code utility important exception program translated machine code
However may seen executor processor performing instruction source code typically consists directly executable machine code generated assembly source code
Every processor processor family machine code
Instructions pattern physical design correspond different command machine
Thus instruction set specific class processor using mostly architecture
Successor derivative processor design often include instruction predecessor may add additional instruction
Occasionally successor design discontinue alter meaning instruction code typically needed new purpose affecting code compatibility extent even nearly completely compatible processor may show slightly different behavior instruction rarely problem
Systems may also differ detail memory arrangement operating system
Because program normally relies factor different system typically run machine code even type processor used
A machine code instruction set may instruction length may instruction
How pattern organized varies strongly particular architecture often also type instruction
Most instruction one field specifies basic instruction type arithmetic logical etc
actual operation add compare field may give type addressing offset index actual value constant operand contained instruction called
Not machine individual instruction explicit operand
An combined left operand result implicit accumulator arithmetic instruction
Other architecture accumulator version common instruction accumulator regarded one general register longer instruction
A operand implicit stack
Special purpose instruction also often lack explicit operand CPUID architecture writes value four implicit destination register instance
This distinction explicit implicit operand important code generator especially register allocation live range tracking part
A good code optimizer track implicit well explicit operand may allow frequent register register assigned result constant expression freed replacing constant code enhancement
A computer program sequence instruction executed CPU
While simple processor execute instruction one another processor capable executing several instruction
may influenced special instruction transfer execution instruction numerically following one
taken execution continues another address execution continues next instruction depending condition
A much readable rendition machine language called us refer machine code instruction rather using instruction numeric value directly
For example processor machine code cause CPU decrement would represented assembly language
The provides specific example machine code whose instruction always bit long
The general type instruction given operation field highest bit
jump immediate instruction fully specified
register instruction include additional field determine exact operation
The field used type indicate register operand give shift amount field contain operand directly
For example adding register placing result register encoded Load value register taken memory cell cell location listed register Jumping address In machine code implemented even fundamental underlying layer called providing common machine language interface across line family different model computer widely different underlying
This done facilitate machine language program different model
An example use IBM family computer successor
With dataflow path width bit bit beyond nevertheless present common architecture machine language level across entire line
Using microcode implement enables computer present architecture entirely different computer
The line used allow porting program earlier IBM machine new family computer
emulator IBM model
Machine code generally different also known either executed interpreter compiled machine code faster direct execution
An exception processor designed use particular bytecode directly machine code case
Machine code assembly code sometimes called referring part language feature library
The computer architecture physically separate storage signal pathway code instruction
Today processor implement separate signal pathway performance reason actually implement support task like loading program data executing
Harvard architecture contrasted data code stored memory read processor allowing computer execute command
From point view part code execution stored
In system comprises program usually
In environment different thread one process share code space along data space reduces overhead considerably compared process switching

Out universal programming language machine language basic
Computers incapable understanding syntax communication system machine code entirely composed numerical value
Practically every family processor adheres specifically configured set instruction laid machine code
Every minor actionable component make overall functioning machine dictated unique arrangement basic unit
Each basic informational unit composing pattern represent machine actionable item binary nature either one two value either
The core instruction set machine code configuration attached processor class
Because structural configuration processor class generally match unique instruction set processor model generally adhere machine code instruction set predecessor derived
When come length machine code instruction may varying arrangement within different instruction set
Some machine code instruction set made instruction share identical length one another instruction code set made instruction varying length
The instruction length factor machine code set generally depend upon unique construction processor generally determined whatever opstring put place
An opstring also referred operation code determines exact operation collectively carried machine code instruction
In addition operation operational code determines exact category instruction set determine length instruction contained within
In modern field mainstream program writing customary project written language advanced tier machine code
Typically higher language level modern programmer employ create program
Assembly language le exhaustive read basic machine code
Following execution assembly language linkers compiler employed convert assembled source code actionable machine form
By nature machine code collectively composed great many small individual numerical component
Attempting successfully compose program machine language alone necessitates programmer numerical address calculation airtight
Because particularly large margin error exceedingly rare program written exclusively machine code
Machine language essentially bare bone foundation upon programmable execution built upon
Though programmer may needed accept difficulty micromanaging great mass small numerical value making machine code instruction modern assembly language technology streamlined process great degree

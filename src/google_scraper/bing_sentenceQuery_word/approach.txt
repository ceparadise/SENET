In woman made computer science graduate


Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I encounter term principled approach computer science
Since I native speaker I quite understand mean
And I find result online
I sure site appropriate question
Please let know I posted wrong place
A approach least way I exposed term implies due care diligence regard rigor discipline used material context
A paper describes principled approach would one presenting procedure execution evaluation given subject matter
For example I picked paper titled principled approach algorithm selection implementation I would expect content paper clearly enumerate system algorithm analysis exhaustive supporting documentation
Conversely paper us principled approach would one follows detailed rigorous methodology data collected research may considered functionally bias low probability corruption inaccuracy
I mathematics similar language used roughly similarly I believe
As answer principled approach science least approach latter three synonymous expression meaning priority getting result perhaps even finding rationalization conclusion one
Obviously approach lends corrupted also quick desired easy result
The principled approach take high road bias conclusion weakness flaw methodology information
That one could hope principled approach involves conflict interest party involved could trusted
At worst unprincipled approach one would ever admit except perhaps mildly perverse claim fresh unorthodoxy produce completely untrustworthy outcome outcome chosen advance whatever result obtained interpreted support original premise
A hilarious example I witnessed computer science
detail elided protect privacy I outside examiner goal prove two bunch event correlated thus proving people promoting one cause right people invest product
Nevermind correlation causality
The guy failed find correlation first twenty statistical test applied kept found statistical test seem assert slight correlation
Of course proven apparently correlation taking unprincipled approach claimed opposite evidence showed etc
By posting answer agree

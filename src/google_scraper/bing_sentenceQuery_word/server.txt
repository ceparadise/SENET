Servers computer
There different type capability server
Think transportation
We think transportation anything move something someone one location
A bicycle move one person car move people bus move people plane move people
They mode transport different capacity
The applies server
There server varying type capacity discussed lesson
When working computer many service computer may need different type server available
We discus basic server type next section
A server contains file made accessible client network
A file server sole responsibility storing managing set file made accessible computer
These file shared among client network allowing access without physically transfer accessed file local system
A server dedicated printer connected accessible client network
Other client network local printer print work printer print server
A server equipped HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol unique domain name serf web page response request submitted client
For example type browser client effect requesting web page stored server domain named called homepage
In response request respective web server locates homepage page system display
If erroneously type age server return error message saying web page found
Well familiar
An responsible storing managing application organization user database backend business application
If visited bank withdraw money accessed bank application server service attending teller
The teller machine banking application access bank application server retrieve bank account detail facilitate transaction
Now real world really two main type server
A system setup serve sophisticated specially designed operating system server software server hardware
To understand better let u revisit definition server
To recap
A server computer equipped specific program hardware enable offer service computer client network connected
A home computer desktop operating system storage capacity memory computer connected containing number file configured share file computer network act file server
On hand big software company designed desktop operating system developed server operating system
The difference desktop operating system good handful computer within geographical location dealing corporate entity sensitive application file thousand login client world little desktop operating system match handling level availability efficiency expected
That server operating system designed handle
Get FREE access day create account
Server operating system designed deal large capacity
A typical server operating system comfortably handle concurrent connection time
Server operating system robust specially built handle withstand demand well numerous security risk concurrent connection pose
strong able bodied men easily defend village square mile people
Those men hand match level threat nation million people living geographical area square mile
Like desktop file server discussed earlier applicable software configured server also applicable hardware configured serve server
But special hardware developed server
For example home computer functioning server stay online long power supply stay functional
In event power source experience fault whole computer go offline client lose access
Well specially built server hardware built differently
The server hardware redundant power supply
This array concurrent power supply
If one power supply fails computer continues functioning normally concurrent client experience interruption
Similar technology applied hard drive key component
computer designed software offer computer network
There different type server determined service offer including Server operating system hardware offer robust sophisticated service ordinary client counterpart match
A typical server operating system comfortably handle concurrent connection time

In provides functionality program device called
This called single overall computation distributed across multiple process device
Servers provide various functionality often called service sharing data among multiple client performing computation client
A single server serve multiple client single client use multiple server
A client process may run device may connect network server different device
Typical server
system today frequently implemented often identified model client sends request server performs action sends response back client typically result acknowledgement
Designating computer hardware implies specialized running server
This often implies powerful reliable standard alternatively large may composed many relatively simple replaceable server component
The use word computing come date mid century notably used along service paper introduced
In earlier paper concrete term telephone operator used
In computing server date least one earliest document describing predecessor contrasted user distinguishing two type
The use serving also date early document contrasting
The defines common sense process performing service request usually remote version reading SERVER A kind performs service requester often run computer one server run
Strictly speaking term refers running program
Through refers device used device dedicated running one several server program
On network device called
In addition word noun verb frequently used though
The word noun may refer either abstract form functionality

Alternatively may refer computer program turn computer server

Originally used server serve user user use server sense obey today one often say server serve data sense give
For instance serve web page user service request
The server part model server serf data
The nature communication client server
This contrast model relationship reciprocation
In principle computerized process used called another process particularly remotely particularly share resource server calling process process client
Thus general purpose computer connected network host server
For example file device shared process process
Similarly software capable computer personal computer host web server
While common design others
In pattern client register server subscribing specified type message initial registration may done
Thereafter server forward matching message client request server message client rather client message server
When referring hardware word typically designates computer model specialized role
In general server performs role better generic
The purpose server share data well share distribute work
A server computer serve computer program well depending scenario could part transaction simply technical possibility
The following table show several scenario server used
Almost entire structure based upon model
router direct traffic internet
There million server connected Internet running continuously throughout world virtually every action taken ordinary user requires one interaction one server
There exception use dedicated server example implementation

requirement server vary widely depending server purpose software
Since server usually accessed network many run unattended without input device audio hardware interface
Many server GUI
They configured managed remotely
Remote management conducted via various method including MMC system Dell HP
Large traditional single server would need run long period without interruption
would high making hardware reliability durability extremely important
enterprise server would use specialized hardware low order maximize
might incorporated insure power failure
Servers typically include hardware dual system along extensive memory testing verification
Critical component might allowing technician replace running server without shutting guard overheating server might powerful fan use
They often able configured powered rebooted remotely using typically based
Server casing usually designed
These type server often housed dedicated
These normally stable power Internet increased security
Noise also le concern power consumption heat output serious issue
Server room equipped air conditioning device
A collection computer server maintained organization supply server functionality far beyond capability single device
Modern often built large cluster much simpler server collaborative effort around concept
A class small specialist server called generally low end scale often smaller common desktop computer
On Internet dominant operating system among server based also significant share
Proprietary operating system also deployed much smaller number
Specialist operating system traditionally feature In practice today many desktop server operating system share similar differing mostly configuration
In data center server cooling electrical infrastructure responsible electrical energy consumption worldwide United States
One estimate total energy consumption information communication technology save time rest economy enabling efficiency

architecture many remote processor request receive service centralized host computer
Client computer provide interface allow computer user request service server display result server return
Servers wait request arrive client respond
Ideally server provides standardized transparent interface client client need aware specific system providing service
Clients often situated server located elsewhere network usually powerful machine
This computing model especially effective client server distinct task routinely perform
In example client computer running application program entering patient information server computer running another program manages information permanently stored
Many client access server information simultaneously time client computer perform task sending
Because client server computer considered intelligent device model completely different old model centralized mainframe computer performed task associated dumb terminal

If interest computer hardware software sure career path choose probably want learn information technology IT computer science
These two rewarding career require slightly different set skill appeal somewhat different type person
An IT career involves installing organizing maintaining computer system well designing operating network database
Computer science focused entirely efficiently programming computer using mathematical algorithm
An IT career necessarily require computer science CS degree although CS degree open certain door otherwise available
IT professional typically work business environment installing internal network computer system perhaps programming
Computer scientist work wider range environment ranging business university video game design company
Both career excellent growth potential high salary software developer somewhat ahead IT professional earnings
A computer science degree give student rigorous education discrete mathematics computer science theory
Most CS graduate go become software developer Web programmer continue schooling chance research work specialized role advanced artificial intelligence programming
With CS degree student find employment programmer software engineer IT professional
However become software developer graduate usually must teach quite bit programming
A CS education prepares student choose correct design pattern algorithm data structure program student graduate knowing one two programming language usually Python Java
For corporate programming job alone may suffice professional software developer know several language including HTML CSS JavaScript MySQL PHP Python Java
Software developer job projected grow well average
In median annual salary developer percent making least
With IT degree graduate find work number occupation including information security network architecture database administration system administration computer support
However job require advanced computer science programming knowledge graduate must enroll specialized program take elective course
For example information security requires knowledge discrete math algorithm database administration requires knowledge programming
Also information security analyst usually certification ISC CISSP
In general IT professional need stay abreast new technology must familiar use operating system server software including Linux Apache OpenSSL Windows Server Oracle MySQL Microsoft SQL Server
percent next ten year salary ranging depending experience level education
While IT CS degree lead similar job difference two quite pronounced
IT professional enjoy installing computer system using software maintaining network database computer scientist enjoy mathematics software design
In general relationship information technology quite close interdependent

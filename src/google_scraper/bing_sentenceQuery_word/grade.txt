Think example
A computer scientist want sort card
First sort suit
Then order number Jack Queen King Ace
There many way sort card
By deciding set step sort card created algorithm
After making algorithm scientist need test whether algorithm work
Then scientist see well algorithm sort card
A simple slow algorithm could drop card pick check whether sorted
If
This method work take long time
A better algorithm would finding first card smallest suit smallest number diamond putting start
After look second card
This work much faster need much space
This sorting algorithm name selection sort

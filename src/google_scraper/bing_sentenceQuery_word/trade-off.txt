A situational decision involves diminishing losing one quality quantity property set design return gain aspect
In simple term tradeoff one thing increase another must decrease
Tradeoffs stem limitation many origin including simple physic instance certain volume object fit given space full container must remove item order accept vessel carry large item multiple small item
Tradeoffs also commonly refer different configuration single item tuning string guitar enable different note played well allocation time attention towards different task
The concept tradeoff implies tactical strategic choice made full comprehension advantage disadvantage setup
An economic example decision invest stock risky carry great potential return versus bond generally safer lower potential return
The term also used widely evolutionary context case process reference decisive factor
In concept tradeoff constraint often closely related
In commonly expressed term one potential choice loss best available alternative
An opportunity cost example individual would decision worker take time work salary attend medical school annual tuition
If assume sake simplicity medical school allows study individual considering stopping work would face going medical school earning work going medical school losing salary pay tuition
The concept often used describe situation everyday life
The old saying put egg one basket implies respect one buy composed many rather one stock may higher expected value return
Similarly trash can used inside taken street emptied Dumpster small large
A large trash need taken Dumpster often may become heavy full user risk strain back injury moving
The choice waste receptacle frequency needing take trash Dumpster versus ease safety use
In case food waste second present large trash can likely sit long time kitchen leading higher level decomposing food indoors potential pest attraction
With small trash taken Dumpster often thus eliminating persist rot attracts pest
Of course user large trashcan could carry outside frequently anyway heavier would weigh user would think take confine schedule compared smaller evidently full take taking
In cold climate finger compartment serve well keep hand warm arrangement also confines finger movement prevents full range hand function glove separate finger drawback keep finger warm mitten
As mitten glove warmth versus dexterity
In like fashion warm coat often bulky hence impede freedom movement wearer
Thin coat worn winter sport athlete give wearer freedom movement warm
When copying music computer format used routinely save space information thrown away detriment
scheme take much disc space affect sound quality much thus providing better sound
Large car carry many people five since larger crumple zone may safer accident
However also tend heavy often hence relatively poor
Small car like carry two people light weight mean fuel efficient
At time smaller size weight small car mean smaller crumple zone mean occupant le protected case accident
In addition small car accident larger heavier car occupant smaller car fare poorly
Thus car size large versus small involves multiple tradeoff regarding passenger capacity accident safety fuel economy
In athletics demand different physical attribute running
As two contest distinct event competition pursuit feature distinct team athlete
Whether professional runner better suited marathon running versus sprinting based runner morphology physiology variation type well runner individual interest preference factor
This tradeoff chiefly perspective sport recruiter decides role prospective athlete would best suit team
In expressed term particular choice loss preferred alternative given
A tradeoff involves sacrifice must made obtain certain product service experience rather others could made obtained using required resource
For example person going basketball game opportunity cost loss alternative watching particular television program home
If basketball game occurs working hour opportunity cost would several hour lost work would need take time work
Many factor affect tradeoff environment within particular country including availability raw material skilled labor force machinery producing product technology capital market rate produce product reasonable time scale forth
A economics often illustrated graphically named economist show greatest least amount one thing attained various given amount
As example production theory output one good output another illustrated graphically
The Pareto frontier also used
In includes show highest level expected return portfolio could given particular level risk measured portfolio return
In tradeoff occur beneficial change one trait linked detrimental change another trait
Tradeoffs important engineering
For example used trade desirable property improved gain bias point immunity reduction
In tradeoff example may include maturity parental care mate choice
For example higher fecundity number offspring lower parental care offspring receive
Parental care function fecundity would show negative sloped linear graph
A related phenomenon known demographic compensation arises different component specie survival growth fecundity etc show negative across
For example survival may higher towards northern edge distribution fecundity growth increase towards south leading compensation allows specie persist along environmental gradient
Contrasting trend life cycle component may arise tradeoff also independent opposite response environmental condition
In tradeoff viewed tool trade
A program often run faster us memory
Consider following example The Software Engineering Institute specific method analysing tradeoff called Architectural Tradeoff Analysis Method ATAM
Strategy often involve tradeoff example might trade pawn improved position
In scenario chess player might even tradeoff loss valuable piece even Queen protect King
In might trade
often involves competing interest must traded interest different people different principle
ethical use information resulting treat disease today
In patient physician often faced difficult decision involving tradeoff
One example localized patient need weigh possibility prolonged life expectancy possible stressful unpleasant treatment
Governmental tradeoff among controversial political social difficulty time
All politics viewed series tradeoff based upon core value core people politician
also involve tradeoff may energize alienate
With work schedule employee often use tradeoff work period compressed narrow group hour working day traditional working day allowing employee take every second Friday

Starting Tutorials Practice Resources References Getting Help A lot computer science
For instance one frequently used mechanism measuring theoretical speed algorithm
What people realize however often I like call tradeoff
Think space efficiency time efficiency two opposite end band continuum
Every point two end certain time space efficiency
The time efficiency le space efficiency vice versa
The picture illustrates simple fashion Algorithms like exceedingly fast require lot space operation
On side spectrum exceedingly slow take minimum space
Sometimes tweak algorithm change amount space time traded
instance implemented way allows done making space speed
On hand also possible bit easier implement Heap Sort using extra space heap
In case heap take space array yet speed sort order magnitude Mergesort although typically slower implemented high constant factor
Heap Sort additional benefit quite consistent speed useful program timing crucial
network
For data tree tree faster balanced normal binary search tree take extraordinary amount space usually ton unused variable lying around
The compromise space time
The tree basically binary tree representation tree take le space tree empty field still retains search efficiency tree
Thus balance space time aspect computing
Much research Computer Science day devoted Time efficiency particularly theoretical time barrier problem like Traveling Salesman Problem
These day memory cheap storage space almost seems given away
With however necessity balance becomes apparent
Often memory machine scarce processing power
Memory used conservatively otherwise network server could become stalled operation finished
Robots often function limited resource installed structure thus many time memory spared vast computing speed
In situation compromise must made
With networking issue becomes mainly topology
basically description physical connection network set
Maybe know term daisy chain kind network topology
A daisy chain computer connected two others one chain us minimum cable relative speed connection smaller computer one end try send signal computer end must first go every computer
On hand every computer connected every computer called fully connected mesh network signal would fast would use lot cable network may become hard maintain
So case correlate number connection network refers speed signal travel network
There also case space explicitly sacrificed time
For instance sine cosine function often used game programming
Instead computing fly game programmer often choose precompute value sine cosine expect come
This add amount space program help speed avoiding otherwise time consuming calculation
Another example time space tradeoff real world programming come optimizing code
In inline function substituted directly code compilation possible rather turned function call
The reason one us inline function calling function take certain amount overhead done often enough help speed inside loop
On hand using many inline function significantly bloat resulting executable file
In fact sometimes space run time end growing program large
Thus although may seem trivial issue really quite important even efficiency space time
Of course type compromise made depends situation generally programmer time essence location memory scarce course space issue
Maybe someday able find algorithm extremely efficient speed memory bridge

A case increased space usage decreased time
Here refers consumed performing given task etc refers time consumed performing given task time
The utility given tradeoff affected related speed storage space subject
Biological usage tradeoff seen earlier stage
Using stored knowledge encoding stimulus reaction instinct DNA avoids need calculation situation
More specific computer implemented since earliest operating system
In first proposed using tradeoff
The common situation algorithm involving implementation include entire table reduces computing time increase amount memory needed compute table entry needed increasing computing time reducing memory requirement
A tradeoff applied problem data storage
If data stored uncompressed take space access take le time data stored compressed since compressing data reduces amount space take take time run
Depending particular instance problem either way practical
There also rare instance possible directly work compressed data case compressed faster work compression without compression
Storing source rendering every time page requested would trading time space time used le space
Rendering image page changed storing rendered image would trading space time space used le time
This technique generally known
Larger code size traded higher program speed applying
This technique make code longer iteration loop save computation time required jumping back beginning loop end iteration
Algorithms also make use tradeoff include

Have ever make decision spending money today versus tomorrow
For example might ask I go dinner tonight would I rather save money I go movie tomorrow
You probably make decision like several time day without even realizing
Since resource time money limited must choose best allocate making
Let learn little understanding concept help make better decision time money
Most u much money position buy everything desire
We must put thought every purchase affect bank account
We also must think type satisfaction purchase give u
As result get one thing like usually give another thing also may like
Making decision requires trading one item another
In economics term often expressed preferred possible alternative
A involves sacrifice must made get certain product experience
A person give opportunity buy B want buy A instead
For person going baseball game economic money time spent ballpark compared alternative watching game home saving money plus time spent driving ball game
Get FREE access day create account
Going Friday night could involve several economic
Let say really want go bar friend
You likely spend evening get home AM
The first might four hour giving could use perhaps finish term paper
Another potential might need fill car gas
Finally know might wake headache likely miss Saturday morning workout look forward
Who would thought giving much go hour
The conclusion skip going friend rather evaluate alternative make smartest decision possible
If business owner make every time buy new equipment company vehicle
The owner evaluates much money going spend likely much revenue sale earned result investment
What
It may opportunity take money would spent put CD bank making five percent interest
It may opportunity going vacation family
These owner may consider buy new piece equipment
As grocery store shopper make every time put item cart
Wow lot
For example buy name brand cereal making purchasing generic brand using additional saving buy another item may able afford otherwise
Only reason whether sacrificing name brand item buy additional snack worth
In economics term often expressed opportunity cost
A involves sacrifice must made obtain desired product experience
Understanding every decision make help ensure using resource whether time money energy wisely
Next time decide spend extra money fancy dinner think thing could money
Evaluating help feel good final decision
Once finished able explain economic illustrate concept example

When DFA converted equivalent NFA NFA give convenience many kind problem word belong language
I want know general price convenience achieved
A deterministic finite state automaton DFA fact finite automaton NFA transition function map singelton set
Recall first principle transition function DFA defined Q whereas NFA P Q This mean intuitively think DFA NFA
It may difficult get answer like given DFA
If know DFA going work extremely hard get equivalent NFA DFA
Suppose however equivalent NFA DFA NFA smaller DFA
Perhaps NFA first place used find equivalent DFA
Given NFA M symbol NFA state equivalent DFA DFA state NFA DFA DFA cheaper simulate NFA
For DFA current state integer j DFA
You keep table M DFA entry jM entry table give transition state j symbol
The lookup O
For NFA current state J NFA typically represented NFA bit vector
A position j vector mean j member current state
Your state transition much expensive
For element current state set need look possibly NFA element next state set union together result lookup
Perhaps algorithm faster O NFA I know hand
There based optimization typically performed NFA simulation keep cache map hash current state current symbol next state get pair future get next state O change worst case bound
I assume mean converting DFA smaller NFA actually us nondeterminism
If machine us nondeterminism difficult simulate deterministic computer
You keep track possible computation state since computer ca guess correct nondeterministic transition like NFA would
This basically amount converting NFA back DFA exponentially state

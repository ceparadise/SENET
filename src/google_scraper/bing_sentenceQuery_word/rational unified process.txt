RUP split project life cycle four phase
During phase six core development discipline take place business modelling requirement analysis design implementation testing deployment
However certain process important take time every stage
For example business modelling mostly take place early phase inception elaboration
Each four phase main objective completed project progress next phase
The main goal RUP create high quality software predictable budget time frame
Each life cycle phase repeated needed main objective met
Once transition stage completed successfully project finished

Project Management Rational Unified Process available

Rational unified process RUP software application development technique many tool assist coding final product task related goal
RUP approach used ensure effective project management software production
RUP enabled great stride development community standard acceptance use case unified modeling language UML
RUP comprised three characteristic recurring cycle
RUP following key characteristic RUP follows following process Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

Rational Unified Process one continuous software development process
It framework created IBM Corporation development software
In process basically team already developed different framework development software engineer developing software use framework development
It specific implementation Unified Process
RUP constitutes four different phase comprises requirement analysis design development testing deployment configuration change management
The four different phase Inception Phase This phase determining overall value project
It basically considers resource needed cost build project revenue generates
In phase also considers factor like success risk effectiveness efficiency
To determine factor us different model well like use case model
After criterion also consider development
If get success criterion whole project redesign meet criterion
Elaboration Phase The main objective phase eliminate risk project much
In phase project start take shape design developed inception phase
In phase project must get green signal lifecycle architecture milestone criterion answering question The vision product set earlier stable
The architecture designed stable
Major risk address
Stakeholders satisfied progress made
Actual planned resource acceptable
If criterion met precede development system otherwise redesign system beginning
Redesign restructuring possible till phase whatever problem risk identified sort phase
Construction phase This one important phase development component feature take place
The software developed completed
All designing work coding work testing work done software developed
Transition phase It phase implementation system take place
Here phase system made available end user
Developers system also provide training end user system functionality feedback end user collected software launched
Fig Rational Unified Process RUP Requirement Analysis It important part inception elaboration phase
Here team developer designer sit together ass requirement system
They generate idea begin development system evaluate cost effectiveness efficiency system
That analysis part important system development
Above Fig clearly show requirement analysis inception phase consecutively phase
Design Design important elaboration phase
Here architect complete framework system well different component system
This help u development system
As shown Fig
design start middle inception phase go peak point elaboration phase slowly drop construction phase slightly proceeds transition phase
Development In step coding carried according design set earlier phase
If system developing large broken different component easier development
After completion different component merge one create one ultimate system
In Fig development process start end inception phase slowly rise end elaboration phase development process go throughout whole construction phase maximum level slowly finish transition phase
Testing In step test final released system
It tested like whether user friendly whether workable
Here effectiveness efficiency also tested according design
In addition step overall system tested make one vital step system development
From Fig
testing process start beginning elaboration phase keep continuously progressing end construction phase construction phase testing process take place slowly end transition phase
Deployment This final step system development
After successfully completion every step system handover end user
After developer provides require training end user system
As shown Fig deployment process also start beginning elaboration phase start testing process continuously process construction transition phase
Configuration Change Management This approach done change needed requirement design implementation
It help find drawback system
From Fig configuration change management process done throughout whole phase starting inception phase transition phase
In way different step carried different phase Rational Unified Process system development
Chapter Project A Brief Discussion On Function Of The Proposed System Book Reservation Procedure First user need login providing appropriate username password
After successful login simply view Book Catalogue
If desire book showing available click Reserve button reserve particular book
After successful reservation user need go college collect book

Book Return Procedure The user limited day hold book
So go college submit book librarian
Now duty library staff receive book check every user detail book detail check whether late fee fine system
If found everything okay pas library card respective user
Addition new book The authority given staff teacher student add new book arrive college
The library staff fill form Add Book
After login staff button called Add Books put detail new book inputting value like Book Name ISBN Price Author Published By Published Date
After adding new book book amended system view immediately inside Book Catalogue
Deletion Procedure It duty library staff delete book Book Catalogue simply clicking Delete button list
It happens book misplaced totally damaged
Feasibility Of The Proposed System Simply feasible mean possible easily conveniently
The feasibility study determined get idea whether proceed next step discontinue project
It used primary tool development cycle
Economic Feasibility Economic feasibility study carried know whether cost mulled extreme income advantage derived development system
We say referred analysis
The cost making system nothing contrast sum expense made college managing library activity
Therefore proposed system doubt economically feasible
Technical Feasibility Is system feasibility within perimeter recent technology
Does technology exist
Is available within give resource constraint budget
Technically proposed system feasible studying performance function constraint
Environmental Feasibility The proposed system simple library staff student teacher easily use without difficulty
They use anywhere
They need trained use system need previous experience related field comfortable use friendly environment
System Design The goal designing system make user feel easy logical free error giving user pleasant environment
Input Design Input Design method assigning input computer based layout
It part whole system design requires careful attention
Normally compilation input data expensive portion system
User login input input user registration dynamic database input main input design related project
The following point main objective input design
Produce cost effective technique input

Get maximum potential degree accuracy

Ensure input acceptable database

Add User Database Development Process The common subject behind database manage information incorporated whole
A database nothing collection interrelated data stored lowest amount redundancy
The common goal make information retrieve fast cheap flexible user
For need proper collection data item organized way
This call Relational Database
To obtain require source model called relational model
This model used create relational database
Generally Relational Database Management System RDBMS software used relational database
Entity Relationship Diagram ERD A data modeling technique generates graphical description entity relationship entity within information system known Entity Relationship Diagram ERD
It often us symbol represent three different type information
Boxes Diamonds oval commonly used represent entity relationship attribute respectively
It also known model Diagram ER Diagram
It clearly understood physical object earlier part user staff library book correspond entity Diagram action done entity hold checkout keep touch relationship
Nevertheless design reduce redundancy make effort store necessary information small room possible
After consideration I decided following design
Degree Relationship Entities Relationship Reason Catalogue Book catalogue contains many book Books Member member hold many book Member Return Status member return many book Member Issue Status member issue many book Tab Degree Relationship In table ER Diagram represents five entity Catalogue Books Members Return Status Issue Status relationship
The relationship catalogue book one catalogue contains many book
The relationship book member one member hold many book
The relationship member return status one member return many book
relationship member issue status one member issue many book
Fig ER Diagram Data Dictionary
Table Name Field Name Type Size Description Example Catalogue Catalogue String catalogue contains many book Aa bc Books int Book identification number varchar Name book Dare Me Network Warrior etc
isbn int Internation Standard Book Number etc
volume int Version etc
status int Status book etc
author varchar Name author Megan Abbott Gary Donahue etc
varchar Published address Reagan Arthur Books OReilly etc
int Published Date etc
price int Price book etc
Member Catalogue Member Return Status member return many book Return Status Catalogue Member Issue Status member issue many book Issue Status Tab Degree Relationship Schema Diagram Fig Schema Diagram Schema Diagram represents three table database library
Firstly table named contains information library user
The primary key table represents unique ID user
The field show user name password user respectively
The next field called category show category like student staff teacher
Similarly field show personal detail user
The field table show many book currently reserved borrowed respective user
The secret answer question used password recovery purpose
Secondly table contains information book available library
In table field play primary key table foreign key table
All detail book like book name ISBN author published address published date price volume record respective field
The status field denotes availability book
The status available status field available
The status field dynamically used PHP script
At last table keep track book borrowed checked particular user
When book checkout issued field flagged record change
Also cardinality relationship three table show one customer one book borrowed checked one represents one one book
For table field primary key
Design Process Users student teacher provided library card check book library temporary password use Library Management System first time
The assigned unique library card number temporary password changed used authenticate user register system
Users provide name address phone number email address registering
They also able create username password time
Checkout operation require library card well reservation put book hold
Every library card fine depending category user case late return
Library staff work library issuing receiving book well adding deleting book information system
All said operation accomplished Library Management System
Functions Users Student Teacher Both Student Teacher register View edit profile
They view existing profile want edit profile limitation
They change address phone number etc
They change First Name Last Name
They change password necessary
They look book reserve
They go Book Catalogue see availability book
If found availability book reserve available book
They checkout book library using library card
They view status book taken date book return date
They return book time
They check fine imposed
They pay fine applicable
The number book reserved checked depends category user
student teacher
The duration time user keep book also depends category
These setting changed modified configuration file
reflect system
Functions Staff Staff provide library card user
They add user system
They issue receive book
They check book due late
They collect fine user
They add delete book
Staffs also profile change password
In essay I talk issue currently annoying HCI community connection software engineering merge

This memo generated effort help team understand risk management
I also taking step integrate risk management role
Did find essay
Our expert write everything need

learn share knowledge build career
I chosen use development method RUP Rational Unified Process project
This method I never used
I also included element Scrum development process
The question requirement specification contain
Is functional requirement
And included technical analysis security requirement RUP
find information
Notes would helpful
Hope people RUP experience share useful experience Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
RUP main part For example Analyst Role Develop Vision Activity result Vision Work Product
Besides RUP give u GUIDELINES CHECKLIST right ACTIVITY WORK PRODUCTS RUP give u template WORK PRODUCTS Suppose vision use RUP template use note write elavator statement like For target customer Who statement need opportunity The product name product category That statement key benefit compelling reason buy Unlike primary competitive alternative Our product statement primary differentiation Even Work product simple statement write WIKI
They even video
Suppose instead writing OpenUP create video team explain main architecture white board FOR RUP WORKPRODUCTS TEMPLATES DO NOT BECAME A TEMPLATE SHOULD NOT FILL EVER PARTS OF IT YOU SHOULD ASK YOURSELF WHAT KIND OF BENEFIT WILL I GET BY WRITING THIS IF YOU HAVE NO VALID ANSWER DO NOT WRITE
DOCUMENTATION SHOULD HAVE REAL REASONS DO NOT MAKE DOCUMENTATION JUST FOR DOCUMENTATION What Why
Agrement StakeHolders Requirements OpenUP Generally capture term like quality like requirement system
Capture function requirement To make concept clear RUP commercial OpenUP So look OpenUP WORK PRODUCTS template get idea kind info recorded Download Eclipse Process Framework Project start reading index page Lastly find usage WORK PRODUCTS agile manner Larman book Applying UML Patterns And Try Rational Unified Process page overview
The core requirement documented project description
RUP tends place lot emphasis use case however important lose sight original requirement level detail answer Why
question
If developer see us case know supposed build effectively functional requirement required
Unless developer easy access original analyst cause serious problem

I wondering benefit using ODBC driver interface MySQL server
What advantage directly connecting server via TCP firing SQL command directly
I working code base written labVIEW reference UDL file reference data source associated ODBC driver handle connection server
I yet convinced necessary
I see benefit using driver connecting Microsoft Access excel recipient SQL server type would need middle man handle SQL command
I used ODBC driver connecting MySQL Community Server time
The ODBC driver allows Windows computer add MySQL connection ODBC data source list
Now reference data source many compatible application
I able use ODBC connection application well proprietary application printing function ODBC functionality
I would say coding web python application always use built MySQL package need access data another proprietary application like window app probably need set system ODBC data source access database
To ODBC let Windows access MySQL easily
Without Windows think need
Why ODBC JDBC
Some reason come mind order helpfulness using JDBC In experience JDBC verbose
You need write many line accomplish simple thing
I found wrapper extremely easy use alternative simple stuff

Whenever I use ODBC driver full connection string DSN entry I often get error similar I correct syntax connection string Internet say I suspect I know correct name current version ODBC driver I using How I find correct name either bit
Use ODBC Data Source Administrator app
Make sure use bit bit version depending application build target
Then select File DSN tab Click Add button select driver installed Then click Advanced button You copy paste correct driver name cancel ODBC Data Source Administrator app
Add rest parameter required working ODBC connection string currently installed version driver
Enjoy By posting answer agree

Learn Windows PowerShell Hey Scripting Guy
How I get list ODBC driver installed computer
VV Hey VV
This one question end driving u crazy
That seems simple b though number way get information
For example Windows XP computer fewer eight WMI class include acronymn somewhere class name
Surely class return list installed driver right
Wrong
What trying get information found tab dialog box But none WMI class seem return information least directly
There might convoluted way getting information Scripting Guys try avoid convoluted way whenever possible
All hope seemed lost one Scripting Guys decided apply Upstairs Closet theory problem
In particular Scripting Home time something lost almost bet found upstairs closet even though item never thrown closet even though everyone house solemnly swears put

Befitting status father Scripting Guy used say sarcastically Well walk Now year later beginning think maybe lost item walk
The registry doubtless know upstairs closet operating system willing look find almost anything registry
And sure enough found list installed ODBC driver Drivers
Oddly enough also found pair shoe jacket always liked hacksaw disappeared year ago
As soon knew could get information registry easy write script retrieved list installed ODBC driver strComputer
Set objRegistry GetObject winmgmts strComputer StdRegProv strKeyPath Drivers strKeyPath arrValueNames arrValueTypes For UBound arrValueNames strValueName arrValueNames strKeyPath strValueName strValue arrValueNames strValue Next We begin defining constant named setting value use constant indicate want work registry hive
We connect WMI service standard registry provider use line code assign registry path within variable strKeyPath As turn installed ODBC driver stored individual registry value within registry key something like Therefore retrieve collection registry value need call method method automatically grab value within specified key When call EnumValues need supply two parameter two parameter
In parameter value supply method script pas constant variable strKeyPath
Taken together parameter tell script registry key working
Out parameter represent information method provides u
To get information provide pair variable name
In script variable arrValueNames end holding array registry value name found Drivers variable arrValueTypes hold array data type registry value
We including particular parameter required
Because registry value data type need worry data type thus use arrValueTypes
After calling EnumValues individual registry value name stored array variable arrValueNames
To access value need set loop run last item upper bound UBound array
As know VBScript first item array always item
That line code Inside loop assign name first registry value variable named strValueName We moment individual registry value
To actually get value assigned registry entry need call method something As see pas GetStringValue four parameter representing registry hive
strKeyPath registry path within
strValueName representing individual registry value
strValue parameter store value registry entry
After simply use line code echo back name registry value value assigned And run script get back output similar Might straightforward would liked know say list installed ODBC driver list installed ODBC driver
We sure say least case make sense
great would also list version well
Of course use registry function retrieve list driver
But much simpler method available Windows Release Preview version Windows Server Release Candidate version
You use PowerShell cmdlet retrieve list driver
The version number driver also obtained easily question Joe
You first obtain driver path driver SQL Server driverPath Driver driverExpandedPath driverPath driverExpandedPath See blog article detail Thanks Ming
WDAC Team Microsoft
This post includes information product formally released
The information change Yeah driver version come anyway
That pretty useful piece joe friend Andy coded following list version well path DLL enjoy Impressed
There still much learn

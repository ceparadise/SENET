comprises practice semblance fact follow
The term first used
religious practice appeared many traditional wake interaction technologically advanced culture
They focus obtaining material wealth cargo advanced culture magical mean building landing strip mock aircraft mock radio like
The speech widely posted Feynman adapted book
Feynman based phrase concept describes culture interpreted technologically sophisticated visitor religious supernatural figure brought boon cargo
Later effort call second visit native would develop engage complex religious ritual mirroring previously observed behavior visitor manipulating machine without understanding true nature task
Just cargo cultist create mock airport fail produce airplane cargo cult scientist conduct flawed research superficially resembles scientific method fails produce scientifically useful result
The following excerpt speech taken book
In South Seas cargo cult people
During war saw airplane land lot good material want thing happen
So arranged imitate thing like runway put fire along side runway make wooden hut man sit two wooden piece head like headphone bar bamboo sticking like wait airplane land
They everything right
The form perfect
It look exactly way looked
But work
No airplane land
So I call thing cargo cult science follow apparent precept form scientific investigation missing something essential plane land
Feynman cautioned avoid becoming cargo cult scientist researcher must avoid fooling willing question doubt theory result investigate possible flaw theory experiment
He recommended researcher adopt unusually high level honesty rarely encountered everyday life gave example advertising politics illustrate everyday dishonesty unacceptable science
Feynman cautioned We learned experience truth come
Other experimenter repeat experiment find whether wrong right
Nature phenomenon agree disagree theory
And although may gain temporary fame excitement gain good reputation scientist tried careful kind work
And type integrity kind care fool missing large extent much research cargo cult science
An example cargo cult science experiment us another researcher result lieu
Since researcher condition might differ present experiment unknown way difference outcome might relation consideration
Other example given Feynman particularly
He also mention kind dishonesty example falsely promoting one research secure funding

style characterized ritual inclusion code program structure serve real purpose
Cargo cult programming typically symptomatic programmer understanding either bug attempting solve apparent solution compare
The term may apply unskilled novice computer programmer one inexperienced problem hand one place another little understanding work whether required new position
Cargo cult programming also refer result applying coding style blindly without understanding reason behind design principle
Examples adding unnecessary comment code overzealous adherence convention specific adding deletion code object would collected automatically
The term originally referred aboriginal religion grew South Pacific World War II
The practice group centered building elaborate airplane military landing strip hope summoning airplane brought marvelous cargo war
Use term computer programming probably derives characterization certain practice
A related term coined
McConnell describes software development organization attempt emulate successful development house either slavishly following without understanding reasoning behind attempting emulate development approach software developer devote large amount time energy toward seeing project succeed mandating long hour unpaid overtime successful company high motivation requirement
In case McConnell contends competence ultimately determines whether project succeeds fails regardless development approach taken furthermore claim incompetent impostor organization merely imitate successful software development organization fact engaging call

Cargo cult programming term used describe practice green unsophisticated le fully competent programmer engineer using certain type ritual habit code revolve around lack understanding code
These action characterized superstitious rote reaction tendency form function
Cargo cult programming also known voodoo programming
The term cargo cult come religious group sprung indigenous South Pacific population World War II era
Some practice group included building mock aircraft landing strip testament actual airplane delivered cargo war year
The term cargo cult programming stem cargo cult science traced back book Richard Feynman
Other tech expert describe cargo cult programming specific scenario
In blog post subject tech writer coder Scott Hanselman likens people home know plumbing work driver understand vehicle move around road
Some computer science academia use term talk student repeatedly fail grasp functional concept around coding rather exploring function code keep going back formalist method relying source code formalism complete project

Science belief ignorance expert great Nobel physicist Richard Feynman science article What Science Feynman emphasized definition repeating sentence extra large typeface article
Feynman essay available online behind subscription wall volume starting page
Immediately definition science Feynman wrote When someone say Science teach using word incorrectly
Science teach anything experience teach
If say Science shown ask How science show
How scientist find
How
What
Where It science And much right anyone else upon hearing experiment patient listen evidence judge whether sensible conclusion arrived And I say Amen
Notice average person
You right hear evidence right judge whether evidence support conclusion
We use phrase scientific consensus peer review rather science By whatever name idea balderdash
Feynman absolutely correct
When attorney general Virginia sued force Michael Mann hockey stick fame provide raw data used complete computer program used analyze data could decide Faculty Senate University Virginia Mann professor time defended hockey stick declared request Feynman request outrage
You peon must simply accept conclusion scientific endeavor satisfied peer review Feynman attorney general scientist request raw data judge whether sensible conclusion arrived would according Faculty Senate send chilling message scientist indeed scholar According Faculty Senate University Virginia science indeed scholarship general longer attempt establish truth replicable experiment looking evidence checked anyone

Exploring issue controversy relationship science medicine A cargo cult pseudo airplane
How much psychology like
Last year I reviewed Tomasz Witkowski Maciej Zatonski book pointed many psychology accepted belief therapy based good evidence
Now Witkowski written new book published later year certain ruffle lot feather
He compare psychology cargo cult
He say cargo cult phenomenon virtually absent physic chemistry mathematics yet run rampant psychology He uncovers cargo cult practice psychology unmasking therapy devoid science dangerous even cruel especially directed child

For familiar term cargo cult originates native Melanesia awestruck plane landed island WWII bringing kind supply
They understanding airplane came
Magical thinking led create bamboo replica plane control tower superstitious belief would attract plane bring material good
Similarly many psychology researcher imitating method science without really understanding science supposed work
They go motion research design poorly thought methodology poor result meaningless
And use meaningless result guide therapy
They led astray deceived harmed patient
Witkowski book start brilliant discussion human mind work evolved thinking process frequently lead error
Next provides thorough discussion cargo cult far detail I read elsewhere
It fascinating stuff especially huge variety cargo cult least one persisted century deliberate deception confusion reality belief
If psychologist good scientist psychotherapy based evidence effective would expect psychology impact world
We would expect see improvement statistic regarding mental health crime fewer people suffering depression fewer suicide etc
In reality find number psychotherapist rise number patient rise mental health statistic get worse
John Holt much doubt regard The person whose main lifework helping others need must others need help
The helper feed thrives helplessness creates helplessness need
Witkowski asks Are involved act profound deception bear responsibility upkeep thousand scientist engage utterly idle effort
There kind psychotherapy disappear
The successful integrated popular belief tradition
Cargo cult prophet discourage empirical validation
Freud said wealth reliable observation assertion rest make independent experimental Witkowski explains people believe ineffective treatment American clinical psychologist put trust clinical experience supported report colleague scientific evidence To recommend method whose consequence include systematic daily experience suffering one must posse overwhelming certainty positive effect therapy sufficient counterbalance negative one
Unfortunately pseudoscientific psychologist
They strong conviction like majority cargo cult priest
Convictions built without foundation resting pillar mere opinion enhanced thin anecdotal evidence precious little empirical proof found
Why common
He cover long list factor contribute blossoming psychobusiness
Anything called therapy today
We color therapy sand play therapy nature walk therapy laughing therapy
If parent buy dog mean child getting dog therapy
He provides numerous example prominent cargo cult therapy become well established rarely questioned
He suggests become subject investigation ethnographer whose field interest encompasses analysis cult myth rite superstition construct
Adult child alcoholic ACoA recently coined diagnostic category laundry list symptom used support diagnosis
The concept expanded include dysfunctional family including population
The approach acclaimed ACoA movement affiliated therapist peculiar brew common sense common observation psychology metaphor false assertion harmful recommendation
People waste life exploring imaginary problem thing necessarily lead solving real problem
Harms include label social stigma belief responsible digging dirt past
The Simonton mind matter method alleged double survival rate cancer patient
It basically marketing lie based faulty research
Contrary common belief association emotion stress cancer rate

In study even observe opposite effect workplace stress associated reduced risk breast cancer
Encouraging patient think positively extra burden imposed difficult situation also deprives vital social support
As American Cancer Society concluded After careful study literature information available American Cancer Society evidence treatment Carl Simonton psychotherapy method result objective benefit treatment cancer human being
therapy encompassing training relaxation technique shown produce better mood reduce psychological suffering improve perception quality life cancer patient
But prolong survival
Critical incident psychological debriefing another example cargo cult psychology
A Cochrane review concluded There current evidence psychological debriefing useful treatment posttraumatic stress disorder traumatic incident
Compulsory debriefing victim trauma cease
The helper felt better
Sometimes patient felt The current WHO recommendation psychological debriefing say Psychological debriefing used people exposed recently traumatic event intervention reduce risk posttraumatic stress anxiety depressive symptom
Strength recommendation STRONG
The Method intended treat brain damage child increase intellectual potential child
They claim individual genetic potential Leonardo Shakespeare Mozart Michelangelo Edison Einstein
Our individual potential race parent grandparent
All intelligence product environment
They make fantastic claim like taught old brain injured child read
They use ridiculous treatment requiring tremendous time investment patterning masking hanging child upside vitamin diet etc
They built worldwide empire
Witkowski critique devastating
Educational kinesiology Paul Dennison Brain funded government used country
Ben Goldacre call scientific explanatory framework barkingly Attachment therapy holding therapy led child torture numerous death
Studies use unreliable measure problem treatment result
They rely subjective report parent questionnaire validated
These method continue used unprincipled people ignorance inability admit wrong
There end psychological pseudoscience pseudotherapies
A topic Witkowski cover covered SBM Baker colleague recommended change existing accreditation system within APA
They would stigmatize unscientific training program well practitioner use method scientifically unproven
They justify call similar change successfully put practice medicine
They say therapy empirically confirmed classified experimental therapy patient recognized medical They suggested using problematic therapeutic intervention facilitated communication method case autistic child treated criminal act
I would propose term therapy phase uncontrolled experiment human alternative
When deciding undergo therapy one remember choosing least hundred school modality many conflict one another
Only handful boast empirically proven effectiveness
Patients ask question Richard Feynman coined term cargo cult science It doom gloom
The book end positive note letter Richard Feynman chastising calling whole field cargo cult
Witkowsi draw Feynman attention example good science psychology demonstrable benefit society instance study reaction time response different configuration brake light led law requiring third brake light vehicle dramatically reducing number collision injury repair cost
There error book AIDS lumped untreatable disease chapter statistic poor misleading explanation
But whole lot valuable information
Even agree calling travesty science cargo cult make wonder psychological principle therapy based good science
This book second part trilogy I look forward volume also known The SkepDoc retired family physician writes pseudoscience questionable medical practice

When Second World War ended anthropologist resumed study Pacific Island society new interest social change social unrest sparked wartime turmoil impending collapse colonial empire
Defiant social movement impossible ignore
In Melanesian island southwest Pacific anthropologist labeled political religious movement eventually would describe several hundred organization erupted across New Guinea today Papua New Guinea Indonesian province Papua Solomon Islands Vanuatu New Caledonia Fiji
Cargo cult proved remarkably popular descriptive term ethnographer used promiscuously also relabel prewar social disturbance well movement elsewhere Pacific beyond
Islanders classic cargo cult embraced new prophecy innovative ritual practice promised arrival return cargo Pidgin Englishes Melanesia
Cult ritual typically included new form dance marching drilling imaginative strategy contact spirit ancestor new moral code secure group unity harmony
Community ancestor postwar period American military would reward faithful shipment cargo
Cargo object organized community desire semantically complex
Sometimes cargo meant money Western manufactured good shipped island massive amount particularly Pacific War
Anthropologists also interpreted cargo represent return dead ancestor achievement balanced exchange relation Europeans assertion sense honor desire political sovereignty transformation transcendence everyday reality
Many cult flared quickly burned cargo arrived
Others however institutionalized survive today church political party business organization
Some anthropologist argued Melanesian culture embrace constant background imminent expectation sudden episodic change
The energy desire sparked cargo culting however currently animates island enthusiasm evangelical Pentecostal Christianity alongside economic development project genuine spurious
Comparative overview cargo cult soon appeared alongside early monographic description particular movement
originally published first still influential remains print see
Peter Worsley committed analysis social transformation originally prepared compendium millenarian movement everywhere
The publisher cut Melanesia
collect four lecture delivered University Sussex drew author field research among Madang cultist Papua New Guinea comparing cargo cult millenarian movement elsewhere explore general explanation cult enthusiasm

A former missionary author frame cargo cult salvationist term suggests additional Christian outreach could redirect cargo energy

Essays argument computing education The term cargo cult science get bandied around bit

The ohrase coined charismatic scientist
However muddled whole cargo cult tale misleading metaphor Feynman went describe I explain post
strange phenomenon sprung Pacific island last year
Over Feynman In South Seas cargo cult people
During war saw airplane land lot good material want thing happen
So arranged imitate thing like runway put fire along side runway make wooden hut man sit two wooden piece head like headphone bar bamboo sticking like wait airplane land
They everything right
The form perfect
It look exactly way looked
But work
No airplane land
The cargo cult wonderful tragic captivating tale explains people remember well
And clearly metaphor people following motion others expert
lack understanding actually going ineffective
Now cargo cultist quite insidious accusation
Let say teacher I accused cargo cult teacher follow apparent action teacher turning class standing talk kid setting exercise marking homework teaching anything
Ouch
How defend
I guess would probably look student exam mark
Anyway back cargo cult science
Feynman follows metaphor I call thing cargo cult science follow apparent precept form scientific investigation missing something essential So identify cargo cult science
It well say look like science miss something essential
We need able distinguish look like science actually science
Feynman go Now behooves course tell missing
But would difficult explain South Sea Islanders arrange thing get wealth system
It something simple like telling improve shape earphone
Great
So cargo cult science lack something essential difficult Feynman master scientific explanation explain
That sound promising
However go say But one feature I notice generally missing cargo cult kind scientific integrity principle scientific thought corresponds kind utter kind leaning backwards
For example experiment report everything think might make think right cause could possibly explain result thing thought eliminated experiment make sure fellow tell eliminated
So cargo cult science science transparent explain potential limitation
But cargo cult analogy
The cargo cultist lack transparency limitation insufficient explanation method
Summoning cargo good metaphor carrying scientific experiment
The whole cargo cult tale completely irrelevant Feynman went talk science lack integrity transparency
These valid problem I think refer problem bad science dishonest science cargo cult metaphor nothing
Feynman used metaphor capture interest speech somehow become one famous thing said
If want know Feynman great tell book Surely You Joking Mr Feynman
It good read though includes speech epilogue
Bad science would setting experiment variable changing arbitrarily conclusion approach hypothesis successfully publishing scientific discovery
Cargo cult science look similar honest scientific experiment easy confuse
Consider following inquiry Why I drop feather hammer equal height flat surface hammer hit first first
Hypothesis The hammer weighs feather
Experiment Increase mass feather tying slug iron equal mass hammer minus feather mass
Result Modified feather Hammer fall speed
Conclusion Mass affect object reach uniform surface first given equal starting height
We done science
Of course bad science obvious first blush know better lacked scientific integrity rigor unwitting public would prepared believe mass affect rate decent object subjected gravity
We dressed scientist created hypothesis experiment confirms hypothesis
But something quite right
As Feynman note end lecture adjusting length antenna wooden headset see improve reception
As accusation practicing cargo cult teaching harsh better believe
But reality today teacher equivalent setting room order standing front class person wondering kid learning anything
But data generated standardized test teacher evaluation scientific I would hard pressed scientifically test organic being wake bad mood forget eat breakfast
Sure quantity testing help smooth simply much variability standardized test almost useless
And educator first point test suck
When good course lauded good job
This cargo cult science
This native setting academic curriculum wood wondering get consistent result kid flourish many flounder
I agree something wrong Feynmans speech
There strong link Cargo Cult Tale explanation following
However Cargo Cult Tale famous iilluminating truth
Todays institute full cargo cult scientist fact know
Perhaps cargo cult scientist aspect work life
I think Cargo Cult Tale far irrelevant
From point view problem integrity problem bad knowledge
An experiment good science year ago would cargo science today ignoring knowledge textbook scientific paper time
There strong evidence scientist today mainly interested publishing paper reading mention understanding
And message Feynman speech point view Try hard understand

In composed pair possible key appears collection
Operations associated data type allow The classic computer science problem task designing maintains set data operation
The two major solution dictionary problem
In case also possible solve problem using directly addressed specialized structure
Many programming language include associative array available many others
form direct support associative array
Associative array many application including fundamental
In associative array association key value often known binding word binding may also used refer process creating new association
The operation usually defined associative array Often instead add reassign single operation add new pair one already exist otherwise reassigns
In addition associative array may also include operation determining number binding constructing loop binding
Usually operation order binding returned may arbitrary
A generalizes associative array allowing multiple value associated single key
A related abstract data type binding operate direction value must associated unique key second lookup operation take value argument look key associated value
Suppose set loan made library represented data structure
Each book library may checked single library patron time
However single patron may able check multiple book
Therefore information book checked patron may represented associative array book key patron value
Using notation data structure would A lookup operation key Great Expectations would return John
If John return book would cause deletion operation Pat check book would cause insertion operation leading different state For dictionary small number binding may make sense implement dictionary using binding
With implementation time perform basic dictionary operation linear total number binding however easy implement constant factor running time small
Another simple implementation technique usable key restricted narrow range integer direct addressing array value given key stored array cell binding cell store special indicates absence binding
As well simple technique fast dictionary operation take constant time
However space requirement structure size entire keyspace making impractical unless keyspace small
The two major approach implementing dictionary
The frequently used general purpose implementation associative array combined separate key separate bucket array
The basic idea behind hash table accessing element array via index simple operation
Therefore average overhead operation hash table computation key hash combined accessing corresponding bucket within array
As hash table usually perform O time outperform alternative situation
Hash table need able handle hash function map two different key bucket array
The two widespread approach problem
In separate chaining array store value store another container usually store value matching hash
On hand open addressing hash collision found table seek empty spot array store value deterministic manner usually looking next immediate position array
Open addressing lower ratio separate chaining table mostly empty
However table becomes filled element open addressing performance degrades exponentially
Additionally separate chaining us le memory case unless entry small le four time size pointer
Another common approach implement associative array
Compared hash table structure advantage weakness
The performance binary search tree significantly better hash table time complexity O log
This contrast hash table whose performance involves element sharing single bucket resulting O time complexity
In addition like binary search tree binary search tree keep element order
Thus traversing element follows pattern whereas traversing hash table result element seemingly random order
However hash table much better time complexity binary search tree O performance highly unlikely good used
It worth noting binary search tree used implement bucket hash table us separate chaining
This allows constant lookup assures performance O log
However introduces extra complexity implementation may cause even worse performance smaller hash table time spent inserting balancing tree greater time needed perform element linked list similar data structure
Associative array may also stored unbalanced data structure specialized particular type key implementation method le efficient hash table well placing greater restriction type data handle
The advantage alternative structure come ability handle operation beyond basic one associative array finding binding whose key closest queried key query present set binding
Associative array implemented programming language package many language system provide part standard library
In language built standard system special syntax often using subscripting
syntactic support associative array introduced name table
made associative array optionally persistent key data structure
supported one possible implementation set map
Most modern scripting language starting including support associative array primary container type
In many language available library function without special syntax
In called called called see called since typically use implementation
In array associative except key limited integer string
In JavaScript see also object behave associative array key Map WeakMap type take arbitrary object key
In Lua called used primitive building block data structure
In called
The also support associative array
Most program using associative array point need store data permanent form like
A common solution problem generalized concept known produce text binary representation original object written directly file
This commonly implemented underlying object model like Cocoa include standard function convert internal data text form
The program create complete text representation group object calling method almost always already implemented base associative array class
For program use large data set sort individual file storage appropriate DB required
Some DB system natively store associative array serializing data storing serialized data key
Individual array loaded saved database using key refer
These used many year history long common RDBs lack standardization among reason limited use certain niche role
RDBs used role case although saving object RDB complicated problem known
After need high performance database suitable closely matching internal structure program using led renaissance store market
These system store retrieve associative array native fashion greatly improve performance common workflow

Data mapping process used data warehousing different data model linked using defined set method characterize data specific definition
This definition atomic unit unit metadata semantic
This data linking follows set standard depends domain value data model used
Data mapping serf initial step data integration
Data mapping applied several way using procedural code Extensible Style Sheet Language Transformation existing graphical interface
The technique involves evaluating data value different data source well automatically simultaneously discovering complex mapping set

In process creating two distinct
Data mapping used first step wide variety task including For example company would like transmit receive purchase invoice company might use data mapping create data map company data standardized message item purchase order invoice
generic EDI standard designed allow exchange company regardless industry
The standard maintained Accredited Standards Committee ASC ANSI accredited set standard EDI
The standard often called
In future tool based language RDF OWL standardized make data mapping automatic process
This process accelerated application performed
Full automated data mapping difficult problem see
Data mapping done variety way using procedural code creating transforms using graphical mapping tool automatically generate executable transformation program
These graphical tool allow user draw line field one set data field another
Some graphical data mapping tool allow user source destination
This feature dependent source destination
Transformation program automatically created SQL XSLT
These kind graphical tool found Tools Extract Transform Load Tools primary mean entering data map support data movement
Examples include SAP BODS Informatica PowerCenter
This newest approach data mapping involves simultaneously evaluating actual data value two data source using heuristic statistic automatically discover complex mapping two data set
This approach used find transformation two data set discover substring concatenation arithmetic case statement well kind transformation logic
This approach also discovers data exception follow discovered transformation logic
similar feature data mapper exception consulted look data element synonym
For example source system list FirstName destination list PersonGivenName mapping still made data element listed metadata registry

October The data mapping process begin early IT project often immediately troublesome
The process typically assigned group people customer side system integrator SI side new SAP technology
The customer yet trained use new technology SI often assigns junior consultant newbie help customer perform mapping function
This combination creates mapping process high probability error
To help remedy situation place experienced people mapping team mapping design work
Here five recommendation complete mapping process
I find two key problem mapping process lead end product mapping document becoming completely useless When begin mapping start asking simple set question
For example To understand question important look typical mapping document sequence
A typical mapping document A mapping document like useless every project map simple field way complex field differently
It provides new information experienced SAP resource
You throw document away
Instead asking two earlier question get root exactly need data mapping scenario
The mapping process span four level beginning high level increasing complexity level progress
Typically mapping done spreadsheet converted technical functional specification converting data
Creating spreadsheet hard manage
Instead recommend mapping team consider using application help gather mapping information SAP implementation define scope document rule track change mapping process
A application BackOffice Associates EZMap solution provides auditable repeatable process help manage mapping rule legacy data SAP target data efficiently
Overall SAP ERP application contain close table field
However experience shown typical project involve mapping table field around field need documented
BackOffice Associates provide detail list table field one need documented
Do waste time debating use field never mapped
For example likely need map Train Stop field SAP customer table field simply unable update
Save time money mapping field use
There one question lingers Are mapping document ever really done complete
Mapping hard complete early project customer yet know SAP technology design done integration testing
So mapping still changed throughout project
However mapping process part design phase phase done people expect mapping done
Too many people decide mapping process done exists laughable concept think
We seen mapping document content seen template list field particular table mapping information
While might consider mapping document done totally useless
What need happen change expectation
Teams must start mapping need early project also need realize process likely complete end project
Realizing mapping process extend across project give flexibility accommodate change mapping need
You expect complex mapping change
As would important document read mapping document carefully sign
Treat signing mapping document would signing purchase order
Take caution phrase like determined design When come data mapping company trouble getting good start

translate It well good CollectiveAccess configuration perfectly accommodates data ca accurately import data little use
CollectiveAccess allows user create mapping use import source data system either Command Line User Interface
The overall process involves seven basic step First create mapping document tell bit data source go new system
Then already data system create backup database executing data dump see information
After taking use mapping document run import either command line graphical user interface
When data migration complete check CollectiveAccess inconsistency mistake
Revise mapping accordingly Load data dump system return state thereby clear data
Run import
In order follow step course need understand exactly write one mapping document
Fortunately created template available go different aspect template
If downloaded template noticed Excel format
If want read first look template later bear mind talking Excel spreadsheet mention row column
This template used import data CSV XLSX XLS MYSQL Filemaker XML Inmagic XML MARC CollectiveAccess data
No matter source importer assume thing
Each row data set corresponds single record word every cell certain row excel spreadsheet example using source data pertain one record
For information map source file type see

Each column corresponds single metadata element
Rule Types basic instruction give data
At present time four Rule Types outlined We talk briefly first two following section describe last two
Let take look selection mapping selection source data spreadsheet This image show column mapping get rest later taking look first four column already mentioned begin understand road map data migration
Take look first row
Under heading see word SKIP heading see number
This mean importing data information coming column skipped
You use rule whenever want importer ignore certain data
Now look next row
You see word Mapping number
This mean row mapping spreadsheet determines data contained metadata element described column original data source go
That mouthful let break row

You using Rule Type Mapping
This simply mean row provide roadmap transformation specific metadata element source data CA configuration

Since data coming second column source data case source excel using column number go
If look data source sample see column titled award year
You want tell data column go metadata element created CA hold case
The metadata element CA configuration supposed contain data named placed Collections table
Therefore complete path
This write heading
In case instruction required
There clear relationship column source data metadata element CA
For example let take another look bottom row sample You see slightly longer CA path word status column heading Group
The format expressing metadata element container CA
In example container called grantStatus subElements
However enough simply write path must also clarify data question destined container
That Group column
Simply put essentially arbitrary term heading subElements ensure go exact container rather different version container
In case term link two status
If one layer container example container like must truncated main container
Example Consider container structure associated object To access metadata path bundle specifier namespace put mapping file
Simple right
Yes get bit complex next column template
So complicated metadata relationship
Or perhaps metadata need combined two element source one CA
This Refineries come play
A refinery simplistic level sound like refines individual mapping allows greater complexity
Refineries one following Splitters Makers Joiners Getters
For detailed description technical example see Let begin example Splitters
What mean Splitter would use
A Splitter several different potential us

It could create relationship splitting given data new record
In word need create entity relationship create new record entity question would use Splitter
In example third column data source contained related entity wanted create related entity record name listed
Do worry talk Refinery Parameters moment
Splitters used scenario like one include see formulation table type followed word Splitter
Also take note fact code case simply

If already existing record side relationship Splitter also used match data rather creating new record
This determined discus later

If jumble data one cell line source need broken individual metadata element also use Splitter example dimension given object contained within one cell excel source want break individual component CA would employ tool using
Maker refinery used create CollectiveAccess stop object item pairing
These relationship different CollectiveAccess relationship two reason
Firstly carry relationship type
Secondly relationship always single multiple tour many tour stop tour stop never belong one tour
Similarly object never belong one lot
List item belong one one list
Here example Maker use In case source column column list tour name parent many tour stop record
Here sample source data The Maker tell data creating multiple record place stop one tour parent
A Joiner used merge data two separate source different column example single field CA
This useful date example different side date range located different cell
This joiner would called dateJoiner
Similarly could used merge data one source column etc
single entity
For example first name last name different column spreadsheet want accidentally create separate relationship would use entityJoiner
Here example dateJoiner use And selection data source refers As see element date separated original dateJoiner need amalgamate
Getters le frequently used
Getters designed specifically MYSQL data mapping
These refinery map repeating source data linking table correct CollectiveAccess element
For information see relevant table
The new tool designed allow import multiple level collection hierarchy
fonds series file single data source
This refinery creates new record like splitter instead creating lateral relationship creates hierarchical one
Using parameter called Parents discussed along parameter builder stack higher level collection record lower one
For example source includes file series record want different collection record entry type import file use builder create series record
As may noticed example refinery often accompanied parameter define behavior
These become complex attention detail important writing dissect
For complete table least possible parameter see Let look entitySplitter example relatively simple parameter
In case parameter type relationshipType entityType delimiter
Let look one function
need define relationship type new entity record creating Splitter record related
In case example source one relationship type
In example entity column entitled created relationshipType defined CA configuration creator
Sometimes source data multiple relationship type juggle single mapping
For example take look parameter Instead saying something like creator relationshipType see
What mean
Here part Source mapping These Associated Names mapped related entity see column right role
relationshipType
As result need set parameter draw relationshipType column column
When however need specify Original Values Replacement Values process described
must define type new record creating
In case type ind code CA configuration individual
The type must match code exactly
case semicolon delineates multiple entity single cell name name need separated therefore delimiter You also notice particular formatting employed writing parameter
They must begin end curly bracket parameter type must quote followed colon parameter must quote well
We look example get hang formatting
Let take look slightly complicated case also entitySplitter
There lot curly bracket let break
Again situation relationshipType simple uniform
In case making related entity record project contact
EntityType similarly uniform individual configuration code individual ind
Here thing get bit complicated
In data source address information entity included next name
Take look You pull reasonable amount data new record parameter using attribute format
In case wanted grab address information related given name dealing multiple column contained within address container configuration
The code container address subElements city stateprovince postalcode country
Because dealing container path specified parameter slightly longer subElement contained within bracket following address code main element
As see main trick keep track punctuation
Once pulled source parameter using need write individual line source template spreadsheet
Here result might look import This parameter used collectionSplitter collectionHierarchyBuilder
In case collectionSplitter used build record new record
In collectionHierarchyBuilder parent parameter defines new record directly imported data
Within Parents parameter map idno name type optional metadata attribute parent record
There parameter discussed along example
To check formatting parameter JSON visit
Often slew import error attributed missing set quotation mark always good
Refineries way introduce greater complexity accuracy import
You also column entitled Options set additional formatting conditionals
Here example column use source column refers As see data source generally say poster blank cell
This could cataloging mistake number reason know clear default value protect occasional blank option default value
Another common use Options formatting
Here example And source In case title record needed formed several disparate element word Oral History Catalog Number column source seen word data two additional column seen Using template would lead Oral History Jim Dauphinee
There many option listed example
Two column mapping template bear closer examination Original Values Replacement Values
These used map list item relationship type variable corresponding code
Let look example This example contains another relatively complex parameter boil relevant component purpose
As see parameter pulling data column source case source contained obituary information relating entity
Take look part source part referenced obituary last part attribute setting
take look list configuration contained relevant metadata element list obituary As see Y way yes indicated data source different yes code configuration
As result need map original value Y replacement value yes
You add multiple value single cell long replacement value match original value line line
This feature used correct common misspelling source data simply normalize name term conform element code fixed list value CollectiveAccess
The last two Rule Types mentioned Settings Constant
Settings located bottom template define overarching preference mapping
For list possible setting time see
They allow define table type specify code mapping spreadsheet useful uploading importer dictate mapping behave regard data already database
Here might look context Where data source deal primarily object existing data contend
used place spreadsheet want set unchanging value used every instance given field
For example In example two table element within container
One date going variable value different record different creation date
However case person writing mapping knew particular container type type would always created
Here container User Interface As result Rule Type Constant used value created case typed Source would otherwise indicated
The two row united one container Group column discussed
Now crafted mapping spreadsheet want actually put use
This done two step With CollectiveAccess version two way go
To begin navigate Import Data Global Navigation Bar
To upload importer mapping click add importer
You see dotted outline around word Drag importer worksheet add update
Simply drag excel worksheet containing data map computer center box wait upload process complete
Once uploaded importer importer appear list screen
To import data either click green arrow right Importer name click Run Import navigation
On Run Import screen must choose appropriate previously uploaded importer format Excel FMPro DSOResult Inmagic XML MARC MySQL CollectiveAccess data source
Then attach file containing data
Data URL field must include account credential remote server
They incorporated URL use run mapping
The url format So planning importing record server using account guest password import URL would read Once everything set click Execute data import finish process


Software Engineer Data conversion translation mapping mean rocket science mean tedious
Even simple data conversion task reading CSV file list class instance require amount code
While task share much common different enough require data conversion method
In virtually every system build point find needing transform data one form another whether importing data existing data store processing data incoming stream translating one format another internal processing transforming data desired output format
And time task seems frustratingly similar done many time yet enough difference require u data mapping process largely scratch
Moreover popular format technology accessing continue evolve new one introduced gain popularity programmer obliged constantly learn new data conversion mapping technique library APIs framework
Although leverage tool like map data one object another refactor existing code matter code tedious write always need maintained
And come solution cross domain translation handling like converting internal code key value value another layer system null value default value type conversion etc
Validation similar issue addressed technology like ream custom validation code
And nuance technology quite subtle
As tell There got better Well fact
And data mapping tutorial
MetaDapper library strives simplify streamline data conversion process greatest extent possible
MetaDapper facilitates data conversion MetaDapper separate logical mapping schema data translation validation physical data mapping conversion various file format APIs
The logical mapping feature powerful set function allows hook method handle specific need
The physical mapping includes rich set supported format extended constantly
To configure mapping MetaDapper Configurator provided simple use Windows executable creating editing mapping executing testing conversion
Converting list class instance XML CSV file populating SQL database record generating SQL script populating table creating spreadsheet much done using configuration file often created second
To include MetaDapper simply need On success writer output transformed data
On error exception give back detailed error information reject data tune configuration
Here brief data mapping example The MetaDapper Configurator provides way visually walk step defining data structure rule
The Configurator enables create edit execute configuration testing conversion
MetaDapper Configurator strives automate much process possible
For example specifying field mapping source destination field matched automatically possible using name matching
Also creating Record Definitions data source contain metadata field definition populated automatically pointing data source
Once created Record Definition maintains link data source created automatically updated data source schema subsequently change
When configuring Record Definition data source little metadata available another similar data source available contain metadata Record Definition copied metadata serve basis new Record Definition edited reflect difference may exist two data source
And case schema metadata identical multiple data source single Record Definition used
Let look detail challenge inherent data conversion process way MetaDapper facilitates simplifies developer
When internal external structure changed course maintenance mapping code relies structure may need adjusted well
This area maintenance work often required whatever solution use maintenance cost need evaluated
For example TotalSale property removed Sale class related mapping assignment need adjusted accordingly
With MetaDapper updating mapping may take little second
For class type example simply click Import field definition class button refresh field newly compiled definition Some type conversion Number type conversion example sensitive host environment international setting unless explicitly specified code
Deploying application new server different international setting therefore break code take account
A date value example interpreted machine setting machine setting
MetaDapper support implicit conversion allows complex reformatting value part translation well
Moreover separate independent international setting specified MetaDapper reader writer mapping engine
Sometimes specific business rule require access system require complex coding determine default value needed
MetaDapper allows number custom delegate method registered engine employed provide default value perform custom data conversion provide custom field validation
It uncommon field value required conditionally even valid value dependent value field
For example might case Partner Name Partner Social Security Code field left blank Partner Name provided Partner Social Security Code possibly field must provided
This type conditional validation complex easy get wrong custom code
By contrast MetaDapper allows kind data mapping relationship easily configured
Specifically list field Record Definition listed Conditional Mandatory Fields Group Then mapping group associated field null would turn require field group supplied
For example Source data may contain inconsistent value
For example salutation field may contain Mr Mister M well female equivalent
Or currency field may contain value like destination format requires USD
Product code another example value may need converted one system another
MetaDapper allows specification reusable synonym list used translate value mapping
Once defined specify Synonym Group employ relevant field mapping Values one field may need used format new value
For example source value may need decorating constant several field may need used generate value
MetaDapper provides capability let build value using field current record including substring portion field constant value
After formatting value converted specified destination type incidentally need string
Similarly complex calculation performed mapping employing full set mathematical operator function combination field value constant
Custom validation delegate registered used mapping
Here example custom method validate field value integer without making data type field integer The method would registered instantiating MetaDapper
Then could easily applied Field Mapping Definition Grouping sorting operation often handled database query data source database
MetaDapper therefore support configuration complex grouping sorting operation performed
In case portion source data may needed filtering source complex implement maintain
MetaDapper support configuring complex filter Boolean operator number field evaluation per record arbitrarily deep nesting operation needed
For example The filter equivalent following C code Some mapping require multiple pass complete data conversion process
Some example include data requires prefix summation record data need mapped differently depending field value document structure simply isolate different stage complex mapping
translate name type conversion etc
Toward end MetaDapper support nested mapping level depth
As data mapping conversion tool MetaDapper constructed allow virtually data format read written using internal reader writer interface
This allows creation class extremely light weight focused nuance
Readers writer also behave intelligently flexibly possible
For example XML reader writer employ XPaths specify retrieve write data XML file
The configuration also used read write example format CSV file case XPath value simply ignored
Likewise configuration include XPath setting used XML reader writer error generated
You skeptical
And I blame
Software tool rarely claim
So real world example MetaDapper already used provide operational benefit
A company provides medical insurance management software customer want fill web form wanted provide data spreadsheet
Using MetaDapper uploaded spreadsheet read memory data cleaned record validated result stored database
They able accept Excel file customer without human validation using MetaDapper easy create configuration file spreadsheet template publish
A large gas company internal application wanted management user able download report Excel format
The report format would likely regularly changed
MetaDapper facilitated Excel sheet generated database
Updating Excel format required updating MetaDapper configuration file without code change recompiling
A company provides asset management software needed solution generating financial data customer dependent accounting package format import system
A generic accounting data query developed using ORM wrapper MetaDapper used sort filter map data desired schema format customer
One MetaDapper configuration made customer become major selling feature new customer
The product configured using MetaDapper minute support whatever custom standard accounting package format integration essential existing system included new sale
The company us MetaDapper various software integration project mapping converting data converting internal code system
A major auto reseller needed add sale report Excel format one application
The report added application le hour start finish
A developer needed table States identical set used another website
MetaDapper used mine data site generate SQL script populating table minute
These example MetaDapper proven utility value data mapping tool
It take mental jump start thinking data conversion generically start thinking set data business rule unbounded usefulness
MetaDapper framework foster facilitates perspective
Whether use MetaDapper another technology roll data mapping solution introduction complexity hidden cost data conversion project
I hope find informative

This handled process manager OS see First little
So process program execution
The first three letter program process probably clue something
Think process An abstraction sequence instruction executed processor processor may need service hardware device process time sharing executing device driver instruction process
make hardly sense understand process bit reading
A process contains A really important thing remember process program disk would file
Imagine recipe cake
Now cake recipe instruction making cake like program disk
The actual activity making cake process
The thing take away section OS collection process
The OS make computer productive switching CPU process
The thing normally cause process created The system call creates process known fork execve Unix Windows CreateProcess
These process called one process create another
This known parent process creating child process
There several reason process may terminated Things could become issue The OS table one entry per process
Each entry known PCB
Each entry The basic thing learn PCB info needed process stopped restarted
Note This diagram taken source material post available slide
All right reserved
The diagram fairly simple
You see actual switching process happening neither process executing CPU perform processing middle switching
The actual switching time vary around microsecond second millisecond The concept processing used far assumed single address space used every process single thread control
But multiple thread within one process
It possible think way You multiple process sharing one computer multiple thread sharing process
This would useful web browser example one thread receiving data network another display text
With web browser could one thread getting input user another thread autosaving
Imagine word processor single threaded You able type anything autosaving
Note On version powerpoint I type anything autosaving
It annoying
You might hear something called
This another way saying thread
So thread multiple flow control sharing one address space
Each one need program counter register value stack
Remember thread process share code section global variable network connection open file
You may heard
This multiple thread share process
Programs become responsive resource shared better
If part program blocked keep running
As IO CPU use shared thread process performance usually better
It economical There lot cost associated making process
Memory resource need allocated
Creating thread faster
There concern though I mentioned two thread share data
Therefore one thread might read location another writing need take care stop problem like
Implementing threading fast done user space
However OS aware meaning user level thread get blocked whole process blocked
This useful support multiprocessor dual core available
This OS schedule individual thread
However slow requires system call

In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within one process executing sharing resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share executable code value variable given time
Systems single processor generally implement multithreading CPU switch different
This generally happens often rapidly enough user perceive thread task running parallel
On system multiple thread execute every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously processor core separate software thread also executed concurrently separate hardware thread
Threads made early appearance MVT context called task
The term thread attributed
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Furthermore program threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort time slicing
Threads differ traditional operating system Systems said thread process operating system great difference except cost switch architecture notably result TLB flush
In one time
The opposite multithreading
While suggested term misleading term widely accepted within community
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context one process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied one process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread either cooperatively
On widely used approach finer grained control execution time via
However preemptive scheduling may context switch thread moment unanticipated programmer therefore causing
In contrast relies thread relinquish control execution thus ensuring thread
This create problem cooperatively multitasked thread waiting thread yielding control execution intensive computation
Until early desktop computer one CPU support although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
In added support processor name introduced processor introduced processor
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
Scheduling done kernel level user level multitasking done preemptively cooperatively
This yield variety related concept
At kernel level contains one share process resource memory file handle process unit resource thread unit scheduling execution
Kernel scheduling typically uniformly done preemptively le commonly cooperatively
At user level process schedule multiple thread execution
If share data Erlang usually analogously called process share data usually called particularly preemptively scheduled
Cooperatively scheduled user thread known different process may schedule user thread differently
User thread may executed kernel thread various way
The term variously refers user thread kernel mechanism scheduling user thread onto kernel thread
A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling creating destroying switching process relatively expensive
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory code data socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way see
Creating destroying process relatively expensive resource must acquired released
Processes typically preemptively multitasked process switching relatively expensive beyond basic cost due issue cache flushing
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including thus relatively cheap create destroy
Thread switching also relatively cheap requires context switch saving restoring register stack pointer change virtual memory thus leaving TLB valid
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor SMP system contend memory bus especially locking fine
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map one scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage used
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual processor
This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation support threading provide access native threading APIs operating system
Some usually programming language language expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
Several programming language language extension also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer fully MPI
Some language designed sequential parallelism instead especially using GPUs without requiring concurrency thread
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby Python support threading concurrency parallel execution thread due GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter simultaneously interpreting application code two thread effectively limit parallelism multiple core system
This limit performance mostly thread require processor much one
Other implementation interpreted programming language using Thread extension avoid GIL limit using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation Pthreads set library call
OS vendor free implement interface desired application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface multithreading like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
Multithreading library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free multithreading function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage set number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed array thread run parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel use GPU architecture

Outline OS resource management technique scheduling policy virtual memory paging interrupt polling
An executing program resides main memory instruction processed one another
Multiprogramming technique keeping multiple program main memory time program compete access CPU work
All modern operating system employ multiprogramming one degree another
An operating system must therefore perform memory management keep track program memory memory reside
Memory continuous set bit referenced specific address
All program stored main memory executed
All data referenced program program also stored main memory accessed
Main memory thought big continuous chuck space divided group bit
Each byte word memory corresponding address simply integer uniquely identifies particular part memory
To right representation memory first memory address
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
Earlier stated multiprogramming environment multiple program data stored main memory time
Thus operating system must employ technique A program filled reference variable part program code
When program compiled reference changed address memory data code resides
But since one know exactly program loaded main memory one know address use anything
The solution use two kind address logical address physical address
A logical address sometimes called virtual relative address value specifies generic location relative program reality main memory
A physical address actual address main memory device shown figure
When program compiled reference identifier variable name changed logical address
When program eventually loaded memory logical address finally corresponds specific physical address
The mapping logical address physical address called address binding
Logical address allow program moved around memory loaded different place different time
As long one keep track program stored one always able determine physical address corresponds given logical address
The following section examine underlying principle main memory management technique
To simplify example calculation performed base
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling policy multitasking paging interrupt polling
The demand paging approach give rise idea virtual memory illusion restriction size program entire program necessarily memory time
In memory management technique examined earlier entire process brought memory continuous whole
Therefore always upper bound process size
Demand paging remove restriction
However virtual memory come lot overhead execution program
With memory management technique program loaded memory ready go
With virtual memory approach one constantly swap page main secondary memory
This overhead usually acceptable one program waiting page swapped another process take control CPU make progress
Excessive page swapping called thrashing seriously degrade system performance
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Limitations resource specific computer system often closely related hardware system capability

Storing data onto secondary storage requires mechanism organising electron medium
As use individual file used user point view smallest amount data bet written secondary memory
A file system natural solution managing file logical view operating system provides user manage data collection file
A file system often organized grouping file directory
Additionally file generic concept
Different type file managed different way
A file general contains program form data one type another

Another important resource operating system must manage use CPU individual process
TO understand operating system manages process one must recognise stage process go computational life understand information must managed keep process working correctly computer system
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
Processes move specific stage managed computer system
That process enters system ready executed executing waiting resource finished
Below flow chart represents process state
In figure box represents state process might arrow indicate process might move one state another
Examining happening process state Note many process may ready state waiting state time one process running state
After process created operating system admits ready state
When CPU scheduling algorithm dictate process dispatched running state
While running process might interrupted operating system allow another process chance CPU
In case process simply return ready state
Alternatively running process might request resource available requires retrieve newly referenced part process case moved waiting state
A running process may finally get enough CPU time complete processing terminate normally otherwise may generate unrecoverable error terminate abnormally
When waiting process get resource waiting move ready state
The operating system must manage large amount data active process
Usually data stored data structured called process control block PCB
Generally state represented list PCBs one process state
When process move one state another corresponding PCB move one state list another operating system
A new PCB created process first created new state persists process terminates

The problem capitalise computer greater capability speed led concept timesharing
A timesharing system allows multiple user interact computer time
Multiprogramming allowed multiple process active gave rise ability programmer interact computer system directly still sharing resource whereas timesharing system create illusion user exclusive access computer
That user actively compete resource though exactly happening behind scene
One user may actually know sharing machine user anything special allow
The operating system manages sharing resource including CPU behind scene
CPU scheduling act determining process ready state moved running state
That CPU scheduling algorithm decide process given CPU make computational progress
CPU scheduling decision made process switch running state waiting state program terminates
This type CPU scheduling called nonpreemptive scheduling need new CPU process result activity current executing process
CPU scheduling decision may also made process move running state ready state process move waiting state ready state
These example preemptive scheduling currently running process fault preempted operating system
Scheduling algorithm often evaluated using particular metric turnaround time process
This amount time time process arrives ready state time exit running state last time
One would like average turnaround time process small possible
There various approach used determine process get chosen first move ready state running state
Here examination three In FCFS scheduling approach process moved CPU order arrive running state
FCFS scheduling nonpreemptive
Once process given access CPU keep unless make request force wait request force wait request device use another process
The SJN CPU scheduling algorithm look process ready state dispatch one smallest service time
Like FCFS generally implemented nonpreemptive algorithm
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
CPU scheduling distributes processing time equitably among ready process
The algorithm establishes particular time slice time quantum amount time process receives preempted return ready state allow another process turn
Eventually preempted process given another time slice CPU
This procedure continues process eventually get time need terminates
Note algorithm preemptive
The expiration time slice arbitrary reason move process CPU

A type cache
Aside obvious various miscellaneous system concept require management may entirely obvious
One cache
Cache component transparently store data future request data served faster
The data stored within cache might value computed earlier duplicate original value stored elsewhere
If requested data contained cache request served simply reading cache comparatively faster
Otherwise data recomputed fetched original storage location comparatively slower
Hence greater number request served cache faster overall system performance becomes

I sure I understand LoadLibrary even find proper entry point test managed assembly
I know one possible way solve problem way I planning implement simply use CLR instance access reflection APIs check DLL managed first I puzzled fact LoadLibrary returning failure I like understand I missing
Is behavior undefined always return handle depend configuration managed assembly

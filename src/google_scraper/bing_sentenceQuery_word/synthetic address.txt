Synthetic biology build advance molecular cell system biology seek transform biology way synthesis transformed chemistry integrated circuit design transformed computing
The element distinguishes synthetic biology traditional molecular cellular biology focus design construction core component part enzyme genetic circuit metabolic pathway etc
modeled understood tuned meet specific performance criterion assembly smaller part device larger integrated system solve specific problem
Just engineer design integrated circuit based known physical property material fabricate functioning circuit entire processor relatively high reliability synthetic biologist soon design build engineered biological system
Unlike many area engineering biology incredibly le predictable le knowledge part interact
Hence overwhelming physical detail natural biology gene sequence protein property biological system must organized recast via set design rule hide information manage complexity thereby enabling engineering integrated biological system
It accomplished design significant scale possible
Synthetic biology arose four different intellectual agenda
The first scientific idea one practical test understanding ability reconstitute functional system basic part
Using synthetic biology scientist testing model biology work building system based model measuring difference expectation observation
Second idea arose biology extension chemistry thus synthetic biology extension synthetic chemistry
Attempts manipulate living system molecular level likely lead better understanding new type biological component system
Third concept natural living system evolved continue exist rather optimized human understanding intention
By thoughtfully redesigning natural living system possible simultaneously test current understanding may become possible implement engineered system easier study interact
Fourth idea emerged biology used technology biotechnology broadly redefined include engineering integrated biological system purpose processing information producing energy manufacturing chemical fabricating material
While emergence discipline synthetic biology motivated agenda progress towards synthetic biology made practical recent advent two foundational technology DNA sequencing synthesis
Sequencing increased understanding component organization natural biological system synthesis provided ability begin test design new synthetic biological part system
While example individually demonstrate incredible potential synthetic biology also illustrate many foundational scientific engineering challenge must solved order make engineering biology routine
Progress foundational challenge requires work many investigator via coordinated constructive international effort

University California Berkeley University Washington Stanford University The evaluation computer science engineering faculty promotion tenure generally followed dictate publish perish publish standard academic meaning publish archival journal Academic Careers
Relying journal publication sole demonstration scholarly achievement especially counting publication determine whether exceed prescribed threshold ignores significant evidence accomplishment computer science engineering
For example conference publication preferred field computational artifact chip etc
tangible mean conveying idea insight
Obligating faculty evaluated traditional standard handicap career indirectly harm field
This document describes appropriate evidence academic achievement computer science engineering
Computation synthetic sense many phenomenon computer scientist engineer study created human rather occurring naturally physical world
As Professor Fred Brooks University North Carolina Chapel Hill observed Academic Careers When one discovers fact nature contribution per se matter small
Since anyone create something new synthetic field alone establish contribution
Rather one must show creation better
Accordingly research computer science engineering largely devoted establishing better property
The computer science engineering field academe composed faculty apply one two basic research paradigm theory experimentation
Generalizing theoretician tend conduct research resembles mathematics
The phenomenon abstract intellectual contribution usually expressed form theorem proof
Though conference publication highly regarded theoretical community long tradition completing revising extending conference paper submission publication archival journal
Accordingly faculty pursue theoretical work often easily evaluated traditional academic mechanism
Nevertheless discussion regarding impact apply theoretical work
As second generalization experimentalists tend conduct research involves creating computational artifact assessing
The idea embodied artifact could chip circuit computer network software robot etc
Artifacts compared lab apparatus physical science engineering medium experimentation
Unlike lab apparatus however computational artifact embody idea concept well mean measure observe
Researchers test measure performance artifact evaluating effectiveness solving target problem
A key research tradition share artifact researcher greatest extent possible
Allowing one colleague examine use one creation intimate way conveying one idea journal publishing seen effective
For experimentalists conference publication preferred journal publication premier conference generally selective premier journal Academic Careers
In way experimental research variance conventional academic publication tradition
The reason conference publication preferred journal publication least experimentalists shorter time print month v year opportunity describe work one peer public presentation complete level review evaluation per paper compared archival journal Academic Careers
Publication prestige conference inferior prestige journal significant page limitation little time polish paper
In dimension count conference superior
Brooks noted researcher synthetic field must establish creation better
Better mean many thing including solves problem le time solves larger class problem efficient resource expressive criterion visually appealing case graphic present totally new capability etc
A key point type research better property simply observation
Rather research postulate new idea mechanism process algorithm representation protocol data structure methodology language optimization simplification model etc
lead better result
For researcher field making connection idea improvement important quantifying much improvement
The contribution idea generally component larger computational system
The fundamental basis academic achievement impact one idea scholarship field
What group affected form impact vary considerably
Often beneficiary research researcher
The contribution may used directly foundation artifact may change others conduct research may affect question ask topic choose study etc
It may even indicate impossibility certain goal kill line research
Clearly much number researcher affected fundamentally influence work
Users another group might feel impact research
For purpose evaluating faculty member promotion tenure two critical objective evaluation Both aspect documented complicated simply counting archival publication
Standard publication seek validate two objective indirectly arguing editor reviewer publication must satisfied claim novelty ownership true significance high enough meet journal standard
There obvious justification view standard publication acceptable albeit indirect mean assessing impact
But challenged two count
First rationale applied conference proceeding provided carefully reviewed prestige conference computer science engineering field
Second measure impact embodied quality publication
publication standard high significance presumed high
Not paper high quality publication great significance high quality paper appear lower quality venue
Publication indirect approach assessing impact implies useful definitive
The primary direct mean assessing impact document item b letter evaluation peer
Peers understand contribution well significance
Though institution demand peer letter writer selected maximize peer stature field
membership National Academy rational basis used
From point view documenting item connection faculty member contribution effect evaluator may selected faculty member collaborator competitor industrial colleague user etc
sharpest knowledge contribution impact
If artifact involved expected letter writer familiar well candidate publication record
These writer may biased course cost collecting primary data
The promotion tenure committee take bias consideration perhaps seeking additional advice
The letter writer need familiar artifact well publication
The artifact embodiment idea
Though publication necessary obvious reason contribution relating idea previous work presenting measurement experimental result etc
artifact encapsulates information captured paper
Most artifact run allowing evaluator acquire dynamic information
Further artifact complex impossible explain characteristic better observe
Artifacts essential research enterprise essential evaluation
Some school prohibit letter evaluation writer academic affiliation
This serious handicap experimental computer scientist engineer field best researcher work industrial research lab occasionally advanced development center
collaboration occur regularly based common interest advantage company resource bring implementation complex artifact
Letters researcher le informed thoughtful insightful writer return address company
In term assessing item b significance impact letter writer generally address significance quantitative data often offered well
Examples include number downloads software artifact number user number hit Web page etc
Such measure sound indicator significance influence especially indicate peer use research popularity equivalent impact
Specifically possible write valuable widely used piece software inducing large number downloads make academically significant contribution
Developers IBM Microsoft Sun etc
every day
In case software literally new might expected synthetic field created within known
It better embodying new idea technique Brooks requires
It may improved anyone schooled art would achieve similar result
Quantitative data may imply claimed manipulated
Downloads imply software actually used Web hit imply interest
There technique Googol approach http may produce objective information Web usage example caution using number always advised
Computer science engineering synthetic field creating something new part problem creation must also shown Though standard publication one indicator academic achievement form publication specifically conference publication dissemination artifact also transmit idea
Conference publication rigorous prestigious
Assessing artifact requires evaluation knowledgeable peer
Quantitative measure impact possible may tell implied story

assigns projected value usually value stated term cost time risk already ranked previous process perform qualitative risk analysis
People often confuse two process normally performed time
Perform quality risk analysis however determining probability impact risk project going prioritise rank risk register
The output process used plan risk response also monitor control risk
This contains list identify risk far project includes information response record category
This document fact risk management strategy defines level risk seen tolerable risk managed responsible carrying risk activity time cost aspect risk activity communication risk occur
Because schedule timing presented quantifiable manner risk concerned timing time scale easily quantified within process
Similar cost also quantifiable used input process
Note scope management plan quantifiable therefore normally used within qualitative risk analysis process
These may consist risk template policy procedure guideline lesson learned previous similar project quantitative risk tool
It worth mentioning risk anything may impact objective project therefore must include positive negative impact
A negative impact risk defined threat positive impact risk defined opportunity
Risk response threat act two reduce probability impact whereas risk response opportunity would want maximize probability impact risk still occur
With mind risk register updated result term risk probability along priority risk plus trend observed
These usually presented table graph represent mathematically probability risk event occurring
These probability distribution aid considering real probability happening using determine best way approach risk
This cover tool technique carrying structured interview determine probability impact risk subject matter expert
These expert must knowledge skill experience sufficient form realistic view probability impact
Rather ask expert single value project manager would normally encourage expert provide optimistic pessimistic realistic probability impact value risk
This involves analysing project determine sensitive particular risk analysing impact severity risk
In broad term determining expected monetary value multiply likelihood cost impact obtain expected value risk added obtain expected military value project
A typical way calculating EMV using decision tree These form flow diagram node represented rectangle contains description risk aspect cost
These rectangle linked together via arrow arrow leading another box representing percentage probability
These total calculated multiplying risk cost probability adding value initial cost
These named funnel shaped portray graphically project sensitivity cost factor
Each tornado diagram represent impact risk term particular aspect
These aspect may stage phase project ranked vertically represented horizontal bar showing plus minus cost impact
The common form Monte Carlo analysis normally calculated computer analysing many scenario project schedule calculating impact particular risk event helpful identifying risk effect project schedule
In similar way carrying structured interview would normally involve asking expert review risk data manner gathered
As consequence expert may also identify additional risk area

Risk analysis review risk associated particular event action
It applied project information technology security issue action risk may analyzed quantitative qualitative basis
Risk analysis component risk management
Risks part every IT project business endeavor
As risk analysis occur recurring basis updated accommodate new potential threat
Strategic risk analysis minimizes future risk probability damage
The risk management process involves key step
First potential threat identified
For example risk associated individual using computer either incorrectly inappropriately creates security risk
Risks also related project completed timely manner resulting significant cost
Next quantitative qualitative risk analysis applied study identified risk
Quantitative risk analysis measure expected risk probability forecast estimated financial loss potential risk
Qualitative risk analysis use number review threat determines establishes risk mitigation method solution
A contingency plan may used risk analysis
If risk presented contingency plan help minimize damage

Stephen worked Project Manager PMP certified well certified Scrum Alliance
Want watch later
Rick recently promoted within company
After working project manager number smaller project given larger complex project manage
His experience valuable additional responsibility come larger project must prepare
One area take work managing risk
In managing risk previous project Rick would always start identifying risk
From would complete would classify risk high medium low term impact probability
Based risk compared company comfort level potential risk Rick work would stop
None identified risk high enough combined probability impact require anything
Working larger complex project Rick know risk company risk tolerance
In managing risk need plan response
This done Rick completes involves determining specific numeric value impact risk project
The impact quantified risk typically project budget schedule
When something unexpected occurs usually cost money add additional time
This quantitative risk analysis performed end result either dollar amount timeframe
After going qualitative risk analysis risk company risk tolerance go quantitative risk analysis get clearer picture risk could mean project
As Rick explores quantitative risk analysis one thing want fully understand benefit come along
One primary benefit quantitative risk analysis provides definition risk
While qualitative risk analysis subjective quantitative risk analysis objective
Instead classification specific numeric value given create common understanding among stakeholder others involved project
The specific value resulting quantitative risk analysis enable action taken address risk planned
This important qualitative risk analysis help identify risk address quantitative risk analysis informs decision
For example one possible risk response risk shifted someone else like buying insurance
If Rick considering insurance cost transfer risk need specific dollar amount assigned risk know worth
Once Rick understands definition quantitative risk analysis benefit brings want consider example fully grasp perform new project
The first step quantitative risk analysis assign specific value probability risk occurring impact occur
From calculate specific numeric value risk
Get FREE access day create account
One possibility Rick rely past experience assign value
For example Rick working construction project risk might want prepare response would labor strike
In Rick experience five labor negotiation two time strike occurred
Based would assign probability labor strike strike negotiation strike could occur
For strike occurred lasted day Rick assigns day impact labor strike
Another approach Rick could use assign specific value probability impact would modeling technique multiple simulation run using random combination variable produce different potential result
In simulation frequency risk occurs assigned probability risk
The average value impact either dollar amount amount time assigned impact
Once Rick assigned value probability impact risk final step quantifying risk calculate value multiplying probability impact
Each value included calculation neither value provides enough
From Rick construction example quantified risk labor strike would day probability X day impact
Any risk response chooses would worthwhile took le day implement
must completed identify risk company
This determines risk go
Quantifying thesis risk involves assigning value probability impact risk multiplying together calculate specific value
This process brings definition enables planned

Suppose moment sun rise
The severity risk would threaten completion project project
In word risk posed sun rising extremely high however likelihood happening relatively small
On hand consider different sort risk
Consider one billing system server destroyed
The likelihood happening considerably higher likelihood sun rising
Unless database recently backed severity risk relatively low
In word neither risk rise level would threaten completion project

There two type risk analysis qualitative quantitative conducted simultaneously gap Qualitative
Qualitative Risk Analysis Quantitative Risk Analysis This risk analysis used identify issue cause hindrance project become risk factor future
This risk analysis focused implementation measure established protect risk defined already
It important quantify threat frequency
Results facilitate management risk return security investment
Risk analysis result necessarily expressed monetary value
Risk analysis result expressed specific quantifiable term like monetary value easier understanding
It easier involve people even expert risk analysis participate
The accuracy risk analysis increase time organization build historic record data gaining experience
It difficult form control implementation basis analysis
The process reach credible result consensus time consuming
Results dependent skill team conducting risk analysis
The process requires expertise difficult train people
Qualitative risk analysis appropriate estimate enough identifying prioritizing risk event Qualitative v
Quantitative risk analysis appropriate
The expert examines qualitative quantitative risk analysis

Risk Analysis often conducted two different way Qualitative Quantitative
For proper risk assessment project plan project management system vital understand basic defining difference

Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Courses included Welcome Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis lesson course
After risk management plan identify risk need carry analysis part risk
There two type analysis namely qualitative quantitative
already discussed previous lesson second analysis quantitative discussed lesson

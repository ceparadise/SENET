The department provides Beowulf cluster known user need high performance computing HPC cluster environment order perform work
The primary way using cluster submit batch job description resource requirement CPU RAM run time scheduler
When resource available job run
Access ionic cluster restricted current member CS department CS account alumnus limited guest account ineligible
Before attempting use cluster important join mailing list visiting link This mailing list used announce outage update cluster
More importantly joining list get added access list necessary schedule job Slurm scheduler
It also place user coordinate usage critical time conference deadline
See section detail
The cluster accessible user CS department
If interested using cluster used collaboratively user CS department OIT several cluster available
The heterogeneous cluster comprised server hardware variety source
It currently occupies three rack CS section University Data Center
Each server also called run Linux one server designated node
All server node
Each physical rack cluster contains Ethernet switch
As top position rack called unimaginatively
Each server Ethernet uplink TOR switch
The TOR switch rack contains head node Ethernet uplink department core switch
The core switch turn path CS storage system access home directory project space
Racks contain head node link TOR switch TOR switch rack contain head node
As mentioned ionic cluster heterogeneous
Typically server added year older server removed either due failure extreme old age
As result cluster contains server varying specification
The best source information hardware specification node Ganglia page cluster file system node
If need specific detail physical characteristic server available via Ganglia filesystem node contact CS Staff

Compute node cluster access three type disk storage The storage intended used stage input file read multiple time well intermediate file
By convention use create use subdirectory username The local cluster storage considered scratch user expected clean file end job
Nodes fail one reason another often without warning resulting loss data stored partition
Given nature cluster network topology possible poorly designed job overwhelm network connection back file system
If job need access remote file multiple time data fit local disk encourage structure code first copy data node access locally
This result increased performance job job running cluster well
If timing code aware accessing file system introduces latency uncertainty
Be sure time computation otherwise measuring may dominated contention Ethernet switch node NFS server NFS server SAN switch disk array disk array
The cluster built using formerly PUIAS Linux distribution clone recompile RedHat Enterprise Linux rebranding
Scheduling done MPICH LAM library collection use cluster environment also installed cluster
version parallel toolkit also available
It worth noting license cluster toolkit able use toolkit achieve higher parallelism
To find available software please check page
If need software package library currently installed compute node please contact CS Staff
If already available repository RPM distribution able install within one business day
Packages available RPM take longer prepare automated configuration management system
Please note might globally install highly specialized package unlikely used others department package conflict already installed package
In case may need install locally home directory project space access
We recommend read information submitting managing job
The scheduler assign job resource using information available
Note assign priority user group
As result time especially near conference deadline user may need coordinate amongst
For example request others hold submitting job day
To use cluster simply using CS username password
This put head node home directory
From submit job Slurm scheduler using command single process job combine MPI job
Details
The head node may used interactive work file editing
The head node may used computationally intensive process
As computational software completely absent head node
It possible get email notification job begin end abort
If submit many job short period time make sure email account prepared receive
That make sure sufficient space Inbox email provider accept message potentially high rate
The CS email system accept message cluster high rate
Because external site frequently blacklist throttle mail server inundated message high rate must send cluster email notification
If forwarding CS Princeton email account external provider Gmail please set filter way prevent forwarding message cluster
These message identified sender address slurm
Those job send large amount output STDOUT STDERR redirect output appropriately job submission script
Otherwise compute node spooling space may fill causing running job fail preventing new job starting
The cluster may brought hardware failure maintenance
Long running job designed regularly checkpoint state resumed event interruption without start entire job
There number different job type run cluster including MPI job single processor job interactive job
These type discussed detail
MPI job run single application multiple CPUs using MPI library call coordinate processing among different CPUs
Single processor job name implies run single CPU
Both job typically initiated creating job file shell script
Interactive job allow user run computationally intensive interactive program cluster developing workload batch job
Jobs submitted cluster using command
The job script always run user current working directory
The submission directory available running job environment variable
Additional shell environment variable maintained scheduling system available script runtime
For list variable see page command
Yes job exceeds requested walltime killed scheduler
If request walltime default hour
The maximum walltime request given job hour one week
For reason good idea ensure job checkpointing capability job killed fails reason lose work already performed
If wish use GPU board must specify need GPU resource using option specify many GPU device job need
Therefore sbatch option like request GPU node GPU capability
Please ensure GPU code respect variable binding GPU mechanism GPUs scheduled allocated
Jobs found using GPUs allocated may killed
Interactive job ionic cluster initiated command head node
You may also want specify resource quantity Please use salloc run interactive job rather mechanism
Using mechanism start interactive job lead failure job accounting making appear though job running extremely inefficiently
Interactive job used troubleshooting mechanism creating batch submission work
If need help forming work batch submission please contact CS Staff happy help
We also ask avoid squatting compute node opening long interactive session without actively using since tie cluster resource could performing work user
Accordingly please make sure exit session finished
Interactive job appear idle long period time may cancelled CS Staff job queue waiting use resource
MPI job ionic cluster executed using command
Here example MPI job submission script
This script assumes script file MPI program binary directory
It specifies hour wall clock time processor node total CPUs
Be sure replace actual email address
Single processor job essentially program wish run batch mode
Just anything would program shell script done single processor job ionic cluster
Of course simplest form job one run single program
You notice job script similar one used MPI job
Again sure replace actual email address
In addition walltime node specify maximum amount physical virtual memory single process job likely use
Using output email add either per node option script
The last line output job completion email includes amount memory used job
If report job used something GB physical memory could modify script line like For future run job modification give scheduler hint job expected use memory
If single processor job need run multiple time exactly command argument like get away single job script command modify line replicate job
The example script run instance command single CPU different node
As example sure replace actual email address
The result script getting submitted using get run different machine
The major problem likely encounter job start job terminate unexpectedly
The first thing look diagnosing job problem STDIN STDOUT output job
Unless direct elsewhere STDIN STDOUT written file named
Another command useful diagnosis command
This command provides accounting information may helpful diagnosing unexpected behavior
Try command like

task grouping set object way object group called similar sense another group cluster
It main task exploratory common technique used many field including
Cluster analysis one specific general task solved
It achieved various algorithm differ significantly notion constitutes cluster efficiently find
Popular notion cluster include group small among cluster member dense area data space interval particular
Clustering therefore formulated problem
The appropriate clustering algorithm parameter setting including value use density threshold number expected cluster depend individual data set intended use result
Cluster analysis automatic task iterative process interactive optimization involves trial failure
It often necessary modify data preprocessing model parameter result achieves desired property
Besides term number term similar meaning including Greek βότρυς grape
The subtle difference often usage result data mining resulting group matter interest automatic classification resulting discriminative power interest
Cluster analysis originated anthropology Driver Kroeber introduced psychology Zubin famously used beginning trait theory classification
The notion cluster precisely defined one reason many clustering algorithm
There common denominator group data object
However different researcher employ different cluster model cluster model different algorithm given
The notion cluster found different algorithm varies significantly property
Understanding cluster model key understanding difference various algorithm
Typical cluster model include A clustering essentially set cluster usually containing object data set
Additionally may specify relationship cluster example hierarchy cluster embedded
Clusterings roughly distinguished There also finer distinction possible example Clustering algorithm categorized based cluster model listed
The following overview list prominent example clustering algorithm possibly published clustering algorithm
Not provide model cluster thus easily categorized
An overview algorithm explained Wikipedia found
There objectively correct clustering algorithm noted clustering eye beholder
The appropriate clustering algorithm particular problem often need chosen experimentally unless mathematical reason prefer one cluster model another
It noted algorithm designed one kind model generally fail data set contains radically different kind model
For example find cluster
Connectivity based clustering also known based core idea object related nearby object object farther away
These algorithm connect object form cluster based distance
A cluster described largely maximum distance needed connect part cluster
At different distance different cluster form represented using explains common name hierarchical clustering come algorithm provide single partitioning data set instead provide extensive hierarchy cluster merge certain distance
In dendrogram mark distance cluster merge object placed along cluster mix
Connectivity based clustering whole family method differ way distance computed
Apart usual choice user also need decide linkage criterion since cluster consists multiple object multiple candidate compute distance use
Popular choice known minimum object distance maximum object distance Unweighted Pair Group Method Arithmetic Mean also known average linkage clustering
Furthermore hierarchical clustering agglomerative starting single element aggregating cluster divisive starting complete data set dividing partition
These method produce unique partitioning data set hierarchy user still need choose appropriate cluster
They robust towards outlier either show additional cluster even cause cluster merge known chaining phenomenon particular
In general case complexity agglomerative clustering make slow large data set
For special case optimal efficient method complexity known SLINK CLINK clustering
In community method recognized theoretical foundation cluster analysis often considered obsolete
They however provide inspiration many later method density based clustering
Gaussian data
At cluster biggest cluster start fragmenting smaller part still connected second largest due effect
cluster
cluster extracted contain single element since linkage clustering notion noise
In clustering cluster represented central vector may necessarily member data set
When number cluster fixed give formal definition optimization problem find cluster center assign object nearest cluster center squared distance cluster minimized
The optimization problem known thus common approach search approximate solution
A particularly well known approximate method often referred although
It however find commonly run multiple time different random initialization
Variations often include optimization choosing best multiple run also restricting centroid member data set choosing choosing initial center le randomly allowing fuzzy cluster assignment
Most algorithm require specified advance considered one biggest drawback algorithm
Furthermore algorithm prefer cluster approximately similar size always assign object nearest centroid
This often lead incorrectly cut border cluster surprising since algorithm optimizes cluster center cluster border
number interesting theoretical property
First partition data space structure known
Second conceptually close nearest neighbor classification popular
Third seen variation model based clustering Lloyd algorithm variation model discussed
separate data assumes cluster adequate represent cluster The clustering model closely related statistic based
Clusters easily defined object belonging likely distribution
A convenient property approach closely resembles way artificial data set generated sampling random object distribution
While theoretical foundation method excellent suffer one key problem known unless constraint put model complexity
A complex model usually able explain data better make choosing appropriate model complexity inherently difficult
One prominent method known Gaussian mixture model using
Here data set usually modeled fixed avoid overfitting number initialized randomly whose parameter iteratively optimized better fit data set
This converge multiple run may produce different result
In order obtain hard clustering object often assigned Gaussian distribution likely belong soft clustering necessary
clustering produce complex model cluster capture attribute
However algorithm put extra burden user many real data set may concisely defined mathematical model
assuming Gaussian distribution rather strong assumption data
On data EM work well since us Gaussians modelling cluster cluster modeled using Gaussian distribution In clustering cluster defined area higher density remainder data set
Objects sparse area required separate cluster usually considered noise border point
The popular density based clustering method
In contrast many newer method feature cluster model called
Similar linkage based clustering based connecting point within certain distance threshold
However connects point satisfy density criterion original variant defined minimum number object within radius
A cluster consists object form cluster arbitrary shape contrast many method plus object within object range
Another interesting property DBSCAN complexity fairly low requires linear number range query database discover essentially result core noise point border point run therefore need run multiple time
generalization DBSCAN remove need choose appropriate value range parameter produce hierarchical result related
combine idea OPTICS eliminating parameter entirely offering performance improvement OPTICS using index
The key drawback expect kind density drop detect cluster border
On data set example overlapping Gaussian distribution common use case artificial data cluster border produced algorithm often look arbitrary cluster density decrease continuously
On data set consisting mixture Gaussians algorithm nearly always outperformed method able precisely model kind data
clustering approach object moved densest area vicinity based
Eventually object converge local maximum density
Similar clustering density attractor serve representative data set detect cluster similar DBSCAN
Due expensive iterative procedure density estimation usually slower DBSCAN
Besides applicability algorithm multidimensional data hindered unsmooth behaviour kernel density estimate result cluster tail
clustering
assumes cluster similar density may problem separating nearby cluster DBSCAN variant handle different density much better In recent year considerable effort put improving performance existing algorithm
Among Ng Han Zhang et
With recent need process larger larger data set also known willingness trade semantic meaning generated cluster performance increasing
This led development method process huge data set efficiently resulting cluster merely rough data set analyze partition existing slower method
Various approach clustering tried seed based clustering
For many existing method fail due render particular distance function problematic space
This led new focus attribute used cluster model include relevant attribute cluster also look arbitrary rotated correlated subspace cluster modeled giving attribute
Examples clustering algorithm CLIQUE
Ideas clustering method particular family algorithm adopted subspace clustering HiSC hierarchical subspace clustering DiSH correlation clustering HiCO hierarchical correlation clustering using correlation connectivity ERiC exploring hierarchical correlation cluster
Several different clustering system based proposed
One Marina Meilă metric another provides hierarchical clustering
Using genetic algorithm wide range different optimized including mutual information
Also algorithm recent development led creation new type clustering algorithm
Evaluation validation clustering result difficult clustering
Popular approach involve evaluation clustering summarized single quality score evaluation clustering compared existing ground truth classification evaluation human expert evaluation evaluating utility clustering intended application
Internal evaluation measure suffer problem represent function seen clustering objective
For example one could cluster data set Silhouette coefficient except known efficient algorithm
By using internal measure evaluation rather compare similarity optimization problem necessarily useful clustering
External evaluation similar problem ground truth label would need cluster practical application usually label
On hand label reflect one possible partitioning data set imply exist different maybe even better clustering
Neither approach therefore ultimately judge actual quality clustering need human evaluation highly subjective
Nevertheless statistic quite informative identifying bad clustering one dismiss subjective human evaluation
When clustering result evaluated based data clustered called internal evaluation
Those use gold standard called external measure discussed next section although symmetric may also used measure two cluster internal evaluation
These method usually assign best score algorithm produce cluster high similarity within cluster low similarity cluster
One drawback using internal criterion cluster evaluation high score internal measure necessarily result effective information retrieval application
Additionally evaluation biased towards algorithm use cluster model
For example clustering naturally optimizes object distance internal criterion likely overrate resulting clustering
Therefore internal evaluation measure best suited get insight situation one algorithm performs better another shall imply one algorithm produce valid result another
Validity measured index depends claim kind structure exists data set
An algorithm designed kind model chance data set contains radically different set model evaluation measure radically different criterion
For example clustering find convex cluster many evaluation index assume convex cluster
On data set cluster neither use evaluation criterion assumes convexity sound
The following method used ass quality clustering algorithm based internal criterion In external evaluation clustering result evaluated based data used clustering known class label external benchmark
Such benchmark consist set item set often created expert human
Thus benchmark set thought evaluation
These type evaluation method measure close clustering predetermined benchmark class
However recently discussed whether adequate real data synthetic data set factual ground truth since class contain internal structure attribute present may allow separation cluster class may contain
Additionally point view reproduction known knowledge may necessarily intended result
In special scenario meta information class label used already clustering process information evaluation purpose
A number measure adapted variant used evaluate classification task
In place counting number time class correctly assigned single data point known metric ass whether pair data point truly cluster predicted cluster
Some measure quality cluster algorithm using external criterion include To measure cluster tendency measure degree cluster exist data clustered may performed initial test attempting clustering
One way compare data random data
On average random data cluster

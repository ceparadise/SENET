FTP File Transfer Protocol used transfer file one computer another
FTP encrypt data sends making easy hacker obtain username password
For reason block FTP protocol ensure security computer network
SCP Secure Copy alternative FTP us secure shell encryption transfer file one computer
This protects username password along file transferring outside interception
SCP simple however provides file transfer capability SFTP Secure File Transfer Protocol comprehensive alternative SCP providing simple command interface list remote local file change directory upload download file remove remote file resume interrupted transfer
To use SCP SFTP Windows need download SCP SFTP client
There several client freely available Internet
The following list popular client

Data transfer file standard transferred computer hardware application
Graphics text sound number need transferred physical medium anymore
Data file stored number format format depend created file begin
For example Microsoft Word store file Adobe Photoshop store file different format
The file extension identifies file format
When data transferred one computer another computer receiving data file may able read format without right application installed
For example image created Adobe Photoshop saved file Photoshop format would readable Microsoft Paint
This becoming le problem standardisation matures application expand list file type able read

A recording discretely
Just word written paper information written computer file
There different designed different purpose
A file may designed store picture written message wide variety kind data
Some type file store several type information
By using computer program person open read change close computer file
Computer file may reopened modified copied arbitrary number time
Typically computer file organised keep track file enables people access
The word file derives Latin thread
File used publicly context computer storage early February In RCA advertisement describing new memory vacuum tube developed RCA stated result countless computation kept file taken
Such exists tube developed RCA Laboratories
Electronically retains figure fed calculating machine hold storage memorizes new one speed intelligent solution maze mathematics
In file denoted information stored
In early use underlying hardware rather content stored denominated file
For example disk drive denominated disk file
The introduction circa MIT concept managed several virtual file one storage device origin contemporary denotation word
Although contemporary demonstrates early concept file use greatly decreased
On modern file organized array
The file defined content since file solely container data although platform format usually indicated specifying rule byte must organized interpreted meaningfully
For example byte plain text file Windows associated either character byte image video audio file interpreted otherwise
Most file type also allocate byte allows file carry basic information
Some file system store arbitrary interpreted file system data outside file format linked file example
On file system done via database
All method however susceptible loss metadata format
At instant time file might size normally expressed number indicates much storage associated file
In modern operating system size whole number byte system limit
Many older operating system kept track number occupied file physical storage device
In system software employed method track exact byte count used special control character signal end text file
The general definition file require size real meaning however unless data within file happens correspond data within pool persistent storage
A special case file newly created file yet data written may serve kind file system accident result aborted disk operation
For example file link point typical system probably defined size seldom change
Compare also file size may obscure
This misleading really file system resource including device accessed like file still real distinction file core behave obscurity size one manifestation
As character device size
Information computer file consist smaller packet information often called line individually different share common trait
For example payroll file might contain information concerning employee company payroll detail record payroll file concern one employee record common trait related similar placing payroll information specific filing cabinet office computer
A text file may contain line text corresponding printed line piece paper
Alternatively file may contain arbitrary binary image may contain
The way information grouped file entirely designed
This led plethora le standardized file structure imaginable purpose simplest complex
Most computer file used create modify delete file use basis
The programmer create program decide file needed used often name
In case computer program manipulate file made visible computer user
For example user manipulates document file user personally name
Although content document file arranged format program understands user able choose name location file provide bulk information word text stored file
Many application pack data file single file called using internal marker discern different type information contained within
The benefit archive file lower number file easier transfer reduce storage usage organize outdated file
The archive file must often unpacked next using
The basic operation program perform file Files computer created moved modified grown shrunk deleted
In case computer program executed computer handle operation user computer also manipulate file necessary
For instance file normally created modified Microsoft Word program response user command user also move file directly using Windows computer CLI
In system program operate directly low level file
Only kernel deal file handle interaction file manner transparent program
The provides level mean interaction file simply filename instead
For example delete file file
There many link file removed considers file memory space free reallocated
This commonly considered security risk due existence
Any program us system function wipe file data
In modern computer system file typically accessed using name
In operating system name associated file
In others file anonymous pointed link name
In latter case user identify name link file false analogue especially exists one link file
Files link file located directory
However generally contain either list file list link file
Within definition paramount importance term file includes directory
This permit existence directory hierarchy directory containing
A name refers file within directory must typically unique
In word must identical name within directory
However operating system name may include specification type mean directory contain identical name one type object directory file
In environment file named file name path file directory must uniquely identify among file computer two file name path
Where file anonymous named reference exist within namespace
In case name within namespace refer exactly zero one file
However file may represented within namespace zero one name
Any string character may may name file link depending upon context application
Whether name depends type computer system used
Early computer permitted letter digit name file modern computer allow long name character containing almost combination letter unicode digit making easier understand purpose file glance
Some computer system allow file name contain space others
file name determined
Unix file system usually case sensitive allow application create file whose name differ case character
support multiple file system different policy regarding
The common file system multiple file whose name differ case user us edit file name
User application however usually allow user create multiple file name differing case
Most computer organize file hierarchy using folder directory catalog
The concept irrespective terminology used
Each folder contain arbitrary number file also contain folder
These folder referred subfolders
Subfolders contain still file folder thus building structure one master folder root folder name varies one operating system another contain number level folder file
Folders named file except root folder often name
The use folder make easier organize file logical way
When computer allows use folder file folder name also path identifies folder folder file folder resides
In path sort special used separate file folder name
For example illustration shown article path uniquely identifies file called folder called turn contained folder called
The folder file name separated slash example topmost root folder name path begin slash root folder name would precede first slash
Many computer system use file name help identify contain also known file type
On Windows computer extension consist dot period end file name followed letter identify type file
An extension identifies text file extension identifies type document documentation commonly
Even extension used computer system degree computer system recognizes heed vary system required system completely ignored presented
Many modern computer system provide method protecting file accidental deliberate damage
Computers allow multiple user implement control may may modify delete create file folder
For example given user may granted permission read file folder modify delete user may given permission read modify file folder execute
Permissions may also used allow certain user see content file folder
Permissions protect unauthorized tampering destruction information file keep private information confidential unauthorized user
Another protection mechanism implemented many computer When flag turned file accomplished computer program human user file examined modified
This flag useful critical information must modified erased special file used internal part computer system
Some system also include make certain file invisible flag used computer system hide essential system file user alter
Any file useful purpose must physical manifestation
That file abstract concept real computer system must real physical analogue exist
In physical term computer file stored type data storage device
For example store file
Hard disk ubiquitous form storage since early
Where file contain temporary information may stored
Computer file also stored medium case etc
The use also beginning rival hard disk drive
In operating system many file associated physical storage device
Examples file directory
These virtual file exist object within operating system kernel
As seen running user program file usually represented either
A File control block FCB area memory manipulated establish filename
passed operating system parameter used older IBM operating system early PC operating system including early version
A file handle generally either integer introduced around running ubiquitous
When computer file contain information extremely important process used protect disaster might destroy file
Backing file simply mean making copy file separate location restored something happens computer deleted accidentally
There many way back file
Most computer system provide utility program assist process become many file safeguard
Files often copied removable medium writable CDs cartridge tape
Copying file another hard disk computer protects failure one disk necessary protect failure destruction entire computer copy file must made medium taken away computer stored safe distant location
The method automatically make three grandfather file oldest copy file son current copy
The way computer organizes name store manipulates file globally referred Most computer least one file system
Some computer allow use several different file system
For instance newer MS Windows computer older file system old version Windows supported addition file system normal file system recent version Windows
Each system advantage disadvantage
Standard FAT allows file name plus extension space example whereas NTFS allows much longer name contain space
You call file NTFS FAT would restricted something like unless using FAT extension allowing long file name
program utility program allow user manipulate file directly
They allow move create delete rename file folder although actually allow read content file store information
Every computer system provides least one program native file system
For example File Explorer formerly Windows Explorer commonly used Microsoft Windows operating system Nautilus common several distribution Linux

An ASCII file defined file consists ASCII character
It usually created using text editor like emacs pico vi Notepad etc
There fancier editor writing code may always save ASCII
As aside ASCII text file seem
After ASCII stand American
However US seem dominate software market effectively international standard
Computer science creating good abstraction
Sometimes succeeds sometimes
Good abstraction presenting view world user use
One successful abstraction text editor
When writing program typing comment hard imagine information stored character
Of course someone really said Come think character saved character
Do know ASCII code
grudgingly agree file really stored
But tough think way
ASCII file really stored
But mean say stored
Files stored disk disk way represent
We merely call also abstraction
Whatever way used store disk care provided think way
In effect ASCII file basically binary file store binary number
That ASCII file store
However since minimum workable size byte bit low bit byte
The significant bit
That mean ASCII file wasting bit
In particular significant bit byte used
Although ASCII file binary file people treat different kind file
I like think ASCII file special kind binary file
They binary file byte written ASCII code
A full general binary file restriction
Any bit pattern used byte binary file
We work binary file time
Executables object file image file sound file many file format binary file
What make binary merely fact byte binary file one bit pattern
They restricted ASCII code
What happens
For time wo worry mechanism mean open file modify close
Instead concerned ASCII encoding
If look ASCII table discover ASCII code merely indicates value hexadecimal instead
Here look Each time type ASCII character save entire byte written corresponds character
This includes punctuation space forth
I recall one time student used asterisk comment asterisk appeared
Each asterisk used one byte file
We saved thousand byte file removing comment mostly asterisk made file look nice add clarity
Thus type saved file
Now sometimes text editor throw character may expect
For example editor insist line end newline character
What mean
I asked student happens end line newline character
This student thought file saved whether student realized ir
He know saved one dimensional array
He realize newline character end line
Without newline character reached end line
The place file missing newline end line last line
Some editor allow last line end something besides newline character
Some editor add newline end every file
Unfortunately even newline character universally standard
It common use newline character UNIX file Windows common use two character end line carriage return newline I believe
Why two character one necessary
This date back printer
In old day time took printer return back beginning line equal time took type two character
So two character placed file give printer time move printer ball back beginning line
This fact important
It mostly trivia
The reason I bring case wondered transferring file UNIX Windows sometimes generates funny character
If want edit binary file really would like edit individual
For example suppose want write binary pattern
How would
You might naive type following file But I suppose edit binary file
exclaim
Sometimes I see dilemma
Students told perform task
They try task even though solution make sense still
If asked think whether solution really work might eventually reason wrong ask But I edit binary file
How I edit individual bit
The answer simple
There program allow type translates single byte instead ASCII code
You call program hex editor
Unfortunately may readily available
It hard write program read ASCII file like hex pair convert true binary file corresponding bit pattern
That take file look like convert ASCII file binary file begin binary
Notice file ASCII mean really stored ASCII code space forth
A program read ASCII file generate appropriate binary code write file
Thus ASCII file might contain byte character space output binary file would contain byte one byte per hex pair
While people prefer view file text editor conveniently view ASCII file way
Most text editor let look binary file executable insert thing look like indicate control character
A good hexdump attempt translate hex pair printable ASCII
This interesting discover say executables many part file still written ASCII
So useful feature
ASCII convenient tends use lot space
You represent information compactly using binary file
For example one thing save object file
This kind
To dump file use method
Usually pas pointer object number byte used represent object use operator determine method
The method dump byte appears memory file
You recover information file place object using corresponding method typically take pointer object point object memory allocated whether statically dynamically allocated number byte object copy byte file object
Of course must careful
If use two different compiler transfer file one kind machine another process may work
In particular object may laid differently
This simple endianness may issue padding
This way saving object file nice simple may portable
Furthermore equivalent shallow copy
If object contains pointer write address file
Those address likely totally meaningless
Addresses may make sense time program running quit restart address may change
This people invent format storing object increase portability
But know storing object contain pointer reading file kind computer system wrote using compiler work
This one reason people sometimes prefer write ints char etc
instead entire object
They tend somewhat portable
A generic binary file us
Each byte binary file full bitstring pattern opposed ASCII file bitstring pattern
There may time Unicode text file becomes prevalent
But ASCII file standard format text file

FTP open protocol standard widely used transport receive large file
It also used send configuration file software update network switch router
FTP us port communication also us encryption protect information received sent
In lesson go topic familiar FTP offer
This image show generic operation client access FTP server
The FTP server listens Port connection request sends data Port
Let look process starting establishing FTP connection using Port FTP server
The FTP client open random port initiate request
In case FTP client chooses Port
The FTP client forward request FTP connection Port FTP server listening Port
Once FTP server receives FTP connection request Port FTP server send acknowledgment back FTP client using address Port saying connection established download may commence
At point connection established FTP client FTP server
The FTP server us Port connection setup receiving command FTP client
The next step downloading data FTP server FTP client
The FTP client send data request signal FTP server
In data request FTP client tell FTP server send data I want download
Use Port delivery address
Now FTP server know send data Port FTP client The FTP server open new port Port
Port solely used send data FTP client nothing
Now using Port FTP server send data client using client Port delivery address
Once download complete client tear connection download successful
So Port
Because standard server listen FTP request sending data
You configure server use different port number desired however client need know port number FTP request get processed correctly
If client request FTP access port FTP server listening request dropped
Here example
Everyone know call emergency
But happens police changed number something different told anyone
People would still call help police would know listening different number
People try call police keeping calling calling without aware phone number changed
This concept FTP port
FTP us two protocol sending receiving file FTP using provides assurance information sent complete FTP TCP try accomplish mission complete
This add overhead information sent slower using UDP protocol
FTP using provide error checking validation verify data sent correctly unlike TCP protocol
FTP using UDP protocol called Simple File Transfer Protocol SFTP
Get FREE access day create account
So would use SFTP
Because service allows fast transfer data verify validate information received client correctly
SFTP mostly used sending configuration file router switch
These file typically kilobyte size take little effort send
SFTP recommended requirement call downloading large file
So happens need send information securely
FTP us secure method transferring information called
This protocol used different application Transport Layer Security TLS application
Some virtual private network application use send information way needed
Most FTP application let use using encryption method
This type method us bulk encryption secure
So concern using FTP would like secure information use
FTP provides user valuable tool sending receiving file
It even help u manage network device router switch
We know FTP us protocol fast delivery guaranteed FTP us best effort delivery
We understand FTP client sends request Port server server sends data back client Port
FTP us encryption order prevent hacker stealing corrupting information

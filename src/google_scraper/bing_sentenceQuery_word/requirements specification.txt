In mathematically based technique whose purpose help implementation system software
They used describe system analyze behavior aid design verifying key property interest rigorous effective reasoning tool
These specification sense syntax semantics fall within one domain able used infer useful information
In passing decade computer system become increasingly powerful result become impactful society
Because better technique needed assist design implementation reliable software
Established engineering discipline use mathematical analysis foundation creating validating product design
Formal specification one way achieve software engineering reliability predicted
Other method commonly used enhance code quality
Given possible use technique demonstrate system design correct respect specification
This allows incorrect system design revised major investment made actual implementation
Another approach use probably correct step transform specification design ultimately transformed implementation
It important note formal specification implementation rather may used develop
Formal specification describe system system
A good specification must following attribute adequate internally consistent unambiguous complete satisfied minimal A good specification One main reason interest formal specification provide ability perform proof software implementation
These proof may used validate specification verify correctness design prove program satisfies specification
A design implementation ever declared correct
It ever correct respect given specification
Whether formal specification correctly describes problem solved separate issue
It also difficult issue address since ultimately concern problem constructing abstracted formal representation informal concrete abstraction step amenable formal proof
However possible specification proving challenge concerning property specification expected exhibit
If correct theorem reinforce specifier understanding specification relationship underlying problem domain
If specification probably need changed better reflect domain understanding involved producing implementing specification
Formal method software development widely used industry
Most company consider apply software development process
This may variety reason Other limitation Formal specification technique existed various domain various scale quite time
Implementations formal specification differ depending kind system attempting model applied point software life cycle introduced
These type model categorized following specification paradigm In addition paradigm way apply certain heuristic help improve creation specification
The paper referenced best discus heuristic use designing specification
They applying approach
The example leading formal
Others include Specification Language AMN

There distinct difference requirement specification
A requirement condition needed user solve problem achieve objective
A specification document specifies complete precise verifiable manner requirement design behavior characteristic system often procedure determining whether provision satisfied
For example requirement car could maximum speed least
The specification requirement would include technical information specific design aspect
Another term commonly seen book paper requirement specification document specifies requirement system component
It includes functional requirement performance requirement interface requirement design requirement developement standard
So requirement specification simply requirement written paper
The first step toward developing accurate complete specification establish correct requirement
As easy sound establishing correct requirement extremely difficult art science
There different step one take toward establishing correct requirement
Although suggestion sound fairly obvious actually puttting practice may easy sound
The first step negotiate common understanding
There quote John von Neumann state There sense exact something even know talking
Communication designer customer vital
There point trying establish exact specification designer customer even agree requirement
Problem stem ambiguity stating requirement
For example say requirement state want create mean would transport group people Boston Washington Possible interpretation requirement includes building bus train airplane among possibility
Although transportation device satisfy requirement certainly different
Ambiguous requirement caused missing requirement ambiguous word introduced element
The requirement state fast people transported Boston Washington
Taking airplane would certainly faster riding bus train
These also missing requirement
group people requirement example ambiguous word
What exactly group imply
A group consist people people people etc
The requirement state create mean design transportation device
This example introduced element incorrect meaning slipped discussion
It important eliminate least reduce ambiguity early possible cost increase progress development life cycle
Often problem one establishing correct requirement get started
One important thing getting started ask question
question question posed early project obtain information global property design problem potential solution
Examples question include client reason solving problem environment product likely encounter time value
These question force side designer customer look higher issue
Also since question appropriate project prepared advance
Another important point get right people involved
There point discussing requirement appropriate people involved discussion
Related getting right people involved making meeting work
Having effective meeting easy sound
However since play central role establishing requirement essential know make meeting work
There important point keep mind creating effective meeting include creating culture safety participant keeping meeting appropriate size point
Exploring possibility another important step toward generating correct requirement
Ideas essential establishing correct requirement important people get together generate idea
Every project also encounter conflict
Conflicts occur personality clash people get along intergroup prejudice technical people marketing people level difference
It important facilitator present help resolve conflict
In establishing requirement important specifically establish function attribute constraint preference expectation product
Usually process gaining information function first one defined
Functions describe product going accomplish
It also important determine attribute product
Attributes characteristic desired client product similar function competely different attribute
After attribute clarified attached function must determine constraint atrributes
Preferences desirable optional condition placed attribute also defined addition constraint
Finally must determine client expectation
This largely determine success product
Testing final step road establishing correct requirement
There several testing method used listed
Establishing good requirement requires people technical communication skill
Technical skill required embedded system highly complex may require knowledge different engineering discipline electrical engineering mechanical engineering
Communication skill necessary lot exchange information customer designer
Without either two skill requirement unclear inaccurate
It essential requirement safety critical embedded system clear accurate complete
The problem requirement often weak system
In dependable system important specify system suppose specfiy system suppose
These system even greater urgency requirement complete dependable know exactly system certain state action perform
Requirements ambiguity also make system dependable
Extra requirement usually required developing dependable embedded system
For example developing dependable system people extra requirement specified make system safe even exceptional abusive situation
Systems exist everywhere universe live
The universe considered system atom
A system loosely defined considered following definition
The conceptual system design first stage system design life cycle example system definition requirement process shown Figure
Each individual box explain
Figure Example system requirement definition process In establishing system requirement first step define need
This need based want desire
Usually individual organization identifies need item function new modified system developed fulfill requirement
After need defined feasibility study conducted evaluate various technical approach taken
The system operational requirement also defined
This includes definition system operating characteristic maintenance support concept system identification specific design criterion
In particular system operational requirement include following element
Usually defining system requirement tendency cover area related performance opposed area related support
However mean emphasis placed part system whole system
It essential take consideration entire system defining system requirement
The system maintenance concept basically describes overall support environment product supposed exist
After system operational requirement system maintenance concept defined preliminary system analysis performed determine approach system development adopted
The following process usually applied
Figure Program documentation Finally conceptual design review also performed conceptual design stage
It usually occurs early system engineering development life cycle operational requirement maintenance concept defined
It important verify requirement correctly implemented design
This done requirement traceability usually refered ability follow life requirement forward backwards direction
origin development specification subsequent deployment use period refinement iteration phase
Requirements traceability capture relationship requirement specification design
Standards system development one Department Defense standard require requirement traceability used
Although requirments traceability around decade consensus kind information used part traceability scheme
The problem definition traceability differs taken different point view system
view system different customer project manager test engineer etc
Each organization different purpose methodology requirement tracing
While purpose paper dwell long discussion requirement traceability short example methodology used one organization given
The project typically involved Abbott Laboratories Diagnostics Division embedded vitro diagnostic instrument approaching line code
They found traceability aid project manager verification cost reduction accountability change management
Traceability help verifying software requirement satisfied design process tested verification process
Traceability allows allocation product requirement early development cycle thereby reducing cost correcting defect due untraceable component integration system test phase
Providing quantitative traceability analysis also allows accountability making sure project milestone approved deliverable verified customer satisfied
The documentation traceability also keep information organized change staff management
A specific vitro diagnostic instrument contained approximately line source code approximately software requirement needed traced
While division also automated traceability system ATS allowed automate many task process tool led success
The main purpose traceability program identify link determine link complete accurate
The traceability analysis consists aspect forward requirement analysis reverse requirement trace forward test analysis reverse test trace
These step used trace software requirement design element test trace
The ATS used design documentation matrix test matrix used perform different analysis required
The ATS also able give feedback design component yet implemented life cycle
In test phase ATS give input requirement covered test case
There many requirement specification standard
They mostly military standard opposed commercial standard
In addition standard system engineering area particular deal software aspect
A good reference many standard Standards Guidelines Examples System Software Requirements Engineering IEEE Computer Society Press
This book compilation international requirement standard military standard
There also section requirement analysis methodology example
Listed several relevant standard list mean exhaustive
There also exists requirement simulation tool
Foresight produced Nu Thena Systems allows designer capture system requirement design graphical executable system model
These model analyzed simulated ensure requirement correctness
Nu The SES workbench simulation software tool focus behavioral performance modeling
Rational Rose visual modeling tool among feature allows UML modeling
The trend towards executable requirement simulation
The Unified Modeling Language UML modeling language specification complex system
UML represents large effort number methodologists construct common mean describing complex system using object orientation
It specification language development process detail given feature link together system development
UML relatively new language still going debate feasibility using embedded system
The main concern using object oriented language embedded system speed size application
Some point support programming embedded system object effecient developer write larger system fewer defect le time using OO method instead structured method OO implemented language including assembly language
Other people also stated argument using UML embedded system
In particular restriction architectural modeling cited one shortfall
For example predefined node stereotype help improve standardization lack predefined stereotype mean capability capture information depth fully describe operational property system
Another shortfall deal deficiency concurrency modeling schedulability
However UML still relatively new time tell effective specification development embedded system
It would also helpful technique assist structured development correct accurate requirement
In particular Quality Function Deployment QFD method structured product planning development enables development team specify clearly customer want need evaluate proposed product service capability systematically term impact meeting need
QFD based matrix show relationship example customer need feature system
Figure show example matrix give relationship row column
For example say row defines customer want car
Lets say A car look cool B car never break
The column specific feature car
Lets say good gas mileage b aerodynamic styling
Each box represents relationship customer want feature car
A car good gas mileage related car looking cool relation
However car aerodynamic styling would look cool strong relation
Similarly car never break possible relation good gas relation much relation aerodynamic styling
Figure Example matrix used QFD

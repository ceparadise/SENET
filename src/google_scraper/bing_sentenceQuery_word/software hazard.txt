In domain CPU problem CPU next instruction execute following clock cycle potentially lead incorrect computation result
Three common type hazard data hazard structural hazard control flow hazard branching hazard
There several method used deal hazard including bubbling case method
pipelined processor performed several stage given time several instruction processed various stage pipeline fetch execute
There many different instruction pipeline instruction may
A hazard occurs two simultaneous possibly order instruction conflict
Data hazard occur instruction exhibit modify data different stage pipeline
Ignoring potential data hazard result also termed race hazard
There three situation data hazard occur Consider two instruction occurring program order
try read source writes A read write RAW data hazard refers situation instruction refers result yet calculated retrieved
This occur even though instruction executed prior instruction prior instruction processed partly pipeline
For example The first instruction calculating value saved register second going use value compute result register
However operand fetched operation result first yet saved hence data dependency occurs
A data dependency occurs instruction dependent completion instruction
try write destination read A write read WAR data hazard represents problem concurrent execution
For example In situation chance may finish concurrent execution must ensured result register stored chance fetch operand
try write operand written A write write WAW data hazard may occur environment
For example The write back WB must delayed finish executing
A structural hazard occurs part processor hardware needed two instruction time
A canonical example single memory unit accessed fetch stage instruction retrieved memory memory stage data written read memory
They often resolved separating component unit separate cache
Branching hazard also termed control hazard occur
On many instruction pipeline microarchitectures processor know outcome branch need insert new instruction pipeline normally stage
also termed method preclude data structural branch hazard
As instruction fetched control logic determines whether hazard occur
If true control logic insert pipeline
Thus next instruction would cause hazard executes prior one sufficient time finish prevent hazard
If number equal number stage pipeline processor cleared instruction proceed free hazard
All form stalling introduce delay processor resume execution
occurs branch instruction jump new memory location invalidating prior stage pipeline
These prior stage cleared allowing pipeline continue new instruction indicated branch
There several main solution algorithm used resolve data hazard In case algorithm used The task removing data dependency delegated compiler fill appropriate number instruction dependent instruction ensure correct operation instruction possible
For example write value register already contains add register store result register
Following execution register contain value
However Instruction write register fully exit pipeline Instruction start executing mean Register contain value Instruction performs addition
In event Instruction add old value register register contains instead
This error occurs Instruction read Register Instruction result write operation Register
So Instruction reading content Register register still contains
Forwarding described help correct error depending fact output Instruction used subsequent instruction value committed Register
Forwarding applied example mean The effect Instruction us correct recent value Register made immediately pipelined
With forwarding enabled stage pipeline two input value read register specified example value Register new value Register example value sent next stage
Added control logic used determine input use
To avoid control hazard microarchitectures In event branch cause pipeline bubble incorrect instruction entered pipeline care must taken prevent instruction effect processor state excluding energy wasted processing discovered loaded incorrectly
Memory latency another factor designer must attend delay could reduce performance
Different type memory different accessing time memory
Thus choosing suitable type memory designer improve performance pipelined data path

As type advocate frequent release short development cycle intended improve productivity introduce checkpoint new customer requirement adopted
Other element extreme programming include programming extensive code avoiding programming feature actually needed flat management structure code simplicity clarity expecting change customer requirement time pass problem better understood frequent communication customer among programmer
The methodology take name idea beneficial element traditional software engineering practice taken extreme level
As example considered beneficial practice taken extreme code reviewed
practice
Extreme programming created work payroll project
Beck became March began refine development methodology used project wrote book methodology October published
cancelled project February seven year company acquired
Many extreme programming practice around time methodology take extreme level
For example practice development planning writing test used early NASA early
To shorten total development time formal test document developed parallel shortly software ready testing
A NASA independent test group write test procedure based formal requirement logical limit software written integrated hardware
In XP concept taken extreme level writing automated test perhaps inside software module validate operation even small section software coding rather testing larger feature
Software development shaped two major influence internally replaced programming paradigm favored industry externally rise Internet emphasized company growth competitive business factor
Rapidly changing requirement demanded shorter often incompatible traditional method software development
The started order determine best way use object technology using payroll system Chrysler object research language
They brought prominent Smalltalk practitioner system role expanded noted several problem development process
He took opportunity propose implement change practice based work frequent collaborator
Beck describes early conception method The first time I asked lead team I asked little bit thing I thought sensible like testing review
The second time lot line
I thought Damn torpedo least make good article asked team crank knob thing I thought essential leave everything else
Beck invited project help develop refine method
Jeffries thereafter acted coach instill practice habit team
Information principle practice behind XP disseminated wider world discussion original Cunningham
Various contributor discussed expanded upon idea methodology resulted see
Also XP concept explained several year using system map XP website circa
Beck edited series book XP beginning spreading idea much larger audience
Authors series went various aspect attending XP practice
The series included book critical practice
XP generated significant interest among software community late early seeing adoption number environment radically different origin
The high discipline required original practice often went wayside causing practice thought rigid deprecated reduced even left unfinished individual site
For example practice particular project could changed schedule simply reduced mutually agreed date
Such relaxed schedule could avoid people feeling rushed generate artificial stub pas testing
A schedule allows instead complex feature fully developed period
Meanwhile agile development practice stood still XP still evolving assimilating lesson experience field use practice
In second edition November five year first edition Beck added value practice differentiated primary corollary practice
describes extreme programming discipline organizes people produce software productively
XP attempt reduce cost change requirement multiple short development cycle rather long one
In doctrine change natural inescapable desirable aspect project planned instead attempting define stable set requirement
Extreme programming also introduces number basic value principle practice top agile programming framework
XP describes four basic activity performed within software development process coding testing listening designing
Each activity described
The advocate XP argue truly important product system development process code software instruction computer interpret
Without code working product
Coding also used figure suitable solution
Coding also help communicate thought programming problem
A programmer dealing complex programming problem finding hard explain solution fellow programmer might code simplified manner use code demonstrate mean
Code say proponent position always clear concise interpreted one way
Other programmer give feedback code also coding thought
Extreme programming approach little testing eliminate flaw lot testing eliminate many flaw
encouraged initially daily activity early detection incompatible interface reconnect separate section diverged widely coherent functionality
However integration testing reduced weekly le often depending stability overall interface system
Programmers must listen customer need system needed
They must understand need well enough give customer feedback technical aspect problem might solved solved
Communication customer programmer addressed
From point view simplicity course one could say system development need coding testing listening
If activity performed well result always system work
In practice work
One come long way without designing given time one get stuck
The system becomes complex dependency within system cease clear
One avoid creating design structure organizes logic system
Good design avoid lot dependency within system mean changing one part system affect part system
Extreme programming initially recognized four value communication simplicity feedback courage
A new value respect added second edition
Those five value described
Building software system requires communicating system requirement developer system
In formal software development methodology task accomplished documentation
Extreme programming technique viewed method rapidly building disseminating institutional knowledge among member development team
The goal give developer shared view system match view held user system
To end extreme programming favor simple design common metaphor collaboration user programmer frequent verbal communication feedback
Extreme programming encourages starting simplest solution
Extra functionality added later
The difference approach conventional system development method focus designing coding need today instead tomorrow next week next month
This sometimes summed YAGNI approach
Proponents XP acknowledge disadvantage sometimes entail effort tomorrow change system claim compensated advantage investing possible future requirement might change become relevant
Coding designing uncertain future requirement implies risk spending resource something might needed perhaps delaying crucial feature
Related communication value simplicity design coding improve quality communication
A simple design simple code could easily understood programmer team
Within extreme programming feedback relates different dimension system development Feedback closely related communication simplicity
Flaws system easily communicated writing unit test prof certain piece code break
The direct feedback system tell programmer recode part
A customer able test system periodically according functional requirement known
To quote Optimism occupational hazard programming
Feedback treatment
Several practice embody courage
One commandment always design code today tomorrow
This effort avoid getting bogged design requiring lot effort implement anything else
Courage enables developer feel comfortable code necessary
This mean reviewing existing system modifying future change implemented easily
Another example courage knowing throw code away courage remove source code obsolete matter much effort used create source code
Also courage mean persistence A programmer might stuck complex problem entire day solve problem quickly next day persistent
The respect value includes respect others well
Programmers never commit change break compilation make existing fail otherwise delay work peer
Members respect work always striving high quality seeking best design solution hand refactoring
Adopting four earlier value lead respect gained others team
Nobody team feel unappreciated ignored
This ensures high level motivation encourages loyalty toward team toward goal project
This value dependent upon value much oriented toward people team
The first version rule XP published Don Wells XP website
rule given category planning managing designing coding testing
Planning managing designing called explicitly counter claim XP support activity
Another version XP rule proposed Ken Auer Universe
He felt XP defined rule practice subject variation ambiguity
He defined two category Rules Engagement dictate environment software development take place effectively Rules Play define activity rule within framework Rules Engagement
The principle form basis XP based value described intended foster decision system development project
The principle intended concrete value easily translated guidance practical situation
Extreme programming see feedback useful done frequently promptly
It stress minimal delay action feedback critical learning making change
Unlike traditional system development method contact customer occurs frequent iteration
The customer clear insight system developed give feedback steer development needed
With frequent feedback customer mistaken design decision made developer noticed corrected quickly developer spends much time implementing
Unit test contribute rapid feedback principle
When writing code running unit test provides direct feedback system reacts change made
This includes running unit test test developer code running addition unit test software using automated process initiated single command
That way developer change cause failure portion system developer know little nothing automated suite reveal failure immediately alerting developer incompatibility change part system necessity removing modifying change
Under traditional development practice absence automated comprehensive suite meant code change assumed harmless developer would left place appearing integration testing worse production determining code change caused problem among change made developer week even month previous integration testing formidable task
This treating every problem solution extremely simple
Traditional system development method say plan future code reusability
Extreme programming reject idea
The advocate extreme programming say making big change work
Extreme programming applies incremental change example system might small release every three week
When many little step made customer control development process system developed
The principle embracing change working change embracing
For instance one iterative meeting appears customer requirement changed dramatically programmer embrace plan new requirement next iteration
Extreme programming described practice grouped four area The practice XP heavily debated
Proponents extreme programming claim customer request change informally process becomes flexible save cost formal overhead
Critics XP claim lead costly rework project beyond previously agreed funded
board sign potential conflict project objective constraint multiple user
XP expedited method somewhat dependent programmer able assume unified client viewpoint programmer concentrate coding rather documentation compromise objective constraint
This also applies multiple programming organization involved particularly organization compete share project
Other potentially controversial aspect extreme programming include Critics noted several potential drawback including problem unstable requirement documented compromise user conflict lack overall design specification document
Historically XP work team twelve fewer people
One way circumvent limitation break project smaller piece team smaller group
It claimed XP used successfully team hundred developer
claimed reasonable success distributed XP project sixty people
In industrial extreme programming IXP introduced evolution XP
It intended bring ability work large distributed team
It practice flexible value
In Doug Rosenberg published questioned value XP process suggested way could improved
This triggered lengthy debate article Internet newsgroups chat area
The core argument book XP practice interdependent practical organization adopt practice therefore entire process fails
The book also make criticism draw likeness XP collective ownership model socialism negative manner
Certain aspect XP changed since publication particular XP accommodates modification practice long required objective still met
XP also us increasingly generic term process
Some argue change invalidate previous criticism others claim simply watering process
Other author tried reconcile XP older methodology order form unified methodology
Some XP sought replace example
tried combining XP computer programming method CMMI
They found three system reinforced well leading better development mutually contradict
Extreme programming initial buzz controversial tenet attracted particular criticism one coming McBreen Boehm Matt Stephens Doug Rosenberg
Many criticism however believed Agile practitioner misunderstanding agile development
In particular extreme programming reviewed critiqued Matt Stephens Doug Rosenberg
Criticisms include

Oftentimes little thing make biggest difference
Consider tenet new programming approach keep code simple review frequently test early often work week
Programmer Kent Beck developed extreme programming XP serving project leader Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation project rewrite Chrysler payroll application
Beck spelled development methodology book titled Extreme Programming Explained Embrace Change
Since advocate XP cropped like kudzu sparked maelstrom debate among programmer project manager either love love hate idea
According Beck XP lightweight methodology meaning dispenses much usual application development process lengthy requirement definition extensive documentation emphasizes keeping development team small code simple
Instead creating large document XP project begin end user software create user story describing new application need
Functional testing requirement done coding begin automated testing code done throughout project
Refactoring frequent streamlining design improving also core doctrine
XP devotee say methodology help deliver code quickly fewer bug
By creating user story performing upfront functional testing Noggin LLC able quickly restart project bogged six month functional requirement written say Kenny Miller vice president programming production New entertainment channel
With XP client able see result sooner say Wyatt Sutherland director technology New CodeFab managed Noggin project
We try pair programming case unit testing task creation refactoring
CodeFab client decide whether project include XP say Sutherland elect use
XP also requires constant communication customer developer team well among developer
Beck advises limiting project team developer working pair
Pair programming perhaps controversial aspect XP
Two developer work side side single assignment
Beck claim duo approach lead code requires le time test debug
Coding easy get distracted disciplined say Tim MacKinnon senior developer Connextra With pair programming like conscience sitting next
The reorganized development space accommodate XP said
MacKinnon brought special curved desk developer pair could sit side side share computer
But pair programming wo work every company developer
When XP work well work generalize well say Jim Duggan analyst Gartner Stamford You ca sit two programmer terminal expect good result fly face many people program
Programmers consider master artist Duggan continues
And two artist palette going fight brush
James Gosling vice president fellow Sun Microsystems say company us XP technique unit performance testing passed pair programming
I know people would say
It give people I know creep
But people might make sense
It pair programming slowed adoption XP
Steve Metsker software development manager Falls Church Capital One Financial cite collective code ownership problematic
In XP anyone change code explains
But I want someone change threading model data access architecture
Metsker project team built call center application telecommunication unit Capital One using XP method
Although lauds productivity gained XP method unit testing peer code review obtaining rapid feedback customer Metsker said current project wo adopt XP
Still Duggan say XP focus core development fundamental causing developer look closely methodology
One thing good XP simplifies thing developer classically like like testing code review
And anything make developer desirable thing add Duggan
But right enough evidence yet XP breakthrough team embrace

Extreme Programming Term Paper available

Graham Wright BigHand Many developer running traditionally organised software project struggle deliver business value particularly within described internet timescales
In response agile method accept changing requirement natural part successful development project grown popularity
Agile software development comprises number methodology differing detail share common emphasis These principle formed basis state Extreme programming XP one form agile development particular emphasis engineering practice within programming team
It first developed Kent Beck late
In agile development spectrum XP sits one end variant emphasise project management Scrum end
Some engineering practice associated XP pair programming development refactoring continuous integration
These aimed improving code quality responsiveness change
Pair programming improves quality collaboration two developer based principle two head better one
Alternatively thought continuous code review
Pair programming effective method spreading knowledge throughout development team particular new member join
Pairs also tend hold accountable maintaining team practice standard
Test driven development TDD ensures full test coverage test written code tested
However scope TDD much wider traditional role programmer unit test
In XP entire test suite constitutes executable definition software developed
As definition always line behaviour software unlike specification often diverge system finally delivered
TDD also process continuous design
Functionality added incrementally specifying newly required behaviour form test
This focus development essence business requirement prevents programmer adding unnecessary whistle code
The process writing test enforces good design
It hard write test system loosely coupled highly cohesive
If adding new test becomes difficult signal programmer system design deficient
Refactoring process design existing code improved without changing behaviour intimately linked development
The existence unit test allows structure code improved confidence detected
An XP project integration phase
Instead employ continuous integration
This involves frequent checking code change central repository regular automated build entire system
This ensures working system incorporating latest change functionality always available
The customer role crucial XP
The customer part development team
If possible customer available regular discussion programmer
The customer specifies business functionality form user story also supply acceptance test verify story implemented correctly
Ideally test automated run alongside programmer unit test automated build process
Since initial description XP role customer changed could refer team individual rather single person
However XP continues maintain rigorous separation programmer technical responsibility business responsibility customer
In common agile method XP aim deliver software short increment
These increment generally one two week period referred
XP planning process emphasis maximising business value
The customer able change feature priority iteration based implementation estimate provided programmer
This interaction customer programmer formulate release plan known planning game drive XP project forward
The subtitle Kent Beck book first described extreme programming change
This remains XP promise
XP reject common assumption software project must undergo rigorous requirement gathering design phase development software begin
Instead postulate software evolve feature implemented customer respond software deepening understanding next key business requirement
Continuous collaboration programming customer member development team mean speedy response changing requirement possible result software provides maximum business value delivered rapidly
The iterative nature development emphasis collaboration programmer customer instead requirement design documentation make extreme programming controversial
To many could seem excuse hacking code uncontrolled fashion
Another common criticism pairing expensive use programming staff
In response XP advocate point failure many project based traditional document heavy process stress incremental design design
Additionally XP emphasis engineering practice make highly disciplined process
XP advocate say pair programming justifies cost improvement code quality reduction bug
The programming practice within extreme programming team planning process radically different traditionally organised project
As difficult adopt XP merely reading description
Engineering practice pair programming development contradict many accepted method working initially difficult programmer adopt successfully
The crucial customer role even difficult master involves new way interacting programmer team also managing impact iterative development rest business
This often harder changing way team operates
These difficulty transforming practice mean key requirement successful adoption XP coaching mentoring programming business member development team
Over recent year agile method general extreme programming specifically grown popularity
Despite early adopter phase still underway generalised XP becomes depend success early project
As much software engineering empirical evidence scarce growing body successful XP project

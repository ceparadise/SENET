Portability relation software measure easily application transferred one computer environment another
A computer software application considered portable new environment effort required adapt new environment within reasonable limit
The meaning abstract term depends upon nature application often difficult express quantifiable unit
The phrase port mean modify software make adaptable work different computer system
For example port application Linux mean modify program run Linux environment
Portability refers ability application move across environment across platform
To clarify computer platform generally refers operating system computer hardware
A computer environment much broader may include hardware operating system interface software user programmer
Portability form reusability
Some kind software known le portable others
An example software portable would assembly code since assembly code specific processor type
No software perfectly portable software limitation
Some programming language fairly portable example C language
C compiler readily available majority operating system turn make C program portable
This portability C language program resulted programmer program recompiling C make much portable
Portability also used describe flexibility use data
Some file format le portable others
For example view file file format PDF JPEG format depend availability appropriate software application

Software developer often claim software write meaning little effort needed adapt new environment amount effort actually needed depends several factor including extent original environment differs new environment experience original author knowing construct third party library call unlikely portable amount effort invested original author using portable construct platform specific construct often provide cheaper solution
The number significantly different CPUs operating system used desktop today much smaller past dominance mean desktop software never ported different CPU
In market choice operating system effectively reduced three
However market remains significant issue widely used alternative
International standard promulgated greatly facilitate porting specifying detail computing environment way help reduce difference different
Writing software stay within bound specified standard represents practical although nontrivial effort
Porting program two platform matter loading source code new platform
However practitioner often find various minor correction required due subtle platform difference
Most standard suffer gray area difference interpretation standard lead small variation platform platform
There also exists number tool facilitate porting provides consistent programming language different platform automates detection minor variation environment adapts software accordingly compilation
The compiler
gain portability outputting source code another high level compiler many platform generally available
Two activity related distinct porting Instead translating directly modern translate machine independent order enhance portability compiler minimize design effort
The intermediate language defines execute program written machine defined language vice versa
The intermediate code instruction translated equivalent machine code sequence create also possible skip generation machine code actually implementing virtual machine
The use intermediate code enhances portability compiler machine dependent code interpreter code generator compiler need ported target machine remainder compiler imported intermediate code processed ported code generator interpreter thus producing compiler software directly executing intermediate code interpreter
The machine independent part developed tested another machine greatly reduces design effort machine independent part need developed create portable intermediate code
An interpreter le complex therefore easier port code generator able code optimization due limited view program code see one instruction time need sequence optimization interpreter extremely easy port make minimal assumption instruction set underlying hardware
As result virtual machine even simpler target CPU
Writing compiler source entirely programming language compiler supposed translate make following approach better known feasible target machine The difficult part coding optimization routine done using language instead assembly language target
According designer language interpreted code BCPL case compact machine code typically factor two one
Interpreted code however run ten time slower compiled code machine
The designer try take advantage compactness interpreted code Java program may need transmitted Internet execution start target
Porting also term used designed run one platform converted run different platform
Earlier video game port often true port rather reworked version game
However many century video game developed using software often output code one console well PC without need actual porting instead relying common porting individual component
Many early port suffered significant gameplay quality issue computer greatly differed

Reviews complained port suffered Apple conversionitis retaining Apple lousy sound graphic Garriott statement asked Atari Commodore people audience happy Apple rewrite
audience shouted No
Garriott responded otherwise Apple version never get done
From publisher point view money wise
Others worked differently
example wrote Atari first preferred develop advanced computer removing altering feature necessary porting
Such policy always feasible Bunten stated
ca done Apple version inferior
When game referred arcade perfect mean game ported version another platform console computer without significant alteration game working mean graphic sound along game characteristic including bug faithful arcade version
It term mostly used professional critic sometimes always mean game identical usually mean difference may minor longer loading time simply port may one preserved experience original game
Console port game originally made console Wii identical version created played console
This term widely used gaming community process porting game console PC often regarded negatively due higher level performance computer generally underutilized partially due console hardware fixed throughout run game developed console spec PCs become powerful hardware evolves also due ported game sometimes poorly optimized PCs lazily ported

Also first autocode compiler developed Alick Glennie Mark computer University Manchester considered first compiled programming language
The FORTRAN team led John Backus IBM generally credited introduced first unambiguously complete compiler COBOL early language compiled multiple architecture
In many application domain idea using higher level language quickly caught expanding functionality supported newer programming language increasing complexity computer architecture compiler become complex
Early compiler written assembly language first compiler capable compiling source code language created Lisp programming language Tim Hart Mike Levin MIT
Since become practice implement compiler language compiles
The GNU Compiler Collection compiler system produced GNU Project supporting various programming language
GCC key component GNU toolchain compiler Operating Systems
The Free Software Foundation distributes GCC GNU General Public License GCC played important role growth free software tool example
Originally named GNU C Compiler handled C programming language
It extended compile December year front end later developed Fortran Java Ada Go among others
Version OpenMP specification supported C compiler default current version support superset superset strict standard support also available
It also provides support later
GCC ported variety instruction set architecture
GCC also available embedded system including AMCC compiler target wide variety platform
Versions also available Microsoft Windows operating system GCC compile code Android iOS
In effort bootstrap GNU operating system Richard Stallman asked Andrew Tanenbaum Tanenbaum told Free University free compiler Stallman decided write
Stallmans initial plan rewrite existing compiler Lawrence Livermore Laboratory Pastel C help Len Tower none Pastel compiler code ended GCC though Stallman use C front end written
GCC first released March available FTP MIT multiple fork proved inefficient unwieldy however difficulty getting work accepted official GCC project greatly frustrating many
In group developer formed GNU Compiler System merge several experimental fork single project basis merger GCC development snapshot taken release
Projects merged included PGCC many improvement many new architecture release July two project united
GCC since maintained group programmer around world direction steering committee
It ported kind processor operating system compiler GCC ported wide variety instruction set architecture widely deployed tool development free proprietary software
GCC also available embedded system including Symbian AMCC compiler target wide variety platform including video game console PlayStation Cell SPE PlayStation Dreamcast
The GNU Build System also known Autotools suite programming tool designed assist making source code package portable many system
It difficult make software program portable C compiler differs system system certain function missing system
Autotools designed address problem manageably Autotools part GNU toolchain widely used many free software open source package
Its component tool free GNU General Public License special license exception permitting use proprietary software GNU Build System make possible build many program using process configure followed make
Autotools consists GNU utility program Autoconf Automake related tool frequently used alongside include GNUs make program GNU gettext GNU Compiler Collection also called GCC
Autoconf generates configure script based content configure
ac file characterizes body source code
Finally make program us Makefile generate executable program source code complexity Autotools reflects variety circumstance body source code may built
If source file changed suffices make part body source code affected change
If file changed suffices config
status body source code copied another computer sufficient configure make
If body code changed fundamentally configure
ac
To process file autoconf us GNU implementation macro system Automake help create portable Makefiles turn processed make utility
It take input Makefile
turn Makefile
also performs automatic dependency tracking every time source file compiled list dependency recorded
Later time make run dependency appears changed Libtool help manage creation static dynamic library various operating system
Libtool accomplishes abstracting process hiding difference various system gnulib simplifies process making software us Autoconf Automake portable wide range system
In case user simply run supplied configure script need Autotools installed computer
It used building program build machine also architecture
This make building software Windows operating system bit harder system provides Bourne shell standard component
One install Cygwin MSYS system top Windows provide compatibility layer though although developer expected provide configure script occasionally user may wish configure script
C originally developed Dennis Ritchie Bell Labs used Unix operating system
C standardized American National Standards Institute since C imperative procedural language
Therefore C useful application formerly coded assembly language
Despite capability language designed encourage programming portably written C program compiled wide variety computer platform operating system change source code
The language become available wide range platform
In C code contained within subroutine called function
Function parameter passed value
simulated C explicitly passing pointer value C program source text using semicolon statement terminator curly brace grouping block statement
The C language also exhibit characteristic There small fixed number keywords including full set flow control primitive switch
name distinguished keywords kind sigil There large number arithmetical logical operator etc
More one assignment may performed single statement function return value ignored needed
Typing static weakly enforced data type C define keyword instead statement beginning name type taken declaration
There function keyword instead function indicated parenthesis argument list compound type possible
Heterogeneous aggregate data type allow related data element accessed assigned unit array indexing secondary notation defined term pointer arithmetic
Unlike structs array object assigned compared using single operator There array keyword use definition instead square bracket indicate array syntactically example month
Enumerated type possible enum keyword tagged freely interconvertible integer
Strings data type conventionally implemented array character
access memory possible converting machine address typed pointer
In computing emulator hardware software enables one computer system behave like another computer system
An emulator typically enables host system run software use peripheral device designed guest system emulation refers ability computer program electronic device emulate another program device
Many printer example designed emulate LaserJet printer much software written HP printer
If printer emulates HP printer software written real HP printer also run printer emulation produce equivalent printing
Since least today video game enthusiast use emulator play arcade game using original programming code hardware emulator emulator take form hardware device
In theoretical sense thesis implies operating environment emulated within environment
However practice difficult particularly exact behavior system emulated documented deduced reverse engineering
Emulation strategy digital preservation combat obsolescence emulation address original hardware software environment digital object recreates current machine
The emulator allows user access kind application operating system current platform state apply date system also upwardly mobile future unknown system
Potentially better graphic quality original hardware potentially additional feature original hardware didnt
Emulators maintain look feel behavior digital object
Despite original cost developing emulator may prove cost efficient solution time many emulator already developed released GNU General Public License open source environment allowing wide scale collaboration
Emulators allow software exclusive one system used another example PlayStation exclusive video game could played PC using emulator
This especially useful system difficult obtain
Copyright law yet effect address saving documentation protection make difficult design emulator since must accurate enough avoid triggering protection whose effect may obvious
Emulators require better hardware system
Because use digital format new medium art relies heavily emulation preservation strategy
The paradox emulation emulator made work future computer emulation technique commonly used design development new system
A cross compiler compiler capable creating executable code platform one compiler running
For example compiler run Windows PC cross compiler necessary compile multiple platform one machine
A platform could infeasible compiler run paravirtualization one machine run many operating system cross compiler could generate executable one main source
Cross compiler confused compiler cross compiler software development binary code compiler translates one programming language another text code
The fundamental use compiler separate build environment target environment
This useful number situation Embedded computer device extremely limited resource computer powerful enough run compiler file system development environment
Since debugging testing may require resource available embedded system le involved
For example company may wish support different version operating system support several different operating system
By using compiler single build environment set compile target
When developing software new platform emulator platform one us cross compiler compile necessary tool operating system
Compiling native code emulator older platform like Commodore Apple II enthusiast use cross compiler run current platform
Use virtual machine resolve reason cross compiler developed Canadian Cross technique building cross compiler machine
Given three machine A B C one us machine A build compiler run machine B create executables machine When using Canadian Cross GCC may four compiler involved term Canadian Cross came time issue discussion Canada three national political party
ALGOL generated ZCODE aided porting compiler application alternate platform compile ALGOL compiler required memory
With memory small actually compile compiler compiler cross compiled larger CAP capability computer IBM mainframe
GCC software collection compiler set cross compile
It support many platform language GCC requires compiled copy binutils available targeted platform
Machine code machine language set instruction executed directly computer central processing unit
Each instruction performs specific task load
Every program directly executed CPU made series instruction numerical machine code may regarded representation compiled assembled computer program primitive programming language
While possible write directly numerical machine code tedious error prone manage individual bit calculate numerical address
For reason machine code almost never used program modern context
Almost practical program today written language assembly language
However interpreter may seen executor processor performing instruction source code every processor processor family machine code instruction set
Instructions pattern bit physical design correspond different command machine thus instruction set specific class processor using architecture
Successor derivative processor design often include instruction predecessor system may also differ detail memory arrangement operating system peripheral device
Because program normally relies factor different system run machine code
A machine code instruction set may instruction length pattern organized varies strongly particular architecture often also type instruction
Not machine individual instruction explicit operand accumulator machine combined left operand result implicit accumulator arithmetic instruction
Other architecture accumulator version common instruction accumulator regarded one general register longer instruction stack machine operand implicit stack
Special purpose instruction also often lack explicit operand distinction explicit implicit operand important machine code generator especially register allocation live range tracking part
A good code optimizer track implicit well explicit operand may allow frequent constant propagation constant folding register computer program sequence instruction executed CPU
While simple processor execute instruction one another superscalar processor capable executing several instruction program flow may influenced special jump instruction transfer execution instruction numerically following one
Conditional jump taken depending condition much readable rendition machine language called assembly language us mnemonic code refer machine code instruction rather using instruction numeric value directly
For example Zilog processor machine code MIPS instruction set provides specific example machine code whose instruction always bit long
A compiler computer program transforms source code written programming language another computer language latter often binary form known object code
The common reason converting source code create executable program name compiler primarily used program translate source code programming language lower level language
If compiled program run computer whose CPU operating system different one compiler run generally compiler specific type translator
While program take set programming specification translate program translates language higher level one decompiler
A program translates language called compiler transpiler
A language rewriter usually program translates form expression without change language term sometimes used refer parser generator tool often used help create lexer parser
A compiler likely many following operation lexical analysis preprocessing parsing semantic analysis code generation
Program fault caused incorrect compiler behavior difficult track work around therefore
Software early computer written assembly language
The notion high level programming language date back actual implementation occurred however
The first actual compiler date identifying first hard subjectivity deciding program become advanced enough count full concept rather precursor
saw two important advance
Grace Hopper wrote compiler programming language though functioned loader linker notion full compiler
Also first autocode compiler developed Alick Glennie Mark computer University Manchester considered first compiled programming language
The FORTRAN team led John Backus IBM generally credited introduced first unambiguously complete compiler COBOL early language compiled multiple architecture

Since become practice implement compiler language compiles
These instruction traditionally machine code instruction physical CPU
Executable code used describe sequence instruction necessarily constitute executable file example
Several object file linked create executable object file executable typically container format Executable Linkable Format
This structure generated code example dividing section
text
data
In order executed system file must conform system Application Binary Interface
For example ELF point specified header field
In GCC field set based symbol
For C done linking object Executable file thus normally contain significant additional machine code beyond directly generated specific source code
In case desirable omit example embedded system development simply understand compilation linking comparison executable file format EXE File Format What Is
Interpretation interpreting oral translation speech sign language another
Translation study study theory description application interpretation translation
The term interpretation translation used interchangeably synonymous
Interpretation describes immediate conversion source orally whereas translation conversion source text primary practical distinction translation translator time consider output may access resource process
A spoken Chinese dialect written using character spoken English represented signed form English Signed Exact English
In legal context interpretation ramification misinterpretation may dire
Teams two interpreter one actively interpreting monitoring greater accuracy
Translators time consider revise word sentence delivering product client live interpretation goal achieve total accuracy time detail original speech missed interpreter ask clarification speaker
In language including language word used exact match
The common form extempore SI interpreter know message hears
In ideal setting language interpreter sits booth speaks microphone
The simultaneous interpretation rendered listener via earphone technology arose American businessman Edward Filene British engineer Alan Gordon Finlay developed simultaneous interpretation equipment IBM
In consecutive interpreting speaker required pause allow interpretation accuracy greatly enhanced traditionally interpreter sit stand near speaker
Consecutive interpretation conducted pattern short long according interpreter preference
In short CI interpreter relies mostly memory whereas long CI Consecutive interpreting whole thought rather small piece desirable interpreter whole meaning rendering target language
This affords truer accurate accessible interpretation short CI simultaneous interpretation used occasion document sight translation required interpreter consecutive interpretation work
Sight translation combine interpretation translation interpreter must render document written target language sight translation occurs usually exclusively judicial medical work

In computer science library collection resource used computer program often develop software
These may include data documentation help data message template code
In IBMs successor referred partitioned data set library also collection implementation behavior written term language interface behavior invoked
For instance people want write higher level program use library make system call instead implementing system call addition behavior provided reuse multiple independent program
A program invokes behavior via mechanism language example simple imperative language C behavior library invoked using Cs normal
What distinguishes call library versus function program way code organized system
This distinction gain hierarchical notion program grows large case may internal library reused independent large program
The value lie reuse behavior
When program invokes library gain behavior implemented inside library without implement behavior library encourage sharing code modular fashion ease distribution code
The behavior implemented library connected program different program lifecycle phase
If code library accessed build invoking program alternative build executable invoking program distribute independently library implementation
The library behavior connected executable invoked executed either part process starting execution case library called dynamic library
A dynamic library loaded linked preparing program execution alternatively middle execution application may explicitly request module loaded
Most compiled language library although programmer also create custom library
Most modern software system provide library implement majority system service library commoditized service modern application requires
As code used modern application provided system library earliest programming concept analogous library intended separate data definition program implementation
JOVIAL brought COMPOOL concept popular attention although adopted idea SAGE software COBOL also included primitive capability library system Jean Sammet described inadequate library facility retrospect
Another major contributor library concept came form subprogram innovation FORTRAN

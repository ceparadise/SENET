A symbolic according technique
Diagrams used since ancient time became prevalent
Sometimes technique us visualization onto surface
The word sometimes used diagram
The term diagram commonly used sense general specific meaning In science term used way
For example Anderson stated generally diagram pictorial yet abstract representation information example diagram whereas photograph video
On hand Lowe defined diagram specifically abstract graphic portrayal subject matter represent
In specific sense diagram chart contrast technical illustration map showing abstract rather representation information
The essence diagram seen Or Hall word diagram simplified figure caricature way intended convey essential meaning
These simplified figure often based set rule
The basic shape according White characterized term elegance clarity ease pattern simplicity validity
Elegance basically determined whether diagram simplest fitting solution problem
There least following type diagram type diagram Many type diagram commonly generated using diagramming software
Thousands diagram technique exist
Some example follow
Diagrams may also classified according use purpose example explanatory diagram

UML stand
They diagram help aid creation visualisation documentation various aspect software engineering process
For requirement use
Use Cases come pair An Actor something performs use case upon system
An Actor entity meaning Human artefact directly play role system long either directly use system used system
For Use Case know entry condition precondition Exit condition So basically What true Use Case What true Use Case
A use case software engineering description system behavior responds request originates outside system
In word use case describes system question
The use case technique used capture system behavioral requirement detailing thread functional requirement
So let quick look Use Case diagram look like This Use Case Library System
It fairly identical one found book page Figure want study little Here see Actors system Library Users Library Staff Suppliers
And Use Case Diagrams Actors MUST represented stick people
Each class interaction system represented named eclipse placed inside box also named
This name name system eg Library System
What diagram show Library user member public search article print using system
A member Library Staff see Catalogue service get book stock top Library Users Staff User Administration privilege
The final actor Suppler interact Catalogue Service user administration privilege since supply book required Library
A Use Case description detailed description class interaction within given Use Case Diagram So quick example Use Case Description say Article Search would something like Computer Scientist Games Developer DevOps Engineer

In science computing engineering device system object viewed term input output without knowledge internal working
Its implementation opaque black
Almost anything might referred black box
To analyse something typical black box approach behavior accounted infer unknown
The usual representation centered box
The opposite black box system inner component logic available inspection commonly referred sometimes also known clear box glass box
The modern term black box seems entered English language around
In electronic process led electronic circuit regarded black box characterized response signal applied traced published idea developed form
Although Cauer use term others followed certainly describe method analysis
put concept even earlier attributing explicit use black box argues component implicitly treated
In full treatment given
A black box described unknown system identified using technique
He saw first step able copy output behavior black box
Many engineer scientist epistemologist used perfected black box theory
The abstraction representing class concrete viewed solely term The constitution structure box altogether irrelevant approach consideration purely external phenomenological
In word behavior system accounted
The understanding based explanatory principle An observer make observation time
All observation input output written table form sequence time state various part input output recorded
Thus using example examining box fallen might lead protocol Thus every system fundamentally investigated collection long protocol drawn time showing sequence input output state
From follows fundamental deduction knowledge obtainable Black Box given input output obtained protocol nothing
If observer also control input investigation turn illustration hypothesis tested directly
When experimenter also motivated control box active feedback relation promoting called architecture
The construction predictive using existing historic data observation table
A developed validated model method ensures based solely element
With input past event used modeling effort entered model see well output match known result
thing defined term function
The term applied field otherwise inquiry definition made relation appearance something
specifically thing black box state related characteristic behaviour within
Specifically inquiry focused upon thing immediately apparent characteristic therefore factor consideration held within hidden immediate observation
The observer assumed ignorant first instance majority available held inner situation away investigation
The element definition shown characterised system observable element enter perhaps imaginary box set different output emerging also observable
In one us black box theory describe understand factor field marketing applied analysis
The state fully understood output
however even wider application professional study The child try open door manipulate handle input produce desired movement latch output learn control one without able see internal mechanism link
In daily life confronted every turn system whose internal mechanism fully open inspection must treated method appropriate Black Box
This simple rule proved effective illustration Black Box principle cybernetics used control situation gone deeply may seem complex
A example Black Box principle treatment mental patient
The human brain certainly Black Box great deal neurological research going understand mechanism brain progress treatment also made observing patient response stimulus

Venn diagram going nickname primary diagram set diagram logic diagram widely known
This kind diagram show possible logical relation finite collection different set
These diagram depict element point plane well set region inside closed curve
A Venn diagram consists multiple overlapping closed curve usually represented circle represents set
The point inside curve labeled S represent element set S point outside boundary represent element set S
In Venn diagram curve overlapped different way showing possible relation existing set
This kind diagram invented year paper work named On Diagrammatic Mechanical Representation Propositions Reasonings John Venn Philosophical Magazine Journal Science used teach elementary set theory well illustrate simple set relationship logic linguistics probability computer science
Venn never used term Venn diagram referred invention Eulerian Circles
An scaled Venn diagram Venn diagram area shape proportional number element contains
Venn diagram general similar Euler diagram invented Leonhard Euler century
Baron noted Leibniz century produced similar diagram Euler unpublished
In century Venn diagram better developed Henderson showed existence diagram rotational symmetry implied n prime number mean natural number greater positive divisor
Henderson also showed symmetric Venn diagram exist n
In year Peter Hamburger found symmetric Venn diagram n Griggs Killian Savage showed symmetric Venn diagram exist prime
Thus rotationally symmetric Venn diagram exist n prime number
Venn diagram Euler diagram incorporated part instruction set theory part new math movement
Since also adopted curriculum field
A Venn diagram built using collection simple closed curve plane
The principle diagram class also known set represented region relation one another possible logical relation class set indicated diagram
That diagram initially leaf room possible relation class
The actual given relation within diagram specified indicating particular region null
Venn diagram normally comprise overlapping circle
The inner part circle aid symbol represents element set
The exterior though implies element included set
For example Venn diagram one circle may represent group object made wood another circle may represent set table
The overlapping region would represent set wooden table
Any shape circle employed shown Venn higher set diagram
Venn diagram contain information relative absolute size set similar Euler diagram mentioned
However Venn diagram n component set must contain hypothetically possible zone correspond combination inclusion exclusion component set
The difference Euler diagram Venn diagram Euler diagram contain actually possible zone given context
In Venn diagram though shaded zone may represent empty zone
At time Euler diagram corresponding zone missing diagram
As example imagine one set representing dairy product another one cheese
In case Venn diagram contains zone cheese dairy product
Thus context cheese mean type dairy product Euler diagram cheese zone entirely contained within one zone cheese
In case Euler diagram typically le visually complex similar Venn diagram especially number intersection small
Once plan draw mentioned diagram including Venn one find useful tool allows make needed drawing within short period time necessary tool design element symbol always available ConceptDraw PRO user basic application rest needed solution always downloaded ConceptDraw STORE site
You always draw Venn diagram purpose computer science using ConceptDraw PRO diagramming vector drawing software extended Venn Diagrams solution
The Venn Diagrams solution always downloaded Diagrams area ConceptDraw Solution Park site ConceptDraw STORE
Venn Diagrams Solution The Venn diagram example visualizes class language inclusion described Chomsky hierarchy
Within field computer science specifically area formal language Chomsky hierarchy occasionally referred hierarchy containment hierarchy class formal grammar
This hierarchy grammar described Noam Chomsky
It also named Schützenberger played crucial role development theory formal language
The Chomsky Hierarchy essence allows possibility understanding use computer science model enables programmer accomplish meaningful linguistic goal systematically
Venn Diagram Problem Solving Chomsky Hierarchy A graphical representation set language included Chomsky hierarchy
The Chomsky hierarchy consists following level Having ConceptDraw PRO software well ConceptDraw STORE one allows anyone care drawing look nice also smart professional get needed result hour even minute depending familiar ConceptDraw PRO

A way modelling domain level detail much domain model
Inside design class diagram class become object Objects created according Object Class Definition
An Object Class definition type template creating object
It includes declaration attribute operation associated object class
In UML object class represented section object attribute object operation
An example shown using object class model If one thing Object Oriented way top section would declaration variable bottom section
Now going get bog fast warning hehe
Now part need read An exam contains different type question Using draw Domain Model Design Class Diagram Domain
First thing first need identify Classes
Well quite obviously Classes straight top BUT look see
Well saw inherit something right inherit Question think one contain something variable operation etc etc really want write declaration time
But Multiple Choice question
They contain multiple answer surely need type could use Multiple Choice Question Options That mean class
So quick guidance Domain Model look like Here
Aside
I realised missed something im sooo sorry So yeah extra feature inside Design Class Diagram besides bleeding These extra feature forgot mention I think either leave comment email uni come bother hahaha OK go
Using Domain Model Design Class Diagram Domain Model
This look good take look
They field called
So could refactor make diagram little neater see spelling error likely Reactor stupid making word Refactor Reactor Computer Scientist Games Developer DevOps Engineer

Graphs mathematical concept found many us computer science
Graphs come many different flavor many found us computer program
Some flavor Most graph defined slight alteration following rule
If u v edge set say sometimes write
For example graph drawn Has following part
The adjacency relation symetric undirected graph also case
Has following part
Note B D D B Edge set arc B D arrow direction
Here following part
Edge labeled graph usually drawn label drawn adjacent arc specifying edge
Here following part
Here following part
Here following part
Vertices like called sink
Vertices like called source
Here following part
Graphs often used represent physical entity network road relationship people etc inside computer
There numerous mechansims used

Possible operation include
Not program need operation program efficent representation compute operation needed others suffice
represented function
We could represent Dgraph follows In rest note assume Vertices type Vertices set finite range type
Thus graph represented follows There many many algorithm graph
In note look
They include

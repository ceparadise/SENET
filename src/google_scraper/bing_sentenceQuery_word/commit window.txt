say In computing commit charge term used Microsoft Windows operating system describe total amount
Can somebody say simple term mean
Why term commit charge
You seem laboring misunderstanding point technical article Wikipedia rather show obscure one possibly
This sentence perfect example
Commit charge microsoft call current amount used virtual memory
That
But said someone might understand talking would terrible
The backing store someone never kissed girl might call hard drive storage
Pagefile course refers memory page case talking memory page stored hard drive opposed RAM would rather virtual memory
Contrary might read many article commit charge measurement anything physically exists
Not physical memory pagefile combination two
It considered sum total RAM pagefile needed store private virtual address space allocated running process actually used allocate
Most application allocate actually use
Memory program code DLL etc
included total
Windows keep track commit charge make sure place store potential data case running application use space allocated
The commit limit size RAM minus overhead plus size pagefile
Not RAM available commit charge
The important thing remember commit charge must always commit limit
If hit limit bad thing happen application system failure
Since commit charge represent anything physical little importance performance By posting answer agree

I getting memory error running virtual machine VirtualBox I checked commit charge lo behold I physical RAM
After closing application I MB still commit charge
That majority RAM
Opening process explorer show process seem order biggest memory hog process explorer everything else quite bit smaller
Can window leak memory
Should I suspect driver something like Symantec antivirus
Would memory use even show process explorer somehow
Commit charge basically
It related RAM
Windows basically address memory pagefile application us based current pagefile usage
The commit charge reflect current memory usage reflects much memory Windows current addressing pagefile
The Windows Task Manager utility Performance tab show three counter related commit charge The commit charge increase program opened used go program closed
It also change program allocate free private virtual memory example VirtualAlloc VirtualFree APIs
The commit limit may increased either creating additional pagefiles pagefile expansion enabled expanding existing one
The operating system expand pagefile automatically possible total commit charge approach limit
In event popup window displayed stating The system running low virtual memory
Some information available
Seems issue VirtualBox
I turned Intel Virtualization Technology Virtualbox suggested another forum problem far

I stuck window

How get
wrote commit message press enter nothing happened
I affraid close window find nothing internet official site say nothing validate commit corectly
You vi editor
In order save exit vi need To save change Or To discard change Look button screenshot exit This happened send message commit using parameter example git commit Your commit message
The default behaviour open default text editor Git case VIM
If want change simply follow instruction It look like
Try esc key exit insert mode ZZ save exit

would like know exact difference visible visible SysInternals
The parameter look like accurate indicator Total Virtual Memory usage process
However always smaller I guess include virtual memory use process
I would like somebody explain exactly included parameter
Memory reserved committed first accessed part working set
When memory portion address space set aside nothing else happens
When memory operating system guarantee corresponding page principle exist either physical RAM page file
In word count toward hard limit total available page system creates page
That creates page pretend exist reality exist yet
When memory first time page exist created exist
Either zero page supplied process data read page mapping
The page moved process necessarily remain forever
Every running process number page RAM page exist exist officially
This process working set
Further every running process page RAM officially exist RAM
They may called standby list part buffer cache something different
When accessed OS may simply move working set
Lastly every process page RAM either swap exist yet
comprises size page process
comprises page
That layman term virtual size pretty much problem limited size address space whereas commit size everybody problem since consumes global limited resource RAM plus swap
It therefore
Commit size amount space reserved paging file process
Used page need swapped make room RAM process
And yes virtual memory size larger since includes page backed paging file
At least code resource section EXE DLLs
When necessary page simply discarded reloaded file
All operating system DLLs fit category
Additionally file used process
SysInternals VMMap utility give insight
Virtual size size process virtual address space
When allocating memory request address range without actually committing memory behind
Those address point physical memory second allocation call used commit

About site A journal thought thing life Collection article I published Presentations I delivered recently Software I written My link collection My picture collection featuring cute little chihuahua Pico Quick introduction internals people scared word like
In simplified form git object storage DAG object handful different type object
They stored compressed identified hash incidentally content file represent representation git
The simplest object bunch byte
This often file symlink pretty much anything else
The object point determines semantics
Directories represented object
They refer content file filename access mode etc stored subdirectory
When node point another node DAG node exist without
Nodes nothing point garbage collected rescued much like filesystem inodes filename pointing
A refers represents state file time commit
It also refers parent
More one parent mean commit merge parent mean initial commit interestingly one initial commit usually mean two separate project merged
The body object commit message
References head branch like note slapped node DAG
Where DAG get added existing node mutated moved around freely
They get stored history directly transferred repository
They act sort bookmark I working
add node DAG move note current branch new node
The ref special actually point another ref
It pointer currently active branch
Normal ref actually namespace often skip part
Remote reference note different color
The difference normal different namespace fact remote ref essentially controlled remote server
update
A node DAG note yet another color
A point includes optional message GPG signature
The fast way access tag lost recovered DAG
The node DAG moved repository repository stored effective form pack unused node garbage collected
But end repository always DAG
So armed knowledge store version history visualize thing like merges differ tool try manage history linear change per branch
This simplest repository
We remote repository one commit
Here ed remote received one new commit remote merged yet
The situation
As merge new commits local branch thing happened moving note changing file working directory respectively
One local later
We new local commit new remote commit
Clearly merge needed
Results
Because new local commits actual new node created DAG
Note two parent Here tree look commits branch another merge
See stitching pattern emerge
The DAG record exactly history action taken
The stitching pattern somewhat tedious read
If yet published branch clearly communicated others base work alternative
You branch instead merging commit replaced another commit different parent branch moved
Your old commit remain DAG garbage collected
Ignore know way screwed totally
If extra pointing old commit remain pointing keep old commit alive indefinitely
That fairly confusing though
Do rebase branch others created new commits top
It possible recover hard extra work needed frustrating
The situation garbage collecting ignoring unreachable commit creating new commit top branch
also know rebase multiple commits one command
That end brief intro people intimidated computer science

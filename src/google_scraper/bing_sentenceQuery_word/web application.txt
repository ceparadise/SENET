In set definition tool building
In general term set clearly defined method various software component
A good API make easier develop providing building block put together
An API may system
An API specification take many form often includes specification
example different form APIs
Documentation API usually provided facilitate usage
Just make easier people use program application programming interface make easier use certain technology building application
By underlying implementation exposing object action developer need API simplifies programming
While graphical interface might provide user button performs step fetching highlighting new email API file might give developer copy file one location another without requiring developer understand operation occurring behind scene
An API usually related
The API describes prescribes specification library set rule
A single API multiple implementation none abstract form different library share programming interface
The separation API implementation allow program written one language use library written another
For example compile compatible Scala developer take advantage Java API
API use vary depending type programming language involved
An API could primarily consist basic routine execute code manipulate data handle error API would provide specification class
also APIs
By mapping feature capability one language interface implemented another language language binding allows library service written one language used developing another language
Tools interface generator facilitate creation interface
An API also related framework based several library implementing several APIs unlike normal use API access behavior built framework mediated extending content new class plugged framework
Moreover overall program flow control control caller hand framework via similar mechanism
An API specify interface application
example specifies set common APIs aim enable application written POSIX conformant operating system another POSIX conformant operating system
example operating system implement POSIX APIs
shown strong commitment API particularly within library older application may run newer version Windows using setting called Compatibility Mode
An API differs ABI API source code based ABI based
For instance provides APIs provides ABI
Remote APIs allow developer manipulate remote resource specific standard communication allow different technology work together regardless language platform
For example Java Database Connectivity API allows developer query many different type set function API us allow function operate remotely appear local developer
Therefore remote APIs useful maintaining object abstraction method call executed locally proxy object invokes corresponding method remote object using remoting protocol acquires result used locally return value
A modification proxy object also result corresponding modification remote object
Web APIs defined interface interaction happen enterprise application use asset
An API approach architectural approach revolves around providing programmable interface set service different application serving different type consumer
When used context API typically defined set HTTP request message along definition structure response message usually Extensible Markup Language JavaScript Object Notation format
An example might shipping company API added web site facilitate ordering shipping service automatically include current shipping rate without site developer enter shipper rate table web database
While web API historically virtually synonymous recent trend moving away Simple Object Access Protocol based web service SOA towards direct REST style ROA
Part trend related movement toward RDF concept promote technology
Web APIs allow combination multiple APIs new application known
In social medium space web APIs allowed web community facilitate sharing content data community application
In way content created one place dynamically posted updated multiple location web
The design API significant impact usability
The principle describes role programming interface enabling hiding implementation detail module user module need understand complexity inside module
Thus design API attempt provide tool user would expect
The design programming interface represents important part organization complex piece software
Several author created recommendation design APIs Kin Lane Michi Henning
APIs one common way technology company integrate
Those provide use APIs considered member business ecosystem
The main policy releasing API An important factor API becomes public
Changes developer part example adding new parameter function break compatibility client depend API
When part publicly presented API subject change thus stable part particular API explicitly documented
For example library part considered unstable might change near future marked
A public API sometimes declare part
This usually mean part API considered candidate removed modified backward incompatible way
Therefore deprecation allows developer transition away part API removed unsupported future
API documentation describes service API offer use service aiming cover everything client would need know use API
Documentation crucial development maintenance application use API
API documentation traditionally found documentation file also found social medium blog forum Q A website
Traditional documentation file often presented via documentation system consistent appearance structure
However type content included documentation differs API API
To facilitate understanding API documentation include description class method API well typical usage scenario code snippet design rationale performance discussion contract implementation detail API service usually omitted
Restrictions limitation API used also covered documentation
For example documentation API function could note parameter null function
Because API documentation comprehensive difficult writer keep documentation updated user read carefully potentially resulting
API documentation enriched information like
This metadata used compiler tool environment implement custom behavior custom handling
In sued distributed new implementation embedded operating system
Google acquired permission reproduce Java API although permission given similar project
Judge ruled case APIs victory Oracle would widely expanded copyright protection allowed copyrighting simple software command To accept Oracle claim would allow anyone copyright one version code carry system command thereby bar others writing different version carry part command
In however Alsup ruling overturned appeal though question whether use APIs constitutes left unresolved
In following trial jury determined Google reimplementation Java API constituted fair use Oracle vowed appeal decision

You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

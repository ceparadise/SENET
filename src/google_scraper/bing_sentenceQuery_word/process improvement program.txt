The specifies procedure Department follows ensure continuous improvement undergraduate degree program
The Department recognizes order provide high quality program meet need undergraduate must make use multiple form feedback assessment collect data need evaluate current status program make sound recommendation improvement
To guide process Department established set BS degree program
statement made skill capability senior Computer Science major time graduate
statement made skill capability Computer Science alumnus approximately three five year graduate
The truth assertion established via assessment evaluation mechanism described policy
The process used Department includes following tracking feedback change made individual course tracking rating course instructor tracking survey feedback provided student alumnus employer collecting reviewing example student coursework This information used make change program address problem improve quality
All undergraduate Computer Science course exception special topic course independent study course course required implement following policy related course assessment Each undergraduate course assigned course coordinator tasked goal managing course setting policy establishing course objective learning goal ensuring consistency across different instance course
In addition course coordinator responsible following policy stated ensure change course applied response continuous improvement data
The specific responsibility course coordinator The Undergraduate Committee charge maintaining list responsibility may make change basis
The course profile includes following information The course profile used track important information course represents contract taught course Department expect student successfully complete course
The profile also provides information course needed review Department Accreditation Board Engineering Technology
The Undergraduate Committee must review change course profile change become official
This review ensures consistency across course maintained change related course outcome adversely affect course dependent outcome
Faculty Course Questionnaires FCQs administered University every term instructor class taught
FCQs allow student rate instructor course provide information instructor teaching improvement student course selection dean chair management
Detailed FCQ result available website summary FCQ result Computer Science course available
The course coordinator must review FCQ result course soon result available time course taught
FCQ result usually available near beginning following semester
The review must include reading comment submitted student course writing summary student comment highlighting relevant criticism course discussing change made course response The result review documented Course Assessment Document
The course coordinator must update Course Assessment Document course semester instance course taught
This update occur FCQ review created review must stored Course Assessment Document
In addition FCQ review course coordinator must discus performance class course objective provide evidence assessment
As example course outcome student know create UML class diagram document design software system instructor must state percentage student mastered outcome tie assessment evidence back statement
For instance previous outcome instructor might say student course mastered outcome evidenced performance question final
That question reproduced class received full credit question
After discussing course outcome coordinator must discus implication individual assessment course overall
For instance student struggling achieve certain outcome change instructor make improve student performance next time course taught
The Course Assessment Document stored online manner allows faculty review previous version document edit upload new version document time course taught
The Undergraduate Committee responsible reminding faculty update document timely fashion track response rate update previous semester complete
To assist Department goal improving quality undergraduate program Undergraduate Committee adopting uniform policy respect collection course material undergraduate course course dossier
These dossier used conjunction Course Assessment Document provide tangible external evidence evaluated ass quality undergraduate course
This information also useful maintaining course dossier must presented ABET reviewer ABET site visit
Course dossier consist following item course profile course assessment document instruction conducted class example graded assignment example student work low medium high performing student student identity concealed example graded quiz exam including final example student work low medium high performing student student identity concealed copy course material used instruction workbook textbook handout etc
task force report resulting course review applicable The course coordinator tasked acquiring representative example material providing Main Office Administrator online storage time course taught An instructor bring hard copy material related course dossier Main Office Administrator scanning storage online
Textbooks scanned retained instructor appropriate text provided ABET reviewer future site visit
Graded material scanned Main Office Administrator material returned student
Materials electronic form organized appropriate file hierarchy archived compressed zip tar file delivered Main Office Administrator stored online

In particular reminder asking course material sent end last week class
A second reminder sent start first week class next semester
Finally third reminder sent starting third week semester course taught weekly reminder sent required material acquired
Each year College Engineering Applied Science administers number survey collect information various College stakeholder student alumnus employer used ass quality College department program
These survey include administered student end first year College administered student month graduate administered student roughly six month graduate administered alumnus three five year graduate administered student take internship position company Summer administered company hire graduate The Undergraduate Committee make use data survey one point independent feedback concerning quality BS degree program whether goal program stated met
In particular The Undergraduate Committee review result Freshman Senior Alumni survey annual basis transform knowledge gained recommendation BS degree program improved
This information captured Department annual assessment report also submitted Chair Department review guidance prioritize various recommendation made

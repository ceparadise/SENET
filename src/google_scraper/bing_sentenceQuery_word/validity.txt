The principle reliability fundamental cornerstone scientific method
Together core accepted scientific proof scientist alike
By following basic principle stand rigorous questioning skepticism
The idea behind must finding inherently
Without replication fulfilled requirement
This prerequisite essential hypothesis establishing accepted scientific truth
For example performing time critical experiment using type stopwatch
Generally reasonable assume keep true accurate time
However diligent scientist take many time minimize chance malfunction maintain validity reliability
At extreme experiment us human judgment always going come question
For example observer rate certain aspect like reliability test compromised
Human judgment vary wildly individual may rate thing differently depending upon time day current mood
This mean experiment difficult repeat inherently le reliable
Reliability necessary ingredient determining overall scientific experiment enhancing strength result
Debate social pure scientist concerning reliability robust ongoing
Validity encompasses entire experimental concept establishes whether result obtained meet requirement scientific research method
For example must appropriate care diligence shown allocation
dictate experimental design structured encompasses
Even result great sloppy inconsistent compromise integrity eye scientific community
reliability core experimental design
process examining result questioning whether possible relationship
randomization lessen external validity problem method completely successful
This statistical proof called absolute truth
Any scientific put forward possible cause studied effect
There always chance another contributed result finding
This extraneous causal relationship may become apparent technique refined honed
If constructed experiment contain scientific community likely accept finding
Eliminating potential causal relationship using control duplicate sample best way ensure result stand rigorous questioning

In everyday language use word reliable mean something dependable give behave predictably every time
We might talk football player reliable meaning give good performance game game
For example might try weigh bowl flour kitchen scale
A reliable scale show reading matter many time weigh bowl
There may slight error may notice reading differ fraction gram overall scale reliable
If scale gave reading kg minute later gave reading kg error become large instrument reliability seriously undermined
When talk instrument necessarily mean physical instrument strip
An educational test assigning quantitative score behavior also instrument
Another way looking reliability considering way maximize inherent repeatability experiment
To maintain reliability researcher use many repeat sample group possible reduce chance abnormal sample group skewing result
This little like weighing bowl several time using average reading
Reliability determined statistically calculating correlation coefficient
If test reliable show high positive correlation repeat score
If use three replicate sample one generates completely different result others likely something wrong
For experiment natural phenomenon result follow always chance sample group produce result one extreme
Using multiple sample group smooth extreme generate accurate spread result
But result continue wildly different likely something wrong
In case entire experiment unreliable
Good experimental design allow plenty replicate sample researcher
But researcher also able perform exactly experiment similar equipment similar condition achieve exactly result
If externally unreliable
A good example failure apply definition reliability correctly provided cold fusion case
Fleischmann Pons announced world managed generate heat normal temperature instead huge expensive torus used research nuclear fusion
This announcement shook world researcher many institution failed experiment
It unclear whether researcher lied genuinely made mistake impossible accept result since unreliable
If ever completed long questionnaire might noticed question seem subtle variation one another
A personality test may I like plan activity ahead time I spontaneous I like go flow three separate item seem quite similar
The reason test increase internal reliability
Internal reliability consistency across separate item within measure
A test internally consistent item contributes equally overall construct measured
If physicist chemist repeat experiment give exactly almost exactly result time time
The behavior phosphorous atom DNA molecule natural force like gravity unlikely change
Ecologists social scientist hand understand achieving identical result repeat experiment practically impossible
Complex system human behavior biological organism subject far random error variation
While experimental design must attempt eliminate natural variation always disparity discipline
The key make sure result reliable possible anybody repeat experiment able compare result scientist make solid estimate
often confused term describe two completely different concept
Very simply This difference best described example A researcher devise new test measure IQ quickly standard IQ test Reliability essential component sufficient measure validity
A test reliable valid whereas test valid yet unreliable
A test extremely unreliable essentially valid either
A bathroom scale measure weight one day kg next day kg unreliable merely measuring meant
There several method ass
In social science psychology testing internal reliability essentially matter comparing
How could determine whether item inventory contributing final score equally
One technique method cut test two piece compare piece
The test split way either first second half item example
method done test measuring one construct example extroversion subscale personality test
Psychometrics use method identify item test correlate strongly others remove improve item
The compare two different instrument ensure ultimately measure thing
For example imagine examining board want test new mathematics exam reliable selects group test student
For section exam calculus geometry algebra trigonometry actually ask two question designed measure aptitude student particular area
If high internal consistency
result two set question similar version test likely reliable
The involves two separate administration instrument internal consistency measure two different version time
Researchers may use internal consistency develop two equivalent test later administer group
A statistical formula called test reliability compare various pair question
Luckily modern computer program take care detail saving researcher calculation
There two common way establish external reliability method
The simplest method testing external reliability involves testing subject later date measuring correlation result
A test retaken month example yield result original reliable test
One difficulty method lie time test
This method assumes nothing changed meantime
If test administered close together participant easily remember material score higher second round
But administered far apart variable enter picture participant may change enough make score second batch truly comparable first
To prevent learning recency effect researcher may administer second test different equivalent first
Anyone watched American Idol cooking competition understand principle reliability
Here measured performance panel judge role An example clinical psychology role play examination student rated performance mock session
Another example grading portfolio photographic work essay competition
Processes rely expert rating performance skill subject kind error however
reliability measure agreement concordance two raters respective appraisal
degree consensus among judge
The principle simple several expert raters agree performance rating rating show high reliability
If however judge wildly different assessment performance assessment show low reliability
Importantly reliability characteristic rating performance rated
As seen understanding extremely important scientist social scientist biologist psychologist crucial foundation
In psychometry example construct measured first need isolated measured
Thus building inventory test done without constant assessment construct validity reliability
For reason extensive research program always involve comprehensive ensuring instrument used consistent valid
Those physical science also perform instrumental ensuring measuring equipment calibrated established standard

A validity check process ensuring concept construct acceptable context process system used
example computer system revolve around creation consumption manipulation data important data correct processing ensure error encountered
A validity check done input data ensure meet requirement system
Validity checking universal process used across different industry particularly information technology data process must meet quality standard ensure proper function software hardware device
The simplest example validity checking data entry system specific field may require numerical data validity check algorithm put place detect user input number immediately notifying user error
A redundancy validity check done submitted input field data entered pure number error returned
The validity correctness data essential system especially deal finance important maintain proper validity checking input processing even output
Companies lost million dollar resulting erroneous input
Therefore essence validity check mechanism used determine input data process conforms standard set system applied detail checking done varies process process system system

Yolanda taught college Psychology Ethics doctorate philosophy counselor education supervision
Imagine psychologist working office
Your client come tell think suffering anxiety
You decide proceed treatment diagnosis need administer psychological assessment
You search drawer test find Beck Anxiety Inventory BAI
The first question ask BAI measure
You read test manual note BAI used ass level anxiety adult adolescent
The second question ask related well BAI measure designed measure
To answer question look three different subdivision
You probably already familiar definition construct
A attribute skill ability based established theory exists human brain
Intelligence anxiety depression example construct
degree test measure construct supposed measure
In word well BAI measure theoretical concept anxiety
Establishing construct validity involves looking numerous study use BAI
There two necessary component construct validity validity
Let say reading manual found BAI highly correlated Hamilton Rating Scale HRS State Trait Anxiety Inventory STAI two previously validated measure anxiety
This establishes
Convergent validity degree measurement agrees measurement ass construct
You also found BAI low correlation Beck Depression Inventory meant measure depression
This establishes
Discriminant validity degree measurement correlate measurement ass concept differentiates two construct
You also read manual BAI item selected based similarity criterion anxiety disorder given Furthermore item cover entire range anxiety symptom including found panic generalized anxiety disorder
This establishes content validity BAI
A measurement item cover aspect construct measured
In word content validity let u know item BAI adequately cover area anxiety
refers degree measurement accurately predict specific criterion variable
Concurrent validity predictive validity two type validity
involves measurement administered time involves one measurement predicting future performance another
Say found significant correlation score BAI score HRS STAI
You established concurrent validity degree score measurement correspond measurement already established valid
Get FREE access day create account
If score BAI significantly correlated people diagnosed anxiety disorder future BAI predictive validity
Predictive validity degree score measurement evaluated correspond another criterion measurement taken future date
In example anxiety diagnosis criterion measurement come administration BAI test evaluated
Let assume found week administered BAI client BAI measure anxiety supposed
What mean client
This mean interpretation BAI result made related client level anxiety valid
As result inference drew based test would accurate
For example diagnosed client anxiety based BAI result diagnosis would wrong since test measuring anxiety
The treatment intervention implemented would probably ineffective since client actually anxiety
If decided help client get medication would find medication helping making client worse
You see validity important psychology
Without validity assessment result completely useless attempt help client using information assessment could end harming client
Let review
refers extent test measure supposed measure
There three type validity
degree test measure construct supposed measure
The two necessary component construct validity
refers whether item measurement represent aspect construct measured
refers degree measurement accurately predict specific criterion variable
two type validity
In order test valid need construct validity content validity validity
So next time someone come office assessment forget pull test manual look evidence validity

When come developing measurement tool intelligence test survey assessment validity important
A variety type validity exist designed ensure specific aspect measurement tool accurately measuring intended measure result applied setting
Before move discussing content validity important understand validity broad concept encompasses many aspect assessment
For example face validity describes degree assessment measure appears measure concurrent validity measure well result one assessment correlate assessment designed measure thing predictive validity measure well assessment result predict relationship construct measured future behavior
So content validity
refers accurately assessment measurement tool tap various aspect specific construct question
In word question really ass construct question response person answering question influenced factor
So content validity measured
How researcher know assessment content validity
Content validity often measured relying knowledge people familiar construct measured
These expert usually provided access measurement tool asked provide feedback well question measure construct question
Their feedback analyzed informed decision made effectiveness question
To better illustrate significance content validity let look two example
One example explains content validity helpful clinical setting business setting
Assessment measurement tool like survey questionnaire quite common social behavioral science
Content validity critical aspect developing tool help practitioner understand treat behavioral mental health condition
Get FREE access day create account
For example particular assessment tool designed measure severity symptom clinical depression group psychiatrist would evaluate question provide opinion rating well wording question tap measuring severity depression symptom
The independent rating expert compared analyzed determine degree content validity exists question
The assessment developer use information make alteration question order develop assessment tool yield highest degree content validity possible
Perhaps subject matter expert report one question really tapping aspect anxiety disorder
While anxiety depression linked term symptomology assessment question interested measuring depression question would either altered eliminated altogether
Here another example might familiar
If ever purchased anything online probably also received email asking buying experience
Retailers want make sure provide good customer service one way go directly customer ask thing went surveying experience
In example construct customer service survey high content validity focus question centered customer service
So question scale excellent rate timeliness delivery order placed would probably score high index content validity
Timeliness tends quality good customer service
What question affordability product order scale affordable
You could argue affordability aspect customer service nearly closely related timeliness
This second question really getting well company priced product separate construct altogether
So question might need work possibly eliminated altogether
Content validity somewhat subjective critical component developing high quality assessment tool
Validity critical aspect developing high quality assessment measurement tool
Many type validity exist focused somewhat different aspect measurement tool
type validity focus well question tap specific construct question
expert used provide feedback rate well question address construct question
Their feedback used assessment developer ensure tool developing highest degree content validity possible

In take form make impossible true conclusion nevertheless false
It required valid argument premise actually true premise true would guarantee truth argument conclusion
A valid true every argument form schema valid every argument valid
An valid truth premise truth conclusion step logical operation argument valid
Under condition would affirm premise deny conclusion
The valid argument negation corresponding conditional
The conclusion premise
An argument valid said invalid
An example valid argument given following What make valid argument true premise true conclusion logical necessity conclusion given two premise
The argument would valid premise conclusion false
The following argument false premise false conclusion equally valid No matter universe might constructed could never case argument turn simultaneously true premise false conclusion
The argument may contrasted following invalid one In case conclusion contradicts deductive logic preceding premise rather deriving
Therefore argument logically even though conclusion could considered general term
The premise men immortal would likewise deemed false outside framework classical logic
However within system essentially function like mathematical state binary philosophical concept normally associated term
A standard view whether argument valid matter argument
Many technique employed logician represent argument logical form
A simple example applied two illustration following Let letter stand respectively set men set mortal Socrates
Using symbol first argument may abbreviated Similarly third argument becomes An argument termed formally valid structural
operand premise true derived conclusion always also true
In third example initial premise logically result conclusion therefore categorized invalid argument
A formula valid formula true every possible language
In propositional logic
A statement called valid
logical truth true interpretation
Validity deduction affected truth premise truth conclusion
The following deduction perfectly valid The problem argument
In order deductive argument sound deduction must valid premise true
analyzes formula respect particular class interpretation suitable mathematical structure
On reading formula valid interpretation make true
An inference valid interpretation validate premise validate conclusion
This known
In validity interpretation variable assigned produce truth value
In validity interpretation variable assigned truth value produce truth value

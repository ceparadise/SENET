Can used refer implementation computer program
As We realize program next week
Listing X demonstrates possible realization
I pretty sure used sense instead sense
However I keep seeing used place quite often also computer science paper I sure anymore
Can native speaker shed light
To add detail question My main confusion come German word used fairly interchangeably context
The true English hence worry correctness text I write
Note strictly speaking program implementation
A program implementation implementation design follows specification
To realize similar implement little bit broader
To realize mean achieve plan whereas implement put effect specific plan
So instance computer program realization software entrepreneur visionary concept
But somewhat awkward say implementation visionary idea
Why
Because visionary concept program design
To implement program translate le detailed design code translate vague idea code
In word idea product realized specifying capturing design various level detail finally implementing
Programmers also speak implementing specification
For instance This server contains implementation protocol even though specification design write supporting code mail server
Basically document give precise testable requirement external behavior data processing system susceptible implemented
We speak duality world communicates piece piece work internally
Realize also direct sense make real often used sometimes overused first sentence probably use implement avoid sounding sense technical literature

In computer science field precise term reification see information

Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information

In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy

During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


In process kind derived underlying representation way object linguistic analysis come produced actual language
often said
The different sound realize particular phoneme called
Realization also subtask involves creating actual text human language English French etc
syntactic representation
There number software package available realization developed academic research group NLG
The remainder article concern realization kind
For example following code cause system print text In example computer program specified linguistic constituent sentence verb subject also linguistic feature plural subject negated information realiser constructed actual sentence
Realisation involves three kind processing Using grammatical knowledge choose inflection add function word also decide order component
For example English subject usually precedes verb negated form
Computing inflected form example plural form
Dealing casing formatting
For example capitalising first word sentence
The example basic realisers capable considerably complex processing
A number realisers developed past year
These system differ term complexity sophistication processing robustness dealing unusual case whether accessed programmatically via API whether take textual representation syntactic structure input
There also major difference pragmatic factor documentation support licensing term speed memory usage etc
It possible describe realisers emerging area

What Mocking
Prologue If look noun dictionary find one definition word
Mocking primarily used unit testing
An object test may dependency complex object
To isolate behaviour object want test replace object mock simulate behavior real object
This useful real object impractical incorporate unit test
In short mocking creating object simulate behaviour real object
At time may want distinguish opposed
There may disagreement subject definition stub minimal simulated object
The stub implement enough behaviour allow object test execute test
A mock like stub test also verify object test call mock expected
Part test verifying mock used correctly
To give example You stub database implementing simple structure storing record
The object test read write record database stub allow execute test
This could test behaviour object related database database stub would included let test run
If instead want verify object test writes specific data database mock database
Your test would incorporate assertion written database mock
There plenty answer SO good post web mocking
One place might want start looking post Martin Fowler discus lot idea mocking
In one paragraph Mocking one particlar technique allow testing unit code reliant upon dependency
In general differentiates mocking method mock object used replace code dependency allow expectation set mock object know meant called code respond
Your original question mentioned TypeMock I left answer TypeMock name
It offer feature free mocking framework like RhinoMocks Moq plus powerful option
Whether need TypeMock highly debatable mocking would ever want free mocking library many argue ability offered TypeMock often lead away well encapsulated design
As another answer stated actually defined concept could taken mean type mocking TypeMock offer using CLR profiler intercept call runtime giving much greater ability fake object requirement needing interface virtual method
Other answer explain mocking
Let walk
And believe actually far simpler think
It subclass original class
It data injected avoid testing injected part solely testing rest code
Let say writing iOS application network job test application
To whether network call work expected NOT YOUR DUTY
It another party duty test
You must remove network dependency yet continue test code work
A network call return different status code etc JSON response
Your app suppose work case error app throw expected error
What mocking create real network response like code JSON file test code without real network call waiting network response
You manually network response ALL different kind see app working expect
incorrect data responsibility responsibility test app correct case test app throw right error This creating real known mocking
In order CA use original code original code response right
You MUST add something dummy data normally needed part class
So SUBCLASS original class add whatever network HTTPResponse data OR case failure pas correct errorString HTTPResponse need subclass ie class
Long story short mocking testing also make feed class depends
In example instead whether app work expect class A good example mocking Just skip minute
I really like part transcript Because testing want make sure function called
We need make sure called Mock simulates behavior real controlled way
Mock object used unit testing
Often method test call external service method within
These called dependency
Once mocked dependency behave way defined
With dependency controlled mock easily test behavior method coded
This Unit testing
The purpose mocking type sever dependency order isolate test specific unit
Stubs simple surrogate mock surrogate verify usage
A mocking framework tool help generate stub mock
Since original wording mention type mocking I got impression related TypeMock
In experience general term mocking
Please feel free disregard info specifically TypeMock
TypeMock Isolator differs mocking framework work modifying IL fly
That allows mock type instance framework mock
To mock framework must provide abstraction mock
TypeMock offer great flexibility expense clean runtime environment
As side effect way TypeMock achieves result sometimes get strange result using TypeMock
I would think use TypeMock isolator mocking framework would TypeMocking
It tool generates mock use unit test without need write code IoC mind
If mock involves network request another alternative real test server hit
You use service generate request response testing
Mocking generating simulate real object behaviour test Thank interest question

What Code Coverage YOU measure
I asked question regarding automating testing code coverage
It seems outside automated tool art science
Anyone real world example use code coverage
Code Coverage measurement many code executed automated test running
Code coverage collected using specialized tool instrument binary add tracing call run full set automated test instrumented product
A good tool give percentage code executed also allow drill data see exactly line code executed particular test
Our team us set code coverage tool
If shop VS integrated tool collect code coverage
You also roll custom tool like describes
If shop Intel run Windows Linux though I used
I also heard gcov tool gcc I know anything ca give link
As use code coverage one exit criterion milestone
We actually three code coverage metric coverage unit test dev team scenario test test team combined coverage
Btw code coverage good metric much testing necessarily good metric well testing product
There metric use along code coverage ensure quality
Code coverage basically test much code covered test
So code coverage mean code covered test
I know might thinking code covered look different angle
What stopping get code coverage
A good example Now code two
If always hitting YES branch covering else part shown Code Coverage result
This good know covered write test cover else part
If code coverage sitting time bomb explode
good tool measure code coverage
Just remember mean everything tested completely mean every line code tested mean tested every common
I would use highlight bit code I probably write test
For example whatever tool show myImportantFunction executed running current probably improved
Basically mean code perfect
Use guide write comprehensive test
Complimenting point many answer
Code coverage mean well test set covering source code

extent source code covered set Test case
As mentioned answer various coverage criterion like path condition function statement etc
But additional criterion covered Note Static code analysis find unreachable code hanging code
code covered function call
And also static coverage
Even static code analysis report code covered give report testing set possible code coverage tested
Code coverage explained well answer
So answer second part question
We used tool determine
another one used slightly different purpose unit testing
It used generate coverage report accessed
This coupled tool ex Canoo give useful coverage report tell much code covered typical end user usage
We use tool Code Coverage simply measure code tested
There variety coverage criterion measured typically various path condition function statement within program makeup total coverage
The code coverage metric percentage test execute coverage criterion
As far I go tracking unit test coverage project I use static code analysis tool keep track
For Perl excellent module I regularly use module
If build installation managed Module simply run get nice HTML site tell coverage per sub line condition nice color making easy see code path covered
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site

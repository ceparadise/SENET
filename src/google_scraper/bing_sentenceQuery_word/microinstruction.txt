An abstract model
It also referred
A realization ISA called
An ISA permit multiple implementation may vary physical size monetary cost among thing ISA serf
Software written ISA run different implementation ISA
This enabled different generation computer easily achieved development computer family
Both development helped lower cost computer increase applicability
For reason ISA one important abstraction today
An ISA defines everything need know order program computer
What ISA defines differs ISAs general ISAs define supported state semantics set comprises computer machine language model
An instruction set architecture distinguished set technique used particular processor implement instruction set
Processors different microarchitectures share common instruction set
For example implement nearly identical version radically different internal design
The concept distinct design specific machine developed IBM design phase
Prior NPL company computer designer free honor cost objective selecting technology also fashioning functional architectural refinement
The SPREAD compatibility objective contrast postulated single architecture series five processor spanning wide range cost performance
None five engineering design team could count able bring adjustment architectural specification way easing difficulty achieving cost performance objective
Some support ISA Microsoft implement translating bytecode commonly used code path native machine code
In addition virtual machine execute le frequently used code path interpretation see
implemented instruction set atop processor fashion
An ISA may classified number different way
A common classification architectural
A CISC many specialized instruction may rarely used practical program
A RISC simplifies processor efficiently implementing instruction frequently used program le common operation implemented subroutine resulting additional processor execution time offset infrequent use
Other type include VLIW architecture closely related LIW EPIC architecture
These architecture seek exploit le hardware RISC CISC making responsible instruction issue scheduling
Architectures even le complexity studied MISC OISC
These theoretically important type commercialized
built discrete
On processing architecture given instruction may specify More complex operation built combining simple instruction executed sequentially otherwise directed instruction
Examples operation common many instruction set include Processors may include complex instruction instruction set
A single complex instruction something may take many instruction computer
Such instruction instruction take multiple step control multiple functional unit otherwise appear larger scale bulk simple instruction implemented given processor
Some example complex instruction include Complex instruction common CISC instruction set RISC instruction set RISC instruction set may include well
RISC instruction set generally include ALU operation memory operand instruction move large block memory RISC instruction set include instruction perform arithmetic operation multiple piece data time
SIMD instruction ability manipulating large vector matrix minimal time
SIMD instruction allow easy algorithm commonly involved sound image video processing
Various SIMD implementation brought market trade name
On traditional architecture instruction includes specifies operation perform zero specifier may specify memory location literal data
The operand specifier may determining meaning may fixed field
In VLIW architecture include many architecture multiple simultaneous opcodes operand specified single instruction
Some exotic instruction set opcode field TTA operand
The instruction set lack operand specifier field including NOSC
Conditional instruction often predicate bit encode specific condition cause operation performed rather performed
For example conditional branch instruction executed branch taken condition true execution proceeds different part program executed branch taken condition false execution continues sequentially
Some instruction set also conditional move move executed data stored target location condition true executed target location modified condition false
Similarly IBM conditional store instruction
A instruction set include predicate field every instruction called
The size length instruction varies widely little four bit many hundred bit VLIW system
Processors used instruction size bit
The longest possible instruction byte bit
Within instruction set different instruction may different length
In architecture notably RISC typically corresponding architecture
In architecture instruction variable length typically integral multiple
Some variable encoding two fixed usually encoding instruction mixed freely must switched branch exception boundary
A RISC instruction set normally fixed instruction length often byte bit whereas typical CISC instruction set may instruction widely varying length byte
instruction le complicated handle instruction several reason check whether instruction straddle cache line virtual memory page boundary instance therefore somewhat easier optimize speed
The instruction constituting program rarely specified using internal numeric form may specified programmer using commonly may generated
The design instruction set complex issue
There two stage history microprocessor
The first CISC Complex Instruction Set Computer many different instruction
In however place like IBM research found many instruction set could eliminated
The result RISC Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture us smaller set instruction
A simpler instruction set may offer potential higher speed reduced processor size reduced power consumption
However complex set may optimize common operation improve memory efficiency simplify programming
Some instruction set designer reserve one opcodes kind
For example us us eight code CF DF EF FF use code range
Fast virtual machine much easier implement instruction set meet
The used much easier implement unprogrammed state memory interpreted
On system multiple processor algorithm much easier implement instruction set includes support something atomic
Any given instruction set implemented variety way
All way implementing particular instruction set provide implementation instruction set able run executables
The various way implementing instruction set give different tradeoff cost performance power consumption size etc
When designing processor engineer use block electronic circuitry often designed separately adder multiplexer counter register ALUs etc
Some kind often used describe decoding sequencing instruction ISA using physical microarchitecture
There two basic way build implement description although many design use middle way compromise Some design use combination hardwired design microcode control unit
Some CPU design use compile instruction set writable inside CPU processor FPGA
An ISA also software
Naturally due interpretation overhead slower directly running program emulated hardware unless hardware running emulator order magnitude faster
Today common practice vendor new ISAs microarchitectures make software emulator available software developer hardware implementation ready
Often detail implementation strong influence particular instruction selected instruction set
For example many implementation allow single memory load memory store per instruction leading RISC
For another example early way implementing led
The demand digital signal processing pushed opposite instruction implemented particular way
For example perform digital filter fast enough MAC instruction typical DSP must use kind fetch instruction two data word simultaneously requires
In early computer memory expensive minimizing size program make sure would fit limited memory often central
Thus combined size instruction needed perform particular task important characteristic instruction set
Computers high code density often complex instruction procedure entry parameterized return loop etc
therefore retroactively named
However typical frequent CISC instruction merely combine basic ALU operation add access one operand memory using direct indirect indexed etc
Certain architecture may allow two three operand including result directly memory may able perform function automatic pointer increment etc
instruction set may even complex powerful instruction
first widely implemented period rapidly growing memory subsystem
They sacrifice code density simplify implementation circuitry try increase performance via higher clock frequency register
A single RISC instruction typically performs single operation add register load memory location register
A RISC instruction set normally fixed whereas typical CISC instruction set instruction widely varying length
However RISC computer normally require often longer instruction implement given task inherently make le optimal use bus bandwidth cache memory
Certain embedded RISC ISAs like typically exhibit high density owing technique called code compression
This technique pack two instruction one instruction unpacked decode stage executed two instruction
MISC form separate instruction multiple instruction fit single machine word
These type core often take little silicon implement easily realized form
The code density MISC similar code density RISC increased instruction density offset requiring primitive instruction task
There research mechanism improving code density
The mathematics describes challenge limit
Instruction set may categorized maximum number operand specified instruction
In example follow direct calculated address referring memory cell refer machine register
Due large number bit needed encode three register instruction RISC architecture instruction invariably design Atmel AVR version
RISC architecture instruction usually design architecture
Each instruction specifies number operand register memory location immediate value
Some instruction give one operand implicitly stored top implicit register
If operand given implicitly fewer operand need specified instruction
When destination operand explicitly specifies destination additional operand must supplied
Consequently number operand encoded instruction may differ mathematically necessary number argument logical arithmetic operation
Operands either encoded opcode representation instruction else given value address following instruction
measure availability free register point time program execution
Register pressure high large number available register use thus higher register pressure often register content must memory
Increasing number register architecture decrease register pressure increase cost
While embedded instruction set suffer extremely high register pressure small register set RISC ISAs like enjoy low register pressure
CISC ISAs like offer low register pressure despite smaller register set
This due many addressing mode optimization addressing memory operand ALU instruction absolute addressing addressing spill CISC ISAs offer

technique imposes interpreter hardware architectural level computer
As microcode layer instruction implement instruction internal sequencing many element
Microcode used well specialized processor hardware
Microcode typically resides special memory translates machine instruction data input sequence detailed operation
It separate machine instruction underlying instruction designed altered freely
It also facilitates building complex instruction reducing complexity computer circuit
Writing microcode often called microcode particular processor implementation sometimes called
More extensive microcoding allows small simple powerful architecture wider relatively simple way achieve software compatibility different product processor family
Some hardware vendor especially use term synonym
In way code within device termed regardless microcode example said microcode updated though typically contain microcode firmware
When compared normal application program element composing microprogram exist lower conceptual level
To avoid confusion element differentiated prefix microinstruction microassembler microprogrammer etc
Engineers normally write microcode design phase processor storing ROM PLA structure combination
However machine also exist microcode stored
This traditionally denoted context computer either
In latter case CPU initialization process load microcode control store another storage medium possibility altering microcode correct bug instruction set implement new machine instruction
Complex digital processor may also employ one possibly order delegate must performed essentially asynchronously parallel
A programmer even programmer normally see change microcode
Unlike machine code often retains among different processor family microcode run exact designed constitutes inherent part particular processor design
Microprograms consist series microinstructions control CPU fundamental level hardware circuitry
For example single typical microinstruction might specify following operation To simultaneously control processor feature one cycle microinstruction often wider bit bit emulator feature
Microprograms carefully designed optimized fastest possible execution slow microprogram would result slow machine instruction degraded performance related application program use instruction
Microcode originally developed simpler method developing control logic computer
Initially CPU
Each step needed fetch decode execute machine instruction including operand address calculation read writes controlled directly rather minimal state machine circuitry
While efficient need powerful instruction set addressing complex operation made processor difficult design debug highly encoded instruction contribute well especially irregular encoding used
Microcode simplified job allowing much processor behaviour programming model defined via microprogram routine rather dedicated circuitry
Even late design process microcode could easily changed whereas CPU design cumbersome change
Thus greatly facilitated CPU design
From late large portion programming done instruction mean greater programmer productivity important advantage microcode relative ease powerful machine instruction defined
The ultimate extension Directly Executable High Level Language design statement language entirely directly executed microcode without compilation
The Fountainhead Processor example
During CPU speed grew quickly memory speed numerous technique used alleviate
machine instruction made possible microcode helped fewer complex machine instruction require le memory bandwidth
For example operation character string done single machine instruction thus avoiding multiple instruction fetch
Architectures instruction set implemented complex microprograms included
The approach increasingly complex instruction set later called
An alternate approach used many use instead combinational logic mainly instruction decoding let simple state machine without much microcode sequencing
The example microprocessor using PLA instruction decode sequencing
The PLA visible photomicrograph chip operation seen simulation
Microprogramming still used modern CPU design
In case microcode debugged simulation logic function substituted control store
Logic function often faster le expensive equivalent microprogram memory
A processor microprograms operate primitive totally different much architecture assembly instruction visible normal programmer
In coordination hardware microcode implement architecture
The underlying hardware need fixed relationship visible architecture
This make easier implement given instruction set architecture wide variety underlying hardware
The IBM architecture register implementation actually use hardware implemented much simpler underlying microarchitecture example data path arithmetic logic unit ALU main memory implemented register special unit data path ALU data path main memory also implemented register special unit core memory
The full data path implement register special unit core memory
The Model Model larger data path implement register faster transistor circuit
In way microprogramming enabled IBM design many model substantially different hardware spanning wide range cost performance making architecturally compatible
This dramatically reduces number unique system software program must written model
A similar approach used Digital Equipment Corporation DEC VAX family computer
As result different VAX processor use different microarchitectures yet architecture change
Microprogramming also reduces cost field change correct defect processor bug often fixed replacing portion microprogram rather change made wiring
In design introduced concept control store way simplify computer design move beyond method
The control store lattice one dimension accepts control time pulse CPU internal clock connects control signal gate circuit
A pulse distributor take pulse generated CPU clock break eight separate time pulse activates different row lattice

Described another way signal transmitted control store played much like roll
That controlled sequence wide word constructed played sequentially
In control store however song short repeated continuously
In enhanced concept adding concept akin computer software
His initial implementation consisted pair matrix first one generated signal manner Whirlwind control store second matrix selected row signal microprogram instruction word speak invoke next cycle
Conditionals implemented providing way single line control store could choose alternative second matrix
This made control signal conditional detected internal signal
Wilkes coined term describe feature distinguish simple control store
Each microinstruction microprogram provides bit control functional element internally compose CPU

Programmers develop microprograms using basic software tool

Because close relationship underlying architecture microcode several property make difficult generate using compiler
A program intended execute bit way electronics allows much freedom debug microprogram
After microprogram finalized extensively tested sometimes used input computer program construct logic produce data
This program similar used optimize
No known computer program produce optimal logic even good logic vastly reduce number transistor number required ROM control store
This reduces cost producing electricity consumed CPU
Microcode characterized referring primarily whether microinstruction control CPU element little decoding horizontal microcode requires extensive decoding vertical microcode
Consequently horizontal microinstruction wider contains bit occupies storage space vertical microinstruction
Horizontal microcode several discrete combined single microinstruction simultaneous operation
Horizontal microcode typically contained fairly wide control store uncommon word bit
On tick sequencer clock microcode word read decoded used control functional element make CPU
In typical implementation horizontal microprogram word comprises fairly tightly defined group bit
For example one simple arrangement might For type micromachine implement JUMP instruction address following opcode microcode might require two clock tick
The engineer designing would write microassembler source code looking something like For tick common find portion CPU used remaining group bit microinstruction
With careful design hardware microcode property exploited parallelise operation use different area CPU example case ALU required first tick could potentially used complete earlier arithmetic instruction
In vertical microcode microinstruction significantly encoded bit field generally pas intermediate combinatory logic turn generates actual control sequencing signal internal CPU element ALU register etc
This contrast horizontal microcode bit field either directly produce control sequencing signal minimally encoded
Consequently vertical microcode requires smaller instruction length le storage requires time decode resulting slower CPU clock
Some vertical microcode assembly language simple conventional computer emulating complex computer
Some processor processor CMOS microprocessor later IBM mainframe mainframe term used Alpha processor term used IBM mainframe microprocessor
This form machine code access special register hardware resource available regular machine code used implement instruction function page table walk Alpha processor
Another form vertical microcode two field The selects part CPU controlled word control store
The actually control part CPU
With type microcode designer explicitly chooses make slower CPU save money reducing unused bit control store however reduced complexity may increase CPU clock frequency lessens effect increased number cycle per instruction
As transistor became cheaper horizontal microcode came dominate design CPUs using microcode vertical microcode used le often
When vertical horizontal microcode used horizontal microcode may referred
A computer built using writable microcode
In design rather storing microcode ROM logic microcode stored RAM called
Such computer sometimes called
Many experimental prototype computer use writable control store also commercial machine use writable microcode early workstation Nautilus family number IBM implementation DEC machine
Many machine offer writable control store option including DEC series
The IBM includes facility called invoked console part another processor complex
Some commercial machine example IBM storage writable control store microcode
WCS offer several advantage including ease patching microprogram certain hardware generation faster access ROMs provide
WCS allows user optimize machine specific purpose
Starting several Intel CPUs writable microcode
This example allowed bug Intel microcode fixed patching microprograms rather requiring entire chip replaced
The design trend toward heavily microcoded processor complex instruction began early continued roughly
At point design philosophy started becoming prominent
A CPU us microcode generally take several clock cycle execute single instruction one clock cycle step microprogram instruction
Some processor include instruction take long time execute
Such variation interfere far important modern system
When designing new processor RISC following advantage microcoded CISC There counterpoint well Many RISC processor designed execute every instruction long cache single cycle
This similar way CPUs microcode execute one microinstruction per cycle
VLIW processor instruction behave similarly wide horizontal microcode although typically without control hardware provided microcode
RISC instruction sometimes similar narrow vertical microcode

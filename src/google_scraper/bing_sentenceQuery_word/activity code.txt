What represented single bit get single bit information one place another
This unit explores technical challenge question arise need represent digital information computer transfer people computational device
Topics include digital representation information number text image communication protocol
Many lesson follow worksheet student guide associated activity
Those worksheet listed relevant lesson plan check unit activity guide
Welcome Computer Science Principles
Groups make rapid prototype innovative idea share
Students watch brief video computing innovation
Students collaborate iterative design process make bit sending device using classroom supply everyday object
They develop system encoding sending simple binary message physical distance
Students use Internet simulator first time lesson
It configured represent two party connected single shared wire hold one two possible state
Students invent binary protocol overcome coordination timing synchronization problem arise forced use truly binary system
In lesson student introduced bit transmitted common medium copper wire cable radio wave used connect device Internet
They chose device transmits bit research device system us
Students create poster presenting finding lesson concludes gallery walk poster
Students explore property number system inventing number system using three shape circle triangle square
This lesson precursor looking several number system important computing especially binary hexadecimal
Students become familiar binary number system making flippy using binary odometer widget practicing number conversion
Students invent binary protocol sending line drawing represented list grid coordinate number
Students test hone protocol using new version Internet Simulator configured automatically send receive stream bit
In lesson student explore fascinating story news history future number encoding computer
These story serve illuminate kind decision student making number encoding kind thing real scientist world worry sometimes disastrous consequence
While lesson possibility running long meant short excursion application limited one class period
Students invent protocol us ASCII standard plain text encoding scheme encode formatted text font color size etc
Students test protocol using Internet Simulator configured send interpret ASCII text see partner properly render draw paper formatting encoded message
This chapter story bit represent importantly age Internet physically get one place another
Through lesson chapter look different type primitive information mostly number text repeatedly ask pair question I represent bit
And I get bit
Ultimately want give student sense layer abstraction involved representing transmitting information
Sending single bit becomes sending stream bit stream bit represent number number represent letter alphabet
In order communicate using bit two party must agree encoding decoding information
A strong foundation learning computer science start developing certain level comfort abstraction
Computer science unlike scientific discipline many rule law defined people sometimes arbitrarily rather nature
The closest thing natural law rely thing related binary representation associated logic mathematics come along
We want student go bit journey repeatedly solve problem related representing information
A broad term approach chapter ask student invent solution problem revealing conventional solution
For example ask student use sequence geometric shape circle triangle square invent number system precursor learning binary
One advantage concept invention tends foster classroom environment
We try structure activity advantage prior knowledge concept
The key pattern approach introduce vocabulary definition student shared experience activity associated concept
A pilot teacher course coined phrase
A seeming disadvantage concept invention student may initially resistant learning way fixated getting right answer
In exploratory activity course one right answer
Early might worry chaos fact student learning thing It worth patient sticking much computer science especially programming coming solution problem using tool hand
There one right way write program either
Furthermore open approach positive effect classroom environment
After certain amount trust established setting student fail rather encouraging create invent see shift attitude
We make heavy use lesson enforce rule binary representation activity designed use
The configuration Internet Simulator change slightly lesson us always communication sending message partner using bit
The simulator intended tool experimentation play
We encourage let student investigate new feature rather explaining outset
Similar approach concept invention philosophy always explain tool work student experience even frustration poking around
In fact much receptive explanation experience
Students read portion memo written Vint Cerf entitled The Internet Everyone highlight benefit free open Internet identifies threat system
Students invent protocol similar real Internet Protocol IP encode necessary element playing simplified game Battleship
Students first play unplugged using new version Internet Simulator configured allow user broadcast message group
Students use new version Internet Simulator configured simulated IP address router explore benefit potential security concern associated routing traffic across Internet
Students see message go many different router may always take path reach destination traffic publicly viewable
Through unplugged activity student introduced packet issue packet delayed dropped
Students invent protocol reliably send message unreliable network using Internet Simulator configured unreliable delaying randomly dropping packet sent router
In subsequent lesson consider strategy used construct network find path data
While connection idea Internet focus lesson algorithm formal technique process solving problem
Students explore solve Minimum Spanning Tree MST problem first unplugged fashion paper
The real challenge solving particular instance minimum spanning tree develop algorithm clear series step followed properly solve instance problem
There possible misconception look MST definite verifiable optimal solution opposed Text Compression problem Unit
In lesson student explore Single Source Shortest Path problem solving problem pencil paper first following famous algorithm solves shortest path problem known Dijkstra Algorithm
Even though algorithm detour strong connection lesson routing algorithm used Internet
This lesson also introduces idea analyze algorithm looking correctness efficiency running time
As foreshadowing next lesson student act another distributed shortest path algorithm used router learn Internet dynamically
This lesson last algorithm series
Building previous lesson shortest path algorithm activity lesson show router learn rest Internet order route traffic take shortest path
In previous lesson student use Internet Simulator send packet student simulated router
The path packet follows router know send however largely untouched
Today student simulate process router joining network generating router table would allow send packet anyone else network efficiently possible
They reflect process comparing similarity SSSP problem process used today facilitates structure Internet
Through unplugged activity student see difficulty trying maintain universal address mapping
The Domain Name System DNS introduced student experiment simplified version using Internet Simulator
Students learn investigate HTTP looking HTTP traffic generated within browser
Students visit variety website use browser tool view traffic
In Practice Performance Task student research prepare flash talk controversial issue around either Net Neutrality Internet Censorship
The talk artifact produced exhibit student knowledge Internet
The story chapter many way story Internet came existence protocol designed build allow rapid expansion scaling
Instead inventing protocol send information directly one peer another consider protocol necessary one computer communicate computer assuming connected via multiple interconnected network
Internet
The lesson chapter build like real internet protocol
For example networked world one computer communicate need protocol computer address
Once address consider data routed multiple network find address supposed
Once consider breaking large message piece reliable transfer
You also need way translate text address like IP address
Finally need way communicate text information one place another relies piece working designed
Again want give student sense involved creation protocol protocol solves one problem solves well allowing complex problem solved top
This philosophy open Internet allowed enormously complex global system like Internet built first place also allows everyone participate growing scaling adapting new problem time
Similar last chapter general approach learning
Each lesson chapter pose one fundamental problem solved Internet communication work
Because concept often abstract hard see typically robust activity pair Internet protocol
The activity designed illuminate problem physical experiential way student draw working develop solution
The solution problem always invention new protocol usually enforce rule protocol using configured differently lesson
Each configuration incorporates solution last major problem student solve time exhibit new behavior problem must solved
For example student invented addressing protocol subsequent version simulator simple IP address built handled automatically system perhaps impose limit size message thereby forcing student invent protocol handle packeting information
Even though designing protocol testing Internet Simulator programming per se many skill
It requires student precise manage growing complexity system creatively iteratively solve problem imposed constraint debug solution using tool hand
Also one right answer time
We believe many lesson help improve student collaborative problem solving behavior bring characteristic computer science work want encourage
We believe computational problem fun engaging novel
It unlikely many student even background knowledge computer science considered problem devising communication protocol
Our theory help foster classroom environment unduly advantage student prior knowledge
We want every student equal stake proceeding discus problem work together test solution

In process ensuring undergone ensure correct useful
It us routine often called validation constraint check routine check correctness meaningfulness security data input system
The rule may implemented automated facility inclusion explicit validation logic
Data validation intended provide certain guarantee fitness accuracy consistency various kind user input application automated system
Data validation rule defined designed using various methodology deployed various context
Data validation rule may defined designed deployed example For business application data validation defined rule
Data conform rule negatively affect business process execution
Therefore data validation start business process definition set business rule within process
Rules collected requirement capture exercise
In evaluating basic data validation generalization made regarding different type validation according scope complexity purpose various validation operation carried
For example Data type validation customarily carried one simple data field
The simplest kind data type validation verifies individual character provided user input consistent expected character one known primitive data type defined programming language data storage retrieval mechanism well specification following primitive data type integer float decimal string
For example many database system allow specification following l plus minus parenthesis
A sophisticated data validation routine would check see user entered valid country code number digit entered matched convention country area specified
A validation process involves two distinct step Validation Check b action
The check step us one computational rule see section determine data valid
The action sends feedback help enforce validation
Simple range constraint validation may examine user input consistency range consistency test evaluating sequence character one test regular expression
Code validation includes test data type validation combined one operation verify data consistent one external rule requirement validity constraint relevant particular organization context set underlying assumption
These additional validity constraint may involve supplied data known table directory information service
For example experienced user may enter string match specification valid address defined string might actually correspond resolvable domain connected active account
Structured validation allows combination various basic data type validation step along complex processing
Such complex processing may include testing conditional constraint entire complex data object set process operation within system
A Validation rule criterion constraint used process carried data encoded onto input medium involves data vet validation program
This distinct operation program determined intended meet purpose
The Validation rule check system still used many major software manufacturer designed employee Microsoft time
The method check data fall appropriate parameter defined system analyst
A judgement whether data valid made possible validation program ensure complete accuracy
This achieved use clerical computer control built system design stage
The difference data validity accuracy illustrated trivial example
A company established Personnel file record contains field Job Grade
The permitted value A B C An entry record may valid accepted system one character may correct grade individual worker concerned
Whether grade correct established clerical check reference file
During system design therefore data definition established place limit constitutes valid data
Using data definition range software validation check carried
An example validation check procedure used verify
Failures omission data validation lead
Data validation check data fit purpose valid sensible reasonable secure processed

Page Validation verification two way check data entered computer correct
entered incorrectly little use
automatic computer check ensure data entered sensible reasonable
It check accuracy data
For example secondary school student likely aged
The computer programmed accept number
This check
However guarantee number typed correct
For example student age might entered valid incorrect
There number validation type used check data entered

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I found confusing I use neural network toolbox Matlab
It divided raw data set three part I notice many training learning algorithm data often divided part training set test set
My question Normally perform supervised learning need two type data set In one dataset gold standard input data together output This dataset usually duly prepared either human collecting data way
But important expected output every data row need supervised learning
The data going apply model
In many case data interested output model thus expected output yet
While performing machine learning following Hence separation
In case need choose appropriate model several rivaling approach set basically training set test set without performing validation trained model
I personally partition
See also
set example used learning fit parameter classifier In MLP case would use training set find weight rule set example used tune parameter classifier In MLP case would use validation set find number hidden unit determine stopping point algorithm set example used ass performance classifier In MLP case would use test estimate error rate chosen final model MLP size actual weight After assessing final model test set YOU MUST NOT tune model
The error rate estimate final model validation data biased smaller true error rate since validation set used select final model After assessing final model test set YOU MUST NOT tune model
My year experience Computer Science taught nothing better simplicity
The concept Data Sets simple
When large data set recommended split part set original data set This used build prediction algorithm
Our algorithm try tune quirk training data set
In phase usually create multiple algorithm order compare performance Phase
set original data set This data set used compare performance prediction algorithm created based training set
We choose algorithm best performance
set original data set Now chosen preferred prediction algorithm know yet going perform completely unseen data
So apply chosen prediction algorithm test set order see going perform idea algorithm performance unseen data
Notes important keep mind skipping test phase recommended algorithm performed well phase really mean truly best one algorithm compared based set quirk noise Test Phase purpose see final model going deal wild case performance poor repeat whole process starting Training Phase
At step asked make decision
choose one option among several option must additional gauge accuracy choice simply pick favorable result randomness mistake distribution center
The left pessimist
The right optimist
The center pragmatist
Be pragmatist
Each type algorithm parameter option number layer Neural Network number tree Random Forest etc
For algorithm must pick one option
training set
You collection algorithm
You must pick one algorithm
test set
Most people pick algorithm performs best validation set ok
But measure error rate test set go error rate validation set blindly mistaken possible likely That recipe disaster
I suppose algorithm parameter would need third step
In case validation step would test step
Perhaps Matlab ask parameter chosen use source confusion
It often helpful go step assumption null hypothesis option
parameter algorithm hence reference distribution
This image
I taken site It follow need split data way
The bootstrap provide smaller mean squared error estimate prediction accuracy using whole sample developing testing model
Most supervised data mining algorithm follow three step A typical machine learning task visualized following nested loop Typically outer loop performed inner loop
You need ass final performance model
In word validation set training set human
I would like add good answer pointing relatively new approach machine learning called differential privacy see paper Dwork
The idea allows actually reuse testing set without compromising final model performance
In typical setting test set used estimate final performance ideally one even allowed look
As well described see entry well possible use test set without biasing model performance
This done using special procedure called differential privacy
The learner direct access test set
One way think three set two come past whereas set come future
The model built tuned using data past data never data come future
To give practical example let say building model predict well baseball player future
We use data create set
Once model built tuned data use data actually past
test set perspective model appears like future data way influenced model creation
Obviously theory could wait data really want
Obviously I using quote everywhere actual temporal order data may coincide actual future definition data generation probably took place actual past
In reality set might simply data time period set hold
In way influence tuning model hold data actually coming future
My Idea option neural network toolbox avoiding overfitting
In situation weight specified training data show global trend
By validation set iteration adaptable decrease training data error cause decrease validation data increase validation data error along decrease training data error demonstrates overfitting phenomenon
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

Applying system thinking computing climate sustainability Sometime I drafted frequently asked question list
Here I wrote meaning term validation verification The term Verification Validation commonly used software engineering mean two different type analysis
The usual definition In word validation concerned checking system meet customer actual need verification concerned whether system
Verification help determine whether software high quality ensure system useful
The distinction two term largely role specification
Validation process checking whether specification capture customer need verification process checking software meet specification
Verification includes activity associated producing high quality software testing inspection design analysis specification analysis
It relatively objective process various product document expressed precisely enough subjective judgement needed order verify software
In contrast validation extremely subjective process
It involves making subjective assessment well proposed system address need
Validation includes activity requirement modelling prototyping user evaluation
In traditional phased software lifecycle verification often taken mean checking product phase satisfy requirement previous phase
Validation relegated begining ending project requirement analysis acceptance testing
This view common many software engineering textbook misguided
It assumes customer requirement captured completely start project requirement change software developed
In practice requirement change throughout project partly reaction project development new software make new thing possible
Therefore validation verification needed throughout lifecycle
Finally V V regarded coherent discipline Software V V system engineering discipline evaluates software system context relative system element hardware user software
Software Verification Validation Its Role Computer Assurance Its Relationship Software Project Management Standards Dolores Wallace Roger Fujii NIST Special Publication Having thus carefully distinguished two term advice V V practitioner forget distinction think instead V V toolbox provides wide range tool asking different kind question software
And master use tool figure use
Here one attempt visualize space tool toolbox A range V V technique
Note modeling model checking refer building analyzing abstracted model software behaviour different kind beast scientific model used computational science For climate model definition focus specification make much sense detailed specification climate model built iterative refinement like agile software development
But matter toolbox approach still work mean tool applied little differently
An appropriate toolbox climate modeling look little different picture tool appropriate control system application software etc missing picture particular simulation software
I draw better picture I finished analyzing data field study practice used climate lab
Many different V V tool climate modelling lab room adding tool toolbox sharpening existing tool subject current research
But question best must proceed detailed analysis current practice effective
There seem plenty wandering space claiming model insufficiently verified validated
And people like pontificate climate modeler ought differently
But anyone pontificate way unable give detailed account V V technique climate modeller currently use blowing smoke
If know toolbox already really make constructive comment missing

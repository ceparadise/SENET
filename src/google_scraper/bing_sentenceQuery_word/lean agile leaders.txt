Course Course Course Course Course Course Course Course Course Course Most folk heard Agile Lean little le well known technology circle realm
Lean started manufacturing world
Lean devised combination innovator including Edwards Deming Taiichi Ohno developer Toyota Production System TPS
Lean revolutionized Japanese industrial economy World War Two made way back US
Narrator Lean also inspired statistical process control focus continuous improvement designed experimentation
Narrator And inherits Henry Ford original work Just In Time manufacturing
So Lean
Well I glad I asked
Lean systematic method eliminate waste maximize flow value system
Value defined something customer pay money
Turns spend lot effort achieving goal customer care contribute organization profitability
Narrator Lean employ something called value stream mapping
This practice generates diagram show exact place value created system flow organization
Here example value stream map showing flow capacity lead time place value added
Narrator The antithesis value waste
Waste effort spent anything creation value
Lean recognizes three major type waste given Japanese name
Muda Muri Mura
Narrator Muda major form waste
Effort spent creating work
It come two type
Type one technically waste necessary reason know like compliance
And type two plain wasteful
Narrator Mura waste unevenness
Stopping starting context switch
Narrator And finally Muri waste overburdening person process system
Narrator The Goal Eliyahu Goldratt Jeff Cox seminal business book Lean theory constraint
It written work fiction demonstrating implementation Lean principle example company
Narrator The theory constraint identifies constraint bottleneck reduce throughput system
Narrator By measuring managing throughput inventory queue length operating expense identifying focusing lifting constraint greatly improve system overall delivery
This focus optimizing entire process system thinking contrasted local optimization performed single functional area may actually inhibit overall flow system
Related pull opposed push philosophy flow system
A station downstream pull item needed rather pushed upon
Lean also place high value upon continuous improvement
It tool strategy designed allow team improve incrementally day day Kaizen host quality tool
And finally respect empowering individual employee team critical part Lean
Work improved harnessing knowledge performing
A simple example Andon Cord
On Lean manufacturing line every single line employee empowered pull cord push button stop entire production line needed resolve issue
Many corporate process seek minimize impact individual employee diametrically opposed Lean theory
Earnest know Lean stuff sound like bunch stuff really get
Well manufacturing world benefit riveting
Oh I see
Okay go
The case study summary Damon Products list following benefit implementing four lean principle
Pull scheduling kanban visual management employee empowerment four factory
It reduced cycle time setup time lead time four eight week five ten day flow distance
Wow impressive
On larger scale TPS Lean widely recognized revolutionized Japanese industry late century revived American auto industry
But DevOps
Well annual puppet lab state DevOps report data analysis DevOps related practice consistently found strong statistical correlation Lean practice high performing IT organization well measured throughput instability better business outcome including productivity market share profitability
Narrator The specific Lean principle found proven work small deliverable limiting work progress information radiator visibility flow gathering broadcasting implementing customer feedback finally empowered development team free experiment improve
Next discus application Lean product management software development contribute DevOps implementation

Is Agile Lean
When people say agile really mean Scrum
Or people still use different type agile
Been getting lot question lately thought I take stab Lean come set principle achieving quality speed customer alignment trying agile development right
adapted principle Lean Manufacturing I believe idea actually provide premise behind agile work In nutshell Lean say relentlessly eliminate adding value work absolutely need moment time
Eliminating waste mean eliminating useless meeting task documentation
But mean eliminating time spent building know need future thing constantly changing often end needing rework condition understanding changed
It also mean eliminating inefficient way working like
deliver fast
Lean also put strong emphasis call system way team operates
We always need looking work top level ensure optimizing whole
For example many manager want optimize individual developer ensuring always time actually
Let people coding something needed fully defined yet sake coding actually creates u future see
Along line Lean say respect people work one best know
Give need effective trust
Software development structure work ensure continuously learning
And defer decision last responsible moment know
Finally develop way build quality product way continuously deliver fast keep going back clean mess
Mary Poppendieck Agile refers set value principle put forth
The Manifesto reaction heavyweight methodology popular yet crippling software project actually needed create software helped customer
I believe Agile value principle work science behind Lean see lot similar theme repeated agile
The Agile Manifesto value process tool comprehensive documentation contract negotiation following plan And principle Any project follows value principle rightly considered agile
That said definitely preferred practice common agile team follow order achieve agility
Most commonly A good agile team pick choses management technical practice best work
bad one pick couple practice falsely belief somehow make agile see

I reading said You need escape every string pas sql query regardless origin
Now I know something like really basic
A Google search turned result
Stackoverflow alone page result one actually explains escaping string
It assumed
Can help
I want learn always I making web app PHP
I looked I could go I sure get point
This laziness
Escaping string mean reduce ambiguity quote character used string
For instance defining string typically surround either double quote single quote But string double quote within
Now I ambiguity interpreter know string end
If I want keep double quote I couple option
I could use single quote around string Or I escape quote Any quote preceded slash understood part value string
When come query MySQL certain keywords watch use query without causing confusion
Suppose table value column named Select wanted select We introduced ambiguity query
Within query reduce ambiguity using This remove confusion introduced using poor judgment selecting field name
A lot handled simply passing value
In example see passing data function ensure wo cause problem query Other method exist escaping string though find goal run safe query large developer prefer context PostgreSQL
Some character special meaning SQL database using
When character used query cause unexpected unintended behavior including allowing attacker compromise database
To prevent character affecting query way need escaped say different way database need told treat special character query
In case escape escaped cause previously mentioned problem includes SQL injection MySQL database

In invokes alternative interpretation subsequent character character sequence
An escape character particular case
Generally judgment whether something escape character depends context
Escape character part many programming language data format communication protocol
For given escape character purpose start character sequence named interpreted differently character occurring without prefixed escape character
An escape character may meaning escape sequence two character
There usually two function escape sequence
The first encode syntactic entity device command special data directly represented alphabet
The second use referred represent character typed current context would undesired interpretation
In latter case escape sequence consisting escape character quoted character
Generally escape character particular case device vice versa
If define control character special meaning output device
escape character device control one
But escape character used programming graphic hence control character
Conversely ASCII control character control function isolation therefore escape character
In many programming language escape character also form escape sequence referred control character
For example escape sequence
JavaScript us backslash escape character Note escape allowed JSON string
The ASCII escape character decimal used many output device start series character called control sequence escape sequence
Typically escape character sent first sequence alert device following character interpreted control sequence rather plain character one character would follow specify detailed action device would go back interpreting character normally
For example sequence followed printable character would cause terminal move cell line screen
This later developed covered standard
The escape character also start command sequence
Early reference term escape character found IBM technical publication credited inventing mechanism work character set
The usually found standard PC keyboard
However commonly absent keyboard PDAs device designed primarily ASCII communication
The DEC series one popular keyboard dedicated Esc key instead using one key main keypad
In uncommon use key escape character modern desktop computer use dropped
Sometimes key identified alternative mode
Even dedicated key escape character code could generated typing simultaneously holding
Many modern specify doublequote character
The escape character typically provides two way include doublequotes inside string literal either modifying meaning doublequote character embedded string becomes modifying meaning sequence character including hexadecimal value doublequote character becomes
allow exactly two backslash escape style
The language Microsoft also use backslash escape
The encoding us escape character
use quote character special meaning character
The character may considered escape character derived format
Some programming language also provide way represent special character literal without requiring escape character see

The us ASCII escape character
The octet immediately following passed higher level protocol
This applied control character used PPP mark beginning end frame octet need transmitted higher level protocol encapsulated PPP well octet negotiated link established
That higher level protocol wish transmit transmitted sequence transmitted
In sh character expanded via
Without preceding escape character expand name file start period file otherwise remains unexpanded
So refer file literally called shell must told interpret way preceding backslash
This modifies interpretation asterisk
Compare The us character escape reserved character special meaning particular
The though support similar syntax support
For example Windows Command Prompt result syntax error
whereas output string In Windows backslash used path separator therefore generally ca used escape character
us instead
For example following command output another line Not confused This article incorporates document

Invented two often begin tell computer software program perform function command
Below listing commonly used available escape sequence used programming language text editor
Below example escape sequence appears computer displayed user
example text sequence
The example escape sequence would display text
Hello Here example text us escape sequence
Finally adding escape sequence regular expression regex allow find replace character perform special feature
For example example regular expression finding line begin character return deleting

For example slow loading Internet could press escape key stop wait
In picture right close picture Esc key look like computer keyboard
Below overview computer keyboard Esc key highlighted blue
An escape key typically used program want abort cancel change currently displayed screen
Below difference place escape key commonly used
With early computer Esc key used send
However today Esc key used perform break
With PC usually press send break stop
also shorthand escape character single performs special function treat following character text function
Below example escape could used
The example treat quote character character beginning end container
For example programming language required printing text file screen contains quote
In word command would print without escaping quote Perl script would generate error extra quote
The example would treat plain text asterisk
This next example similar first example period also wild card represents single character
So need match period regular expression every character must escape recognized period
When file name directory need space Linux use backward slash followed space escape space name
If done Linux treat anything space option additional command
Finally escape character also used escape sequence create function command
For example would create character file screen
See definition additional example

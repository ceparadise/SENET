In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

Incomplete dominance form intermediate inheritance one specific trait completely expressed paired allele
This result third expressed physical trait combination phenotype allele
Unlike complete dominance inheritance one allele dominate mask
Incomplete dominance occurs trait eye color skin color
It cornerstone study genetics
Incomplete genetic dominance similar
Whereas incomplete dominance blending trait additional phenotype produced allele expressed completely
The best example AB inheritance
Blood type determined multiple allele recognized A B O blood type AB phenotype fully expressed
Going back ancient time scientist noted blending trait though none used word incomplete dominance
In fact Genetics scientific discipline began study
Like many others Mendel focused plant pea plant particular
He helped define genetic dominance noticed plant either purple white flower
They would combination lavender color one might suspect
Previous scientist believed physical trait would always blending parent plant
Mendel proved quite opposite offspring inherit different form separately
In pea plant trait visible allele dominant allele recessive
Mendel described genotype ratio phenotype ratio
Both would consequential research
In early German botanist Carl Correns would conduct similar research four plant
While Mendel work laid foundation Correns credited actual discovery incomplete dominance
In work Correns observed blend color flower petal
This led conclusion genotype ratio prevailed genotype phenotype
In turn allowed heterozygote display allele rather dominant one Mendel found
As example incomplete dominance seen experiment red white snapdragon plant
In allele produce red color completely expressed allele produce white color
The resulting offspring pink
The
In incomplete dominance intermediate trait
In case snapdragon plant pink plant heterozygous genotype
The red white plant plant color genotype
Polygenic trait height weight eye color skin color determined one gene interaction among several allele
The contributing trait equally influence phenotype allele gene found different
The allele additive effect phenotype resulting varying degree phenotypic expression
Individuals may express varying degree dominant phenotype recessive phenotype intermediate phenotype

Computer science often difficult define
This probably due unfortunate use word computer name
As perhaps aware computer science simply study computer
Although computer play important supporting role tool discipline
Computer science study problem solution come process
Given problem computer scientist goal develop list instruction solving instance problem might arise
Algorithms finite process followed solve problem
Algorithms solution
Computer science thought study algorithm
However must careful include fact problem may solution
Although proving statement beyond scope text fact problem solved important study computer science
We fully define computer science including type problem stating computer science study solution problem well study problem solution
It also common include word describing problem solution
We say problem computable algorithm exists solving
An alternative definition computer science say computer science study problem computable study existence nonexistence algorithm
In case note word computer come
Solutions considered independent machine
Computer science pertains process also study
Abstraction allows u view problem solution way separate logical physical perspective
The basic idea familiar u common example
Consider automobile may driven school work today
As driver user car certain interaction take place order utilize car intended purpose
You get insert key start car shift brake accelerate steer order drive
From abstraction point view say seeing logical perspective automobile
You using function provided car designer purpose transporting one location another
These function sometimes also referred
On hand mechanic must repair automobile take different point view
She know drive must know detail necessary carry function take granted
She need understand engine work transmission shift gear temperature controlled
This known physical perspective detail take place The thing happens use computer
Most people use computer write document send receive email surf web play music store image play game without knowledge detail take place allow type application work
They view computer logical user perspective
Computer scientist programmer technology support staff system administrator take different view computer
They must know detail operating system work network protocol configured code various script control function
They must able control detail user simply assumes
The common point example user abstraction sometimes also called client need know detail long user aware way interface work
This interface way user communicate underlying complexity implementation
As another example abstraction consider Python module
Once import module perform computation This example
We necessarily know square root calculated know function called use
If perform import correctly assume function provide u correct result
We know someone implemented solution square root problem need know use
This sometimes referred black box view process
We simply describe interface name function needed parameter returned
The detail hidden inside see

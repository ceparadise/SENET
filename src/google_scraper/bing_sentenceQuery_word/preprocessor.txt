The amount kind processing done depends nature preprocessor preprocessors capable performing relatively simple textual substitution expansion others power
A common example processing performed next step compilation
In phase known
It also include macro processing file inclusion language extension
Lexical preprocessors preprocessors require operate source text prior performing simple substitution character sequence tokenized character sequence according rule
They typically perform file conditional compilation inclusion
The common example take line beginning
Because know nothing underlying language use criticized many feature built directly language
For example macro replaced aggressive inlining template includes import requires preservation type information object code making feature impossible retrofit language effectively accomplished dead code elimination language
However key point remember preprocessor directive start new line
Other lexical preprocessors include commonly used build system open source macro processor operates pattern context
Syntactic preprocessors introduced family language
Their role transform syntax tree according number rule
For programming language rule written language program reflection
This case
Some language rely fully external language define transformation preprocessor statically typed counterpart
Syntactic preprocessors typically used customize syntax language extend language adding new primitive embed DSL inside general purpose language
A good example syntax customization existence two different syntax programming language
Programs may written indifferently using normal syntax revised syntax may either syntax demand
Similarly number program written customize syntax language addition new operator
The best example language extension macro found family language
While language simple dynamically typed functional core standard distribution permit imperative programming well static typing
Almost feature implemented syntactic preprocessing although bear noting macro expansion phase compilation handled compiler Lisp
This still considered form preprocessing since take place phase compilation
One unusual feature family language possibility using macro create internal DSL
Typically large project module may written variety one perhaps using dialect another written dialect specialized etc
standard library contains example level syntactic abstraction form LOOP macro implement minilanguage describe complex iteration still enabling use standard Lisp operator
The provides similar feature external DSLs
This preprocessor take description semantics language
interpreter combining interpretation code generation turn definition compiler programming language either bytecode native code
Most preprocessors specific particular data processing task C language
A preprocessor may promoted meaning aimed specific usage programming language intended used wide variety text processing task
probably well known example general purpose preprocessor although C preprocessor sometimes used specific role

anybody explain example
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
It allows construct indentifiers part
Eg would expand
It vastly used trick used boost preprocessor library eg
would expand
Also sometimes used generate struct function name akin template
I sure meen preprocessor
C preprocessor expanding macro compile time
This first pas source code
There different thing used Note though really C though part spec cause headache get wrong
I believe new language would way anymore

Preprocessor directive line included program character make different typical source code text
They invoked compiler process program compilation
Preprocessor directive change text source code result new source code without directive
Although preprocessing C conceptually similar different two aspect
First preprocessing C involve separate step preprocessor execution compilation
It processed part lexical analysis phase
Second used create macro
In addition new directive region unregion added C along exclusion directive used earlier include notable directive whose use replaced using include assembly
Java support preprocessor directive
A preprocessor directive usually placed top source code separate line beginning character followed directive name optional white space
Because comment line declaration preprocessor directive used scroll following line delimited comment used
A preprocessor directive statement must end semicolon
Preprocessor directive defined source code common line argument compilation
Examples preprocessing directive used C include Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

In pragmatic specifies process input
Directives part may vary compiler compiler
They processed specify compiler behavior function form parameterization
In case directive specify global behavior case affect local section block programming code
In case C program directive optional compiler hint may ignored normally prescriptive must followed
However directive perform action language rather change behavior compiler
This term could used refer proprietary third party tag command markup embedded code result additional executable processing extend existing compiler assembler language construct present development environment
The term directive also applied variety way similar term
In language support simple
Source line handled preprocessor referred
Another C construct directive used instruct compiler use pragmatic feature
Two notable user directive
Syntactic construct similar C preprocessor directive also typically called directive although case may real preprocessing phase involved
All preprocessor command begin hash symbol
Directives date known pragmatic denoted newer language notably C abbreviated pragma
A common use pragmats ALGOL specifying regime meaning keywords indicated
Various directive follow specifying POINT UPPER RES reserved quote regime
Note use stropping keyword abbreviated either POINT quote regime Today directive best known C language early vintage continued current standard either instruction form directive compiler
They also used degree modern language see

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
According dragon book one first step source code program go compilation Preprocessor
Assuming language like underlying virtual machine abstract away underlying platform way deal cross platform compilation without requiring use Preprocessor
Another use case would code remove code executed Debug Builds
I mentioning us preprocessor like defining value PI easily replaced use const global variable
Yes entirely possible
For example define language requiring least minimal degree elimination example something like produce code refer
This give roughly effect something like would C
The obvious difference including capability language typically require content condition syntactically correct target programming language whereas C allow block contain code syntactically correct C long preprocessor still detect matching
Now case easy require thing nobody know thus producing specification nobody implement
That would case though compiler optimization already exist
Ada one example includes great deal ability tailor code specific platform without using preprocessor like C
In fact Ada arguably support quite bit C regard
By posting answer agree

recursive acronym open source scripting language especially suited web development embedded HTML
Nice mean
An example Instead lot command output HTML seen C Perl PHP page contain HTML embedded code something case output Hi I PHP script
The PHP code enclosed special allow jump PHP mode
What distinguishes PHP something like JavaScript code executed server generating HTML sent client
The client would receive result running script would know underlying code
You even configure web server process HTML file PHP really way user tell sleeve
The best thing using PHP extremely simple newcomer offer many advanced feature professional programmer
Do afraid reading long list PHP feature
You jump short time start writing simple script hour
Although PHP development focused scripting much

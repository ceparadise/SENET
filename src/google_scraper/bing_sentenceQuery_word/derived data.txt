While concept data commonly associated data collected huge range organization institution including business sale data revenue profit government rate organization census number organization
Data whereupon using graph image analysis tool
Data general refers fact existing form suitable better usage
unprocessed data collection cleaned corrected researcher
Raw data need corrected remove obvious instrument data entry error thermometer reading outdoor Arctic location recording tropical temperature
Data processing commonly occurs stage processed data one stage may considered raw data next stage
raw data collected uncontrolled environment
data generated within context scientific investigation observation recording
Data described new
The first English use word data
Using word data mean transmittable storable computer information first done
The expression data processing first used
The plural thing given neuter past participle give
Data may used plural noun sense writer using singular plural
In though everyday writing data commonly used singular like information sand rain
Data closely related concept role relation term meaning
According common view data collected analyzed data becomes information suitable making decision analyzed fashion
derived extensive amount experience dealing information subject
For example height generally considered data
The height recorded precisely entered database
This data may included book along data Mount Everest describe mountain manner useful wish make decision best method climb
Using understanding based experience climbing mountain advise person way reach Mount Everest peak may seen knowledge
Some complement series data information knowledge wisdom would mean status person possession certain knowledge also know circumstance good use
Data often assumed least abstract concept information next least knowledge abstract
In view data becomes information interpretation height Mount Everest generally considered data book Mount Everest geological characteristic may considered information climber guidebook containing practical information best way reach Mount Everest peak may considered knowledge
Information bear diversity meaning range everyday usage technical use
This view however also argued provide model relation data information knowledge
Generally speaking concept information closely related notion constraint communication control data form instruction knowledge meaning mental stimulus pattern perception representation
us concept differentiate data information data series symbol information occurs symbol used refer something
Before development computing device machine people could collect data impose pattern
Since development computing device machine device also collect data
In computer widely used many field collect data sort process discipline ranging analysis usage citizen scientific research
These pattern data seen information used enhance knowledge
These pattern may interpreted though truth subjective concept may authorized aesthetic ethical criterion discipline culture
Events leave behind perceivable physical virtual remains traced back data
Marks longer considered data link mark observation broken
Mechanical computing device classified according mean represent data
An represents datum voltage distance position physical quantity
A represents piece data sequence symbol drawn fixed
The common digital computer use binary alphabet alphabet two character typically denoted
More familiar representation number letter constructed binary alphabet
Some special form data distinguished
A collection data interpreted instruction
Most computer language make distinction program data program operate language notably similar language program essentially indistinguishable data
It also useful distinguish description data
A similar yet earlier term metadata ancillary data
The prototypical example metadata library catalog description content book
Gathering data accomplished primary source researcher first person obtain data secondary source researcher obtains data already collected source data disseminated scientific journal
Data analysis methodology vary include data triangulation data percolation
The latter offer articulate method collecting classifying analyzing data using five possible angle analysis least three order maximize research objectivity permit understanding phenomenon investigation complete possible qualitative quantitative method literature review including scholarly article interview expert computer simulation
The data thereafter percolated using series step extract relevant information
Though data also increasingly used field suggested highly interpretive nature might odds ethos data given
Peter Checkland introduced term Latin take distinguish immense number possible data attention oriented
argued since humanity affirm knowledge production situated partial constitutive using may introduce assumption counterproductive example phenomenon discrete
The term emphasizes act observation constitutive offered alternative visual representation humanity

This action might possible undo

In simply classification data tell programmer intends use data
Most programming language support various type data example
A data type provides set value
variable function may take value
The type defines operation done data meaning data way value type type value expression may take value Data type used within type system offer various way defining implementing using
Different type system ensure varying degree
Almost programming language explicitly include notion data type though different language may use different terminology
Common data type include For example type represents set ranging value well operation performed integer addition subtraction multiplication
Colors hand represented three denoting amount red green blue one string representing color name allowable operation include addition subtraction multiplication
Most programming language also allow programmer define additional data type usually combining multiple element type defining valid operation new data type
For example programmer might create new data type named would include real imaginary part
A data type also represents constraint placed upon interpretation data describing representation interpretation structure stored computer memory
The type system us data type information check access manipulate data
Most data type statistic comparable type computer programming vice versa shown following table identified five definition type literature
Types including behavior align closely model whereas model would tend include code called
The five type The definition term representation often done imperative language definition term value space behaviour used language
typically type basic language implementation
All data computer based digital electronics represented alternative lowest level
The smallest addressable unit data usually group bit called usually bit
The unit processed instruction called typically bit
Most instruction interpret word word represent unsigned integer value signed integer value
Because machine language machine need distinguish unsigned signed data type part
There specific set arithmetic instruction use different interpretation bit word number
Machine data type need made available allowing control hardware
The instance supply integer type various width
If corresponding native type exist target platform compiler break code using type exist
For instance integer requested bit platform compiler tacitly treat array two bit integer
Several language allow convenient manipulation machine data
In higher level programming machine data type often hidden implementation detail would render code le portable exposed
For instance generic type might supplied instead integer specific
The represents value
Although two value possible rarely implemented single binary digit efficiency reason
Many programming language explicit Boolean type instead interpreting instance false value true
Boolean data simply refers logical structure language interpreted machine language
In case Boolean refers logic False
True always non zero especially one known Boolean
Such derived one primitive type
This done number way
The way combined called
Composing primitive type compound type generally result new type
different type
Many others possible tend variation compound
The distinct value compared assigned necessarily particular concrete representation computer memory compiler interpreter represent arbitrarily
For example four suit deck playing card may four enumerator named belonging enumerated type named
If variable declared data type one assign four value
Some implementation allow programmer assign integer value enumeration value even treat integer
Such Character string type store sequence character character set
Since character set include possible numeric string
However many language treat belonging different type numeric value
Character string type different subtypes according required character width
The original wide ASCII found limited superseded set encode wide variety alphabet symbol
Strings may either fixed size even programming language
They may also subtyped maximum size
Note string primitive language instance C may composed array character
Types based derived basic type explained
In language C type derived type
The main derived type data type whose value refers directly point another value stored elsewhere using
It primitive kind
In everyday term page number book could considered piece data refers another one
Pointers often stored format similar integer however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To ameliorate potential problem pointer considered separate type type data point even underlying representation
Any type specify implementation
For instance abstract type implemented array contiguous block memory containing multiple value set memory block linked
Abstract type handled code know care underlying type contained
Programming agnostic concrete data type called
Arrays record also contain underlying type considered concrete specify content element laid memory
Examples include For convenience language may supply real world data type instance even language allows built primitive type
A associate type computed value
By examining flow value type system attempt prove occur
The type system question determines constitutes type error type system generally seek guarantee operation expecting certain kind value used value operation make sense
A may use static type value optimize storage need choice algorithm operation value
In many compiler data type example represented accord
They thus use value addition multiplication etc
The depth type constraint manner evaluation affect language
A may associate operation varying concrete algorithm type case
study type system although concrete type system programming language originate practical issue computer architecture compiler implementation language design
Type system may variously forth

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I know scalar mean exactly I trying see I thinking correctly
Does scalar relate arbitrariness type data could type system able know data advance
The term scalar come used differentiate single number vector matrix
The meaning computing similar
It distinguishes single value like integer float data structure like array
This distinction prominent Perl sigil resembles used denote scalar variable sigil resembles denotes array
It anything type element
It could number character string object
What matter called scalar
A Scalar simply
For purpose discussion let assume scalar rather collection number
For example result SQL query return value first column first row result set returned query
It typically used retrieve aggregate value COUNT AVERAGE ID new record number record processed query
A supplemental mnemonic Karl Bielefeldt great answer A simple way thinking scale
An integer scale
A integer scale

A real number scale
A character boolean decimal scale
Even string scale use sorting
Hence scalar
A database row scale
A complex number scale
An object representing email message scale
An array vector matrix scale
A scalar simple single numeric value etc
usually integer fixed point float single double opposed array structure object complex vector real plus imaginary magnitude plus angle component higher dimensional vector matrix etc
data type contains one single numeric value
However note large complex data type sort also flattened represented byte computer memory also represented one single binary scalar number
Turing used technique represent entire computer program one scalar number
As case many term computing origin word relates physical property
The term Scalar relatively old computing
Its definition le strict day
When store data computer memory data either fit one address
When called scalar called composite
Mainly CPUs could handle one data byte time
As stated Karl Bielefeldt term indeed taken algebra
We call string string string char
A char scalar string composite
Storing piece data datum multiple address blurred line somewhat
Think like When CPU could process datum one instruction scalar
These day scalar singular value singular value may defined differently amongst different language
integer float char string booleans enums considered scalar day
Arrays list tree object etc

I say byte keep thing clear technically I talking day bit commonly used punch card example later magnetic strip Disclaimer I unable find reference internet I got information school old book amongst I think Mathematical Tables Aids Computation
That said memory used anyone deny answer would nice
The word scalar derives Latin word scalaris adjectival form scala Latin ladder
The English word scale also come scala
A Scalar variable hold individual value
For example Say trying represent name various student set variable
Each individual variable scalar variable follow SQL scalar function return single value based input value

In term multiple meaning
It could refer one following The format indicator type magic number first found early source code operating system although lost original meaning term become part computer industry
When ported one first therefore early version Unix used model
version read executable file jumped first low memory address program zero
With development version Unix created describe component
Also inserted first word header skip header start program
In way program could run older relocatable memory reference regular mode paged mode
As executable format developed new constant added incrementing branch
In Unix program loader exec function read executable image file system
The first file containing size program text initialized global data area
Also first word header compared two determine contained normal newly implemented executable image separated instruction data paged image
There mention dual role header constant high order byte constant fact branch instruction
Adding seven program counter showed constant would branch Unix exec service executable image eight byte header start program
Since Sixth Seventh Editions Unix employed paging code dual role header constant hidden
That exec service read executable file header data buffer read executable image thereby using constant branching feature
Magic number creation implemented Unix magic number branching probably still used suite came Sixth Seventh Editions
Thus header constant provide illusion met criterion
In Version Seven Unix header constant tested directly assigned variable labeled subsequently referred
Probably uniqueness term came mean executable format type expanded mean file system type expanded mean type file
Magic number common program across many operating system
Magic number implement data form controlling program read data type program
Many file constant identify contained data
Detecting constant file simple effective way distinguishing many yield
The Unix utility program read interpret magic number file file used parse information called
The Windows utility similar purpose
This list limit data storage type The term also refers using number directly source code
This referred breaking one oldest rule programming dating back manual
The use unnamed magic number code obscures developer intent choosing number increase opportunity subtle error
every digit correct equal
make difficult program adapted extended future
Replacing significant magic number named make program easier read understand maintain
Names chosen meaningful context program result code easily understood maintainer original author
An example named constant descriptive
The problem associated magic described limited numerical type term also applied data type declaring named constant would flexible communicative
Thus declaring better several occurrence number
For example required randomly shuffle value array representing standard pack job using algorithm array object function chooses random integer inclusive swap th th entry array
In preceding example magic number
It considered better programming style write following This preferable several reason Disadvantages In context use unnamed numerical constant generally accepted arguably magic
While acceptance subjective often depends individual coding habit following common example The constant sometimes used represent value True False programming language without boolean type older version
Most modern programming language provide use
In C sometimes used represent
As boolean value C standard library includes macro definition whose use encouraged
Other language provide specific value case alternative used
The typed pointer constant introduced
It possible create alter GUIDs memorable highly discouraged compromise strength identifier
The specification generating GUIDs UUIDs quite complex lead guaranteed unique properly implemented
They generated reputable software tool
Microsoft Windows product ID number product sometimes end OFFICE product ID Office Extensibility Component
Java us several GUIDs starting
In GPT partitioning scheme use special GUID follow GUID definition instead formed using code string partially order
specific value written deallocation later possible tell whether become corrupted make obvious value taken uninitialized memory used
Memory usually viewed hexadecimal memorable repeating value common
Numerically odd value may preferred processor without byte addressing fault attempting use pointer must fall even address
Values chosen away likely address program code static data heap data stack
Similarly may chosen valid code instruction set given architecture
Since unlikely although possible integer would take specific value appearance number likely indicates error buffer overflow
Famous common example include Used protocol VLC player sends four byte order system
Some IP camera expecting player sends magic number start stream magic number received
Note long architecture computer
The prevalence value Microsoft technology coincidence discussed detail book
He give variety criterion value Since often used mark area memory essentially empty term came used phrase meaning gone aborted flushed memory

What magic number
Why avoided
Are case appropriate
A magic number direct usage number code
For example Java This refactored It improves readability code easier maintain
Imagine case I set size password field GUI
If I use magic number whenever max size change I change two code location
If I forget one lead inconsistency
The JDK full example like class
PS Static analysis tool like FindBugs PMD detects use magic number code suggests refactoring
A Magic Number value may change later stage therefore hard update
For example let say Page display last Orders Your Orders Overview Page
Magic Number set standard convention number made reason outlined spec
Now different place SQL script Website Your Last Orders order login possibly many place
Now happens someone decides change


You replace place likely miss
may work may used thing blindly replacing bad side effect
call also set user start reporting frequent timeouts
Also code hard understand
encounter middle complicated function developer familiar code may ask WTF
That best ambiguous arbitrary number exactly place make code readable also mean need change well defined place
Places Magic Numbers appropriate everything defined standard
sure standardized
Also everything defined within function might acceptable depends Context
Have taken look Wikipedia entry It go bit detail way magic number reference made
Here quote magic number bad programming practice The term magic number also refers bad programming practice using number directly source code without explanation
In case make program harder read understand maintain
Although guide make exception number zero one good idea define number code named constant
A magic number sequence character start file format protocol exchange
This number serf sanity check
Example Open GIF file see start
magic number
Other program read first character file properly identify GIFs
The danger random binary data contain character
But unlikely
As protocol exchange use quickly identify current passed corrupted valid
Magic number still useful
Magic Unknown semantic Symbolic Constant Provides correct semantic correct context use Semantic The meaning purpose thing
Create constant name meaning replace number
Martin Fowler First magic number number
Any basic value magic
Basic value manifest entity integer real double float date string booleans character
The issue data type magic aspect value appears code text
What mean magic
To precise By magic intend point semantics meaning purpose value context code unknown unknowable unclear confusing
This notion magic
A basic value magic semantic meaning quickly easily known clear understood confusing surround context without special helper word
symbolic constant
Therefore identify magic number measuring ability code reader know clear understand meaning purpose basic value surrounding context
The le known le clear confused reader magic basic value
We two scenario magic basic value
Only second primary importance programmer code An overarching dependency magic lone basic value
number commonly known semantic like Pi locally known semantic
program entirely clear context could abused good bad context
The semantics programming language allow u use lone basic value except perhaps data
table data
When encounter magic number generally context
Therefore answer Do I replace magic number symbolic constant
How quickly ass understand semantic meaning number purpose context
With thought mind quickly see number like Pi magic number placed proper context
x x radius
Here number mentally recognized Pi without symbolic constant identifier
Still generally replace symbolic constant identifier like Pi length complexity number
The aspect length complexity Pi coupled need accuracy usually mean symbolic identifier constant le prone error
Recognition Pi name simply convenient bonus primary reason constant
Laying aside common constant like Pi let focus primarily number special meaning meaning constrained universe software system
Such number might basic integer value
If I use number first question might What mean
The meaning unknown unknowable without context leaving use unclear confusing
Even though software happen language semantics want see carry special semantics obvious purpose alone
Let put lone context context GUI Container
In context meaning pixel graphical unit offer u quick guess semantics meaning purpose
We might stop say okay context nothing else need know
However perhaps software universe whole story
There padding context reveal
Let pretend pixel padding program variety throughout system
Therefore writing instruction good enough
The notion default revealed
Only I write context elsewhere I fully realize better fuller meaning semantic purpose system
The example pretty good could anything
Only limit range domain understanding program GUI UX part program finally make sense proper context
Here magic number factored symbolic constant within context GUI UX program order make use quickly understood greater context enclosing code
Thus basic value whose meaning semantic purpose sufficiently quickly understood good candidate symbolic constant place basic value
magic number
Numbers scale might semantics well
For example pretend making D D game notion monster
Our monster object feature called integer
The number meaning knowable clear without word supply meaning
Thus begin arbitrarily saying From symbolic constant start get mental picture aliveness deadness undeadness possible ramification consequence monster D D game
Without word symbolic constant left number ranging
Just range without word leaf u place possibly great confusion potentially error game different part game dependency range number mean various operation like
Therefore searching considering replacement magic number want ask question number within context software even number interact semantically
Let review question ought ask You might magic number
Examine manifest constant basic value code text
Ask question slowly thoughtfully instance value
Consider strength answer
Many time answer black white shade misunderstood meaning purpose speed learning speed comprehension
There also need see connects software machine around
In end answer replacement answer measure mind strength weakness reader make connection
get
The quickly understand meaning purpose le magic
CONCLUSION Replace basic value symbolic constant magic large enough cause difficult detect bug arising confusion
In programming magic number value given symbolic name instead slipped code literal usually one place
It bad reason SPOT Single Point Truth good If wanted change constant later would hunt code find every instance
It also bad might clear programmer number represents hence magic
People sometimes take magic number elimination moving constant separate file act configuration
This sometimes helpful also create complexity worth
A problem mentioned using magic number
If many odds reasonably good two different using magic number happen
And sure enough need change value one purpose
A magic number also number special hardcoded semantics
For example I saw system record IDs treated normally new record root created root
would cause WebService supply new ID
What bad reusing space signed integer record IDs special ability
Maybe never want create record ID negative ID even every person look either code database might stumble confused first
It go without saying special value
Arguably count magic number
I assume response earlier question
In programming magic number embedded numerical constant appears without explanation
If appears two distinct location lead circumstance one instance changed another
For reason important isolate define numerical constant outside place used
It worth noting sometimes want number code
There number including used optimized inverse square root algorithm
In rare case I find need use Magic Numbers I set const code document used work came
I always used term magic number differently obscure value stored within data structure verified quick validity check
For example gzip file contain first three byte Java class file start etc
You often see magic number embedded file format file sent around rather promiscuously lose metadata created
However magic number also sometimes used data structure like ioctl call
A quick check magic number processing file data structure allows one signal error early rather schlep way potentially lengthy processing order announce input complete balderdash
What initializing variable top class default value
For example In case magic number according CheckStyles
To setting default value okay
I want Does make difficult read
I never considered I installed CheckStyles
I even suggest magic number
A principle related magic number every fact code deal declared exactly
If use magic number code password length example marcio gave easily end duplicating fact understand fact change got maintenance problem
What return variable
I specially find challenging implementing
Imagine next stored procedure wrong syntax I know show example It return Id company exists particular table
Otherwise return
Somehow magic number
Some recommendation I read far say I really design somthing like By way return company exists
Ok set also return
Antoher option make two separate function So second stored procedure company exists
But afraid concurrency system company created another user
The bottom line way think using kind magic number relatively known safe tell something unsuccessful something exists
Another advantage extracting magic number constant give possibility clearly document business information
By posting answer agree

Does anybody know possibility differentiate text file binary file using magic number
Should include magic string used identify password
Is init data really four longs magic number
May UTC It arguable consider string number sort Consider shebang weak example
How used
How init data used
Is set longs always used
I familiar
I would say though May UTC Move article Jun UTC This category linked justification provided article wrong
Dec UTC After reading article I fooled around hexdump dumping first byte various file filesystem
But dumping shell script I found
article say
So I corrected article
But reading article say googling around dose make wiser
So I bit confused one correct
Apr UTC The line Unix shell script file recently edited
Actually either equally valid question
machine like box use machine like Sun computer yes Virginia Unixen use
Apr UTC Hexdump silly think care thing day word bit
Most GUI hex editor display hexdump byte order though group short
Most hex editor also show text representation I get around coding better hexdump sometime
Where byte order matter big endian preferred since extends easily say byte magic like order appears file
This confuses le people mean misaligned magic easier spot
May UTC hexdump silly order little big endian machine exactly
I sitting little endian machine Fedora Core running AMD processor
The hex code one

Endianess word applies Integer Float Double data type
If string character string character
Are sure file looking first person
The correct sequence
From magic file copyright file except description string sample shell descriptor Bourne shell script text executable nix machine others look shell November UTC Some people remember literal code generally bad seem think putting magic number variable constant especially global one language support like FIVE even text string accessDenied Access Denied
one useful example good solution problem
I think include least one paragraph explain approach shit different icing point avoiding magic number code put descriptive variable related content content type much purpose
okay
Especially value might changed IS production code constant like EIGHT later set I kidding
April UTC This article mention sometimes number magic
These usually limited sometimes
I say I seen code look like useless since add layer indirection layer abstraction
May UTC Are constant really considered magic number
I always thought term magic number limited usage arbitrary number used uniquely distinguishing identifier
The section coding style seems place
Using deck card analogy coding example showed spade club etc
would seem applicable example showing constant number card deck
May UTC I think somewhat misleading describe acceptable literal number
This totally ignores real issue programmer symbolising literal number make code
In way symbolised sometimes
On side totally ignores presence numerous algorithm involve doubling halving binary search reversing array etc
Symbolising would silly
March UTC I dare oppose programmer would concede use zero two allowable
In fact programmer use magic number good purpose
The people fire antipattern shotgun everything always right
Sure people abuse magic number like abuse anything make wrong
Magic number example used give constant meaning much like ordinary enum still visible binary code debugger
In respect magic number disadvantage number one notable exception switch statement compiler implement switch efficiently using jump table continguous number enum used
As example magic number used file format data block Microsoft good example sensible appication
If ever deal document coming different encoding BOM make life programmer user lot happier I wish Unicode Consortium thought something similar beginning
In spirit bold I rewritten entire section acceptable use magic number
I added example common usage magic number code drawn programming experience
I mentioned added note macro definition cstdlib world
Likewise null pointer use
November UTC I added request expansion template section virtually empty
I hoping see discussion thing like assigned number equivalent protocol etc
May UTC I consider number listed Magic debug value notable enough worth mentioning
I like remove number mention used well one use mentioned notable I consider string random person using MAC address chat nick notable
January UTC someone please append April UTC While I agree magic constant generally bad NPOV statement put encyclopedia article
Wikipedia coding style handbook
I think section changed reflect neutral point view
July UTC It hard totally neutral something widely acknowledged negative
See Wikipedia section Spaghetti code instance
Or may want peruse entry category
That said I gon na rewrite intro little le prescriptive I also add ref
Am original author
December UTC Anyone else think section slightly strange
It first say magic number acceptable context
Then say acceptance subjective
Yet go rather detailed prescription It noted multiplying dividing acceptable multiplying dividing value value defined named constant
If acceptance magic number subjective wikipedia really giving detailed advice
I think section read like textbook weasel wording While acceptance subjective
And I happen think describes generally accepted truth
But may October UTC I replaced instance word value byte sequence file format discussed specify certain certain
This distinction especially important light byte since magic number sequence regardless underlying hardware reading file
Where endianness issue given magic number file format mentioned
December UTC Can someone please explain line
I believe using index generally acceptable
Should better three concept mentioned article
I think main article rather disambiguation page link others
Mariano For reason almost always return reference
Would considered magic number
I think better programming example needed
Currently example encourage another poor programming practice could lead buffer overrun array shorter deckSize
For example Would better written April UTC state I think best example could give
The size playing card deck changed card card card IIRC tile casino card invented
I see substantial likelihood number card change even facilitate program implementing card game
March UTC say following However changing MZ ZM cause modern version Windows puke
This independently verifiable hex editor
Maybe information date
November UTC I removed entry debug value table Seen Intel binary platform see
I see CEFAEDFE say FEEDFACE read byte backwards I still happy explanation
The Apple hardware booted mode could switch little endian point
object file could contain either PowerPC code presumably either endianness
Also word Intel sentence
Were chip big endian Apple machine made Motorola
What debugger would running hardware would display FEEDFACE CEFAEDFE
And kind file would displayed
One meant kind hardware
Why developer type magic number way would display garbled debugger
I sorry entry raise far question answer
If anyone explain meant illustrate least need rewrite entry share joke
January UTC Regarding I want say IDEs show value named constant example hovering mouse mention looking window even defined completely different file elsewhere project
Just saying
I know mention make clear I sure matter
But completely insane mean
July UTC removed reference basis support point text namely use magic number make difficult program adapted extended future
From second page link address impact poor practice specifically citing use magic constant example poor practice code maintenance longevity another way saying adapted extended future
February UTC help detect typo disingenuous
Obviously example cited name variable need initialized initial value may easily mistyped
It could argued opportunity mistype initial value named variable variable name referenced
June UTC Phil Short This article need link another article listing bad coding practice
Hello fellow Wikipedians I modified external link
Please take moment review
If question need bot ignore link page altogether please visit additional information
I made following change When finished reviewing change may follow instruction template fix issue URLs
December UTC

Ever since first person wrote calculator nerd hiding secret number inside PC using negotiate secret handshake application file
Today take quick look entertaining example
Most programming language use integer type represent certain type data behind scene internally number stored RAM used CPU one zero source code would written either regular decimal format hexadecimal format us number letter A When operating system application want determine type file look beginning file special marker signifies type file
For instance PDF file might start hex value equal ASCII format ZIP file start equal PK descends original PKZip utility
By looking signature file type easily identified even without metadata
The Linux utility file used terminal determine type file fact called When application want call function pas value function using standard type like integer expressed source code hexadecimal format
This especially true constant identifier defined name like map actual integer type value
So instead programmer typing value like every time call function source code could use constant better readability
Constants usually easily recognized written capital letter
All example fall term might require specific hexadecimal number order function file type work value correct work
And programmer want little fun might define value using hexadecimal number spell something English otherwise known
If take quick look see system call Linux requires magic variable passed equal hexadecimal number
If something tried call function without passing magic value first would return error
The GUID globally unique identifier form ASCII string Hah IdontNeedEFI allusion fact GPT would normally used necessarily
Microsoft famously supporting source code submitted Linux finally removed source code altogether
More fun example include These one course short list example seemed fun
Know
Tell u comment
You see example opening hex editor opening number file type
There plenty freeware hex editor available Windows OS X Linux get infected crapware spyware
As added example recovery image Android phone like ClockworkMod start ANDROID read ASCII format
go changing anything looking around

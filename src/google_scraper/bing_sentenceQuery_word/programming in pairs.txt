Become fan Slashdot Actually experience valuable I rather hire programmer college education
Although possible learn everything CS degree teach without attending actual school people
It efficient learn part degree although learn quite bit eventually need never know part thing NOT need
Without knowing least something compiler theory relational model discrete math data structure basic algorithm much software developer matter much experience trivial programming
At least CS simple like say simple problem solved
If learn great mind rather go solve trial error worse never learn
colossaly wasting time
Either ignorant useful technique used awfully lot time reinventing wheel
However learning enough maybe depends kind thing working I certainly agree one go use knowledge
Going higher degree without intervening experience silly ignoring CS theory altogether
So saying code OK poor communication skill ca fit corporate structure
Do want mean CS degree problem people getting job remember lack social skill
Imagine someone good people skill code
I bet person get job
Until find magical job allows sole developer project people skill relevant skill programmer
It seems something lack surprised inability find job feel commensurate coding ability
This college anymore
You get work
A good coder ca interact people le valuable decent coder
If care notice could learn valuable life lesson
An MBA management work experience worthless monitarily speaking
Many university wo even accept program unless management role
You sir never experienced joy using one international tax treaty make income foreign assignment citizen would otherwise taxable taxable completely offset foreign tax credit ta da
eligible moving expense associated assignment paid year tax resident deductable income following year
Accounting potential interesting hack
When last time got figuratively go Nyeah nyeah nyeah nyeah
IRS CRA Canada Revenue Agency
This story come good time I pondering exact issue I considering studying MBA course start May I need move fast
They two MBAs I consider option though I somewhat undecided go I process engineer process manager involved process control improvement pa After experience membership professional society eg IEEE whatever better certification cost le exclusive
Certifications third list
They OK peop I find even discussion friend branch advertising hardly served application available hour talking seeing really need get day could probably whip together something simple would rather garbage MS Office wrestle
Consider pro taking respectable understanding technology career law politics even
Psychology
Do laugh Psychology minor extremely useful particularly class dealt cognitive Psychology directly applicable interface
I intend turn full Bachelor someday
If thinking going back school look lot different subject find something really interested idea taking class subject sort exciting take class
If real concern looking token degree give resume superficial bump sound like job PHB case go ahead get MBA
You learn necessary synergize order get greatest possible ROI
Otherwise take interesting class see lead
I CS physic bachelor primary aim physic
I found compsci degree helpful I work particle physic I writing ton analytical code
Also planned development government lab ability create accurate model good thing physic help
Management obviously MBA
I also consider humanity particularly English degree always complain plight illiterate
employee look good go long way
year major commitment polish writing though
That said I find I need humanity stay sane probably time well spent
Besides CS grad would make horrible lawyer general one significant reason horrible communication skill
Lawyers intelligent analytical trait many CS degree also able effectively communicate idea others trait CS holder experience
Keep mind someone CS degree undergrad friend one sibling attended top law school US
Let tell find group rabid alpha people competitive law school
And somehow CS geek rabid alpha rarely refer person
On hand area learning really would like know History Physics English Lit etc get degree
It far interesting make much interesting candidate
But
Personally unlimited time fund I recommend law degree
Fight good fight SCO
What deluge criminal computer case next decade
You would perfect situation take advantage
I going mod I got last line comment
Legal work actually starting get outsourced country US since US site blah blah I would say biggest caveat economics program really depend professor
Spending year econ program cruddy prof rather painful
The biggest gain econ background even MBA general business degress people throwing around make decision programmer box positively affect business whole
Too many programmer idealogue sense implementing feature X bad idea cost Y increase sale Y
The ability make suggestion development better help business whole make valuable probably make better working environment
Oh also good starting point striking innovator
There magic degree bullet
I went school lot undergrad degree biology
A number premeds wanted go medicine thought degree would magic carpet high income job security
As turned thing simple
HMOs put pressure doctor fee medicine field burnout people want admit
For people good relationship people premeds I knew seeing people kind thing year year becomes huge bore
By time hit forty doctor would like something else late easily change profession used making lot money
Since degree I know guarantee good income job security AND interesting work might well go degree something interest might improve job prospect
If I get another degree I get degree quantitative finance
That application mathematical technique financial modeling trading stock bond foreign exchange
Having solid software background ability handle math big asset
Of course u downside may live around New York city feature people
If English appeal degree humanity look since require language research skill present renaissance person code zombie
Read someone make decision someone subject
History also particularly good
Remember CS major stereotypically introverted nerd ca communicate anyone speak LISP
CS major MBAs stereotypically ca communicate anyone speak Marketroid
Anything prove either help lot
If interested computational biology bioinformatics made either academia industry
With genomic revolution looming people apply knowledge CS algorithm problem HUGE demand
Feel free replace biology biochemistry molecular biology biomedical engineering degree particular taste warrant
APL natural extension assembler language programming best educational purpose

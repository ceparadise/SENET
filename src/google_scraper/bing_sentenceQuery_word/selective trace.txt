Additive manufacturing printing process turning digital design object
It convenient affordable way make prototype well finished product making popular business hobbyist inventor
One technology used today printer called selective laser sintering SLS
During SLS tiny particle plastic ceramic glass fused together heat laser form solid object
The SLS process developed patented Carl Deckard undergraduate student University Texas mechanical engineering professor Joe Beaman
Deckard Beaman involved founding one first printing startup Desk Top Manufacturing DTM
In DTM sold Systems company previously developed though much different method printing known
While Deckard Beaman patented process selective laser sintering far first use sintering process creating object powder using atomic diffusion create three dimensional object
Sintering used thousand year create everyday object like brick porcelain jewelry
Like method printing object printed SLS machine start design CAD file
CAD file converted format understood printing apparatus
Objects printed SLS made powder material commonly plastic nylon dispersed thin layer top build platform inside SLS machine
A laser controlled computer tell object print pulse platform tracing object onto powder
The laser heat powder either boiling point sintering boiling point melting fuse particle powder together solid form
Once initial layer formed platform SLS machine drop usually le exposing new layer powder laser trace fuse together
This process continues entire object printed
When object fully formed left cool machine removed
Unlike method printing SLS requires little additional tooling object printed meaning object usually sanded otherwise altered come SLS machine
SLS require use additional support hold object together printed
Such support often necessary printing method stereolithography fused deposition modeling making method SLS
See also SLS machine print object variety material plastic glass ceramic even metal related process known direct metal laser sintering
This make popular process creating prototype well final product
SLS proved particularly useful industry need small quantity object printed high quality material
One example aerospace industry SLS used build prototype airplane part
Because airplane built small quantity remain service many year company produce physical mold airplane part
These mold would expensive make would need stored long period time without damaged corroded
Using SLS company create prototype stored digitally file redesign reprint needed
Because SLS machine print range material flexible plastic ceramic SLS also popular method printing customized product hearing aid dental retainer prosthetics
And object printed SLS rely mold require additional tooling also useful anyone wish print highly complex particularly delicate object
company often associated SLS printing United States
The company print part customer also sell SLS machine use business manufacturing
There also around United States use SLS machine provide client prototype finished part
While many desktop printer market printer use method printing fused deposition modeling FDM SLS
Because SLS requires use laser often expensive potentially dangerous use home
However several intrepid inventor working version desktop SLS printer
Andreas Bastian engineering student Swarthmore College recently developed creates wax carbon object
And Focus SLS printer another homemade SLS machine could bring technology home consumer
The instruction building Focus SLS printer available

This service advanced JavaScript available learn Energy efficient performance efficient instruction fetch unit critical issue modern processor design
Trace cache store dynamic stream significantly improve performance efficiency
Conventional trace cache CTC usually adopts set associative structure requires probing data way parallel output matched way used energy accessing way wasted
In paper propose selective way based trace cache SWTC probe selected way instead probing data way
In SWTC trace divided several type stored cache type
Then trace cache partially activated accessed
Based design principle SWTC model proposed evaluated paper
Simulation result show compared CTC SWTC reduce energy consumption fetch unit average providing almost performance term number instruction per cycle

In program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
Most commonly profiling information serf aid program
Profiling achieved either program binary executable form using tool called
Profilers may use number different technique statistical instrumented simulation method
Profilers use wide variety technique collect data including operating system
Profilers used process
Program analysis tool extremely important understanding program behavior
Computer architect need tool evaluate well program perform new
Software writer need tool analyze program identify critical section code
writer often use tool find well algorithm performing
The output profiler may tool existed platform early usually based timer interrupt recorded PSW set detect hot spot executing code
This early example see
In early permitted full trace feature
program analysis Unix date back Unix system included basic tool listed function much program execution time used
In extended concept complete analysis
In Amitabh Srivastava published paper describing ATOM Analysis Tools OM
The ATOM platform convert program profiler insert code program analyzed
That inserted code output analysis data
This technique modifying program analyze known
In ATOM paper appeared list influential paper period ending
Flat profilers compute average call time call break call time based callee context
profilers show call time frequency function also involved based callee
In tool full context preserved
profilers add dimension flat profilers relating performance measure feature input workload input size input value
They generate chart characterize application performance scale function input
Profilers also program analyze target program collecting information execution
Based data granularity profilers collect information classified event based statistical profilers
Since profilers interrupt program execution collect information finite resolution time measurement taken grain salt
The programming language listed profilers Some profilers operate
A sampling profiler probe target program regular interval using
Sampling profile typically le numerically accurate specific allow target program run near full speed
The resulting data exact statistical approximation
The actual amount error usually one sampling period
In fact value n time sampling period expected error n sampling period
In practice sampling profilers often provide accurate picture target program execution approach intrusive target program thus many side effect memory cache instruction decoding pipeline
Also since affect execution speed much detect issue would otherwise hidden
They also relatively immune cost small frequently called routine loop
They show relative amount time spent user mode versus interruptible kernel mode processing
Still kernel code handle interrupt entail minor loss CPU cycle diverted cache usage unable distinguish various task occurring uninterruptible kernel code activity
Dedicated hardware go beyond ARM recent MIPS processor JTAG interface PCSAMPLE register sample truly undetectable manner allowing collection flat profile
Some commonly used statistical profilers OSX Linux Parallel Amplifier part
This technique effectively add instruction target program collect required information
Note program cause performance change may case lead inaccurate result
The effect depend information collected level detail required
For example adding code count every call probably le effect counting many time statement obeyed
A computer special hardware collect information case impact program minimal
Instrumentation key determining level control amount time resolution available profilers

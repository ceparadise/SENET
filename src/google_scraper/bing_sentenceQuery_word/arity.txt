In number function take
The arity dimension corresponding
A function arity thus arity considered relation
The term spring word like unary binary ternary etc
Unary function predicate may also called monadic similarly binary function may called dyadic
In mathematics arity may also named word many meaning mathematics
In logic philosophy arity also called
In arity usually named
In often distinction syntactical operator usually arity also common
Functions vary widely number argument though large number become unwieldy
Some programming language also offer support function syntactically accepting variable number argument
The term arity rarely employed everyday usage
For example rather saying arity operation addition operation arity one usually say addition binary operation
In general naming function operator given arity follows convention similar one used
One combine prefix ending example Sometimes useful consider operation arity hence call
Also function without argument meaningful necessarily constant due
Often function fact might including whole state system time free memory
The latter important example usually also exist purely functional programming language
Examples mathematics programming include unary minus plus increment decrement operator language logical language unary one complex number however two part lower level abstraction function mathematics
The operator example unary operator math programming
All function especially descended technically unary see
According Latin distributives forth term singulary correct adjective rather unary
follows Quine usage
Most operator encountered programming form
For programming mathematics addition operator division operator
Logical predicate typically used binary operator two distinct operand
In architecture common two source operand store result one
From variant come taking three parameter
also contains ternary operator multiplies first two number dividing third intermediate result double cell number
This used intermediate result would overflow single cell
ternary conditional expression
The several ternary operator pop three value stack efficiently compute
Additionally many instruction ternary opposed two operand specified CISC higher load MOV register content calculated memory location sum parenthesis register
From mathematical point view function argument always considered function one single argument element
However may convenient notation consider function example linear map product space
The true programming language function taking several argument could always defined function taking single argument language
In computer science function accepting variable number argument called
In logic philosophy predicate relation accepting variable number argument called anadic variably polyadic
There Latinate name specific arity primarily based Latin meaning group though based
Only commonly used derived distributive number
So use expand concept nary anary usage found yet
An alternative nomenclature derived similar fashion corresponding root example
Thence derive alternative term
These word often used describe anything related number board

Hi You talk arity function operation something like addition could arity negation usually arity
A paper I reading talking positive arity negative arity I understand mean
The author give example classical logic say disjunction conjuction positive arity negation negative arity
I suppose I reading bit level I get need distinction
The paper question Definition Example relevant bit
Can anyone lend insight
While I never seen notion may common may first paper us term Comment basically explains idea
A relation r R n relation propositional formula I believe first n input considered positive last negative
To see mean consider following case
Say r R relation
input positive
Further say B deducible A
You look paper see deducible exactly mean
Then since arity positive r B deducible r A
An example would trivial relation r A A
Another example positive arity conjunction classical logic
If deductible respectively deducible
In negative case opposite
Say r R relation
input negative
Again say B deducible A
Then since arity negative r A deducible r B opposite direction
An example would negation relation classical logic B deducible A A deducible B
The contrapositive
These combined relation positive negative arity
An example implication classical logic R relation
one positive arity one negative arity
If deducible respectively deductible
This basically implies implies implies
The antecedent negative input consequent positive one
I hope help
Edit Jason Rute beat second
From quick look paper seems negative arity refers

nice higher order function completely necessary avoid runtime support case favourable use function pointer instead since generate huge code bloat certain scenario
Under condition safe implement higher order call using function pointer instead reducing huge switch table static call
My initial thought something known arity

I read logic general undecidable could decidable working unary operator
I think propositional logic correct I wrong The question I would like see reference material least simple way think passage unary lead undecidable problem
Logic unary operator called
The thing called logic predicate constant quantifier
The follows predicate logic least one binary predicate powerful enough express logic sufficiently complicated statement Turing machine get undecidability
In contrast monadic logic unary predicate describe working Turing machine
I deliberately vague give idea without getting bogged technicality
As Raphael pointed comment probably asking decidability classical decision problem fragment first order logic unary predicate
The search syntactically restricted fragment logic validity formula decidable active field research year
It understood early dependency variable make decision problem difficult
And dependency best expressed two variable occur within argument predicate
Therefore binary predicate functional symbol allow functional symbol essential undecidability
It gave decision procedure logic unary predicate
If interested might find intriguing exposition paper titled written Yuri Gurevich form dialog two fictitious character
The paper first published Bulletin EATCS
The paper introduces problem explains search developed finding complete classification decidable undecidable fragment term quantifier prefix

Researchers developed computer program defeat even best human player
Illustration Peter Maria By Card shark beware
A new program beaten variety poker called limit Texas Hold least human team computer scientist report
Researchers previously developed unbeatable algorithm game checker new work mark first time scientist found algorithm solved complex game information state game card opponent hand remains hidden player
The program yielded insight could help player improve game general approach may usefulness security health care application
Because hidden information luck draw program wo necessarily win every hand explains computer scientist Michael Bowling University Alberta Edmonton Canada led study
But average program good human would chance ever edging ahead even two played million hand
So purpose anyone would ever care solved game Bowling say
Some game easier solve others
For example even child learn force draw every time
In contrast took computer scientist year plenty computing power
And either game much simpler poker number reason
In checker player full knowledge state game every turn
In poker player see card
And unlike checker poker involves luck betting bluffing factor make impossible find strategy guarantee win draw every hand
In fact poker complicated Bowling colleague decided study relatively specialized version called limit Texas Hold em
In two player compete size bet limited
To begin player place bet dealt two card
Three laid middle table
Then two card played table
Each player try make best three card table
After round card player check bet match opponent bet raise bet fold
During round betting player must least match opponent bet stay game
In end one fold better hand win pot
The researcher developed strategy pitting computer series training round
After playing computer examined move see making different choice would improved result
It calculated regret mathematical measure much lost imperfect move
As computer practiced improved strategy regret gradually diminished
In solved game regret would zero move would perfect
After training algorithm computer regret close zero game could beaten human lifetime
In way computer calculated vast table strategy possible action game
For every hand computer look whether fold bet
Given hand program always take action instead bet certain fraction time fold certain fraction time
The program even weak hand program usually fold occasionally bet
Bluffing turn mathematical basis optimized action
Technically value regret function researcher achieved mean game exactly solved even better program could found
But strategy good essentially pointless keep looking better algorithm say computer scientist Murray Campbell IBM Thomas Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights New York work program
In poker never get exact perfect solution get close nobody could ever tell difference
Phil Laak professional poker player based Los Angeles California played earlier program Bowling group say program like one useful tool professional
Such program say improve game might worry take joy
Poker somehow grab imagination romance attached I think forever exist said
In fact program may already providing insight game
The program play larger range hand professional player making bet weak hand professional player tend fold
It also confirmed conventional wisdom dealer round hold advantage
But although new strategy never lose may maximize winning situation
When playing weak player strategy conservative rake biggest possible winning
Although study poker may seem like fun game advance game theory application area airport security coast guard patrol health care people must make decision using limited information available
I think exciting step paper make I think part broader development algorithm say Vincent Conitzer computer scientist Duke University Durham North Carolina

A computer program designed play game human opponent computer opponent
It commonly referred simply
These bot used often situation either legitimate opponent human player form
Whether use bot constitutes cheating typically defined poker room host actual poker game
Most cardroom forbid use bot although level enforcement site operator varies considerably
The subject player bot computer assistance playing online poker controversial
Player opinion quite varied come deciding type computer software fall category unfair advantage
One primary factor defining bot whether computer program interface poker client word play without help human operator
Computer program ability said autoplayer universally defined category bot regardless well play poker
The issue unfair advantage much type information artificial intelligence available
In addition bot play many hour time without human weakness endure natural variance game without influenced human
On hand bot significant disadvantage example difficult bot accurately read bluff adjust strategy opponent way human
While term condition poker site generally forbid use bot level enforcement depends site operator
Some seek ban bot user utilization variety software tool
The poker client programmed detect bot although controversial right might seen tantamount embedding client software
Another method use random interval play
The subject house bot even controversial due conflict interest potentially pose
By strictest definition house bot automated player operated online poker room although would define indirect example example player operating bot knowledge consent operator house bot well
These type bot would equivalent brick mortar
In brick mortar casino house player subvert fairness game offered long house dealing honestly
In online setting also true
By definition honest online poker room chooses operate house bot would guarantee house bot access information also available player hand would apply human well
The problem online setting house way prove bot receiving sensitive information card server
This exacerbated ease clandestine information sharing accomplished digital environment
It essentially impossible even house prove control player probably real way could done would disclose confidential personal information every player obviously done due consideration
Poker game card play concealed thus making difficult anyone including computer deduce final outcome hand
Because lack information computer programmer implement system based imperfect technique
AIs like PokerSnowie created allowing computer determine best possible strategy letting play enormous number time
This seems current approach poker AI opposed attempting make computer play like human
This result odd bet sizing much different strategy human used seeing
Methods developed least approximate perfect poker strategy perspective two player game increasingly good system created game
Perfect strategy multiple meaning context
From optimal point view perfect strategy one expect lose player strategy however optimal strategy vary presence player weakness exploited
In case perfect strategy would one correctly closely model weakness take advantage make profit explained
A large amount research computer poker player performed Computer Poker Research Group led Michael Bowling
The group developed agent
licensed entertainment game featuring Canadian poker player
available name SparBot poker training program Poker Academy
The series program competed Annual Computer Poker Competition recently taking three gold medal six event competition
The line research also produced played human professional became first computer poker program win meaningful poker competition
In January article Michael Bowling Neil Burch Michael Johanson Oskari Tammelin claimed poker bot essentially weakly solved game limit Texas hold
Sandholm Gilpin started poker AI research beginning unbeatable agent game called Hold
Next step outperformed best commercially available poker bot
Since poker agent group participated annual computer competition
At point program better best human player claim Sandholm
His bot faced four human opponent
In program latest software faced four professional poker player
By end experiment four human player lost combined million
A team consists small number scientist employ create enhance Texas Hold em poker agent
The group applies different AI technique number game including participation commercial project Small Worlds
Neo Poker Lab established science team focused research poker artificial intelligence
For several year developed applied algorithm procedure like regret minimization gradient search equilibrium approximation decision tree recursive search method well expert algorithm solve variety problem related game poker
One earliest poker bot competition organized International Conference Cognitive Modelling
The tournament hosted five bot various university around world
The winner Ace Gruber
The ACM hosted competition competitor submit actual piece software able play poker specific platform
The event host operate everything conduct contest report result
citation reference link needed
In summer online poker room Golden Palace hosted promotional tournament Las Vegas old Binions giveaway prize
It billed World Series Poker Robots
The tournament bot entry fee
The bot developer computer scientist six nationality traveled expense
The host platform Poker Academy
The event also featured demonstration headsup event Phil Laak
In summer hosted highly specialized headsup tournament human Polaris bot AAAI conference Vancouver BC Canada
The host platform written
There maximum giveaway purse special rule motivate human play well
The human paid entry fee
The unique tournament featured four duplicate style session hand
The human narrow margin
In summer poker coaching website Stoxpoker ran second tournament World Series Poker Las Vegas
The tournament six duplicate session hand human player Limit specialist
Polaris tournament win loss draw
The result tournament including hand history match available competition website
From Carnegie Mellon University Sandholm latest bot faced four human opponent series Texas match
Finally playing hand human combined total
But even though human technically scientist considered win statistically insignificant rather statistical tie compared total betting amount million
However determined claim disingenuous
Statistically insignificant mean programmer Claudico say confidence confidence interval human better computer program
However statistically significant win confidence interval
This mean human player somewhere favorite
The way tournament structured two set two player
In two set player got opposite card
Meaning computer Ace Spades Nine Clubs human one computer two player set computer
However even human player winning player positive head head match ups
The total player winning follows Since Annual Computer Poker Competition run series competition poker program
In three type poker played Limit Texas Texas Limit Texas
Within event two winner named agent win match agent win money
These winner often agent one evaluation reward robust player reward player good exploiting agent mistake
The competition motivated scientific research emphasis ensuring result statistically significant running million hand poker
The competition format million hand played eliminate luck factor
Some researcher developed web application people could play ass quality AI
So December following top group individual researcher agent could found

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I looking way make easier perform planning poker virtual team
team one another
Requirements successful planning poker The obvious answer tool found seems bit heavy need
I want make team member sign account entering story seems like bit much
We tried thing like holding chat session online everyone process get little biased fact people see input others
What else could I hold successful planning poker session virtual team
Since appear many specific solution problem I ended writing simple web app meet need
I think even team might like use
Check Google Hangouts
So team meeting virtual folk still see planning poker almost effective get team member room
I done lot distributed planning year without formal planning poker estimate
Here tip worked
Have written backlog story
It matter spreadsheet Google Docs Trello planning poker app make sure backlog written somewhere everyone access
If else fails single document shared screen
VNC Google Hangouts Mikogo suffice emergency
Avoid people message vote Scrum Master privately big reveal
Scrum team average seven nine people plus Scrum Master onerous
Let Scrum Master collect vote share group
Other viable alternative include If stuck using planning session let people meeting email estimate Scrum Master reveal
Since additional vote often reconciling outlying vote anchoring somewhat le important since folk openly discussing story estimate point anyway
Alternatively Scrum Master put conference call hold call people individually additional vote
Be creative
Ask team
Planning poker estimation tool required Scrum artifact practice
If planning poker work team invite brainstorm better way help team estimate easiest common Scrum Master
The simplest thing I think
You set server Skype participant log time enter number
I think need take another look
It simple I imagine heavy
Only leader would type paste story even could refer story number URL whatever want
Also one leader log participant even log

Researchers developed computer program say beat human planet particular variant Texas poker
The scientist planning clean
Instead hope help computer become better face uncertainty
The work journal
Poker player know game mixture luck statistic psychology
You need know odds know whether opponent bluffing
In word You got know hold know fold
The variety strategy one use play poker truly immense according computer scientist University Alberta Canada invented new program
There trillion different decision point game Bowling say
So actual number way playing astronomically large number
But case Limit Texas variant two player betting capped one trillion strategy beat others
It matter human opponent master bluffer blundering amateur Bowling say computer using single best strategy eventually win
It took Bowling year find winning approach
His team crunch strategy supercomputer
The final push ultimate strategy crunched computing cluster made nearly CPUs according graduate student project
It took cluster two month find answer Johanson say
Almost thousand year computation went
But end perfect strategy scientist say
Well almost perfect
It tiny bit Bowling say
And tiny bit small even played lifetime hour day hand hour year still would able tell apart played perfect game
The strategy confirms several belief among poker player
For example program always raise stake reasonable hand first bet
But computer program also showed surprise
It often bet even hold pair card like four three according Bowling
Many professional player would fold least call weak hand
Bowling say program much threat online gambler
Limit variety poker people play
But believe poker bot trying win online game room
My guess probably quite strong poker bot say
But going hear lot talk
He hope program developed help make computer generally better making decision faced uncertainty
head Seattle Allen Institute Artificial Intelligence say new program breakthrough
Etzioni note computer beaten human chess checker backgammon even But say human still edge Each computer involves different computer software say
In word highly specialized trick winning particular game
The human Etzioni say still eon ahead computer program general intelligence

Program file chapter The picture show architecture University California campus Berkeley
At left picture South Hall one original campus building red brick ivy many chimney
The white brick clock tower dominates center picture Sather Tower popularly called Campanile building Venice Italy modeled
Just left Evans Hall concrete fortress house Mathematics Department
Andrews Hall front picture small building unusually shaped roof
Stephens Hall mostly hidden tree behind Andrews zigzag
And similar view Stanford University campus Palo Alto California
Compared Berkeley building one see look uniform
At left first photo corner Quadrangle central building complex campus
The School Education path left follows pattern rough tan stone sloping orange roof
The Meyer Library rear photo follows color scheme even though obviously recent building
The second photo show new School Law
In building architect clearly worked combine tan stone orange roof theme modern detail texture stone uniform arch le ornate
Both campus result architectural planning illustrate two different planning
The Stanford campus planned first came overall concept detail fill concept
The Berkeley campus planned new building designed fit architect idea immediate local situation
Some individual building quite beautiful building rather campus unit attract attention
I oversimplifying course
In strictly approach entire campus would laid paper building built
Adding new building later even made fit old one mean original plan defective
Instead patching purist would architect begin allowing building beginning design process
And fact original Berkeley campus much uniform campus today rapid growth led widespread change original plan
Still difference architectural planning style striking suggestive
The two planning strategy possible computer programming
Suppose want write program play I Chapter
You start saying Let see I draw board
You write procedure draw four line make grid
Then might write procedure draw X O right size box made
And
That would design
Alternatively might start deciding major task program carry
You might write procedure like In writing I freely used subprocedures I written yet
Later I could fill gap writing procedure exactly needed fill place main procedure
In recent year majority computer scientist adopted school thought called structured programming
This phrase title book Dahl Edsger Dijkstra Hoare describes uncompromising philosophy programming
Structured programming idea though also includes rule step program development process
For example one potential problem programming hard test procedure written subprocedures written also
By contrast subprocedure tested superprocedures written
Structured programming solves problem recommending use preliminary version subprocedures really job provide result allows procedure tested
For example operation written yet might replaced stub always output zero empty list simple appropriate value
More importantly structured programming approach tell u write procedure first written detailed specification program behave detailed plan organized achieve goal
The programming language Pascal designed Niklaus Wirth promote programming style philosophy like structured programming
Pascal meant teach structured style providing tool needed approach making hard program style
The widespread use Pascal college programming course reflects popularity structured programming approach
As I preparing second edition book Pascal beginning lose ground teaching language several competing school thought programming led diverse language choice
The best known right language exemplifies approach program structure
Others Ada Modula two language le Pascal tradition Scheme like Logo dialect Lisp represents artificial intelligence tradition
One area computer science approach accepted enthusiastically artificial intelligence
AI researcher try program computer carry complex task playing chess prototypical example single obvious method
In kind research project start writing paper complete specification finished program organized
Instead start le vague idea try programming play around try improve result
That one reason majority AI program written Lisp language interactive encourages program keyboard
Pascal hand designed language must write entire program carry single instruction
Logo dialect Lisp developed artificial intelligence researcher
Their idea see could use experience problem trying get computer think order help human being learn think effectively least certain kind problem
You surprised therefore learn Logoites tend enthusiastic structured programming
It planning
On contrary
Planning one fundamental skill
But many kind planning
The kind every part program behavior written begin programming realistic many context
Even business government project structured programmer like talk common ultimate user program change mind work experience using
The wise programmer anticipate changing requirement original planning process
Still one never anticipates everything sensible person faced unexpected change requirement flexible enough modify initial plan start
And even true people like learning program goal programming project exploratory rather predetermined
Sometimes human life depend correct operation computer program
In one famous example time first edition book published one person died others injured program controlling medical machine gave patient massive overdoses radiation
Certainly programming technique help prevent accident valuable
Still technique applicable programming situation necessarily best technique beginning learner even experienced researcher exploring new area rather writing production program
To make concrete I like show actual planning process programming project
I going write Logo program tell I I go along
I sitting rather crowded desk left microcomputer running Logo right terminal I call large computer I use text editing
I switch back forth I work
Please understand I showing Official Logo Programming Style
I showing one way one Logo programmer approach particular project
The project I mind announce value poker hand
That program behave something like In imagining sample dialogue I kind planning
I specified example form I intend represent hand list five card card word combining rank suit standing heart spade diamond club
I suppose mean I decided playing draw poker rather stud
But later I may want think choice
I also written specific message program print although I much le certain
I may may actually bother detail parenthesis example
Okay program work
I envision series test particular kind poker hand
So head vague procedure template like This something I ready type computer
I still thinking detail likely work
One thing come mind stand great duplication effort
The test royal flush like test straight flush plus particular special condition ace high
I really make test twice
For matter test straight flush test straight combined test flush
I another instruction starting repeating test
I also read list representing hand million time time pulling rank without suit vice versa
It seems I begin going hand extracting various kind information bunch variable
I probably along thing like list rank appear twice hand
I sure exactly variable I need I impatient start programming
What I going write initialization procedure set information
In revising chapter second edition I find I different idea write initialization procedure
But I think worthwhile since chapter planning program finished product preserve original version reasoning led write
In next section I show another approach
I write insert new member list set empty list
Why example
Pairhood property part hand whereas straighthood property entire hand
It make sense say three five card form straight
But list help determining whether hand straight flush respectively
For instance flush hand one suit turn list length one hand flush
A full house hand one rank listed another listed
I seem violating rule explicit assignment variable made
But course whole point initialization procedure variable used later procedure one one subprocedures
In large project typical initialization procedure assign value nonlocal variable
If I careful I get around writing I probably put instruction variable
I write without thinking I hope
It one standard template Do something member list
It obvious go inside I imagine instruction
So I start writing anyway
Okay time thinking
I see going lot instruction
I subprocedure handle
By way see I extract rank card rather
It would matter except ten rank two digit
That ten spade represented word
The word single digit number really want
I know second input name variable like value variable like I used technique like
That input going used among thing first input invocation
need variable order able change value
Although particular notation specific Logo programming language way distinguish similar mechanism handle special case subprocedure must able modify superprocedure variable
What
The idea I seen particular rank I insert But bug
If I put instruction one I already written rank found I put
Instead I put instruction one insert
In fact problem arise list
I start testing inserting work way
This illustrates general rule I learned rule hour debugging earlier project I recognize situation right away
Here finished procedure The command efficiency
Suppose I found particular rank three time already poker hand card I looking fourth rank
Then first succeed since rank already member
If command omitted I go next instruction would find rank therefore insert
But unnecessary I found rank need insert
In word insert card list need check see list smaller run rank
Of course sort funny list since ca one poker hand
But structure make instruction pleasingly similar
I notice another potential bug
When I add rank example I remove
So data base claim I pair well three kind
I could write procedure analogous guess wo necessary
If I follow restrictive test first principle later program I know I three kind I ever look
If turn problem later I fix
I slightly annoyed procedure computes many time
Perhaps But fact I bothered making change
Finally missing subprocedure The first instruction ensure nothing added list twice
The command I mentioned earlier ought ensure thing except list
But since I need instruction case anyway take belt suspender approach list
The input I called used called I thinking Insert thing list
But I found using procedure next variable looked confusing even though would bothered Logo interpreter
I hope noticed second instruction start rather
This indirect assignment technique I mentioned briefly Chapter
Remember variable contains another variable
It second variable whose value changed
For example invokes input whose name whose value
In case instruction inside equivalent I wrote first edition using version Logo without higher order function
These function written Logo fact I write later book I using chapter
But retrospect style creating variable named whose value empty list adding rank card reassigning new value variable seems much harder understand operation primitive Berkeley Logo whose output input duplicate member removed
As I think easily replaced array keep track number time rank appears hand
Since I want use card rank index array I use number represent rank inside program even though person using program still represent rank form A ace
Where first version program would test four kind new version say Notice second thought detail program
I changed mind big idea procedure examines hand convert information format rest program use easily
This idea I used program Chapter I converted position internal list triple From I wo show two version every procedure
I use revised data representation even though chapter tell story I wrote older version program
Ideally according structured programming never debugging
You start complete clear program specification
Then use approved style translate specification program
Then able mathematically program correct
Debugging relic dark age
That Logo approach
I already done debugging project
Programming sort like real life always get right first time
Structured programmer get right first time either difference Logoites embarrassed
We think debugging part process solving problem general
If student school odds often encouraged accept debugging valuable
When hand paper quiz teacher point error invite try
Instead mark error red ink take point
You taught work perfect first time
One strong contribution computer programming general Logo particular made education provide one context shown realistic approach making correcting mistake
The main thing remaining done project collection predicate like check particular kind poker hand
I decided write easy one namely one multiple rank
These pretty obvious
Notice though one thing changed since initial idea procedure take input
They examine poker hand directly examine variable set initialization procedure
Now I want start putting piece together I going write preliminary version
If pair I ca simply use find many pair hand
Instead procedure look member output list rank exactly two card hand
For purpose I could output number pair would little easier computing list rank pair
But I recall I want able say thing like pair seven I need actual rank
Let try Looks like bug
This really happened I making able talk debugging
The first step solving problem like read error message carefully
This message tell error happened immediately active procedure
So I look mistake
The exact form message different different version Logo give piece information
In Berkeley Logo error message also includes instruction line error occurred
I edited looked word
I found list one input operation
Aha
The trouble whichever input selected predicate input trying evaluate list Logo expression
What I meant Now evaluate come value use input
Let try So far good course work
We need write combination straight flush royal flush
I think I instruction testing I originally planned instead I test true look special case within
It obvious write
Here plan First find card hand
Then order straight next four rank must also present hand
This possible way test straight think implement another
start smallest rank hand check exactly one card next four rank
It take advantage fact I representing rank internally number add rank get next one sequence
If reach zero mean indeed found five consecutive rank hand
If one five desired rank hand hand one card rank hand straight
There one problem approach
The ace used either high card low card straight
think ace low card
We fix later
Now let try case
I added line
It much matter I put line danger straight also found multiple one rank
This instruction changed eventually want test straight flush
But make possible debug
I picked example pretty much random
It good idea testing procedure pick test case near boundary program supposed accept
For example straight
What hand next four rank exist lowest card Jack
Actually last example may never invoke test come first
Anyway look okay
I could try example I think I believe
I decide instruction I put followed The instruction come second principle restrictive first
If test came first straight flush would reported flush
Time test Now time solve problem straight
It turn easy hand ace I use subprocedure check consecutive rank check four rank king
That end category poker hand put together requires little editing I done le I set
It took procedure
I hope feeling process switching back forth thinking particular subproblem thinking overall structure program
I done every detail I first suggested
In particular I information particular rank I print
I think perhaps effort project seems worth
I cute saying point real poker enthusiast might want spend lot time program make beautiful possible
But show completed program modified I make print thing like instead
First I able find word like starting rank indicator like
The next step change one instruction use new tool If confused double square bracket around seeing new version one possibility output procedure literal list might help
If motivated modify message category include specific rank information
You might want change example
What wanted use program hand
In word instead list five card given list seven pick best five
The main thing I think careful order instruction
I said test either ca true
But case hand If try challenge make sure program announces straight flush straight
I wrote program I looking example book would long short
That kind artificial reason starting project
In real life I wrote program like one would part larger program would actually poker
In context problem would become different
We want merely print designation hand want able compare several hand announce winner
To attach something like numerical ranking hand might become output
But ca single number many possible hand list rank order
Instead ranking hand might list number
might mean hand full house guessing would rank fifth value three seven two ten
To compare two list number compare equal go compare next member
The point I back something approaching planning
As scale project becomes lot bigger kind advance planning seems necessary
But really comparing two hand one subproblem playing poker
Really according view I start designing procedure
Perhaps first attempt might look like But would premature type computer
We think issue like Is computer player deal bank player
How many people play
What good strategy bidding
In end might turn written would fit larger project might rewritten context
To structured programmer effort put would wasted
But I think even every procedure edited I benefit taken time understand solve subproblem

Libratus artificial intelligence developed Carnegie Mellon University made history defeating four world best professional poker player marathon poker competition called Brains Vs
Artificial Intelligence Upping Ante Rivers Casino Pittsburgh
Once last hand Texas Hold em played Libratus led pro collective chip
The developer Libratus Tuomas Sandholm professor computer science Noam Brown student computer science said sizable victory statistically significant simply matter luck
The best AI ability strategic reasoning imperfect information surpassed best human Sandholm said
This new milestone artificial intelligence implication realm information incomplete opponent sow misinformation said Frank Pfenning head Computer Science Department CMU School Computer Science
Business negotiation military strategy cybersecurity medical treatment planning could benefit automated using AI
The computer win poker bluff Pfenning said
Developing AI successfully tremendous step forward scientifically numerous application
Imagine smartphone someday able negotiate best price new car
That The pro Dong Kim Jimmy Chou Daniel McAulay Jason Les split prize purse based respective performance event
McAulay Scotland said Libratus tougher opponent expected exciting play
Whenever play top player poker learn McAulay said
Les Costa Mesa agreed superior opponent help poker player improve
Usually lose lot pay lot money experience said
Here least I losing This experiment demanded assemble world best professional poker player specialize Texas Hold em would play best ability throughout long contest Brown said
These player met description proved tenacious team opponent Libratus studying strategizing together throughout Libratus victory made possible Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center Bridges computer AI computed strategy event Rivers Casino hosted event
Rivers Casino proud partner Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center host Brains Vs
Artificial Intelligence Upping Ante competition said Craig Clark general manager Rivers Casino
event like important increase awareness company Pittsburgh impacting The event surrounded speculation Libratus able improve day day competition
It turn pro taught Libratus weakness
After play ended day analyzed hole pro identified exploited Libratus strategy Sandholm said
It prioritized hole algorithmically patched top three using supercomputer night
This different learning used past poker
Typically researcher develop algorithm try exploit opponent weakness
In contrast daily improvement algorithmically fixing hole Sandholm also said Libratus strategy computed live Bridges computer hand major advance
The solver perfect analysis card said
It able update strategy hand way ensured late change would improve strategy
Over course competition pro responded making aggressive move early hand doubt avoid playing deep water endgame AI advantage added
Sandholm sharing Libratus secret competition beginning invited talk Association Advancement Artificial Intelligence meeting San Francisco submission scientific conference journal
Throughout competition Libratus recruited raw power approximately Bridges compute node
Bridges total speed petaflops time fast laptop memory Terabytes much get laptop
This computing power gave Libratus ability play four best Texas Hold em player world beat
We designed Bridges converge computing artificial intelligence said Nick Nystrom PSC senior director research principal investigator National Science Bridges system
Libratus win important milestone toward developing AIs address complex problem
At time Bridges powering new discovery physical science biology social science business even humanity
With unique emphasis usability new project always Sandholm said continue research push core technology involved solving game applying technology problem
That includes work Optimized Markets company founded automate negotiation
CMU played pivotal role developing computer chess eventually beat human world champion Watson AI beat top human Jeopardy
competitor Pfenning said
It exciting watch progress program finally surpassed best human player
Each one accomplishment represents major milestone understanding intelligence
Brains AI sponsored GreatPoint Ventures journal
Carnegie Mellon partnered Rivers Casino PSC allocation Sandholm event
Head Texas Hold em exceedingly complex game number followed zero information set set characterized path play hand perceived player whose turn
That vastly information set number atom universe
The AI must make decision without knowing card play trying sniff bluffing opponent
As suggests player may bet raise amount chip

A document usually form table used assist determining completeness relationship correlating two using relationship comparison
It often used often consist marketing requirement detailed product matching part detailed design
A requirement traceability matrix may used check current project requirement met help creation various deliverable document project plan task
Common usage take identifier item one document place left column
The identifier document placed across top row
When item left column related item across top mark placed intersecting cell
The number relationship added row column
This value indicates mapping two item
Zero value indicate relationship exists
It must determined relationship must made
Large value imply relationship complex simplified
To ease creation traceability matrix advisable add relationship source document backward traceability forward traceability
That way item changed one easy see need changed

A traceability matrix primarily used software development project trace identify verify specific functionality component developed
Typically traceability matrix worksheet type document consisting table
Two different set value compared placing identifier one set top row set left column
If commonality relationship mark placed column row intersect
For example software developed evaluated completion using traceability matrix project requirement placed within left column pertaining test case top row
If project requirement test case completed mark placed intersect chart requirement added calculate software completion status

Stephen worked Project Manager PMP certified well certified Scrum Alliance
Want watch later
Robert recently taken Project Manager position new company
In preparing take first project review documentation previous project interview team member identify anything added changed current process
A recurring theme work done within project feel disconnected purpose project
Robert belief opportunity use requirement traceability matrix
A table grid map project requirement business need well connects deliverable produced
Each row table specific requirement column minimum include business need deliverable ownership cover much detail related progress requirement needed
In requirement literally traced initiation implementation
As project manager Robert typically one create maintain RTM used project team stakeholder want support
His primary challenge convince another document read process follow something add value
He start detailing purpose RAs project manager Robert typically one create maintain RTM used project team stakeholder want
The purpose requirement traceability matrix linked progression requirement detailed within beginning end detailed Robert work
Within purpose broken team completing project stakeholder concerned outcome
Robert start beginning highlighting one purpose RTM link requirement business need
Business need crucial part project initiated
They provide reason project done
For team important provides context work value
For stakeholder help define business need behind project link requirement show business need met
The project accomplishing intend
In addition tracing requirement back business need initiate project Robert discus team requirement also linked deliverable produced project
This valuable provides team vision result toward working
For stakeholder connection give insight tangible outcome project help set expectation
The last purpose Robert identifies team relevant detailed RTMs include ownership progression requirement
For team working requirement level detail RTM allows see needed requirement progress way point deliverable produced main point contact requirement work
For stakeholder provides clear visibility progress requirement business need deliverable requirement traced
In order fully help team understand requirement traceability matrix RTM Robert take requirement project recently completed use example
The project chooses involves creating internal company website
The project involves number requirement business need deliverable Robert focus small subset example
In creating RTM Robert us requirement related calendar feature created website
His first step identify business need associated requirement well deliverable produced
In addition includes owner requirement
Get FREE access day create account
Once Robert creates basic layout add column show progress requirement including development testing user acceptance testing
In column includes status requirement open progress done well note consider requirement progress point
A connects requirement business need initiate project deliverable produced
For team working project give context work completing well vision working toward
For stakeholder ensures goal met set expectation implemented
More detailed RTMs trace requirement progress point well
The layout RTM involves row requirement column item traced business need deliverable

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
So I taking sample scope management test online Question stumped traceability matrix
Can someone please explain b better c
Below direct question quoted A It describes WBS Dictionary entry traced work package work package decomposed deliverable B used make sure Project Management Plan created C It help understand source requirement requirement verified later deliverable D used trace source every change keep track entire Control Scope process verify change properly implemented Here explanation right answer The Requirements Traceability Matrix tool use trace requirement back specific business case forward rest scope deliverable like specific WBS work package well part project product design like specific level Cows Gone Wild test strategy like test plan Ranch Hand Games tester use make sure game work
I sure I understand
Can someone explain greater detail
I probably would picked C well see trying get selected answer
I agree I see point
It academic answer probably aligns something PMBOK mean either great question great answer
Most test especially prep test often contain ambiguous question answer wrong perspective
This necessarily deliberate practice hone skill often select question pool allowed precisely mirror test question often protected NDAs copyright
Even actual test often question iffy selected answer reflect academic rather practical bent part test creator
This pervasive problem test writer academic rather practitioner good test normed response
As singular example I sat CISSP many year ago I remember particularly horrible question virus security
The question something along line What best way prevent introduction virus onto computer system
The use system option security practitioner would select I knew test expected certify medium correct answer particular test
Unless understood test written academic focus abstruse government practice bound get answer wrong
Unless fail actual exam I would lose sleep question like
Depending exam also strategy consider
Finally remember sample test sample rarely drawn actual test material
They really help confidence level material
Sometimes knowing sample test contains invalid question iffy answer good way measure domain knowledge anything else
By mean find question merit additional study part
However sometimes important know answer one employer would pay perform regardless answer key sample test say
Maybe C discus subset B
Answer C indicates two item source requirement link final deliverable
Answer B mention indicate argumentation also includes link design testplan
Since C actually cover everything might able link requirement complete answer And therefore answer
My cent Brian I tell better I tell wrong
The reason correct due little
It help understand source requirement requirement verified later deliverable would describe process
The Requirements Traceability
As function trace back verified
I think great answer explanation even worse
Hope help
The answer B becuase need think PMBOK would say
First thing need understand input output Program Management Plan Chapter PMBOK
The PM plan much encompassing answer C Traceability Matrix would
Take plus requirement consideration
I teach PMP session PMP exam course
It turn HR one item I teach
I sure B right answer I tell A C D
Option A talk decomposition WBS nothing traceability matrix
Option C D read line talk requirement verified later deliverable verify change properly implemented
Now traceability matrix NOT focus verification implementation requirement change
It simply help u track change respect various parameter
Hence A C D clearly discarded correct answer B
Although I personally appreciate B best answer question
By posting answer agree

Software production activity also known software development process improving due demand quality increase product
The demand quality cost decrease added introduction new technology naturally force process improvement
Those fact new occurs several production area employ different technique increase development process
In particular software research area involved process improvement Software Engineering Bauer IEEE IEEE
The first model ever employed software development process proposed work segmentation waterfall model
It able allow structured overview software development structure foundation stone propose new process new necessity required
There development model prototyping incremental evolutionary spiral
It interesting observe common point model start Requirements Engineering
Generally speaking Requirements Engineering process identify stakeholder need documenting way make analysis communication subsequent implementation feasible time leading product quality reliability Nuseibeh Easterbrook
The fact Requirements Engineering first activity within software production process better explored analyzing following statement Antoniou et
Nuseibeh Easterbrook
The first statement refers definition purpose inherent characteristic initial activity project research methodology Basili et Solingen Berghout
The second refers meet intended purpose
If software development basis come solution given problem fundamental importance knowledge exact dimension problem solved
Requirements initially discovered project understand basic condition next phase
Thus one get idea importance respect requirement Requirements Engineering occurs initial phase within development process
Requirements engineering activity divided five category Elicitation Analysis Negotiation Documentation Validation Management
These definition alternate among different author Jarke Pohl Sawyer et Graham Kotonya Sommerville Sommerville concept similar Individuals organization involved affected system influence requirement
They could manager supplier customer
The process identification analysis documentation management requirement useful implementation consistent need stakeholder provide software product quality
The main resource used maintain represent traceability relationship
A link establishes explicit relationship two artifact
Technical managerial procedure aid evaluation improvement software development process
The ability define trace requirement artifact throughout development process follow trace direction
A set element describing something built purpose subject particular form analysis
A parallel process support requirement engineering activity identification change management requirement traceability throughout development process

A security requirement traceability matrix SRTM grid allows documentation easy viewing required system security
SRTMs necessary technical project call security included
Traceability matrix general used type project allow requirement test easily traced back one another
The matrix way make sure accountability process effective way user ensure work completed
An SRTM security requirement test activity would grid much like Excel spreadsheet column following Each row new requirement making SRTM easy way view compare various requirement test needed particular security project
Links also included guiding user area information requirement test located

A security incident warning may threat information computer security
The warning could also threat already occurred
Threats violation identified unauthorized access system
A computer security incident threat policy related computer security
An incident also result misuse confidential information computer system
This could include information Social Security number health record anything could include sensitive personally identifiable information
When incident affect computer system computer security incident response team CSIRT activated handle threat
There also policy procedure already established handling incident occurs
Examples computer security incident include attack denial service attack malicious code includes worm virus
Unauthorized access someone allowed access computer system also considered potentially threatening computer security incident
A security incident may even refer inappropriate use computer system employee using work computer access pornography expressly forbidden company procedural guideline

The investigation still ongoing began several student came forward report student continued working shared answer spring final Computer Science exam ended
Recent discussion regarding incident sparked post social news website Saturday
According student member teaching staff crowdedness logistical difficulty Haas Pavilion exam took place made easier student cheat
Although staff member aware Math class would taking exam time expected room able accommodate student taking exam
However crowdedness forced GSIs check identification exam causing exam collection take minute
CS student also sat back making difficult hear announcement room single sound system
The Haas Pavilion echoey one could actually hear said Dhruv Garg campus junior majoring electrical engineering computer science
When professor said time clear whether instruction targeted towards class According GSI Chenyu Zhao witness brought cheating incident attention teaching staff exam
Within hour professor posted class forum notifying class incident urging class take responsibility
The cheater going hurting grade honest student class Professor Sahai wrote
They deserve mercy loyalty despicable act fellow The electrical engineering computer science department academic recommend cheater failed corresponding course student expelled repeat offense
According student fail resolve incident professor receive alleged violation letter either accept sanction go hearing
Ultimately le percent class found guilty
For confessed grade turned grade readjusted remove point possibly gained extra question
Those still confessed according Sahai least fail class university decide subsequent punishment
The investigation ongoing
Students said cheater justification action given professor helpfulness fairness throughout semester
The professor GSIs threw homework party helpful said Alex Danilychev campus sophomore computer science major
We also extra credit opportunity throughout semester
I could easily gotten three time extra credit I got I wanted The student range response varying surprise anger compelling report anything suspicious witnessed
According professor people came forward report
There positive side discussion happened afterwards generated shared sense something wrong acceptable Sahai said

In field involves monitoring detection security event execution proper response event
Computer security incident management specialized form primary purpose development well understood predictable response damaging event computer intrusion

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

The often abbreviated published specification developed document interchange Microsoft product
Most able read write version RTF
There several different revision RTF specification portability file depend version RTF used
RTF specification changed published major version
It confused predecessor Rich Text medium type IBM Revisable Format Content Architecture completely different specification
David Luebbert member development team developed original RTF middle late
Its syntax influenced typesetting language
The first RTF reader writer shipped part Microsoft Word implemented RTF version specification
All subsequent release Microsoft Word Macintosh version Windows read write file RTF format
Microsoft maintains format
The final version implementing feature
Microsoft discontinued enhancement RTF specification
New feature Word later version save properly RTF format
Microsoft anticipates update RTF stated willingness consider editorial modification RTF Specification associated balloting period
For time RTF file used produce Windows help file though use superseded file
RTF programmed using group backslash control word delimiter
Groups contained within brace opening brace closing brace indicating start group end group respectively
Groups used indicate type attribute apply certain text
The backslash indicates control word going used
Control word specifically programmed command RTF
They certain state active
Their state represented number
For example A delimiter one three thing As example following RTF code document would rendered like read program support RTF This text
A standard RTF file consist character encode character beyond ASCII
The character escape two type escape starting RTF escape
In code page escape two digit following backslash used denoting character taken Windows code page
For example code page set sequence encode Arabic letter ب
For Unicode escape control word used followed signed integer giving Unicode code unit number
For benefit program without Unicode support must followed nearest representation character specified code page
For example would give Arabic letter ب specifying older program Unicode support render question mark instead
The control word used indicate subsequent Unicode escape sequence within current group specify substitution character
Until RTF specification version release RTF handled character directly character encoded hexadecimal using
RTF control word since RTF generally accept signed number argument
Unicode value greater must expressed negative number
If Unicode character encoded surrogate pair
Support Unicode made due text handling change Microsoft Word Microsoft Word partially application handle text using
Microsoft Word later version application handle text using Unicode character encoding scheme
RTF file usually ASCII plain text
RTF consists control word control symbol group
RTF file easily transmitted PC based operating system encoded ASCII character
Converters communicate Microsoft Word MS Windows Macintosh expect data transfer character binary data contain value
Unlike many word processing format RTF code RTF file viewed plain contained ASCII text legible
The distracting provided document creator kept formatting concise
At time RTF initial release rare among document format
Today format common
In contrast MS Word format scrap legible text
Although content read often extensive formatting code make hard read
The file produced program contain large amount formatting code
Such file easily ten time larger corresponding
They legible
Also character must RTF
Thus even concise formatting text us certain le legible
Latin language make heavy use character particularly difficult read RTF
consisting character illegible RTF
Finally beginning RTF supported Microsoft embedded object Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber object
RTF data format saving sharing document intended intuitive easy typing person
Most word processing software support RTF format importing exporting following version RTF specification direct editing often making common format otherwise incompatible word processing software operating system
These factor contribute depend version RTF used
There several consciously designed accidentally born RTF dialect
Most application read RTF file silently ignore unknown RTF control word
RTF internal markup language used Microsoft Word
Overall since RTF file may transferred back forth many old new computer system Internet despite difference operating system version
But incompatibility
RTF later specification RTF RTF use Unicode character
This make useful format basic formatted text document instruction manual résumés letter modest information document
These document minimum support bold italic underline text formatting
Also typically supported text font specification document margin
Font margin default well style presets function vary according program default
There may also subtle difference perhaps different version RTF specification implemented differing program program version
Nevertheless RTF format consistent enough computer computer considered highly portable acceptable use
The format support title author etc
implementation support
Use Microsoft Object Linking Embedding OLE object Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber object limit interoperability object widely supported program viewing editing RTF file
embedding file inside RTF table chart spreadsheet application
If software understands OLE object available object usually replaced picture bitmap representation object displayed
RTF support inclusion JPEG Portable Network Graphics PNG Enhanced Metafile EMF WMF Apple PICT Windows bitmap Windows Device Independent bitmap Metafile picture type hexadecimal default binary format RTF file
Not picture type supported RTF reader
When RTF document opened software support picture type inserted picture picture displayed
RTF writer usually convert inserted picture unsupported picture type
BMP TIFF GIF etc
one supported picture type PNG WMF include picture
For better compatibility Microsoft product RTF writer include picture two different picture type one RTF file This method increase RTF file size rapidly
The RTF specification require method various implementation include picture without WMF copy
Abiword Ted
For Microsoft Word also possible set specific registry value order prevent Word saving WMF copy see link Document file size increase EMF PNG GIF JPEG graphic Word beginning
RTF support used document feature widely supported software implementation
RTF also support generic font family name used
This feature widely supported font substitution
Abiword
RTF specification support annotation comment document since version
RTF specification defined new feature annotation date stamp previously time stamp parent annotation
When RTF document annotation opened application support RTF annotation displayed
Similarly document annotation saved RTF application support RTF annotation annotation preserved RTF file
Some implementation may hide annotation default require user action display
Abiword since version IBM Lotus Symphony version
Microsoft product support comment within footer footnote header
Inserting comment within header footer footnote may result corrupted RTF document
The RTF specification also support footnote confused annotation widely supported RTF implementation
Abiword KWord Ted Wordpad
Endnotes implemented variation footnote application support footnote endnotes render endnotes RTF document footnote
Similar annotation due Microsoft product supporting footnote header footer comment including footnote within context RTF document may result corrupted document
RTF specification defined use drawing object rectangle ellipsis line arrow polygon various shape
RTF specification introduced many new control word drawing object
RTF drawing object also called shape since RTF
However RTF drawing object supported many RTF implementation though supported Abiword
When RTF document drawing object opened application support RTF drawing object displayed
Some implementation also display text inside drawing object
Similarly document drawing object saved RTF application support RTF drawing object preserved RTF file
Unlike Microsoft Word format well newer format RTF support
For reason RTF often recommended format spread macro concern
However extension guarantee file safe since Microsoft Word open standard DOC file renamed RTF extension run contained macro usual
Manual examination file plain text editor use system required determine whether suspect file really RTF
Enabling Word Confirm file format conversion open option enabled default version Word also assist warning document opened format match format implied file extension giving option abort opening file
RTF file carry malware sometimes malicious file RTF format renamed extension
One exploit attacking vulnerability patched Microsoft Word April
Since malware RTF file embedding exploit file header renamed RTF extension create master key cover number recent patched exploit one RTF low AV detection
Documents type analysed free charge online tool called Cryptam
Each RTF implementation usually implement version subset RTF specification
Many available RTF converter understand new feature latest RTF specification
The editor creates RTF file default
It defaulted file format write support Word document dropped security update
Read support also dropped Windows
WordPad support RTF feature header footer
However WordPad read save many RTF feature create table strikeout superscript subscript extra color text background color numbered list right left indent URL linking various line spacing
RTF also data format rich text control MS Windows APIs
The default text editor also view edit save RTF file well file
TextEdit currently July limited ability edit RTF document margin
Much older Mac word processing application program able view edit save RTF file well
The word processor view edit save RTF file
RTF format also used word processor
us individual RTF file text file make given project
freeware application developing publishing dictionary us RTF common form document output
RTF file produced Toolbox designed used also used word processor
RTF used interoperability simplicity low CPU processing requirement
The script partially convert RTF XML
GNU program convert RTF HTML LaTeX troff macro format
library create convert document RTF XHTML PDF format
project create Rich Text content via
library Tcl routine free software generate RTF output Cost script convert SGML RTF
module generating RTF document
API enabling developer create RTF document
open source document converter multiple output format including RTF
project create RTF document via pure
The Mac OS X command line tool textutil enables file converted rtf rtfd text doc docx wordml odt webarchive
The Rich Text Format standard file format document application developed Microsoft Windows
Microsoft initially make RTF specification publicly available making difficult competitor develop document conversion feature application
Because Microsoft developer access specification Microsoft application better compatibility format
Also every time Microsoft changed RTF specification Microsoft application lead competitor redevelop application studying newer version format
alleged Microsoft practice anticompetitive antitrust complaint Microsoft
The RTF specification lack semantic definition necessary read write modify document

Tara taught Psychology master degree evolutionary psychology
The acronym refers statistical procedure used test degree two group vary differ experiment
In experiment great deal variance difference usually indicates significant finding research
In lesson look detailed example ANOVA work applied real life situation
In majority experiment first need null hypothesis alternative hypothesis
A assumption difference group tested therefore significant result revealed
The hand hypothesis stating difference group indicated ANOVA performed data collected
Let use experiment scenario help explain thing
Imagine running experiment see relationship people religion consider ideal family size
You would likely recruiting individual different religious group asking report consider ideal number child family
Let u say ended recruiting Catholics Protestants Jewish individual answer question
In case one independent variable religion thought effect opinion ideal family size dependent variable scenario
Additionally experiment includes three different level independent variable
In case three level three different group religion
The fact differing level independent variable religion allows u carry ANOVA
Let say asking people three group consider ideal number child family record person answer calculate mean average number reported collective group
You discover average number child reported Catholic group Protestant group Jewish group
At first glance may seem like definite difference three group opinion ideal number child
However must keep mind could due chance number could different asked different Catholics different Protestants different Jewish individual
Therefore ANOVA good test use control determine really difference three group beyond mere random chance
In particular example difference average three group statistically significant computed ANOVA test due chance
This mean religious affiliation influence opinion ideal number child family
Therefore shown null hypothesis false since significant difference three religious group alternative hypothesis also proven true
After reading experiment might thinking use real world
The ANOVA come handy large number real life situation
For instance social science much research devoted figuring factor influence people opinion behavior
The previous example involving religion number child fit category
Other example include effect political party view marriage
You could design experiment group Democrats group Republicans group Independents give survey asks view marriage
You could use ANOVA compare difference average number people group claiming support marriage

ANOVAs also used medical profession
When scientist want test effectiveness new drug implement ANOVA see effective possibly ineffective drug
For example doctor want test effectiveness new cancer treatment could design experiment involves different level independent variable cancer treatment
One group participant could receive chemotherapy another group could receive radiation treatment still another could receive treatment finally last group would receive new drug question
By comparing percentage reduction cancer cell treatment group ANOVA scientist could easily tell type treatment would effective
These situation ANOVA useful
It used experiment involves two usually three level independent variable
Additionally work one independent variable tested simultaneously
The analysis variance ANOVA recognized common statistical procedure used psychological research main goal determine much group experiment differ purpose statistical significance
More specifically experiment involve ANOVAs usually required least two level group independent variable
Any difference dependent variable group average group also measured
When difference observed significant mean variability difference greater expected due mere chance
When prof case ANOVA hypothesis tested alternative hypothesis prof true therefore independent variable influence dependent variable
Although ANOVAs used commonly psychological research used social science
Not used medical research implemented experiment natural science
Although minimum number group independent variable two ANOVA experiment design involve two even one independent variable tested

Many support
For instance type subtype expression type used wherever expression type used
refers subtyping complex type relates subtyping component
For example list relate list
Or function returning relate function returning
Depending variance subtyping relation simple type may either preserved reversed ignored respective complex type
In programming language example list Cat subtype list Animal list constructor
Meaning subtyping relation simple type preserved complex type
While function Animal String subtype function Cat String function type constructor argument type
Here subtyping relation simple type reversed complex type
A programming language designer consider variance devising typing rule language feature array inheritance generic datatypes
By making type constructor covariant contravariant instead invariant program accepted
On hand programmer often find contravariance unintuitive accurately tracking variance avoid runtime type error lead complex typing rule
In order keep type system simple allow useful program language may treat type constructor invariant even would safe consider variant treat covariant even though could violate type safety
Within typing rule type constructor The article considers applies common type constructor
For example subtype The variance C generic interface declared placing covariant contravariant attribute zero type parameter
For type parameter compiler conclusively verifies violation fatal use globally consistent
The interface declared
Types one type parameter may specify different variance type parameter
For example delegate type represents function input parameter type return value type
The ensure type safety
For example represents function expecting argument type function handle type animal always used instead one handle cat
data type source covariant data type sink contravariant
Mutable data type act source sink invariant
To illustrate general phenomenon consider
For type make type array animal
For purpose example array support reading writing element
We option treat either If wish avoid type error third choice safe
Clearly every treated since client reading array expect may contain

So contravariant rule safe
Conversely treated
It always possible put
With covariant array guaranteed safe since backing store might actually array cat
So covariant rule also array constructor
Note issue mutable array covariant rule safe immutable array
Early version Java C include generic also termed
In setting making array invariant rule useful polymorphic program
For example consider writing function shuffle array function test two array equality using
method element
The implementation depend exact type element stored array possible write single function work type array
It easy implement function type However array type treated invariant would possible call function array exactly type
One could example shuffle array string
Therefore Java C treat array type covariantly
For instance Java subtype C subtype
As discussed covariant array lead problem writes array
Java C deal marking array object type created
Each time value stored array execution environment check type value equal type array
If mismatch Java C thrown In example one array b safely
It trying array lead trouble
One drawback approach leaf possibility error stricter type system could caught
Also hurt performance write array requires additional check
With addition generic Java C offer way write kind polymorphic function without relying covariance
The array comparison shuffling function given parameterized type Alternatively enforce C method access collection way one use interface instead passing array
Languages like function expecting Cat returning Animal written syntax syntax
Those language also need specify one function type subtype safe use function one type context expects function different type
It safe substitute function function accepts general type argument return specific type
For example given function type function type used wherever expected One compare communication liberal accept conservative produce
The general rule In word type constructor
This rule first stated formally popularized paper
When dealing rule applied several time
For example applying rule twice see
In word type A position
For complicated type confusing mentally trace given type specialization easy calculate position contravariant position covariant left side even number arrow applying
When subclass method superclass compiler must check overriding method right type
While language require type exactly match type superclass invariance also type safe allow overriding method better type
By usual subtyping rule function type mean overriding method return specific type return type covariance accept general argument argument type contravariance
In notation possibility follows Subtyping type method

The signature overriding method unchanged

The subtyping relation direction relation ClassA ClassB

The subtyping relation opposite direction relation ClassA ClassB

Not type safe
For concrete example suppose writing class model
We assume subclass base class using Java syntax Now question subclass type allowed give
In language allows covariant return type derived class override method return specific type Among mainstream OO language support covariant return type
Adding covariant return type one first modification language approved standard committee also support covariant return type
Similarly type safe allow overriding method accept general argument method base class Not many language actually allow
Java would interpret unrelated method name
However supported covariance contravariance
Calling convention overridden method covariant argument return value contravariant normal argument mode
Uniquely among mainstream language allows argument overriding method specific type method superclass argument type covariance
Thus Eiffel version following code would type check overriding method base class This type safe
By one try place dog cat shelter
That meet argument restriction result runtime error
The lack type safety known catcall problem Eiffel community issue
Over year various combination global static analysis local static analysis new language feature proposed remedy implemented Eiffel compiler
Despite type safety problem Eiffel designer consider covariant argument type crucial modeling real world requirement
The cat shelter illustrates common phenomenon animal shelter seems reasonable use inheritance restricted argument type model
In proposing use inheritance Eiffel designer reject state object subclass always le restricted object superclass
One instance mainstream language allowing covariance method argument PHP regard class constructor
In following example method accepted despite method argument covariant parent method argument
Were method anything error would occur Another example covariant argument seem helpful binary method
method argument expected type object method called
An example method check whether come ordering way compare say two rational number different way compare two string
Other common example binary method include equality test arithmetic operation set operation like subset union
In older version Java comparison method specified interface The drawback method specified take argument type
A typical implementation would first argument throwing error expected type In language covariant argument argument compareTo could directly given desired type hiding typecast
Of course would still give runtime error called

Other language feature provide apparent benefit covariant argument preserving Liskov substitutability
In language
previous example written way
Instead defining define parameterized class
One drawback implementer base class need foresee type need specialized subclass
Similarly recent version Java interface parameterized allows downcast omitted way Another language feature help
One reason binary method awkward write call like selecting correct implementation really depends runtime type conventional OO language runtime type taken account
In language CLOS comparison method could written generic function argument used method selection
Giuseppe Castagna observed typed language multiple dispatch generic function argument control dispatch argument
Because method selection rule chooses specific applicable method method override another method overriding method specific type controlling argument
On hand ensure type safety language still must require argument least general
Using previous terminology type used runtime method selection covariant type used runtime method selection method contravariant
Conventional language like Java also obey rule one argument used method selection receiver object passed along method hidden argument indeed type specialized inside overriding method superclass
Castagna suggests example covariant argument type superior particularly binary method handled using multiple dispatch naturally covariant
However programming language support multiple dispatch
The following table summarizes rule overriding method language discussed
In programming language support generic
programmer extend type system new constructor
For example C interface like make possible construct new type like
The question arises variance type constructor
There two main approach
In language programmer annotates definition generic type intended variance type parameter
With programmer instead annotates place generic type instantiated
The popular language variance annotation using keywords using keywords
C allows variance annotation interface type Scala OCaml allows interface type concrete data type
In C type parameter generic interface marked covariant contravariant invariant annotation
For example define interface iterators declare covariant type parameter
With declaration treated covariant type argument
subtype
The typechecker enforces method declaration interface mention type parameter way consistent annotation
That parameter declared covariant must occur contravariant position position contravariant occurs odd number contravariant type constructor
The precise rule return type method interface must method argument type must defined follows As example rule apply consider interface
The argument type must valid contravariantly
type parameter must tagged
Similarly result type must valid covariantly
since covariant interface type must valid covariantly
type parameter must tagged
This show interface allowed marked either contravariant
In common case generic data structure restriction mean parameter used method getting data structure parameter used method putting data structure hence choice keywords
C allows variance annotation parameter interface parameter class
Because field C class always mutable variantly parameterized class C would useful
But language emphasize immutable data make good use covariant data type
For example immutable list type covariant subtype
Scala rule checking variance annotation essentially C
However idiom apply immutable datastructures particular
They illustrated following excerpt definition class
First class member variant type must immutable
Here type declared covariant indeed declared method
Trying declare mutable field would rejected type error
Second even data structure immutable often method parameter type occurs contravariantly
For example consider method add element front list
The implementation work creating new object class nonempty list
The obvious type give would However would type error covariant parameter appears contravariant position function argument
But trick get around problem
We give general type allows adding element type long supertype
Note relies covariant since type treat type
At first glance may obvious generalized type sound programmer start simpler type declaration type error point place need generalized
It possible design type system compiler automatically infers best possible variance annotation datatype parameter
However analysis get complex several reason
First analysis nonlocal since variance interface depends variance interface mention
Second order get unique best solution type system must allow parameter simultaneously contravariant
And finally variance type parameter arguably deliberate choice designer interface something happens
For reason language little variance inference
C Scala infer variance annotation
OCaml infer variance parameterized concrete datatypes programmer must explicitly specify variance abstract type interface
For example consider OCaml datatype wrap function The compiler automatically infer contravariant first parameter covariant second
The programmer also provide explicit annotation compiler check satisfied
Thus following declaration equivalent previous one Explicit annotation OCaml become useful specifying interface
For example standard library interface association table include annotation saying map type constructor covariant result type
This ensures
subtype
One drawback approach many interface type must made invariant
For example saw needed invariant contained
In order expose variance API designer could provide additional interface provide subset available method
list provides
However quickly becomes unwieldy
variance annotation aim give user class opportunity subtyping without requiring designer class define multiple interface different variance
Instead time class interface used type declaration programmer indicate subset method used
In effect definition class also make available interface covariant contravariant class
Therefore designer class longer need take variance account increasing
Java provides variance annotation restricted form
A parameterized type instantiated wildcard together upper lower bound

A unbounded wildcard like equivalent
Such type represents unknown type satisfies bound
For example type typechecker accept type known subtype rejected type error since necessarily
In general given interface reference forbids using method interface occurs contravariantly type method
Conversely type one could call
While plain generic type Java invariant
subtyping relationship wildcard type made specific specifying tighter bound example subtype
This show wildcard type also
In total given wildcard type like three way form subtype specializing class specifying tighter bound replacing wildcard specific type see figure
By combining two step subtyping therefore possible
pas argument type method expecting
This exactly kind program covariant interface type allow
The type act interface type containing covariant method implementer define ahead time
This variance
In common case generic data structure covariant parameter used method getting data structure contravariant parameter method putting data structure
The mnemonic Producer Extends Consumer Super PECS book give easy way remember use covariance contravariance
Wildcards flexible drawback
While variance mean API designer need consider variance type parameter interface must often instead use complicated method signature
A common example involves interface
Suppose want write function find biggest element collection
The element need implement method first try might However type general find max
The problem implement instead better interface
In Java unlike C considered subtype
Instead type modified The bounded wildcard conveys information call contravariant method interface
This particular example frustrating method contravariant condition trivially true
A system could handle example le clutter annotating definition
variance annotation provide additional flexibility allowing program
However criticized complexity add language leading complicated type signature error message
One way ass whether extra flexibility useful see used existing program
A survey large set Java library found wildcard annotation could directly replaced annotation
Thus remaining indication place Java benefit system available
In language library must either expose le variance define interface
For example Scala Collections library defines three separate interface class employ covariance covariant base interface containing common method invariant mutable version add method covariant immutable version may specialize inherited implementation exploit structural sharing
This design work well annotation large number interface carry complexity cost client library
And modifying library interface may particular one goal adding generic Java maintain binary backwards compatibility
On hand Java wildcards complex
In conference presentation criticized hard understand use stating adding support simply afford another
Early version Scala used variance annotation programmer found difficult use practice annotation found helpful designing class
Later version Scala added existential type wildcards however according need interoperability Java would probably included
Ross Tate argues part complexity Java wildcards due decision encode variance using form existential type
The original proposal used syntax variance annotation writing instead Java verbose
Since wildcards form existential type used thing variance
A type like type list let object passed method stored field without exactly specifying type parameter
This particularly valuable class method mention type parameter
However existential type difficult problem
For compiler implementer Java wildcards raise issue type checker termination type argument inference ambiguous program
In general whether Java program using generic type checker go infinite loop time program
For programmer lead complicated type error message
Java typechecks wildcard type replacing wildcards fresh type variable
This make error message harder read refer type variable programmer directly write
For example trying add give error like Since annotation useful type system provide
These term come notion
Consider category whose object type whose morphisms represent subtype relationship
This example partially ordered set considered category
Then example function type constructor take two type creates new type take object object
By subtyping rule function type operation revers first argument preserve second contravariant functor first argument covariant functor second

Analysis Variance short statistical test look significant difference mean
For example say interested studying education level athlete community survey people various team
You start wonder however education level different among different team
You could use ANOVA determine mean education level different among softball team versus rugby team versus Ultimate Frisbee team
There four type ANOVA model
Following description example
A group ANOVA used want test difference two group
This simplest version ANOVA
The example education level among different sport team would example type model
There one grouping type sport played using define group
A repeated measure ANOVA used single group measured something one time
For example wanted test student understanding subject could administer test beginning course middle course end course
You would use repeated measure ANOVA see student performance test changed time
A group ANOVA used look complex grouping
For example student grade previous example could extended see student abroad performed differently local student
So would three effect ANOVA effect final grade effect abroad versus local interaction final grade
Each main effect test
The interaction effect simply asking significant difference performance test final grade acting together
repeated measure ANOVA us repeated measure structure also includes interaction effect
Using example repeated measure test grade course could add gender see joint effect gender time testing
That male female differ amount information remember time
The following assumption exist perform analysis variance If significantly greater likely statistically significant difference group
The statistical software use tell F statistic significant
All version ANOVA follow basic principle outlined number group interaction effect increase source variation get complex
It unlikely would ANOVA hand
Unless small data set process would
All statistical software program provide ANOVA
SPSS okay simple analysis however anything complicated becomes difficult
Excel also allows ANOVA Data Analysis however instruction good
SAS STATA Minitab equipped handling bigger complex data set better performing ANOVA
There error

It would useful measure scatter following property Both meet three criterion symmetric data set
The variance measure far value data set mean
Here defined The standard deviation simply positive square root variance
In order write equation defines variance simplest use Σ
The summation operator shorthand way write Take sum set number
As example show would use summation operator write equation calculating mean value data set
We start assigning number variable like Think variable measured quantity number leaf per think subscript indicating trial number
To calculate average number leaf per plant first add value six trial
Using summation operator write like equivalent Obviously sum lot compact write summation operator
Here equation calculating mean data set using summation operator The general equation calculating mean set number would written like Sometimes simplicity subscript left right
Doing away subscript make equation le cluttered still understood adding value
Now know summation operator work understand equation defines variance The variance defined sum squared distance term distribution mean divided number term distribution
There efficient way calculate standard deviation group number shown following equation You take sum square term distribution divide number term distribution
From subtract square mean
It lot le work calculate standard deviation way
It easy prove two equation equivalent
Start definition variance Equation
Expand expression squaring distance term mean Equation
Now separate individual term equation summation operator distributes term parenthesis see Equation
In final term sum taken time
Next simplify second third term Equation
In second term see Σ another way writing average term
So second term simplifies compare
In third term equal third term simplifies compare Equations
Finally Equation see second third term combined giving u result trying prove Equation
As example let go back two distribution started discussion What variance standard deviation data set
We construct table calculate value
You use similar table find variance standard deviation result experiment
Although data set mean variance second data set little variance first data set
The standard deviation square root variance standard deviation second data set standard deviation first data set
The variance standard deviation give u numerical measure scatter data set
These measure useful making comparison data set go beyond simple visual impression

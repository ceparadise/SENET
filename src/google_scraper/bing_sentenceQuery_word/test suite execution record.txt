You run test suite directly run test suite execution record
When run test suite directly test suite run local test environment
A default test suite execution record generated record include planning test environment information
If situation complex must support multiple test environment generate test suite execution record cover planning environment need
You designate specific test environment test cell
For example test cell Z might consist server A B workstation run specific adapter
You create test suite execution record context test suite
Test suite execution record map test planning environment information test suite
When run test suite execution record run test suite specific software hardware environment associate test specific test plan test iteration
You use test suite execution record run manual automated test
If created manual test script add test case suite
Then associate test suite execution record suite
Similarly refer automated test script add test case suite associate test suite execution record suite
Typically run test suite execution record run script added test case associated test suite
After testing commences pause test suite run console
You might pause test suite run system testing need minor adjustment testing proceed
When pause test suite run manual test run part suite also paused
If pause test automated test running test completed however automated test started run
In either case test suite paused
You resume paused test suite console list view editor
You stop test suite console
Unfinished test case suite marked incomplete
Stopped test suite resumed

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I difficult time pinning official description test suite compared test plan
In Test Computer Software even mention suite
I assume book rather dated From state If test case represents piece scenario element simulate user completing transaction use test suite
For instance test suite might contain four test case separate test script Test case Login Test case Add New Products Test case Checkout Test case Logout Test suite identify gap testing effort successful completion one test case must occur beginning next test case
make sound like classifying test suite something run succession
state In software development test suite le commonly known validation suite collection test case intended used test software program show specified set behaviour
A test suite often contains detailed instruction goal collection test case information system configuration used testing
A group test case may also contain prerequisite state step description following test
Collections test case sometimes incorrectly termed test plan test script even test scenario
I also found explanation Fundamentally Test Plan logical collection Test Cases
Lets say test case test Authentication functionality website group Test Cases
Test Suite hand execution unit Functional Test User Acceptance Testing UAT Integration Test Regression Test
These Test Suite combination Test Cases required corresponding Testing phase
So Test Suites actually widely different Test Cases
I could continue give example dissenting opinion already gone pretty long
I starting get concerned actual definition everybody make definition fit preconceived notion
If case I move I hoping case pin actually
The traditional definition would something like A test suite collection test case related test work
You might suite regression one build verification test suite specific component
A test plan generally document describes testing approach methodology used testing project risk scope testing specific tool
It usually include specific test case information higher level
If refer A set several test case component system test post condition one test often used precondition next one
A document describing scope approach resource schedule intended test activity
It identifies amongst others test item feature tested testing task task degree tester independence test environment test design technique entry exit criterion used rationale choice risk requiring contingency planning
It record test planning process
From Test Management tool perspective Test Plan collection certain test case executed certain build
For example MSTF VSTS Microsoft ALM HP term Plan used
Other test management tool like SpiraTest us term Set refer collection certain case certain testing purpose
In similar way also name given collection test case action step based test case representing single scenario like Login end end scenario
In general well asked test application module feature may asked write convey Plan may contain Test Mission Test Strategy Logistics may written documented may

Other way define Test Plan way documenting test plan term Scope Resources Time Milestones Entry Exit criterion idea template based Plan fit certain project serve purpose indeed
In case people referring test plan also described test strategy
Also I seen definition Test Plans could Test Suite
That said definition according ITQSB Glossary Terms typically used described

In method individual unit set one computer program module together associated control data usage procedure operating procedure tested determine whether fit use
Intuitively one view unit smallest testable part application
In unit could entire module commonly individual function procedure
In unit often entire interface class could individual method
Unit test short code fragment created programmer occasionally development process
It form basis component testing
Ideally independent others
Substitutes used assist testing module isolation
Unit test typically written run ensure code meet design behaves intended
Because class may class testing class frequently spill testing another class
A common example class depend order test class tester often writes code interacts database
This mistake unit test usually go outside class boundary especially cross boundary introduce unacceptable performance problem unit
Crossing unit boundary turn unit test integration test test case fail may unclear component causing failure
Instead software developer create abstract interface around database query implement interface
By abstracting necessary attachment code temporarily reducing net effective coupling independent unit thoroughly tested may previously achieved
This result unit also maintainable
Unit testing commonly may still performed manually
The favor one
The objective unit testing isolate unit validate correctness
A manual approach unit testing may employ instructional document
However automation efficient achieving enables many benefit listed article
Conversely planned carefully careless manual unit test case may execute integration test case involves many software component thus preclude achievement goal established unit testing
To fully realize effect isolation using automated approach unit code body test executed within outside natural environment
In word executed outside product calling context originally created
Testing isolated manner reveals unnecessary dependency code tested unit data space product
These dependency eliminated
Using automation framework developer code criterion result known good test verify unit correctness
During test case execution framework test fail criterion
Many framework also automatically flag failed test case report summary
Depending upon severity failure framework may halt subsequent testing
As consequence unit testing traditionally motivator programmer create code body
This practice promotes healthy habit software development
unit testing refactoring often work together best solution may emerge
Parameterized unit test PUTs test take parameter
Unlike traditional unit test usually closed method PUTs take set parameter
PUTs supported various test framework
Suitable parameter unit test may supplied manually case automatically generated test framework
Testing tool like exist generate test input PUTs
The goal unit testing isolate part program show individual part correct
A unit test provides strict written piece code must satisfy
As result affords several benefit
Unit testing find problem early
This includes bug programmer implementation flaw missing part specification unit
The process writing thorough set test force author think input output error condition thus crisply define unit desired behavior
The cost finding bug coding begin code first written considerably lower cost detecting identifying correcting bug later bug may also cause problem software
Code impossible difficult test poorly written thus unit testing force developer structure function object better way
In TDD frequently used unit test created code written
When test pas code considered complete
The unit test run function frequently larger code base developed either code changed via automated process build
If unit test fail considered bug either changed code test
The unit test allow location fault failure easily traced
Since unit test alert development team problem handing code tester client still early development process
Unit testing allows programmer code upgrade system library later date make sure module still work correctly
The procedure write test case whenever change cause fault quickly identified
Unit test detect change may break
Unit testing may reduce uncertainty unit used testing style approach
By testing part program first testing sum part becomes much easier
Unit testing provides sort living documentation system
Developers looking learn functionality provided unit use look unit test gain basic understanding unit interface
Unit embody characteristic critical success unit
These characteristic indicate use unit well negative behavior trapped unit
A unit test case document critical characteristic although many software development environment rely solely upon code document product development
When software developed using approach combination writing unit test specify interface plus refactoring activity performed test passing may take place formal design
Each unit test seen design element specifying class method observable behaviour
Testing catch every error program evaluate every execution path trivial program
This superset
The true unit testing
Additionally unit testing definition test functionality unit
Therefore catch integration error broader error function performed across multiple unit test area
Unit testing done conjunction activity show presence absence particular error prove complete absence error
To guarantee correct behavior every execution path every possible input ensure absence error technique required namely application proving software component unexpected behavior
An elaborate hierarchy unit test equal integration testing
Integration peripheral unit included integration test unit test
Integration testing typically still relies heavily human testing difficult automate manual testing often appears faster cheaper
Software testing combinatorial problem
For example every Boolean decision statement requires least two test one outcome true one outcome false
As result every line code written programmer often need line test code
This obviously take time investment may worth effort
There also many problem easily tested example involve multiple
In addition code unit test likely least buggy code testing
quote Never go sea two chronometer take one three
Meaning two contradict know one correct
Another challenge related writing unit test difficulty setting realistic useful test
It necessary create relevant initial condition part application tested behaves like part complete system
If initial condition set correctly test exercising code realistic context diminishes value accuracy unit test result
To obtain intended benefit unit testing rigorous discipline needed throughout software development process
It essential keep careful record test performed also change made source code unit software
Use system essential
If later version unit fails particular test previously passed software provide list source code change applied unit since time
It also essential implement sustainable process ensuring test case failure reviewed regularly addressed immediately
If process implemented ingrained team workflow application evolve sync unit test suite increasing false positive reducing effectiveness test suite
Unit testing embedded system software present unique challenge Because software developed different platform one eventually run readily run test program actual deployment environment possible desktop program
Unit test tend easiest method input parameter output
It easy create unit test major function method interact something external application
For example method work database might require mock database interaction created probably wo comprehensive real database interaction
Here set test case specify number element implementation
First must interface called Adder implementing class constructor called AdderImpl
It go Adder interface method called add two integer parameter return another integer
It also specifies behaviour method small range value number test method
In case unit test written first act design document specifying form behaviour desired solution implementation detail left programmer
Following simplest thing could possibly work practice easiest solution make test pas shown
Using design specification one significant advantage design method The design document used verify implementation
The test never pas unless developer implement solution according design
Unit testing lack accessibility diagrammatic specification diagram may generated unit test using automated tool
Most modern language free tool usually available extension
Free tool like based framework outsource another system graphical rendering view human consumption
Unit testing cornerstone relies automated
This automated unit testing framework either third party created within development group
Extreme programming us creation unit test
The developer writes unit test expose either software requirement defect
This test fail either requirement implemented yet intentionally expose defect existing code
Then developer writes simplest code make test along test pas
Most code system unit tested necessarily path code
Extreme programming mandate test everything possibly break strategy traditional test every execution path method
This lead developer develop fewer test classical method really problem restatement fact classical method rarely ever followed methodically enough execution path thoroughly tested
Extreme programming simply recognizes testing rarely exhaustive often expensive economically viable provides guidance effectively focus limited resource
Crucially test code considered first class project artifact maintained quality implementation code duplication removed
Developers release unit testing code code repository conjunction code test
Extreme programming thorough unit testing allows benefit mentioned simpler confident code development simplified code integration accurate documentation modular design
These unit test also constantly run form
Unit testing also critical concept
As emergent design heavily dependent upon refactoring unit test integral component
Unit testing framework often product distributed part compiler suite
They help simplify process unit testing developed
Examples testing framework include open source solution various testing framework known collectively solution Development Testing dotTEST Testwell
It generally possible perform unit testing without support specific framework writing client code exercise unit test us mechanism signal failure
Unit testing without framework valuable adoption unit testing scant unit test hardly better none whereas framework place adding unit test becomes relatively easy
In framework many advanced unit test feature missing must
Some programming language directly support unit testing
Their grammar allows direct declaration unit test without importing library whether third party standard
Additionally boolean condition unit test expressed syntax boolean expression used test code used statement
Languages unit testing support include Some language without support good unit testing
Those language include

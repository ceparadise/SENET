The development model created study data collected organization contracted funded research
The term maturity relates degree formality optimization process practice formally defined step managed result metric active optimization process
The model aim improve existing process also applied process
The Capability Maturity Model originally developed tool objectively assessing ability government contractor implement contracted software project
The model based process maturity framework first described later book
It later published report book author
Though model come field also used model aid business process generally also used extensively worldwide government office commerce industry
In use computer grew widespread flexible le costly
Organizations began adopt computerized information system demand grew significantly
Many process software development infancy standard best practice approach defined
As result growth accompanied growing pain project failure common field still early year ambition project scale complexity exceeded market capability deliver adequate product within planned budget
Individuals began publish article book research result attempt professionalize process
In several US military project involving software subcontractor ran completed far later planned
In effort determine occurring funded study SEI
The first application staged maturity model IT rather published IT organization
began developing process maturity concept later stage career IBM
Active development model US Department Defense Software Engineering Institute SEI began Humphrey joined located Carnegie Mellon University retiring IBM
At request Air Force began formalizing Process Maturity Framework aid Department Defense evaluating capability software contractor part awarding contract
The result Air Force study model military use objective evaluation software subcontractor process capability maturity
Humphrey based framework earlier Quality Management Maturity Grid developed book Quality Free
Humphrey approach differed unique insight organization mature process stage based solving process problem specific order
Humphrey based approach staged evolution system software development practice within organization rather measuring maturity separate development process independently
The CMM thus used different organization general powerful tool understanding improving general business process performance
Watts Humphrey Capability Maturity Model CMM published book
Organizations originally assessed using process maturity questionnaire Software Capability Evaluation method devised Humphrey colleague Software Engineering Institute
The full representation Capability Maturity Model set defined process area practice five maturity level initiated Version completed January
The CMM published book primary author Mark Paulk Charles Weber Mary Beth Chrissis
United States America New York USA
The CMM model application software development sometimes problematic
Applying multiple model integrated within across organization could costly training appraisal improvement activity
The CMMI project formed sort problem using multiple model software development process thus CMMI model superseded CMM model though CMM model continues general theoretical process capability model used public domain
The CMM originally intended tool evaluate ability government contractor perform contracted software project
Though come area software development continues widely applied general model maturity process organization
A viewed set structured level describe well behavior practice process organization reliably sustainably produce required outcome
A maturity model used benchmark comparison aid understanding example comparative assessment different organization something common used basis comparison
In case CMM example basis comparison would organization software development process
The model involves five aspect There five level defined along continuum model according SEI Predictability effectiveness control organization software process believed improve organization move five level
While rigorous empirical evidence date support belief
Within maturity level Key Process Areas characterise level area five factor goal commitment ability measurement verification
These necessarily unique CMM representing stage organization must go way becoming mature
The model provides theoretical continuum along process maturity developed incrementally one level next
Skipping level
At maturity level process concerned addressing statistical process variation changing process example shift mean process performance improve process performance
This would done time maintaining likelihood achieving established quantitative objective
There company world attained level
The model originally intended evaluate ability government contractor perform software project
It used may suited purpose critic pointed process maturity according CMM necessarily mandatory successful software development
The software process framework documented intended guide wishing ass organization project consistency Key Process Areas
For maturity level five checklist type

A capability level evolutionary plateau describing organization capability relative process area
A capability level consists related specific generic practice process area improve organization process associated process area
Each level layer foundation continuous process improvement
Thus capability level cumulative higher capability level includes attribute lower level
In CMMI model contiunous representation six capability level designated number
Incomplete Performed Managed Defined Quantitatively Managed Optimizing A short description capability level follows An incomplete process process either performed partially performed
One specific goal process area satisfied generic goal exist level since reason institutionalize partially performed process
This tantamount Maturity Level staged representation
A Capability Level process process expected perform Capability Level specific generic practice
Performance may stable may meet specific objective quality cost schedule useful work done
This start process improvement
It mean something prove really working
A managed process planned performed monitored controlled individual project group process achieve given purpose
Managing process achieves model objective process well objective cost schedule quality
As title level indicates actively managing way thing done organization
You metric consistently collected applied management approach
Remember metric collected used level CMMI staged continuous representation
It bitter fallacy think organization wait Capability Level use metric
A capability level process characterized defined process
A defined process managed capability level process tailored organization set standard process according organization tailoring guideline contributes work product measure information organizational process asset
A capability level process characterized quantitatively managed process
A quantitatively managed process defined capability level process controlled using statistical quantitative technique
Quantitative objective quality process performance established used criterion managing process
Quality process performance understood statistical term managed throughout life process
An optimizing process quantitatively managed process improved based understanding common cause process variation inherent process
It focus continually improving process performance incremental innovative improvement
Both defined process organization set standard process target improvement activity
Capability Level focus establishing baseline model measurement process performance
Capability Level focus studying performance result across organization entire enterprise finding common cause problem work done process e used fixing problem process
The fix would include updating process documentation training involved error injected
Project Planning Project Monitoring Control Supplier Agreement Management Integrated Project Management IPPD Integrated Supplier Management SS Integrated Teaming IPPD Risk Management Quantitative Project Management Configuration Management Process Product Quality Assurance Measurement Analysis Causal Analysis Resolution Decision Analysis Resolution Organizational Environment Integration IPPD Requirements Management Requirements Development Technical Solution Product Integration Verification Validation In next chapter give brief description process area

CMMI developed CMMI project aimed improve usability maturity model integrating many different model one framework
The project consisted member industry government Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute SEI
The main sponsor included Office Secretary Defense
CMMI successor CMM Software CMM
The CMM developed
In version released version followed August version November
Some major change CMMI support improvement high maturity practice alignment representation staged continuous
According SEI CMMI help integrate traditionally separate organizational function set process improvement goal priority provide guidance quality process provide point reference appraising current process
In March CMMI Institute acquired
CMMI exists two representation continuous staged
The continuous representation designed allow user focus specific process considered important organization immediate business objective organization assigns high degree risk
The staged representation designed provide standard sequence improvement serve basis comparing maturity different project organization
The staged representation also provides easy migration CMMI
Depending area interest acquisition service development used process area contains vary
area covered organization process
The table list seventeen CMMI core process area present CMMI area interest version
The process area maturity level listed CMMI service model CMMI best practice published document called model address different area interest
Version provides model three area interest development acquisition service
An organization certified CMMI instead organization
Depending type appraisal organization awarded maturity level rating capability level achievement profile
Many organization find value measuring progress conducting appraisal
Appraisals typically conducted one following reason Appraisals organization using CMMI model must conform requirement defined Appraisal Requirements CMMI ARC document
There three class appraisal A B C focus identifying improvement opportunity comparing organization process CMMI best practice
Of class A appraisal formal one result level rating
Appraisal team use CMMI model appraisal method guide evaluation organization reporting conclusion
The appraisal result used process group plan improvement organization
The SCAMPI appraisal method meet ARC requirement
Results SCAMPI appraisal may published appraised organization approves CMMI Web site SEI
SCAMPI also support conduct also known Software Process Improvement Capability Determination assessment etc
This approach promotes member EPG PATs trained CMMI informal SCAMPI C appraisal performed process area prioritized improvement
More modern approach involve deployment commercially available process significantly reduce time achieve compliance
SEI maintained statistic time move organization adopting earlier Software CMM well CMMI
These statistic indicate since median time move Level Level month Level Level additional month
Since release CMMI median time move Level Level month median movement Level another month
These statistic updated published every six month maturity profile
The Software Engineering Institute SEI team software process methodology use CMMI model used raise maturity level
A new product called Accelerated Improvement Method AIM combine use CMMI TSP
To address user security concern two unofficial security guide available
one process area Security Management
following process area While affect maturity capability level process area reported appraisal result
The SEI published organization measured increase performance category cost schedule productivity quality customer satisfaction
The median increase performance varied customer satisfaction productivity
However CMMI model mostly deal process implemented much implemented
These result guarantee applying CMMI increase performance every organization
A small company resource may le likely benefit CMMI view supported page
Of small organization employee assessed level Managed organization employee rated highest level Optimizing
Turner Jain argue although obvious large difference CMMI approach much common
They believe neither way way develop software phase project one two better suited
They suggest one combine different fragment method new hybrid method
Sutherland et al
assert combination CMMI brings adaptability predictability either one alone
David Anderson give hint interpret CMMI agile manner
CMMI Roadmaps approach selecting deploying relevant process area model provide guidance focus effective CMMI adoption
There several CMMI roadmaps continuous representation specific set improvement goal
Examples CMMI Project Roadmap CMMI Product Product Integration Roadmaps CMMI Process Measurements Roadmaps
These roadmaps combine strength staged continuous representation
The combination project management technique EVM CMMI described
To conclude similar use CMMI Extreme Programming software engineering method evaluated Nawrocki et
For example XP requirement management approach relies oral communication evaluated compliant CMMI
CMMI appraised using two different approach staged continuous
The staged approach yield appraisal result one five The continuous approach yield one four The difference approach felt appraisal best practice equivalent result equivalent process improvement result

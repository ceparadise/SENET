In science computing engineering device system object viewed term input output without knowledge internal working
Its implementation opaque black
Almost anything might referred black box
To analyse something typical black box approach behavior accounted infer unknown
The usual representation centered box
The opposite black box system inner component logic available inspection commonly referred sometimes also known clear box glass box
The modern term black box seems entered English language around
In electronic process led electronic circuit regarded black box characterized response signal applied traced published idea developed form
Although Cauer use term others followed certainly describe method analysis
put concept even earlier attributing explicit use black box argues component implicitly treated
In full treatment given
A black box described unknown system identified using technique
He saw first step able copy output behavior black box
Many engineer scientist epistemologist used perfected black box theory
The abstraction representing class concrete viewed solely term The constitution structure box altogether irrelevant approach consideration purely external phenomenological
In word behavior system accounted
The understanding based explanatory principle An observer make observation time
All observation input output written table form sequence time state various part input output recorded
Thus using example examining box fallen might lead protocol Thus every system fundamentally investigated collection long protocol drawn time showing sequence input output state
From follows fundamental deduction knowledge obtainable Black Box given input output obtained protocol nothing
If observer also control input investigation turn illustration hypothesis tested directly
When experimenter also motivated control box active feedback relation promoting called architecture
The construction predictive using existing historic data observation table
A developed validated model method ensures based solely element
With input past event used modeling effort entered model see well output match known result
thing defined term function
The term applied field otherwise inquiry definition made relation appearance something
specifically thing black box state related characteristic behaviour within
Specifically inquiry focused upon thing immediately apparent characteristic therefore factor consideration held within hidden immediate observation
The observer assumed ignorant first instance majority available held inner situation away investigation
The element definition shown characterised system observable element enter perhaps imaginary box set different output emerging also observable
In one us black box theory describe understand factor field marketing applied analysis
The state fully understood output
however even wider application professional study The child try open door manipulate handle input produce desired movement latch output learn control one without able see internal mechanism link
In daily life confronted every turn system whose internal mechanism fully open inspection must treated method appropriate Black Box
This simple rule proved effective illustration Black Box principle cybernetics used control situation gone deeply may seem complex
A example Black Box principle treatment mental patient
The human brain certainly Black Box great deal neurological research going understand mechanism brain progress treatment also made observing patient response stimulus

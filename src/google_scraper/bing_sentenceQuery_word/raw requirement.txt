I avid Poolplayer played year I retired system developer mainframe system mostly never done raw development PC standalone program
I know several language expample COBOL SAS fortran databus remember
I familiar HTML XML AND SOME jAVA
The system program I chosen develop hwich none currently Design program cuemakers Pool player planning custom cue made
If seen familiar Custom Cues know many part many various wooods used
I need develop similiar sophisticated paint program photoship program Pool oriented template used building cue selecting wood different joint used different ring material different wrap etc
In addition varioius design component like different style point made different pattern inlay
When cue built I want dimensional rendition rotate customer get actual feel possible
I also want print part list
Of course must able save creation
I developed system year mainframe online batch including object oriented code SAS frame
But PC application area I NOT know language combination software application would BEST accomplish I described
I NEED RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR THE RIGHT TOOLS remember dimensional rendition animation
PRICE OF THE TOOLS IS ALSO A CONSIDERATION
IF tool forget okay
I know computer functionality various language function
I pick new language fast
I pride logic ability
Can help suggestion
Well kiddo let beat around bush
What asking develop pretty hard
Well hard time consuming especially want build scratch
First familiarise create drawing screen
And need know matrix
Then stuff like rotate pool cue space
Adding material pool cue well I guess could using OpenGL would also develop lighting algorithm stuff eek The best app market would cover requirement would probably autocad
Since developed specifically engineering create high precision object ideal need
But asking develop something like stand alone application pool cue
Tough
Which language choose
Hmm well anything incorporates OpenGL I guess java
Anyway thumbnail crappy pool cue I rendered provides utility view object space appropriate material
Food thought kiddo
simple database want sum Amount one one text box footer form textbox
Am using access database Hello I got node
look like C Files If start tool double click Hello professional try make tool colleague
I got XMLTreeView form load

concept
Two early important example The term architecture computer literature traced work Lyle Johnson Mohammad Usman Khan member Machine Organization department IBM main research center
Johnson opportunity write proprietary research communication time known Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
To describe level detail discussing luxuriously embellished computer noted description format instruction type hardware parameter speed enhancement level system architecture term seemed useful machine Subsequently Brooks Stretch designer started Chapter book Planning Computer System Project Stretch ed
Buchholz writing Computer architecture like architecture art determining need user structure designing meet need effectively possible within economic technological constraint
Brooks went help develop called line computer architecture became noun defining user need know
Later computer user came use term many way
The earliest computer architecture designed paper directly built final hardware form
Later computer architecture prototype physically built form TTL prototype tweaked committing final hardware form
As new computer architecture typically built tested computer architecture inside FPGA committing final hardware form
The discipline computer architecture three main subcategories There type computer architecture
The following type used bigger company like Intel count computer architecture The purpose design computer maximizes performance keeping power consumption check cost low relative amount expected performance also reliable
For many aspect considered includes instruction set design functional organization logic design implementation
The implementation involves integrated circuit design packaging power cooling
Optimization design requires familiarity compiler operating system logic design packaging
An instruction set architecture ISA interface computer software hardware also viewed programmer view machine
Computers understand Java programming language used
A processor understands instruction encoded numerical fashion usually
Software tool translate high level language instruction processor understand
Besides instruction ISA defines item computer available
memory
Instructions locate available item register index name memory addressing mode
The ISA computer usually described small instruction manual describes instruction encoded
Also may define short vaguely mnemonic name instruction
The name recognized software development tool called
An assembler computer program translates form ISA form
also widely available usually software program isolate correct malfunction binary computer program
ISAs vary quality completeness
A good ISA compromise programmer convenience easy code understand size code much code required specific action cost computer interpret instruction complexity mean space needed disassemble instruction speed computer larger disassemblers come longer disassemble time
For example ISAs like ISA subtracts one value value zero value return higher value inexpensive fast however ISAs like convenient helpful looking size ISA
Memory organization defines instruction interact memory memory interacts
During design software emulator run program written proposed instruction set
Modern emulator measure size cost speed determine particular ISA meeting goal
Computer organization help optimize product
For example software engineer need know processing power processor
They may need optimize software order gain performance lowest price
This require quite detailed analysis computer organization
For example SD card designer might need arrange card data processed fastest possible way
Computer organization also help plan selection processor particular project
Multimedia project may need rapid data access virtual machine may need fast interrupt
Sometimes certain task need additional component well
For example computer capable running virtual machine need hardware memory different virtual computer kept separated
Computer organization feature also affect power consumption processor cost
Once instruction set designed practical machine must developed
This design process called
Implementation usually considered architectural design rather hardware
Implementation broken several step For entire implementation process organized differently often referred
The exact form computer system depends constraint goal
Computer architecture usually trade standard power versus performance cost memory capacity latency amount time take information one node travel source throughput
Sometimes consideration feature size weight reliability expandability also factor
The common scheme depth power analysis figure keep power consumption low maintaining adequate performance
Modern computer performance often described IPC instruction per
This measure efficiency architecture clock frequency
Since faster rate make faster computer useful measurement
Older computer IPC count low
Simple modern processor easily reach near processor may reach three five IPC executing several instruction per clock cycle
Counting machine language instruction would misleading varying amount work different ISAs
The instruction standard measurement count ISA actual machine language instruction unit measurement usually based speed computer architecture
Many people used measure computer speed clock rate usually MHz GHz
This refers cycle per second main clock CPU
However metric somewhat misleading machine higher clock rate may necessarily greater performance
As result manufacturer moved away clock speed measure performance
Other factor influence speed mix speed available memory type order instruction program
There two main type speed latency throughput
Latency time start process completion
Throughput amount work done per unit time
guaranteed maximum response time system electronic event like disk drive finish moving data
Performance affected wide range design choice example processor usually make latency worse make throughput better
Computers control machinery usually need low interrupt latency
These computer operate environment fail operation completed specified amount time
For example brake must begin braking within predictable short time brake pedal sensed else failure brake occur
take factor account measuring time computer take run series test program
Although benchmarking show strength choose computer
Often measured machine split different measure
For example one system might handle scientific application quickly another might render video game smoothly
Furthermore designer may target add special feature product hardware software permit specific benchmark execute quickly offer similar advantage general task
Power efficiency another important measurement modern computer
A higher power efficiency often traded lower speed higher cost
The typical measurement referring power consumption computer architecture million instruction per second per watt
Modern circuit le power required per transistor number transistor per chip grows
This transistor put new chip requires power supply requires new pathway built power
However number transistor per chip starting increase slower rate
Therefore power efficiency starting become important important fitting transistor single chip
Recent processor design shown emphasis put focus power efficiency rather cramming many transistor single chip possible
In world embedded computer power efficiency long important goal next throughput latency
Increases publicly released refresh rate grown slowly past year respect vast leap power consumption reduction miniaturization demand
This led new demand longer battery life reduction size due mobile technology produced greater rate
This change focus greater refresh rate power consumption miniaturization shown significant reduction power consumption much reported Intel release dropped power consumption benchmark watt watt
Comparing processing speed increase GHz GHz seen focus research development shifting away refresh rate moving towards consuming le power taking le space

In instruction instruction used write set memory location return old value single operation
If multiple process may access memory location process currently performing process may begin another first process finished
A may use instruction offered another electronic component CPU may also offer instruction
A lock built using atomic instruction follows The calling process obtains lock old value otherwise spin waiting acquire lock
This called
another example
proved finite solve two concurrent process
In contrast offer general solution problem
instruction work many way
Here two variation describe DPRAM provides exactly port allowing separate electronic component CPUs access every memory location DPRAM
When CPU issue instruction DPRAM first make internal note storing address memory location special place
If point CPU happens issue instruction memory location DPRAM first check internal note recognizes situation issue BUSY interrupt tell CPU must wait retry
This implementation using interrupt mechanism
Since happens hardware speed CPU wait get short
Whether CPU trying access memory location DPRAM performs test given CPU
If test succeeds DPRAM set memory location value given CPU
Then DPRAM wipe internal note CPU writing
At point CPU could issue would succeed
CPU issue instruction write memory location A
The DPRAM immediately store value memory location A instead simultaneously move current value special register setting content memory location A special flag value
If point CPU issue memory location A DPRAM detects special flag value Variation issue BUSY interrupt
Whether CPU trying access memory location DPRAM performs CPU test
If test succeeds DPRAM set memory location A value specified CPU
If test fails DPRAM copy value back special register memory location A
Either operation wipe special flag value
If CPU issue succeed
Some instruction set atomic machine language instruction successor including
Those still implement atomic using instruction
The test set instruction used boolean value behaves like following function
Crucially entire function executed process interrupt function hence see state exists execution function
This code serf help explain behaviour atomicity requires explicit hardware support hence ca implemented simple function
NOTE In example assumed passed reference name assignment creates new value copying reference
The code segment atomic sense instruction
It also differs description DPRAM hardware set value test fixed invariant set part operation done regardless outcome test whereas description DPRAM memory set upon passage test value set test condition specified CPU
Here value set considered valid value memory location value nonzero allowed test equates case described DPRAM hardware specifically DPRAM case reduces constraint
From viewpoint correctly called full conventional sense term
The essential point note software function embody general intent principle value tested set one atomic operation program thread might cause target memory location change tested set would violate logic requiring location set certain value
That critically opposed merely recently value
In implementation would like The code also show TestAndSet really two operation atomic test
Only need atomic
This true delaying value comparison amount time change result test value test obtained
Once code writes initial value result test determined even computed
C language example operator
One way implement using based lock follows The lock variable shared variable
accessed
Note keyword
In absence volatile compiler CPU may optimize access lock use cached value thus rendering code erroneous
Conversely unfortunately presence guarantee read writes committed memory
Some compiler issue ensure operation committed memory since semantics quite vague compiler
Consult compiler documentation determine
This function called multiple process guaranteed one process time
The rest process keep spinning get lock
It possible process never granted lock
In case loop endlessly
This drawback implementation ensure fairness
These issue elaborated
Here atomic instruction lock variable
The process return unless acquires lock
The four major evaluation metric lock general uncontended latency bus traffic fairness storage
score low two namely high bus traffic unfairness
When processor obtained lock processor also waiting lock keep incurring bus transaction attempt acquire lock
When processor obtained lock processor also wish obtain lock keep trying obtain lock initiating bus transaction repeatedly get hold lock
This increase bus traffic requirement significantly
This slows traffic miss
It slows overall section since traffic saturated failed lock acquisition attempt
improvement TSL since initiate lock acquisition request continuously
When consider fairness consider processor get fair chance acquiring lock set free
In extreme situation processor might starve
might able acquire lock extended period time even though become free time
Storage overhead TSL next nothing since one lock required
Uncontended latency also low since one atomic instruction branch needed

Computer architecture provides introduction system design basic computer science student
This computer architecture study guide describes different part computer system relation
Students typically expected know architecture CPU primary CPU component role primary memory difference RAM ROM
Other topic study include purpose cache memory machine instruction cycle role secondary memory play computer architecture
The following definition help understand modern computer architecture The CPU calculation take place
It internal component computer often referred brain computer
Modern CPUs small square contain multiple metallic connector pin underside
The CPU inserted directly CPU socket pin side motherboard
The CPU important element computer system term computing power
The arithmetic logic unit ALU performs arithmetic logical operation
It data held temporarily calculation take place
The control unit CU control interprets execution instruction It extract instruction memory decodes executes calling ALU necessary
The following diagram showing relationship element CPU input output storage
There two type physical memory memory
Primary memory volatile memory
Secondary memory secondary storage
The main function primary memory also called main memory primary storage execute program code store temporary data
Primary memory memory processor access first
The memory chip located motherboard
The primary memory store application run operating system OS user interface installed software utility
The computer manipulate data main memory
Every program executed every file accessed must copied storage device main memory
The amount main memory computer system determines many program executed one time much data readily available program
Examples primary memory include RAM ROM
Random access memory RAM type common type memory found computer device printer
RAM requires flow electricity retain data computer powered
memory ROM type memory computer memory data prerecorded
ROM retain data without flow electricity computer powered
Secondary memory also called auxiliary memory storage device hard drive solid state drive removable storage medium including flash drive DVDs
Secondary memory accessed directly CPU primary memory
Instead data secondary memory loaded RAM sent processor
It transfer requested data intermediate area primary storage
While secondary memory much slower primary memory offer greater storage capacity
Persistent storage storage lose data loses power supply extremely important computer system
It needed store data device running program keep file data later use
The hard disk drive common example persistent storage
Cache memory also called CPU cache storage mechanism reserved section main memory independent storage device
The CPU cache reduces time required access data main memory
Modern CPUs different independent cache instruction data cache
There two type caching commonly used computer system memory caching disk caching
Memory cache sometimes called RAM cache portion memory made static RAM SRAM instead slower cheaper dynamic RAM DRAM used main memory
Memory caching effective program access data instruction
Disk caching work principle memory caching instead using SRAM disk cache us conventional main memory
Disk caching dramatically improve performance application accessing byte data RAM thousand time faster accessing byte hard disk
The instruction cycle refers time period one instruction fetched memory executed computer given instruction machine language
The CPU carry following four stage instruction cycle Fetch instruction memory
This step brings instruction instruction register circuit hold instruction decoded executed
Decode instruction
Mathematical logical operation used reference data
Read effective address memory instruction indirect address
Execute instruction
This combine step
Steps called instruction
Steps called change instruction

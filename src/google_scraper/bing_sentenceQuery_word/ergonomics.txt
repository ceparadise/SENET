Ergonomics draw many discipline study human environment including anthropometry biomechanics mechanical engineering industrial design
The term ἔργον meaning work νόμος meaning natural law first entered modern lexicon Polish scientist used word article The Outline Ergonomics
Science Work Based Truths Taken Natural Science
The introduction term English lexicon widely attributed British psychologist Hywel Murrell meeting UK led foundation
He used encompass study engaged World War II
The expression predominantly North American term adopted emphasise application method situation
A human factor physical property individual social specific human may influence functioning technological system
The term human factor ergonomics essentially synonymous
Ergonomics comprise three main field research Physical cognitive organisational ergonomics
There many specialization within broad category
Specialisations field physical ergonomics may include visual ergonomics
Specialisations within field cognitive ergonomics may include usability user experience engineering
Some specialisation may cut across domain concerned human interaction environment characterized climate temperature pressure vibration light
The emerging field us human factor principle understand action capability road user car truck driver pedestrian bicyclist etc

Pressure insignificant imperceptible unaffected disorder may painful render device unusable
Many ergonomically designed product also used recommended treat prevent disorder treat
One prevalent type injury musculoskeletal disorder
musculoskeletal disorder WRMDs result persistent pain loss functional capacity work disability initial diagnosis difficult mainly based complaint pain symptom
Every year million worker experience WRMDs nearly injury serious enough cause worker miss work
Certain job work condition cause higher rate worker complaint undue strain localized fatigue discomfort pain go away overnight rest
These type job often involving activity repetitive forceful exertion frequent heavy overhead lift awkward work position use vibrating equipment
The Occupational Safety Health Administration OSHA found substantial evidence ergonomics program cut worker compensation cost increase productivity decrease employee turnover
Therefore important gather data identify job work condition problematic using source injury illness log medical record job analysis
Cognitive ergonomics concerned mental process perception memory reasoning motor response affect interaction among human element system
Relevant topic include mental workload skilled performance human reliability work stress training may relate design
Organizational ergonomics concerned optimization system including organizational structure policy process
Relevant topic include communication crew resource management work design design working time teamwork community ergonomics cooperative work new work program virtual organization telework quality management
The foundation science ergonomics appear laid within context culture
A good deal evidence indicates Greek civilization century BC used ergonomic principle design tool job workplace
One outstanding example found description gave surgeon workplace designed tool us arranged
The also show early Egyptian dynasty made tool household equipment illustrated ergonomic principle
In century pioneered method proposed way find optimum method carrying given task
Taylor found could example triple amount coal worker shoveling incrementally reducing size weight coal shovel fastest shoveling rate reached
expanded Taylor method early develop
They aimed improve efficiency eliminating unnecessary step action
By applying approach Gilbreths reduced number motion allowing bricklayer increase productivity brick per hour
However approach rejected Russian researcher focused well worker
At criticised Taylorism
Bekhterev argued The ultimate ideal labour problem Taylorism organisation labour process would yield maximum efficiency coupled minimum health hazard absence fatigue guarantee sound health round personal development working people
Myasishchev rejected Frederick Taylor proposal turn man machine
Dull monotonous work temporary necessity corresponding machine developed
He also went suggest new discipline ergology study work integral part work
The concept taken Myasishchev mentor Bekhterev final report conference merely changing name ergonology Prior focus aviation psychology aviator war shifted focus onto aircraft particular design control display effect altitude environmental factor pilot

term thrown around health professional marketing maven cavalier attitude
For specific meaning
For others cover everything sun
With different verbiage flying probably starting wonder What Ergonomics Ergonomics derives two meaning work meaning natural law create word mean science person relationship work
The adopted technical definition ergonomics scientific discipline concerned understanding interaction among human element system profession applies theory principle data method design order optimize human overall system performance
That efficient definition ergonomics
Let u keep thing simple
Ergonomics science making thing comfy
It also make thing efficient
And think comfy another way making thing efficient
However simplicity ergonomics make thing comfortable efficient
At simplest definition ergonomics literally mean science work
So ergonomists
practitioner ergonomics study work work done work better
It attempt make work better ergonomics becomes useful
And also making thing comfortable efficient come play
Ergonomics commonly thought term product
But equally useful design service process
It used design many complex way
However user concerned How I use product service meet need I like using Ergonomics help define used meet need importantly like
It make thing comfy efficient
Comfort much soft handle
Comfort one greatest aspect design effectiveness
Comfort interface mental aspect product service primary ergonomic design concern
Comfort interface usually noticed first
Physical comfort item feel pleasing user
If like touch wo
If touch operate
If operate The utility item true measure quality design
The job designer find innovative way increase utility product
Physical comfort using item increase utility
Making item intuitive comfortable use ensure success marketplace
The mental aspect comfort interface found feedback
You preconceived notion certain thing
A quality product feel like made quality material
If lightweight flimsy feel comfortable using
The look feel use durability product help make mental determination product service
Basically let evaluate quality item compare cost
Better ergonomics mean better quality mean comfortable value item
Efficiency quite simply making something easier
Efficiency come many form Efficiency found almost everywhere
If something easier likely
If useful
Again utility true measure quality design
And willingly something often greater chance liking
If like comfortable
So next time hear term ergonomics know mean
And hopefully comforting thought
There error
Please try

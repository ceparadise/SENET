A computer science education sure ticket job today tech economy right
Hardly say one startup CEO lambasts school failing teach practical computer skill suggesting developer skip degree path first place
In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity
An Android developer authority computer copy editor Shakespeare Keats
Instead larger lesson may developer realistic career opportunity school upfront program lead
As startup CEOs keep mind distinction coding vocational training knowledge

However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science

The study five major component Professional Development PD Landscape Study Teacher Capacity Study Stories Field CS Schools Study Design Studio
While component study examined independently considered together complement providing broad view issue affecting CS education viewed lens different stakeholder
The study includes perspective teacher PD provider school administrator community leader others
This section highlight five major challenge repeatedly surfaced across five study component
The order challenge presented indication importance priority important consider effort improve state CS education
Computer science commonly accepted definition teacher student school leader PD provider interpret different way
Some view computer science computer application others consider programming still others describe logic modeling
These different point view contribute lack coherence instructional resource support provided teacher inconsistency instruction information communicated parent policy decision made school administrator
These different point view make challenging set goal metric necessary spread CS teaching learning leading intentionality clarity
Recommendation The CS education community need come agreement worth knowing CS learned student academic career
It invest development robust measure student learning use help describe quality CS teaching learning look like
While effort establish standard CS education widely embraced standard one piece needed
To build foundation CS education community need develop widely agreed upon standard student CS learning way measure
This would guide CS educator toward quality curriculum assessment professional development teaching practice turn enable clearly communicate advocate CS education
Instructional resource refers coherent set curriculum pedagogical resource inform instruction teacher knowledge student progress
CS teacher access range quality instructional resource teacher subject enjoy
Recommendation Support development comprehensive instructional material
Like subject many case even student entering CS course typically bring vastly different background level experience
A variety instructional resource support school teacher making decision best meet need CS student
These instructional material reflect growing knowledge student learn informed knowledge design implementation instructional resource large scale though research needed aspect
In discipline instructional material help student learn also help teacher improve practice
Instructional material support specific teacher professional development provide teacher assessment tool inform teaching daily basis
There little incentive school district include CS course
There requirement college level state requirement basic course material computer expensive purchase maintain
The decision include CS course fall individual school district level
Coupled lack instructional material result vastly different experience student across country
CS course also tend ephemeral leaving school funding reduced CS teacher leave school phenomenon directly tied CS course lack priority
Recommendation Establish policy enable school district prioritize CS coursework student access quality CS education
These policy developed careful consideration student learning requirement student schedule pay careful attention change management issue arise within school result implementation
There pathway become CS teacher
Furthermore little incentive teacher commit teaching CS school district generally prioritize CS coursework
Individuals CS experience many career option teaching
Those interest teaching find resource education leading certification support related subject mathematics
Recommendation In short medium term develop deploy strategy help existing teacher become excellent CS teacher
In long term one expect CS course prioritized accompanied robust standard curriculum teacher professional development CS teaching emerge viable path
These change may increase number teacher entering CS teaching career
CS teacher colleague close share idea information discipline provide instructional support coaching
The lack colleague collaborator source new information CS instruction compounded low prioritization CS school lack instructional material lack criterion quality CS instruction
This make improving instruction difficult affect motivation
Recommendation Dedicate resource build sustain online network CS teaching learning leading including teacher school PD provider
If well designed network potential support improvement across school district state line
September To Computer Science Education Community It privilege pleasure engage computer science community developing component study Building Operating System Computer Science This community strikingly thoughtful committed seemingly tireless effort bring quality computer science education student
We hopeful work done create foundation next step continue work within community realize goal
We came work collective decade experience mathematics science education teaching research evaluation administration scientific research little knowledge computer science education computer science education community
We deeply appreciate community willingness orient u key information issue concern get u back track strayed forthcoming knowledge experience essential ensuring effort would valuable
This kind collaboration openness taken granted appreciate support community provided
As reflect particular piece work come close look forward continuing work inspiring community
Over next month year hope u keep following mind History show destructive debate content pedagogy mathematics teaching learning stifled progress school student
Likewise science education suffered lack prioritization insufficient clarity purpose
The computer science community avoid similar history bringing clear coherent committed message computer science education policy maker public decision maker
A unified voice aligned action aspect community practicing scientist researcher university faculty teacher foundation corporate interest essential
Computer science education beginning take benefitting population enamored part technology industry much like science education moved public consciousness Sputnik
With support may easier convince district state give computer science education attention
More attention however equal higher quality sometimes work
It essential define quality computer science education look like shared way measure develop common language communicate
Without clarity others bring meaning agenda discussion
There groundswell energy commitment momentum computer science teaching learning leading
Having watched trend come go discipline see unprecedented opportunity establish norm computer science education
Given newness discipline setting right foundation pave way tremendous gain future something contemporary mathematics science education community never opportunity
Our hope research useful community
We welcome comment question time look forward continuing work move computer science education agenda forward

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

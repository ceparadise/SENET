A resource histogram one tool given u company produce project management software help allocation resource project plan
Automatic resource leveling usually give u best solution resource allocation problem
Until good artificial intelligence program help u automatic resource leveling probably give u long schedule
The resource histogram allows u look individual resource schedule Gantt chart time
By looking two display simultaneously make intelligent decision regarding use resource
The resource histogram show amount use availability resource Gantt chart show activity resource scheduled working
When project schedule moved hand draftsman drawing activity arrow diagram Gantt chart hand computer became much faster produce result
Unfortunately many result created difficulty
Prior computerization resource allocation difficult efficiently
When computerization began automatic resource leveling introduced considered great step forward
It take people long realize computerized resource leveling terribly intelligent
The resource leveling algorithm used computer software package examines project schedule conflict arises
A resource conflict occurs two activity require use resource le availability resource require
Let u say activity start Tuesday January scheduled end Monday January work weekend eightday activity start January scheduled finish January
Let u also say two activity require effort Mary Engineer
This resource conflict scheduled activity require resource January
In situation computer algorithm would schedule first activity start January reschedule second activity start January resource becomes available
This one many possible solution resource conflict may always best solution
There consideration use total float free float length activity duration risk number activity depend one rescheduled
In word pretty
Referring RESOURCE HISTOGRAM WITH GANTT CHART another example resource conflict
Here use resource histogram help u solve problem
In week one two resource Engineer fully utilized
Engineer used twenty hour per week
Task task using engineer
During week three four continue working task one also work task two
Since task require engineer work twenty hour per week schedule engineer work parttime task
This mean used forty hour per week
Now come problem
In week project schedule call task three start task one end
The trouble task three requires engineer work forty hour task alone
If try complete work task two start working task three require sixty hour per week engineer time
Asking engineer work twenty hour overtime may mixed result engineer family
We also notice week six completed twenty hour work engineer
There many way problem could solved
We could delay start task three task two completed
We could reschedule task two start task three completed
In solution shown OVERALLOCATION OF RESOURCE RESOLVED chosen interrupt task two worked two week
At point schedule engineer start work task continues working completed
When task three finished start work task continues work task two
Notice solution make utilization engineer much better
The engineer scheduled working forty hour week week
Using resource histogram quite easy
Most software allows easily see scheduled task simple mouse point click
The resource histogram change reflect change made schedule make relatively easy make optimum schedule using real people
Although one resource shown time scroll resource quickly
The Gantt chart made filter task use resource

A summary hammock activity shown Figure used represent group activity project schedule
It used summarize schedule information group activity allow entire project summarized relatively summary activity
The summary activity show start finish group activity one Gantt bar
If early start early finish used schedule bar show earliest early start latest early finish activity group
Figure The summary activity come use since development project management software
The advantage summary activity milestone necessary set elaborate logical relationship make sure milestone rescheduled activity group represented milestone moved
The milestone show single date
This start finish group activity major event commitment date
The summary activity show start finish group activity
The computer search group activity find earliest early start date latest early finish date project scheduled according early schedule
If project scheduled late schedule combination two computer search earliest latest scheduled date group activity
On Gantt chart milestone duration zero generally shown triangle
Summary activity shown Gantt chart schedule activity bar usually graphic distinguish normal scheduled activity
In Microsoft Project summary bar small triangle bar end bar
The summary activity created selecting activity summarized clicking right arrow tool bar
The work breakdown structure entered way
The WBS make convenient set summary activity may sufficient reporting system
If summary activity may entered needed

See Attached BRAIN MASS Word Document
I provided example histogram
I use problem additional exercise well guide correctness
Thank Your company planning launch important new project starting January last one year
You estimate need one project manager two full time analyst first six month two Senior programmer whole year four junior programmer month July August September one technical writer last three month
This solution discus project management display create resource histogram

Excel Erudition Excellently Expounded I confess I never heard phrase last night
A colleague asked I could show prepare one histogram Excel
I asked show example I would I could
Well chart I given course NOT histogram I given prepare
What I create table data chart I given ask Excel create Stacked Column Chart
That apart adding chart title axis label
Here table data I put together Resource Histogram based
That really

Julianne working transportation project college engineering class
She want first conduct research find type transportation local community currently us
Julianne creates distributes survey sample people
Out people surveyed people chose bus people chose personal car people chose carpool people chose walking people chose bike people chose scooter people chose motorcycle people chose train
Julianne would like display information visual way show frequency method transportation chosen
Julianne use display data
A histogram graphical representation distribution data
Let look Julianne create histogram
Histograms similar bar graph
Histograms show u frequently certain number appear set data
You use histogram show popularity mode certain type data
To create histogram first put type data horizontal axis
In case put different type transportation horizontal axis
The vertical axis represents frequency choice
The popular choice carpool selected people
Therefore tallest bar unit high
From histogram see popular choice least popular choice
Let look histogram deal number rather category
Julianne want know much time person spends type transportation
She realizes people use different type transportation day
Julianne asks people many hour spend type transportation
After collecting data Julianne group information type transportation
Here data set number hour person spends riding bus week Wow lot number
It little much take
If try sit look number may left headache much else
We take number place histogram make number easier understand
Much better
The number bottom along horizontal axis actual hour spent bus
The number side along vertical axis number time hour appeared data set
Take hour example
The bar go match number vertical axis
That mean people said ride bus hour week
If look original data set see appears four time
Get FREE access day create account
This histogram Julianne created
She gathered data asking many people walked part daily transportation system
Out people said walked
Julianne asked distance person walked daily
She grouped distance created histogram
The mode data set since appears time
We identify mode data set distance selected people surveyed
What else notice histogram
Do see data peak towards left taper towards right
This majority distance selected closer towards mile rather mile
That mean data set skewed right
shape graph peak left right center
Data set skewed right fewer observation number higher value
While data set skewed left fewer observation number lower value
Histograms excellent way group visualize data distribution
A graphical representation distribution data
Histograms similar bar graph
Histograms show u frequently certain number appear set data
You use histogram show popularity mode certain type data
To create histogram first put type data horizontal axis
The vertical axis represents frequency choice
A histogram show data shape graph peak left right center
Data set skewed right fewer observation number higher value data set skewed left fewer observation number lower value
The tallest peak histogram give mode popular choice data set

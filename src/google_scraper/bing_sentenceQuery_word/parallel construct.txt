type many calculation execution carried simultaneously
Large problem often divided smaller one solved time
There several different form parallel computing
Parallelism employed many year mainly interest grown lately due physical constraint preventing
As power consumption consequently heat generation computer become concern recent year parallel computing become dominant paradigm mainly form
Parallel computing closely related frequently used together often conflated though two distinct possible parallelism without concurrency concurrency without parallelism multitasking CPU
In parallel computing computational task typically broken several often many similar subtasks processed independently whose result combined afterwards upon completion
In contrast concurrent computing various process often address related task typical separate task may varied nature often require execution
Parallel computer roughly classified according level hardware support parallelism computer multiple within single machine use multiple computer work task
Specialized parallel computer architecture sometimes used alongside traditional processor accelerating specific task
In case parallelism transparent programmer parallelism explicitly particularly use concurrency difficult write sequential one concurrency introduces several new class potential common
different subtasks typically greatest obstacle getting good parallel program performance
A theoretical single program result parallelization given
Traditionally written
To solve problem constructed implemented serial stream instruction
These instruction executed one computer
Only one instruction may execute instruction finished next one executed
Parallel computing hand us multiple processing element simultaneously solve problem
This accomplished breaking problem independent part processing element execute part algorithm simultaneously others
The processing element diverse include resource single computer multiple processor several networked computer specialized hardware combination
dominant reason improvement
The runtime program equal number instruction multiplied average time per instruction
Maintaining everything else constant increasing clock frequency decrease average time take execute instruction
An increase frequency thus decrease runtime program
However power consumption chip given equation switched per clock cycle proportional number transistor whose input change processor frequency cycle per second
Increases frequency increase amount power used processor
Increasing processor power consumption led ultimately May cancellation processor generally cited end frequency scaling dominant computer architecture paradigm
empirical observation number transistor microprocessor double every month
Despite power consumption issue repeated prediction end Moore law still effect
With end frequency scaling additional transistor longer used frequency scaling used add extra hardware parallel computing
Optimally parallelization would number processing element halve runtime doubling second time halve runtime
However parallel algorithm achieve optimal speedup
Most speedup small number processing element flattens constant value large number processing element
The potential speedup algorithm parallel computing platform given Since show small part program parallelized limit overall speedup available parallelization
A program solving large mathematical engineering problem typically consist several parallelizable part several serial part
If part program account runtime get time speedup regardless many processor added
This put upper limit usefulness adding parallel execution unit
When task partitioned sequential constraint application effort effect schedule
The bearing child take nine month matter many woman assigned
Amdahl law applies case problem size fixed
In practice computing resource become available tend get used larger problem larger datasets time spent parallelizable part often grows much faster inherently serial work
In case give le pessimistic realistic assessment parallel performance Both Amdahl law Gustafson law assume running time serial part program independent number processor
Amdahl law assumes entire problem fixed size total amount work done parallel also whereas Gustafson law assumes total amount work done parallel
Understanding fundamental implementing
No program run quickly longest chain dependent calculation known since calculation depend upon prior calculation chain must executed order
However algorithm consist long chain dependent calculation usually opportunity execute independent calculation parallel
Let two program segment
Bernstein condition describe two independent executed parallel
For let input variable output variable likewise
independent satisfy Violation first condition introduces flow dependency corresponding first segment producing result used second segment
The second condition represents second segment produce variable needed first segment
The third final condition represents output dependency two segment write location result come logically last executed segment
Consider following function demonstrate several kind dependency In example instruction executed even parallel instruction instruction us result instruction
It violates condition thus introduces flow dependency
In example dependency instruction run parallel
Bernstein condition allow memory shared different process
For mean enforcing ordering access necessary
Subtasks parallel program often called
Some parallel computer architecture use smaller lightweight version thread known others use bigger version known
However thread generally accepted generic term subtasks
Threads often need update shared
The instruction two program may interleaved order
For example consider following program If instruction executed instruction executed program produce incorrect data
This known
The programmer must use provide
A lock programming language construct allows one thread take control variable prevent thread reading writing variable unlocked
The thread holding lock free execute section program requires exclusive access variable unlock data finished
Therefore guarantee correct program execution program rewritten use lock One thread successfully lock variable V thread proceed V unlocked
This guarantee correct execution program
Locks necessary ensure correct program execution greatly slow program
Locking multiple variable using lock introduces possibility program
An lock multiple variable
If lock lock
If two thread need lock two variable using lock possible one thread lock one second thread lock second variable
In case neither thread complete deadlock result
Many parallel program require subtasks
This requires use
Barriers typically implemented using software lock
One class algorithm known altogether avoids use lock barrier
However approach generally difficult implement requires correctly designed data structure
Not parallelization result
Generally task split thread thread spend portion time communicating
Eventually overhead communication dominates time spent solving problem parallelization splitting workload even thread increase rather decrease amount time required finish
This known
Applications often classified according often subtasks need synchronize communicate
An application exhibit parallelism subtasks must communicate many time per second exhibit parallelism communicate many time per second exhibit rarely never communicate
Embarrassingly parallel application considered easiest parallelize

From advent VLSI fabrication technology computer architecture driven doubling amount information processor manipulate per cycle
Increasing word size reduces number instruction processor must execute perform operation variable whose size greater length word
For example processor must add two processor must first add bit integer using standard addition instruction add bit using instruction lower order addition thus processor requires two instruction complete single operation processor would able complete operation single instruction
Historically microprocessor replaced microprocessor
This trend generally came end introduction processor standard computing two decade

The literary meaning word cohesion consistency organization different unit
In computer science software engineering cohesion refers level strength unity different component software program
It remained norm software engineering software program developed different function module module separate task associated
Cohesion software determines strength source code comprehended exploring associative principle type calculating method
The concept cohesion introduced capture feature program software engineering domain
This concept make easy determine module software program indicates rapidly perform different task assigned
Increased cohesion software program obtained identical operation performed different module inversely proportional decreased number module
This mean software program designed perform multiple task multiple module higher probability lower cohesion negatively affect overall performance effectiveness computing machine
Associative principle software cohesion refer relationship type software module corresponding action operation
These principle collectively constitute cohesion software program vary according different operational requirement
There seven associative principle formalized seven type software cohesion includes coincidental logical temporal procedural communicational sequential functional cohesion
Each cohesion type unique associative principle associated define action property software module
There certain property associated cohesion software engineering
For instance software constituted three different module similar term action overall cohesion software program increase
Similarly cohesion decrease module entirely different unique action associated
Furthermore cohesion software program also dependent upon type data process inversely proportional increased number data type
Cohesion software program analysis quantitative qualitative method
In qualitative measurement process textual code software program analyzed taking different sample evaluating according coding standard respective programming language
In contrast quantitative evaluation cohesion identifies number module constituted within software program evaluates action according scale

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
From page Cohesion interdependency within module name worse better high cohesion good emphasis mine
I fully understand definition logical cohesion
My question Logical cohesion bad end grouping functionality technical characteristic rather functional characteristic
For example consider application consisting multiple module
Each module represents business domain corresponding data access code
If group data access code across module logical cohesion
After data access case beneficial able evaluate data access pattern application
This however problematic business domain provides module boundary technical domain
By achieving logical cohesion end losing functional cohesion
Typically business domain defines unit deployment technical aspect support business domain
From described I would say coupling code together cohesion break object orientation
Example calculation polygon area
When put calculation square together calculation triangle choose grouped two thing logically outcome taking account real nature

type many calculation execution carried simultaneously
Large problem often divided smaller one solved time
There several different form parallel computing
Parallelism employed many year mainly interest grown lately due physical constraint preventing
As power consumption consequently heat generation computer become concern recent year parallel computing become dominant paradigm mainly form
Parallel computing closely related frequently used together often conflated though two distinct possible parallelism without concurrency concurrency without parallelism multitasking CPU
In parallel computing computational task typically broken several often many similar subtasks processed independently whose result combined afterwards upon completion
In contrast concurrent computing various process often address related task typical separate task may varied nature often require execution
Parallel computer roughly classified according level hardware support parallelism computer multiple within single machine use multiple computer work task
Specialized parallel computer architecture sometimes used alongside traditional processor accelerating specific task
In case parallelism transparent programmer parallelism explicitly particularly use concurrency difficult write sequential one concurrency introduces several new class potential common
different subtasks typically greatest obstacle getting good parallel program performance
A theoretical single program result parallelization given
Traditionally written
To solve problem constructed implemented serial stream instruction
These instruction executed one computer
Only one instruction may execute instruction finished next one executed
Parallel computing hand us multiple processing element simultaneously solve problem
This accomplished breaking problem independent part processing element execute part algorithm simultaneously others
The processing element diverse include resource single computer multiple processor several networked computer specialized hardware combination
dominant reason improvement
The runtime program equal number instruction multiplied average time per instruction
Maintaining everything else constant increasing clock frequency decrease average time take execute instruction
An increase frequency thus decrease runtime program
However power consumption chip given equation switched per clock cycle proportional number transistor whose input change processor frequency cycle per second
Increases frequency increase amount power used processor
Increasing processor power consumption led ultimately May cancellation processor generally cited end frequency scaling dominant computer architecture paradigm
empirical observation number transistor microprocessor double every month
Despite power consumption issue repeated prediction end Moore law still effect
With end frequency scaling additional transistor longer used frequency scaling used add extra hardware parallel computing
Optimally parallelization would number processing element halve runtime doubling second time halve runtime
However parallel algorithm achieve optimal speedup
Most speedup small number processing element flattens constant value large number processing element
The potential speedup algorithm parallel computing platform given Since show small part program parallelized limit overall speedup available parallelization
A program solving large mathematical engineering problem typically consist several parallelizable part several serial part
If part program account runtime get time speedup regardless many processor added
This put upper limit usefulness adding parallel execution unit
When task partitioned sequential constraint application effort effect schedule
The bearing child take nine month matter many woman assigned
Amdahl law applies case problem size fixed
In practice computing resource become available tend get used larger problem larger datasets time spent parallelizable part often grows much faster inherently serial work
In case give le pessimistic realistic assessment parallel performance Both Amdahl law Gustafson law assume running time serial part program independent number processor
Amdahl law assumes entire problem fixed size total amount work done parallel also whereas Gustafson law assumes total amount work done parallel
Understanding fundamental implementing
No program run quickly longest chain dependent calculation known since calculation depend upon prior calculation chain must executed order
However algorithm consist long chain dependent calculation usually opportunity execute independent calculation parallel
Let two program segment
Bernstein condition describe two independent executed parallel
For let input variable output variable likewise
independent satisfy Violation first condition introduces flow dependency corresponding first segment producing result used second segment
The second condition represents second segment produce variable needed first segment
The third final condition represents output dependency two segment write location result come logically last executed segment
Consider following function demonstrate several kind dependency In example instruction executed even parallel instruction instruction us result instruction
It violates condition thus introduces flow dependency
In example dependency instruction run parallel
Bernstein condition allow memory shared different process
For mean enforcing ordering access necessary
Subtasks parallel program often called
Some parallel computer architecture use smaller lightweight version thread known others use bigger version known
However thread generally accepted generic term subtasks
Threads often need update shared
The instruction two program may interleaved order
For example consider following program If instruction executed instruction executed program produce incorrect data
This known
The programmer must use provide
A lock programming language construct allows one thread take control variable prevent thread reading writing variable unlocked
The thread holding lock free execute section program requires exclusive access variable unlock data finished
Therefore guarantee correct program execution program rewritten use lock One thread successfully lock variable V thread proceed V unlocked
This guarantee correct execution program
Locks necessary ensure correct program execution greatly slow program
Locking multiple variable using lock introduces possibility program
An lock multiple variable
If lock lock
If two thread need lock two variable using lock possible one thread lock one second thread lock second variable
In case neither thread complete deadlock result
Many parallel program require subtasks
This requires use
Barriers typically implemented using software lock
One class algorithm known altogether avoids use lock barrier
However approach generally difficult implement requires correctly designed data structure
Not parallelization result
Generally task split thread thread spend portion time communicating
Eventually overhead communication dominates time spent solving problem parallelization splitting workload even thread increase rather decrease amount time required finish
This known
Applications often classified according often subtasks need synchronize communicate
An application exhibit parallelism subtasks must communicate many time per second exhibit parallelism communicate many time per second exhibit rarely never communicate
Embarrassingly parallel application considered easiest parallelize
Parallel programming language parallel computer must also known memory model
The consistency model defines rule operation occur result produced
One first consistency model model
Sequential consistency property parallel program parallel execution produce result sequential program
Specifically program sequentially consistent result execution operation processor executed sequential order operation individual processor appear sequence order specified program
common type consistency model
Software transactional memory borrows concept applies memory access
Mathematically model represented several way
introduced Carl Adam Petri doctoral thesis early attempt codify rule consistency model
Dataflow theory later built upon created physically implement idea dataflow theory
Beginning late developed permit algebraic reasoning system composed interacting component
More recent addition process calculus family added capability reasoning dynamic topology
Logics Lamport mathematical model also developed describe behavior concurrent system
created one earliest classification system parallel sequential computer program known
Flynn classified program computer whether operating using single set multiple set instruction whether instruction using single set multiple set data
The SISD classification equivalent entirely sequential program
The SIMD classification analogous operation repeatedly large data set
This commonly done application
MISD rarely used classification
While computer architecture deal devised application fit class materialized
MIMD program far common type parallel program
According Some machine hybrid category course classic model survived simple easy understand give good first approximation
It widely used scheme
From advent VLSI fabrication technology computer architecture driven doubling amount information processor manipulate per cycle
Increasing word size reduces number instruction processor must execute perform operation variable whose size greater length word
For example processor must add two processor must first add bit integer using standard addition instruction add bit using instruction lower order addition thus processor requires two instruction complete single operation processor would able complete operation single instruction
Historically microprocessor replaced microprocessor
This trend generally came end introduction processor standard computing two decade
Not early advent architecture processor become commonplace
A computer program essence stream instruction executed processor
Without parallelism processor issue le one
These processor known processor
These instruction combined group executed parallel without changing result program
This known parallelism
Advances parallelism dominated computer architecture
All modern processor
Each stage pipeline corresponds different action processor performs instruction stage processor pipeline different instruction different stage completion thus issue one instruction per clock cycle
These processor known processor
The canonical example pipelined processor processor five stage instruction fetch IF instruction decode ID execute EX memory access MEM register write back WB
The processor pipeline
Most modern processor also multiple
They usually combine feature pipelining thus issue one instruction per clock cycle
These processor known processor
Instructions grouped together
similar scoreboarding make use two common technique implementing execution parallelism
Task parallelism characteristic parallel program entirely different calculation performed either different set data
This contrast data parallelism calculation performed different set data
Task parallelism involves decomposition task allocating processor execution
The processor would execute simultaneously often cooperatively
Task parallelism usually scale size problem
Main memory parallel computer either shared processing element single processing element local address space
Distributed memory refers fact memory logically distributed often implies physically distributed well
combine two approach processing element local memory access memory processor
Accesses local memory typically faster access memory
Computer architecture element main memory accessed equal known UMA system
Typically achieved system memory physically distributed
A system property known NUMA architecture
Distributed memory system memory access
Computer system make use fast memory located close processor store temporary copy memory value nearby physical logical sense
Parallel computer system difficulty cache may store value one location possibility incorrect program execution
These computer require system keep track cached value strategically purge thus ensuring correct program execution
one common method keeping track value accessed thus purged
Designing large cache coherence system difficult problem computer architecture
As result shared memory computer architecture scale well distributed memory system
communication implemented hardware several way including via shared either multiported memory shared interconnect network myriad including fat hypercube hypercube one processor node
Parallel computer based interconnected network need kind enable passing message node directly connected
The medium used communication processor likely hierarchical large multiprocessor machine
Parallel computer roughly classified according level hardware support parallelism
This classification broadly analogous distance basic computing node
These mutually exclusive example cluster symmetric multiprocessor relatively common
A processor processor includes multiple called core chip
This processor differs processor includes multiple issue multiple instruction per clock cycle one instruction stream thread contrast processor issue multiple instruction per clock cycle multiple instruction stream
designed use prominent processor
Each core processor potentially superscalar every clock cycle core issue multiple instruction one thread
Intel best known early form
A processor capable simultaneous multithreading includes multiple execution unit processing superscalar issue multiple instruction per clock cycle thread
hand includes single execution unit processing unit issue one instruction time thread
A symmetric multiprocessor SMP computer system multiple identical processor share memory connect via bus
prevents bus architecture scaling
As result SMPs generally comprise processor
Because small size processor significant reduction requirement bus bandwidth achieved large cache symmetric multiprocessor extremely provided sufficient amount memory bandwidth exists
A distributed computer also known distributed memory multiprocessor distributed memory computer system processing element connected network
Distributed computer highly scalable
The term distributed computing lot overlap clear distinction exists
The system may characterized parallel distributed processor typical distributed system run concurrently parallel
A cluster group loosely coupled computer work together closely respect regarded single computer
Clusters composed multiple standalone machine connected network
While machine cluster symmetric difficult
The common type cluster cluster implemented multiple identical computer connected
Beowulf technology originally developed
The vast majority supercomputer cluster
Because grid computing system described easily handle embarrassingly parallel problem modern cluster typically designed handle difficult require node share intermediate result often
This requires high bandwidth importantly interconnection network
Many historic current supercomputer use customized network hardware specifically designed cluster computing Cray Gemini network
As current supercomputer use standard network hardware often
A massively parallel processor MPP single computer many networked processor
MPPs many characteristic cluster MPPs specialized interconnect network whereas cluster use commodity hardware networking
MPPs also tend larger cluster typically far processor
In MPP CPU contains memory copy operating system application
Each subsystem communicates others via interconnect

others supporting
Several ASIC approach devised dealing parallel application
Because ASIC definition specific given application fully optimized application
As result given application ASIC tends outperform computer
However ASICs created
This process requires mask set extremely expensive
A mask set cost million US dollar
The smaller transistor required chip expensive mask
Meanwhile performance increase computing time described tend wipe gain one two chip generation
High initial cost tendency overtaken computing rendered ASICs unfeasible parallel computing application
However built

These generally divided class based assumption make underlying memory memory distributed memory shared distributed memory
Shared memory programming language communicate manipulating shared memory variable
Distributed memory us
two widely used shared memory APIs whereas MPI widely used system API
One concept used programming parallel program one part program promise deliver required datum another part program future time

The OpenHMPP programming model offer syntax efficiently offload computation hardware accelerator optimize data movement hardware memory
OpenHMPP directive describe remote procedure call RPC accelerator device
GPU generally set core
The directive annotate code describe two set functionality offloading procedure denoted codelets onto remote device optimization data transfer CPU main memory accelerator memory
The rise consumer GPUs led support either graphic APIs referred dedicated APIs language extension
Automatic parallelization sequential program parallel computing
Despite decade work compiler researcher automatic parallelization limited success
Mainstream parallel programming language remain either best programmer give compiler parallelization
A fully implicit parallel programming language Parallel
As computer system grows complexity usually decrease
technique whereby computer system take snapshot record current resource allocation variable state akin information used restore program computer fail
Application checkpointing mean program restart last checkpoint rather beginning
While checkpointing provides benefit variety situation especially useful highly parallel system large number processor used
As parallel computer become larger faster becomes feasible solve problem previously took long run
Parallel computing used wide range field economics
Common type problem found parallel computing application Parallel computing also applied design particularly via system performing operation parallel
This provides case one component fail also allows automatic result differ
These method used help prevent single event upset caused transient error
Although additional measure may required embedded specialized system method provide cost effective approach achieve redundancy commercial system

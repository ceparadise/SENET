In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

BY Peter Denning Full citation ACM Digital Library Ubiquity Volume Number June Pages DOI Where computer science intellectual discipline fit human discourse
Is robust tributary mathematics Mother Sciences borrowing formalism fundamental notion contributing well
Is science sharing mindset philosophical underpinnings physic chemistry biology psychology
Or engineering bringing constructive approach wondrous creation
Most computer scientist feel proper reply among choice rather
The traditional curricular distinction theory system point computer science mathematical engineering discipline
What perhaps controversial whether computer science also claim true science
Over dozen contributor looked question identity many viewpoint
In closing statement emphasize six theme running commentary draw conclusion seem supported symposium
We refer author appearing symposium last name Cuny contribution Carlson Yaffe Anderson McGeoch Moret Sjøberg Guzdial Alderson Gelenbe Tichy Rosenbloom Bell
We refer Vint Cerf essay Where Science Computer Science essay Computer Science Revisited Peter Denning essay Performance Analysis Experimental computer science best
got u started emphasizing experimental method
Tichy quoted Richard Feynman The fundamental principle science definition almost The sole test validity idea experiment
stated physical world science largely model measurement prediction validation
Our ability predict likely outcome based model fundamental central notion scientific method
offered following definition The key affect experimental science apparatus collecting data hypothesis systematic analysis see whether data support hypothesis
One u argued elsewhere debugging task familiar computer scientist fact highly specific example scientific method
Carlson definition broader Science everything know physical Universe know
He explained scientist always fit theory fact never fact theory
And added Doing science making sure fooling
This get back notion science uncovering empirical truth
Yaffe went detail listing character trait science emphasizing Einstein assertion The whole science nothing refinement everyday thinking
The symposium writer seem share definition science
gave brief history field computing present stretch year
He suggested computing began science morphed engineering year developed technology entered science renaissance year ago
Although computing subfields demonstrated idea science computing whole recently begun embrace ideal
Moret history display similar arc
In pioneering era computing early theoretical experiment algorithm much thorough experimental assessment common across computer science
Along way theory experiment became decoupled perhaps enormous complexity setting meaningful experiment We move toward reintegration two aspect field
mentioned famous letter journal In Allen Newell Alan Perlis Herbert Simon famously defended new field true science concerned aspect surrounding computer
Guzdial brought Perlis another context Perlis argued computer science study important everyone
argued term science raise expectation least mind ability define model make prediction behavior computes computing system concluded group professional devoted evolution understanding application software hardware myriad problem opportunity activity modern society responsibility pursue science computer science
went state To degree aspect computing subject analysis modeling fair say rigorous element science field
He discussed challenge science opportunity address challenge model used hardware analysis tractable used software analysis abstraction powerful tool modeling aid ability analyze make prediction behavior complex process
He concluded really science found computer science
McGeoch made point concerning algorithm research There three main activity algorithm research analysis predicting performance echoing identification science others previously mentioned design finding new better way solve problem model computation understanding design analysis change basic operation defined platform modified
In three area theoretical method necessarily make simplifying input dominant operation cost RAM
Experimental method fill gap simplifying assumption real experience incorporating interesting subclass input constant factor secondary cost realistic machine model
Sjøberg gave many example empirical investigation software engineering Tichy observed Journals conference started devoted empirical work method
In software engineering well area experimental algorithm usability research scientific method practiced
He continued In summary question software research following scientific paradigm
The consensus clear science computing
stated In Simon went letter arguing famous book several field including economics computer science met traditional criterion science deserved called science even focal phenomenon opposed natural
Simon emphasized artifactual nature computer computation existence predicated task needed done
So reply would No computer science natural science
It artifactual artificial
continued thought Alan Turing drew dramatic attention artificiality system call Universal Turing Machine
This conceptual artifact emphasizes artificial nature computation
That software artifact seems obvious
Moreover strikingly complex artifact filled layer upon layer component exhibit dependency complex often unpredicted say unpredictable behavior
noted In Kari Rozenberg wrote excellent overview natural information process intersected computer science
conclusion The old lament computing dealt solely artificial information process went wayside
Gelenbe went arguing Evolution viewed computational process whose outcome seek continually optimize living specie condition environment specie share environment
He went give example computation inherent chemistry natural selection gene regulatory network neuronal system
Rosenbloom agreed The earlier emphasis computer may blinded u existence natural form computing
Now see various form computing already embodied example within living organism
Rosenbloom followed argument distinction natural artificial science two additional counterargument
First distinction natural artificial artificial increasingly meaningless
Second continually improving ability modify natural process finer level detail make increasingly difficult across board distinguish due human agency
Let u make another argument computer science natural science following Yaffe observation science work assumes law govern real world knowable comprehensible
We discover law learn use understand already happened currently going happen
This called
This focus prediction mirrored many author symposium raise question know computer science theory endure
Yaffe also said science reproducibility
Science trying discover thing universally true depend place time
The question arises would think computer science theory would
Why would experimental result reproducible
The source endurance reproducibility fact computer science artifact created human
Sjøberg emphasized software development human activity carried organization also human activity
Humans arbitrary rather behave create artifact structure deriving brain structure arose inherent psychological ability limitation arose biological process evolution arose organic chemical process arose fundamental physical process
Humans nature thus tool artifact nature
Rosenbloom concluded It time put final nail coffin computing true science study artificial rather natural phenomenon
Rosenbloom went If computing science fit traditional taxonomy physical life social science
Conceivably could sit within one three existing domain however core subject matter information transformation simply fit within domain
Instead laid length amount fourth domain full equal three
Computation science
As seen computer science part science
But emphasized beginning science
Computer science actually union three quite disparate perspective mathematical perspective scientific perspective engineering perspective
Consider term theory
In mathematical perspective theory collection mathematical object theorem object
Examples asymptotic complexity theory algorithm program verification theory programming language serializability theory database
In scientific perspective theory seen set coherent prediction empirically tested shown hold reality
In engineering perspective computer science attempt derive system algorithm language software engineering methodology better sense faster cheaper functional
As example McGeoch Moret mentioned four Dagstuhl workshop algorithm engineering
It quite awkward name discipline contains one three constituent perspective
So call part computer science espouses scientific perspective
early used term experimental computer science
McGeoch made distinction relies primarily observation algorithm realistic field experiment natural emphasizes systematic manipulation test parameter like laboratory experiment
Moret shared following I got sense colleague Europe felt empirical negative came mind something like experimental neutral positive brought mind something much systematic thorough
This perception really agree formal definition two word
His observation point back McGeoch characterization
Hence
Paul Cohen wrote book entitled discussing scientific methodology wide application
And McGeoch book published entitled
Sjøberg termed area work empirical software engineering empirical software research
Others used term design science
used term analytic stated abstraction modeling key making thing analytic
The term formal mathematical undertone may confused mathematical perspective
One major problem using either term empirical experimental engineering perspective utilizes experiment extensively judge improvement novel design methodology algorithm contrast science us instrument judge improvement rather understanding test proposed predictive theory follow Carlson dictum always fit theory fact never fact theory
One u prefers term science computer science science computation new word
mentioned performance modeling prediction exemplifying ideal science
elaborated two example within general area performance analysis
The first concern virtual memory hypothesis discussing substantial amount work many team culminating Denning Locality Theory
McGeoch Sjøberg also mentioned contribution
second example queueing network model specifically theory probability seeing given apportionment job among device system product series factor depending number job present given device parameter device
stated Kleinrock famous contribution recognition state space explosion could tamed Kleinrock independence assumption statistic traffic flowing network regenerated node using statistically identical independent variable
Little Law equation later emerged work law shown apply broad class queueing system extensively validated real system
Sjøberg enumerated many theory resulting empirical software research
Examples theory also called model Human Information Processing HIP model Model Personal Computer Utilization MPCU Technology Acceptance Model TAP Theory Planned Behavior TPB
Although origin within field software research successfully applied basis theory model proposed field
Examples theory theory program understanding comprehension theory coordination software engineering model inspection process model complexity delegation economic model business value development process
He also listed important result kind research Carefully controlled experiment shown skill level task complexity stronger predictor pair programming performance strong indication personality effect
Inspections consistently shown reduce error design pattern generally improve maintenance activity pattern also improve communication among beginner
Static across module interface effective reducing number error
Other scientific theory within computation include Cognitive Load Theory concerning application Fitts Law concerning mouse movement Manhattan World Theory concerning image analysis Theory applying algorithm Social Network Theory concerning graph encountered Facebook
Cuny raised challenge broadening participation computing argued high school critical point
High school place student see computing empowering discipline potential impact many aspect society
She stated existing AP CS course year Java programming appeal narrow group student
She noted National Science Teachers Association National Math Science Initiative partner effort increase participation
Both group imagine would enthusiastically support Andersen injunction choose math high school part least mathematical prerequisite understanding computing
This raise possibility emphasizing science perspective core part discipline computer science may increased interest discipline among high school student including underrepresented group
Carlson emphasized enterprise science accomplished presenting way intellectually stimulating emotionally compelling
McGeoch stated unequivocally I think general experimental methodology play role computer science education level
She went assert experimental algorithmics rich example project student
Sjøberg agreed empirical evaluation become natural part teaching curriculum undergraduate graduate level
By changing context introductory undergraduate class Guzdial argued explore scientific principle traditionally covered introduction computing
He continued These pretty deep fundamental idea come naturally Media Computation context student really engage part course
The point context explain student care principle
Rosenbloom gave several example computing specifically integration three great domain science could incorporated STEM education
And Bell went illustrating great idea computer science could communicated effectively even student young year old
We draw seven conclusion symposium
First question whether computer science science old field
It arose traditional scientist recognize computational process natural process
Even though much early energy field devoted building system understanding theoretical limit field developed two important scientific theory
The theory locality studied memory reference pattern computation theory performance evaluation validated queueing network model reliable performance prediction computer system
Second growing consensus today many issue studying complex experimental approach lead understanding
The symposium document advance algorithmics biology social networking software engineering cognitive science use empirical method answer important question
Third scientist many field recognize existence natural information process field
This settle early controversy said CS deal behavior artificial information process
CS compartment science artificial Herb Simon thought
CS indeed natural science
Fourth need alternative awkward term science computer science
None several option mentioned author yet universally accepted
Fifth exists core group scientific theory computation many area working add group
They hunger understanding rigorously tested theory could provide
Sixth information process pervasive field science computing necessarily involved field computational thinking accepted widely applicable approach
Many student selecting computer science major preserve flexibility choosing career field later
Finally computing presented science engaging middle high school student belying unfortunate prevalent notion computer science equal programming
A growing number STEM teacher embracing new method

The Object Oriented programming paradigm play important role human computer interface
It different component take real world object performs action making live interaction man machine
Following component OOPP This paradigm describes system interaction among real object
It model application group related object interact
The programming entity modeled class signifies collection related real world object
Programming start concept real world object class
Application divided numerous package
A package collection class
A class encapsulated group similar real world object
object share two characteristic They state behavior
Let u see following pictorial example understand Objects
In diagram object Dog state behavior
An object store information attribute discloses behavior method
Let u discus brief different component object oriented programming
Hiding implementation detail class user object method known data encapsulation
In object oriented programming bind code data together keep safe outside interference
The point software entity interact either single computer network known pubic interface
This help data security
Other object change state object interaction using method exposed outer world public interface
A class group object mutual method
It considered blueprint using object created
Classes passive communicate used instantiate object interact
Inheritance general term process acquiring property
In OOP one object inherit property another object
Polymorphism process using method name multiple class redefines method derived class
Object oriented interface unites user real world manipulating software object designing purpose
Let u see diagram
Interface design strive make successful accomplishment user goal help interaction task manipulation
While creating OOM interface design first analysis user requirement done
The design specifies structure component required dialogue
After interface developed tested Use Case

Solving problem core computer science
Programmers must first understand human solves problem understand translate algorithm something computer finally write specific syntax required computer get job done
It sometimes case machine solve problem completely different way human
Computer Programmers problem solver
In order solve problem computer must Know information data describing problem
Determine step information one representation another
A computer heart really dumb
It really know thing number character booleans list called array item
See Data Types
Everything else must approximated combination data type
A good programmer encode fact necessary represent problem variable See Variables
Further good way bad way encode information
Good way allow computer easily compute new information
An algorithm see Algorithm set specific step solve problem
Think way tell year old neice play favorite song piano assuming neice never played piano would tell piano sit bench open cover key press order press etc etc etc
The core good programmer able define step necessary accomplish goal
Unfortunately computer know restricted limited set possible step
For example computer add two number
But want find average two number beyond basic capability computer
To find average must Computer scientist like use fancy word Encapsulation show smart
This term thing human every day
It combined another fancy term Abstraction
Abstraction idea ignoring detail
For example forest really vastly complex ecosystem containing tree animal water path etc etc etc
But computer scientist normal person forest
For example professor need cup coffee asks single item Get cup coffee used encapsulation abstraction
The number step required actually get coffee enumerable
Including getting walking hall getting car driving coffee stand paying coffee etc etc etc
Further idea cup coffee abstract
Do bring mug coffee Styrofoam cup
Is caffeinated
Is freshly brewed concentrate
Does come Africa America
All information would quickly unable funciton remember detail
Thus abstract away detail remember important item
This brings u idea Complexity Hiding
Complexity hiding idea time detail matter
In computer program simple idea drawing square screen involves hundred thousand low level computer instruction
Again person could possible create interesting program every time wanted something correctly every one instruction
By ecapsulating meant draw square reusing operation make programming tractable
The idea behind encapsulation store information necessary particular idea set variable associated single object
We create function manipulate object regardless actual data
From point treat idea high level rather worry part data action function necessary represent object computer
Brute force technique solving problem relies computer speed fast repeat step solve problem
For example wanted know many time number go number could following Of course silly way computer human solve problem
The real way would When doubt often use brute force solve problem often save time least computer time think problem solve elegant manner

See Valiant research statement I think good summary The majority computational problem including explicit mathematical characterization problem fall within category question best compute little understood
These core problem remain fundamental mathematical challenge computer science
They related foundational question quantum physic notably polynomial time version Turing hypothesis
In major conceptual challenge remain controlling programming large parallel system whether multicore device chip highly distributed design algorithm device portable run efficiently wide class architectural design widely varying performance characteristic
A fundamental question characterize computational building block necessary cognition
A specific challenge build success machine learning cover broader issue intelligence
This requires particular reconciliation two contradictory characteristic apparent logical nature reasoning statistical nature learning
In widely open problem remains weak model computation cortex apparently offer support cognitive computation
broad set primitive operation computed robustly significant scale even weak model
A challenge different direction understanding Darwinian evolution evolve number generation population size apparently available earth
Darwin notion variation selection computational notion offer direct challenge quantitative analysis method computer science
What sought quantitative understanding possibility limitation basic Darwinian process

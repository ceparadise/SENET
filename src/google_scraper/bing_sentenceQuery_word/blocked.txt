In instance computer program executed
A process always exists exactly one
A process one waiting becoming available completion operation
In computer system individual must share resource system
Shared resource include CPU network network interface memory disk
When one task using resource generally possible desirable another task access
The technique used prevent concurrent use
When task blocked unable execute first task finished using shared resource
designed minimize effect blocking
A process block may prevent local progressing
In case blocking often seen wanted
However may instead assigned independent process halting one little effect others since scheduling continue
An example blocking passively waiting part polling spin loop part semantics channel
Correctly engineered may used implement reactive system
mean process pathologically wait circle
As directly associated blocking
Once event occurs process waiting blocked process advanced blocked state imminent one

What term block mean wrt computer science
I seen used multiple occassions never understood mean
Like blocking
Googling seem help much
Blocking mean program essentially asks Get data I wait ready
This contrast
There two flavor Get data I going go something else
Interrupt data ready
Get data I going go something else
I ask later yet
It important program block waiting data ca thing like respond mouse click repaint screen
This happening see program labeled Not Responding task manager
In summary mean process hang wait completes
cover passing focussing block progress program communication progress leaving system resource idle
When program make many operation mean processor spend almost time idle waiting operation complete Of course help much next step something data
Blocking simpler move obvious way You ca since involves setting object connection fed single multiplexor constantly look next thing come
Imagine two approach different thousand million connection
You choose one factor like For example problem blocking holding several thousand connection open one thread system like several thousand thread
But turn fairly complex issue
Read perception including PDF
In addition indicating programming context also mean
First meaning block easy computer science block source code computer language
For perl etc
curly bracket block code delimits block code
Python use indentation block
The second meaning used context operating system usually called kernel seen supreme manager manages resource
When different process thread ask system call resource CPU disk network memory resource may available due multiple competing thread process asking thing
The kernel put process thread suspension wait queue allowing process thread working resource execution state
The suspended process blocking state blocked
Blocking achieve either hardware software mechanism operating system
The running process also ask operating system suspend execution sleep command Shell perl

This handled process manager OS see First little
So process program execution
The first three letter program process probably clue something
Think process An abstraction sequence instruction executed processor processor may need service hardware device process time sharing executing device driver instruction process
make hardly sense understand process bit reading
A process contains A really important thing remember process program disk would file
Imagine recipe cake
Now cake recipe instruction making cake like program disk
The actual activity making cake process
The thing take away section OS collection process
The OS make computer productive switching CPU process
The thing normally cause process created The system call creates process known fork execve Unix Windows CreateProcess
These process called one process create another
This known parent process creating child process
There several reason process may terminated Things could become issue The OS table one entry per process
Each entry known PCB
Each entry The basic thing learn PCB info needed process stopped restarted
Note This diagram taken source material post available slide
All right reserved
The diagram fairly simple
You see actual switching process happening neither process executing CPU perform processing middle switching
The actual switching time vary around microsecond second millisecond The concept processing used far assumed single address space used every process single thread control
But multiple thread within one process
It possible think way You multiple process sharing one computer multiple thread sharing process
This would useful web browser example one thread receiving data network another display text
With web browser could one thread getting input user another thread autosaving
Imagine word processor single threaded You able type anything autosaving
Note On version powerpoint I type anything autosaving
It annoying
You might hear something called
This another way saying thread
So thread multiple flow control sharing one address space
Each one need program counter register value stack
Remember thread process share code section global variable network connection open file
You may heard
This multiple thread share process
Programs become responsive resource shared better
If part program blocked keep running
As IO CPU use shared thread process performance usually better
It economical There lot cost associated making process
Memory resource need allocated
Creating thread faster
There concern though I mentioned two thread share data
Therefore one thread might read location another writing need take care stop problem like
Implementing threading fast done user space
However OS aware meaning user level thread get blocked whole process blocked
This useful support multiprocessor dual core available
This OS schedule individual thread
However slow requires system call

In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within one process executing sharing resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share executable code value variable given time
Systems single processor generally implement multithreading CPU switch different
This generally happens often rapidly enough user perceive thread task running parallel
On system multiple thread execute every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously processor core separate software thread also executed concurrently separate hardware thread
Threads made early appearance MVT context called task
The term thread attributed
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Furthermore program threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort time slicing
Threads differ traditional operating system Systems said thread process operating system great difference except cost switch architecture notably result TLB flush
In one time
The opposite multithreading
While suggested term misleading term widely accepted within community
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context one process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied one process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread either cooperatively
On widely used approach finer grained control execution time via
However preemptive scheduling may context switch thread moment unanticipated programmer therefore causing
In contrast relies thread relinquish control execution thus ensuring thread
This create problem cooperatively multitasked thread waiting thread yielding control execution intensive computation
Until early desktop computer one CPU support although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
In added support processor name introduced processor introduced processor
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
Scheduling done kernel level user level multitasking done preemptively cooperatively
This yield variety related concept
At kernel level contains one share process resource memory file handle process unit resource thread unit scheduling execution
Kernel scheduling typically uniformly done preemptively le commonly cooperatively
At user level process schedule multiple thread execution
If share data Erlang usually analogously called process share data usually called particularly preemptively scheduled
Cooperatively scheduled user thread known different process may schedule user thread differently
User thread may executed kernel thread various way
The term variously refers user thread kernel mechanism scheduling user thread onto kernel thread
A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling creating destroying switching process relatively expensive
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory code data socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way see
Creating destroying process relatively expensive resource must acquired released
Processes typically preemptively multitasked process switching relatively expensive beyond basic cost due issue cache flushing
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including thus relatively cheap create destroy
Thread switching also relatively cheap requires context switch saving restoring register stack pointer change virtual memory thus leaving TLB valid
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor SMP system contend memory bus especially locking fine
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map one scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage used
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual processor
This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation support threading provide access native threading APIs operating system
Some usually programming language language expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
Several programming language language extension also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer fully MPI
Some language designed sequential parallelism instead especially using GPUs without requiring concurrency thread
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby Python support threading concurrency parallel execution thread due GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter simultaneously interpreting application code two thread effectively limit parallelism multiple core system
This limit performance mostly thread require processor much one
Other implementation interpreted programming language using Thread extension avoid GIL limit using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation Pthreads set library call
OS vendor free implement interface desired application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface multithreading like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
Multithreading library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free multithreading function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage set number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed array thread run parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel use GPU architecture

Could someone provide layman definition use case
Blocking mean caller wait callee finish processing
For instance blocking read socket wait data return read return indication usually count whether something read
You hear term mostly around APIs access resource necessarily require CPU attention instance
You also hear A call Thread A Thread B might designed block hold Thread A Thread B achieves relevant state process least accept request
The obvious example join usually mean I Thread A want wait Thread B terminated use exiting program
In simple word If call function stop program continuing run user performed action action program controlling call called blocking call

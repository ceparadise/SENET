field computer science artificial intelligence concerned interaction computer human natural language particular concerned programming computer fruitfully process large natural language data
Challenges natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition natural language understanding natural language generation
The history NLP generally started although work found earlier period
In published article titled proposed called criterion intelligence
The involved fully sixty Russian sentence English
The author claimed within three five year machine translation would solved problem
However real progress much slower found research failed fulfill expectation funding machine translation dramatically reduced
Little research machine translation conducted late first system developed
Some notably successful NLP system developed natural language system working restricted restricted vocabulary simulation written
Using almost information human thought emotion ELIZA sometimes provided startlingly interaction
When patient exceeded small knowledge base ELIZA might provide generic response example responding My head hurt Why say head hurt
During many programmer began write conceptual ontology structured information data

During time many written including
Up NLP system based complex set rule
Starting late however revolution NLP introduction algorithm language processing
This due steady increase computational power see gradual lessening dominance theory linguistics
whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged sort underlies approach language processing
Some machine learning algorithm produced system hard rule similar existing rule
However introduced use NLP increasingly research focused make soft decision based attaching weight feature making input data
The upon many system rely example statistical model
Such model generally robust given unfamiliar input especially input contains error common data produce reliable result integrated larger system comprising multiple subtasks
Many notable early success occurred field due especially work IBM Research successively complicated statistical model developed
These system able take advantage existing multilingual produced result law calling translation governmental proceeding official language corresponding system government
However system depended corpus specifically developed task implemented system often continues major limitation success system
As result great deal research gone method effectively learning limited amount data
Recent research increasingly focused algorithm
Such algorithm able learn data desired answer using combination annotated data
Generally task much difficult typically produce le accurate result given amount input data
However enormous amount data available including among thing entire content often make inferior result
In recent year flurry result showing technique achieving result many natural language task example language modeling parsing many others
Since statistical revolution late mid much Natural Language Processing research relied heavily
Formerly many task typically involved direct hand coding rule general robust natural language variation
The paradigm call instead using automatically learn rule analysis large typical example plural corpus set document possibly human computer annotation
Many different class machine learning algorithm applied NLP task
These algorithm take input large set feature generated input data
Some algorithm produced system hard rule similar system rule common
Increasingly however research focused make soft decision based attaching weight input feature
Such model advantage express relative certainty many different possible answer rather one producing reliable result model included component larger system
Systems based algorithm many advantage rule The following list commonly researched task NLP
Note task direct application others commonly serve subtasks used aid solving larger task
Though NLP task obviously closely intertwined frequently convenience subdivided category

historically family long history distinctive fully
Originally specified Lisp widespread use today
Only older one year
Lisp changed since early day many existed history
Today best known Lisp dialect
Lisp originally created practical influenced notation
It quickly became favored programming language AI research
As one earliest programming language Lisp pioneered many idea including
The name derives LISt Processor
one Lisp major Lisp made list
Thus Lisp program manipulate source code data structure giving rise system allow programmer create new syntax new embedded Lisp
The interchangeability code data give Lisp instantly recognizable syntax
All program code written parenthesized list
A function call syntactic form written list function operator name first argument following instance function take three argument would called
Lisp invented MIT
McCarthy published design paper entitled Recursive Functions Symbolic Expressions Their Computation Machine Part I
He showed simple operator notation function one build language algorithm
first AI language already included many concept recursion came used Lisp
McCarthy original notation used bracketed would translated
As example equivalent
Once Lisp implemented programmer rapidly chose use abandoned
surfaced attempt
Lisp first implemented computer
Russell read McCarthy paper realized McCarthy surprise Lisp function could implemented
The result working Lisp interpreter could used run Lisp program properly Lisp expression
Two became primitive operation decomposing list Contents Address part Register number Contents Decrement part Register number term register used mean memory register nowadays called memory location
etymology term
Lisp dialect still use operation return first item list rest list respectively
The first complete Lisp compiler written Lisp implemented Tim Hart Mike Levin MIT
This compiler introduced Lisp model incremental compilation compiled interpreted function intermix freely
The language used Hart Levin memo much closer modern Lisp style McCarthy earlier code
Lisp difficult system implement compiler technique stock hardware
routine developed graduate student made practical run Lisp computing system efficiency still problem
This led creation dedicated hardware running Lisp environment program
During great effort made unify work new Lisp dialect mostly successor like NIL New Implementation Lisp single language
The new language somewhat compatible dialect replaced book note compatibility various construct
In published Common Lisp standard ANSI Information Technology Programming Language Common Lisp
Since inception Lisp closely connected research community especially system
Lisp used implementation programming language used famous AI system
In AI research spawned commercial offshoot performance existing Lisp system became growing issue
Over history Lisp spawned many variation core theme language
Moreover given dialect may several instance dozen implementation
Differences dialect may quite instance Common Lisp us keyword name function Scheme us
Within dialect standardized however conforming implementation support core language different extension library
After declined somewhat Lisp recently experienced resurgence interest
Most new activity focused around implementation includes development new portable library application
Many new Lisp programmer inspired writer pursue language others considered antiquated
New Lisp programmer often describe language experience claim substantially productive language
This increase awareness may contrasted Lisp brief gain
Dan Weinreb list survey Common Lisp implementation eleven actively maintained Common Lisp implementation
Scieneer Common Lisp new commercial implementation forked CMUCL first release
The community created new supporting infrastructure wiki collect Common Lisp related information list resource lisp popular IRC channel allows sharing commenting code snippet support written Lisp collect content various blog user discus Lisp topic service announcing job offer weekly news service
hosting site open source Common Lisp project
library manager Common Lisp
year Lisp celebrated OOPSLA
There regular local user meeting Boston Vancouver Hamburg
Other event include European Common Lisp Meeting European Lisp Symposium International Lisp Conference
The Scheme community actively maintains
Several significant new implementation Chicken Gambit Gauche Ikarus Larceny Ypsilon developed last year
The Revised Report Algorithmic Language Scheme standard Scheme widely accepted Scheme community
The process created lot quasi standard library extension Scheme
User community individual Scheme implementation continue grow
A new language standardization process started led R RS Scheme standard
Academic use Scheme teaching computer science seems declined somewhat
Some university MIT longer using Scheme computer science introductory course
There several new dialect Lisp Lisp Flavored Erlang
represent two major stream Lisp development
These language embody significantly different design choice
successor
The primary influence Scheme
It many feature Lisp Machine Lisp large Lisp dialect used program designed efficiently implementable personal computer workstation
Common Lisp large language standard including many data type function macro language element well object system
Common Lisp also borrowed certain feature Scheme
Scheme statically scoped properly dialect Lisp programming language invented
It designed exceptionally clear simple semantics different way form expression
Designed decade earlier Common Lisp minimalist design
It much smaller set standard feature certain implementation feature full specified Common Lisp
A wide variety programming paradigm including imperative functional message passing style find convenient expression Scheme
Scheme continues evolve series standard Revised Report Algorithmic Language Scheme series
recent dialect Lisp principally target well CLR Ruby VM compiling
It designed pragmatic language
Clojure draw considerable influence place strong emphasis immutability
Clojure provides access Java framework library optional type hint call Java avoid reflection enable fast primitive operation
Further Lisp dialect used many application editor later Nyquist Scheme
The potential small size useful Scheme interpreter make particularly popular embedded scripting
Examples include successfully embedded image processor generic name
LIBREP Lisp interpreter John Harper originally based language embedded
Lisp first language structure program code represented faithfully directly standard data quality much later dubbed
Thus Lisp function manipulated altered even created within Lisp program without manipulation
This generally considered one main advantage language regard expressive power make language suitable syntactic macro
A conditional using syntax invented McCarthy Fortran context
He proposed inclusion made part specification
For Lisp McCarthy used general
took popularized
Lisp deeply influenced leader research team developed turn Lisp influenced Smalltalk later dialect adopting programming feature inheritance class encapsulating instance message passing etc

The object system introduced concept
The provides multiple inheritance multimethods yielding flexible powerful form
It served template many subsequent Lisp including object system often implemented via object system defined term Lisp second language Smalltalk still one language posse metaobject system
Many year later Alan Kay suggested result confluence feature Smalltalk Lisp could regarded properly conceived programming system
Lisp introduced concept system walk looking unused memory
Progress modern sophisticated garbage collection algorithm generational garbage collection stimulated use Lisp
lecture said Largely resource requirement respect early computing hardware including early microprocessor Lisp become popular outside community language
Because suitability complex dynamic application Lisp enjoying resurgence popular interest
Lisp
Unlike language distinction made expression code data written expression
When expression produce value Common Lisp possibly multiple value embedded expression
Each value data type
McCarthy paper introduced two type syntax sexps mirror internal representation code data express function
never found favor almost Lisps today use manipulate code data
The use parenthesis Lisp immediately obvious difference programming language family
As result student long given Lisp nickname
However syntax also responsible much Lisp power syntax extremely regular facilitates manipulation computer
However syntax Lisp limited traditional parenthesis notation
It extended include alternative notation
For example XMLisp Common Lisp extension employ integrate Extensible Markup Language
The reliance expression give language great flexibility
Because Lisp written list processed exactly like data
This allows easy writing program manipulate program
Many Lisp dialect exploit feature using macro system enables extension language almost without limit
A Lisp list written element separated surrounded parenthesis
For example list whose element three
These value implicitly typed respectively two integer data type called symbol declared
The empty list also represented special atom
This entity Lisp atom list
Expressions written list using
The first element list name function name macro lambda expression name special operator see
The remainder list argument
For example function return argument list expression evaluates list
The quote preceding example special operator return argument without evaluating
Any unquoted expression recursively evaluated enclosing expression evaluated
For example evaluates list
Note third argument list list nested
Arithmetic operator treated similarly
The expression evaluates
The equivalent would
Lisp notion operator implemented language
Arithmetic operator Lisp able take number argument
A increment operator sometimes implemented name giving syntax equivalent returning new value
Special operator sometimes called special form provide Lisp control structure
For example special operator take three argument
If first argument evaluates second argument otherwise evaluates third argument
Thus expression evaluates
Of course would useful expression substituted place
Lisp also provides logical operator
The operator return first nil argument respectively
evaluate James
Another special operator used bind variable value evaluated within expression
This operator also used create function argument list argument expression expression function evaluates returned value value last expression evaluated
The expression evaluates function applied take one argument bind return number one greater argument
Lambda expression treated differently named function invoked way
Therefore expression evaluates
Here function application execute anonymous function passing value
Named function created storing lambda expression symbol using macro
defines new function named global environment
It conceptually similar expression In original two fundamental atom list
A list finite ordered sequence element element either atom list atom symbol
A symbol essentially unique named item written string used either variable name data item
For example list contains three element symbol list number
The essential difference atom list atom immutable unique
Two atom appeared different place source code written exactly way represented object whereas list separate object could altered independently list could distinguished list comparison operator
As data type introduced later Lisp dialect evolved concept atom lost importance
Many dialect still retained predicate defining true object con
A Lisp list
Each cell list called Scheme composed two called
These respectively equivalent field discussed article
Of many data structure built con cell one basic called
A proper list either special empty list symbol con point datum may another con structure list point another proper list
If given con taken head linked list car point first element list cdr point rest list
For reason function also called referring con part linked list rather say tree
Thus Lisp list atomic object instance container class Java would
A list nothing aggregate linked con
A variable refers given list simply pointer first con list
Traversal list done list taking successive cdrs visit con list using several map function list
Because con list universal Lisp system common misconception Lisp data structure
In fact simplistic Lisps data structure vector hash table structure forth
Parenthesized represent linked list structure
There several way represent list
A con written car cdr
A longer proper list might written notation
This conventionally abbreviated
An improper list may written combination two list three con whose last cdr list fully specified form
Lisp provides many procedure accessing controlling list
Lists created directly procedure take number argument return list argument
Because way list constructed procedure used add element front list
Note procedure asymmetric handle list argument list constructed
The procedure appends two list one another
Because Lisp list linked list appending two list Lisp list simple linked list share structure one another
That say two list final sequence con
For instance execution following Common Lisp code list respectively
However tail structure list
It copy con cell pointing memory location list
Sharing structure rather copying give dramatic performance improvement
However technique interact undesired way function alter list passed argument
Altering one list replacing affect This change thereby also change possibly unexpected result
This source bug function alter argument documented reason
Aficionados avoid destructive function
In Scheme dialect favor functional style name destructive function marked cautionary exclamation point bang read replaces car con
In Common Lisp dialect destructive function commonplace equivalent named replace car
This function rarely seen however Common Lisp includes special facility make easier define use destructive function
A frequent style Common Lisp write code functionally without destructive call prototyping add destructive call optimization safe
Lisp evaluates expression entered user
Symbols list evaluate usually simpler expression instance symbol evaluates value variable name evaluates
However form evaluate entering Lisp return
Any expression also marked prevent evaluated necessary symbol list
This role special operator abbreviation one quotation mark
For instance usually entering symbol return value corresponding variable error variable
To refer literal symbol enter usually
Both Common Lisp Scheme also support operator termed Scheme entered character
This almost plain quote except allows expression evaluated value interpolated quoted list comma operator
If variable value evaluates evaluates
The backquote often used defining macro expansion
form quoted form Lisp equivalent literal
It may possible modify value mutable literal program code
For instance function return quoted form code call function modifies form may alter behavior function subsequent iteration
Modifying quoted form like generally considered bad style defined ANSI Common Lisp erroneous resulting undefined behavior compiled file coalesce similar constant put memory etc
Lisp formalization quotation noted others example idea
The Lisp family split use
lexical
Clojure Common Lisp Scheme make use static scoping default embedded language use dynamic scoping
Since version Emacs us dynamic lexical scoping
A fundamental distinction Lisp language Lisp textual representation program simply description internal data structure linked list symbol number character etc
would used underlying Lisp system
Lisp us implement powerful macro system
Like macro language macro return code compiled
However unlike C macro macro Lisp function exploit full power Lisp
Further Lisp code structure list macro built function language
In short anything Lisp data structure Lisp macro code
In contrast language parser output purely internal language implementation manipulated programmer
This feature make easy develop language within language
For example Common Lisp Object System implemented cleanly language extension using macro
This mean application need different inheritance mechanism use different object system
This stark contrast language example Java support multiple inheritance reasonable way add
In simplistic Lisp implementation list structure directly run program function literally piece list structure traversed interpreter executing
However substantial Lisp system also include compiler
The compiler translates list structure machine code execution
This code run fast code compiled conventional language Macros expand compilation step thus offer interesting option
If program need precomputed table macro might create table compile time compiler need output table need call code create table run time
Some Lisp implementation even mechanism allows code present compile time macro would need present emitted module
Lisp language often used interactive may combined IDE
The user type expression command line directs IDE transmit Lisp system
Lisp entered expression result
For reason Lisp command line called
The basic operation REPL follows
This simplistic description omits many element real Lisp quoting macro
The function accepts textual input par internal data structure
For instance type text prompt translates linked list three element symbol number number
It happens list also valid piece Lisp code evaluated
This car list name addition operation
Note read single symbol
read number one hundred
read string
The function evaluates data returning zero Lisp data result
Evaluation mean interpretation Lisp system compile every expression native machine code
It simple however describe evaluation interpretation To evaluate list whose car name function first evaluates argument given cdr applies function argument
In case function addition applying argument list yield answer
This result evaluation
The symbol evaluates value symbol foo
Data like string evaluates string
The list evaluates list
It job function represent output user
For simple result trivial
An expression evaluated piece list structure would require traverse list print
To implement Lisp REPL necessary implement three function function
Naturally implementation complex since must also implement special operator like
This done basic REPL one line code
The Lisp REPL typically also provides input editing input history error handling interface debugger
Lisp usually evaluated
In argument evaluated innermost order argument undefined leaving room optimization compiler
Lisp originally control structure many added language evolution
Lisp original conditional operator precursor later structure
Programmers Scheme dialect often express loop using
Scheme commonality academic computer science led student believe tail recursion common way write iteration Lisp incorrect
All Lisp dialect iteration construct Scheme loop complex expression
Moreover key issue make objective rather subjective matter Scheme make specific requirement handling thus reason use tail recursion generally encouraged Scheme practice expressly supported language definition
By contrast ANSI Common Lisp require optimization commonly termed tail call elimination
Thus fact tail recursive style casual replacement use traditional construct discouraged Common Lisp matter stylistic preference potentially one efficiency since apparent tail call Common Lisp may compile simple program correctness since tail recursion may increase stack use Common Lisp risking
Some Lisp control structure equivalent language syntactic keywords
Expressions using operator surface appearance function call differ argument necessarily case iteration expression may evaluated
In contrast major programming language Lisp allows implementing control structure using language
Several control structure implemented Lisp macro even programmer want know work
Both Common Lisp Scheme operator control flow
The difference operator deepest difference two dialect
Scheme support using procedure allows program save later restore particular place execution
Common Lisp support continuation support several way handling escape continuation
Often algorithm expressed Lisp either imperative functional style
As noted Scheme tends favor functional style using tail recursion continuation express control flow
However imperative style still quite possible
The style preferred many Common Lisp programmer may seem familiar programmer used structured language C preferred Schemers closely resembles language
Because Lisp early heritage list processing wide array function relating iteration sequence
In many case explicit loop would needed language like loop C Lisp task accomplished function
The true many functional programming language
A good example function Scheme called Common Lisp called
Given function one list applies function successively list element order collecting result new list This applies function corresponding pair list element yielding result
Here example Common Lisp code
The basic program Lisp syntax lends naturally recursion
Mathematical problem enumeration recursively defined set simple express notation
Evaluate number An alternative implementation take le stack space previous version underlying Lisp system optimizes Contrast iterative version us macro The following function revers list
Lisp function thing

Just human use language communicate different region different language computer also language specific
Different kind language developed perform different type work computer
Basically language divided two category according computer understands
There also type language include These language mutually exclusive language belong multiple category
The term also open interpretation language considered considered language continued develop
computer language either machine code close
A computer understand instruction given language English
It understand execute instruction given form machine language
binary
There two type language Machine language lowest elementary level programming language first type programming language developed
Machine language basically language computer understand usually written hex
In fact manufacturer design computer obey one language machine code represented inside computer string binary digit bit
The symbol stand absence electric pulse stand presence electric pulse
Since computer capable recognizing electric signal understands machine language
Assembly language developed overcome many inconvenience machine language
This another important language operation code operand given form alphanumeric symbol instead l
These alphanumeric symbol known mnemonic code combine maximum combination
ADD addition SUB subtraction START LABEL etc
Because feature assembly language also known Symbolic Programming Language
This language also difficult need lot practice master little English support language
Mostly assembly language used help compiler orientation
The instruction assembly language converted machine code language translator executed computer
computer language use format similar English
The purpose developing language enable people write program easily native language environment English
language basically symbolic language use English word mathematical symbol rather mnemonic code
Each instruction language translated many machine language instruction computer understand
Many language developed achieving variety different task
Some fairly specialized others quite general
These language categorized according use These language oriented towards computational procedure solving mathematical statistical problem
Examples include These language best able maintain data processing procedure problem involved handling file
Some example include These used string manipulation including search pattern inserting deleting character
Examples In OOP computer program divided object
Examples These programming language designed building This resource used help write article

There hundred programming language use today
How know one learn first
How know one best IT field choice
Well I ca answer question
But start learning one top popular one
That way always able get job IT industry
Learning programming language easy rewarding
You lot question first
Just remember get help need
You find answer almost everything Google nowadays excuse failure
Also remember take year become expert programmer
Do expect get good overnight
Just keep learning something new every day eventually competent enough get job done This article cover top popular programming language ranked June
I added general review comment language listed
Remember personal opinion
Other IT professional might different opinion
us released Sun Microsystems
Java number one programming language today many reason
First language strong library reusable software component
Second program written Java run many different computer architecture operating system use JVM Java
Sometimes referred code even WORA write run anywhere
Third Java language likely taught university computer science class
A lot computer science theory book written past decade use Java code example
So learning Java good idea even never actually code
Java Strengths WORA popularity Java Weaknesses Slower natively compiled language compiled developed use UNIX operating system
Although designed portable nature C program must specifically compiled computer different architecture operating system
This help make lightning fast
Although C relatively old language still widely used system programming writing programming language embedded system
Strengths Speed Weaknesses Memory management difficult master compiled written update C Bjarne Stroustrup
It attempt C brings help larger project
Despite age used create wide array application game office suite
Strengths Speed Weaknesses older considered clumsy newer language Java C
us language originally developed create dynamic web page
At first even real programming language time eventually grew fully featured programming language
Although PHP much criticized past bit sloppy insecure pretty good since version came
It hard argue success
Today PHP popular language used write web application
Even English IT program currently using written PHP Strengths Web programming good documentation Weaknesses Inconsistent many way thing history bizarre security decision interpreted language developed Microsoft Corporation Windows platform
It evolving year seen direct descendant Microsoft old BASIC
Visual Basic good language scripting Windows application need power speed C
Strengths None
Weaknesses Only run Windows interpreted programming language written late intended general programming purpose
Python named snake actually Monty Python comedy group
Python characterized use indentation readability encouragement making developer similar thing similar way
Python used main programming choice Google Ubuntu
Strengths Excellent readability overall philosophy Weaknesses None compiled language written Microsoft
It open specification rarely seen platform
C conceived Microsoft premium language
It similar Java syntax nature
Strengths Powerful pretty fast Weaknesses Only really suitable Windows interpreted language
A strange one
Despite name nothing whatsoever Java
You rarely ever see language outside web browser
It basically language meant script behavior web browser used thing web form validation AJAX style web application
The trend future seems building complex application JavaScript even simple online game office suite
The success trend depend upon advancement speed browser JavaScript interpreter
If want correct real name programming language although almost nobody actually call
Strengths reliable way web programming Weaknesses really useful web browser interpreted language written
It characterized somewhat disorganized syntax make sense PERL programmer However lot veteran programmer love use every day primary language
year ago Perl popular today
What happened
A lot newer programmer even old Perl programmer switched language PHP Python Ruby
Perl perhaps still best language text processing system administration scripting
I personally recommend however primary programming language
Strengths text processing system administration Weaknesses strange syntax perhaps many way thing interpreted language written around
It one language world
Everything object Ruby even letter number method call
It great language learn love object
The negative love make bit slow even interpreted language
Strengths Perhaps world language Weaknesses superior object model come price namely speed Okay
Those top programming language use today personal comment
Remember opinion like nose everyone one smell If disagree please feel free email write opinion forum
Which programming language already know
Which one want learn
Why
Which language think best making banking software

The Scrum framework like foundation wall building
You ignore fundamentally change value principle practice without risking collapse
What however customize inside structure Scrum adding fixture feature process work
To understand make version Scrum uniquely must first firm grasp Scrum framework principle planning occurs every level
Scrum development team consist least three role ScrumMaster product owner development team

We however mistake going fast hurried
This say Scrum better sequential waterfall development
It however often appropriate tool solving complex problem
Many believe Scrum take planning
This true
When developing product Scrum planning happens multiple level time
Although Scrum formally defines daily sprint planning organization benefit planning release product portfolio level well
Portfolio planning help determine product work order long
Although portfolio planning conceptually higher level product planning deal collection product one primary input newly envisioned product idea product planning
The goal product planning envisioning capture essence potential product create rough plan creation product
Envisioning begin product vision end initial version product backlog
Many company also find helpful build product roadmap communicates incremental nature product built delivered time along important factor define individual release
Release planning making scope date budget incremental delivery
On development effort sensible initial release planning envisioning starting first sprint associated release Don fooled fallacy agile mean planning
Successful Scrum development project require multiple interrelated planning activity
Once understand underlying foundation Scrum discover path forward
Don wait get Scrum perfect start
You
Instead learn inspect adapt way forward based organization unique goal culture complex environment operate

process producing detailed
This data model contains needed logical physical design choice physical storage parameter needed generate design used create database
A fully attributed data model contains detailed attribute entity
The term database design used describe many different part design overall
Principally correctly thought logical design base data structure used store data
In
In entity relationship map directly object class named relationship
However term database design could also used apply overall process designing base data structure also form query used part overall database application within DBMS
The process database design generally consists number step carried database designer
Usually designer must Within final step generally broken two step determining grouping information within system generally determining basic object information stored determining relationship group information object
This step necessary
In majority case person design database person expertise area database design rather expertise domain data stored drawn
financial information biological information etc
Therefore data stored database must determined cooperation person expertise domain aware data must stored within system
This process one generally considered part requires skill part database designer elicit needed information domain knowledge
This necessary domain knowledge frequently express clearly system requirement database unaccustomed thinking term discrete data element must stored
Data stored determined Requirement Specification
Once database designer aware data stored within database must determine dependency within data
Sometimes data changed changing data visible
For example list name address assuming situation multiple people address one person one address address dependent upon name
When provided name list address uniquely determined however inverse hold given address list name uniquely determined multiple people reside address
Because address determined name address considered dependent name
NOTE A common misconception called stating relationship data element therein
This true
The relational model named based upon mathematical structure known
Once relationship dependency amongst various piece information determined possible arrange data logical structure mapped storage object supported
In case storage object store data row column
In storage object correspond directly object used used write application manage access data
The relationship may defined attribute object class involved method operate object class
The way mapping generally performed set related data depends upon single object whether real abstract placed table
Relationships dependent object stored link various object
Each table may represent implementation either logical object relationship joining one instance one logical object
Relationships table may stored link connecting child table parent
Since complex logical relationship table probably link one parent
Database design also include ER diagram
An ER diagram diagram help design database efficient way
Attributes ER diagram usually modeled oval name attribute linked entity relationship contains attribute
Relational Database In field design systematic way ensuring database structure suitable querying free certain undesirable update deletion anomaly could lead loss
A standard piece database design guidance designer create fully normalized design selective subsequently performed reason
However modeling discipline approach design explicitly recommend design
design large part adhere
Normalization consists normal form NF Schema refinement database specifies data normalized reduce data insufficiency conflict
The physical design database specifies physical configuration database storage medium
This includes detailed specification option parameter residing DBMS
It detailed design system includes module database hardware software specification system

Ontology Ling Liu Tamer Eds
ontology semantic data model ontological engineering In context computer information science defines set representational primitive model domain knowledge discourse
The representational primitive typically class set attribute property relationship relation among class member
The definition representational primitive include information meaning constraint logically consistent application
In context database system ontology viewed level abstraction data model analogous hierarchical relational model intended modeling knowledge individual attribute relationship individual
Ontologies typically specified language allow abstraction away data structure implementation strategy practice language ontology closer expressive power logic language used model database
For reason ontology said semantic level whereas database schema model data logical physical level
Due independence lower level data model ontology used integrating heterogeneous database enabling interoperability among disparate system specifying interface independent service
In technology stack Semantic Web standard ontology called explicit layer
There standard language variety commercial open source tool creating working ontology
The term ontology come field philosophy concerned study existence
In philosophy one talk theory nature existence Aristotle ontology offer primitive category substance quality presumed account All That Is
In computer information science ontology technical term denoting artifact purpose enable modeling knowledge domain real imagined
The term adopted early Artificial Intelligence AI researcher recognized applicability work mathematical logic argued AI researcher could create new ontology computational model enable certain kind automated reasoning
In AI community came use term ontology refer theory modeled world Physics component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early effort create interoperability standard identified technology stack called ontology layer standard component knowledge system
A widely cited web page paper associated effort credited deliberate definition ontology technical term computer science
The paper defines ontology explicit specification conceptualization turn object concept entity presumed exist area interest relationship hold among
While term specification conceptualization caused much debate essential point definition ontology One objection definition overly broad allowing range specification simple glossary logical theory couched predicate calculus
But hold true data model complexity example relational database single table column still instance relational data model
Taking pragmatic view one say ontology tool product engineering thereby defined use
From perspective matter use ontology provide representational machinery instantiate domain model knowledge base make query service represent result calling service
For example API search service might offer textual glossary term formulate query would act
On hand Semantic Web standard suggests specific formalism encoding ontology OWL several variant vary expressive power
This reflects intent specification abstract data model domain conceptualization independent particular form
Ontology discussed applied context software database engineering yet theoretical grounding well
specifies vocabulary make assertion may input output knowledge agent software program
As ontology provides language communicating agent
An agent supporting interface required use term ontology knowledge
Nonetheless definition formal constraint ontology put restriction stated language
In essence committing ontology
supporting interface using ontology vocabulary requires statement asserted input output definition constraint ontology
This analogous requirement row database table insert statement SQL must consistent integrity constraint stated declaratively independently internal data format
Similarly ontology must formulated representation language intended semantic level specification independent data modeling strategy implementation
For instance conventional database model may represent identity individual using primary key assigns unique identifier individual
However primary key identifier artifact modeling process denote something domain
Ontologies typically formulated language closer expressive power logical formalism predicate calculus
This allows ontology designer able state semantic constraint without forcing particular encoding strategy
For example typical ontology formalism one would able say individual member class attribute value without referring implementation pattern use primary key identifier
Similarly ontology one might represent constraint hold across relation simple declaration A subclass B might encoded join foreign key relational model
concerned making representational choice capture relevant distinction domain highest level abstraction still clear possible meaning term
As form data modeling knowledge skill required
The heritage computational ontology philosophical ontology rich body theory make ontological distinction systematic coherent manner
For example many insight formal ontology motivated understanding real world applied building computational ontology world data
When ontology encoded standard formalism also possible reuse large previously designed ontology motivated systematic account human knowledge language
In context ontology embody result academic research offer operational method put theory practice database system
Ontologies part standard stack Semantic Web used specify standard conceptual vocabulary exchange data among system provide service answering query publish reusable knowledge base offer service facilitate interoperability across multiple heterogeneous system database
The key role ontology respect database system specify data modeling representation level abstraction specific database design logical physical data exported translated queried unified across independently developed system service
Successful application date include database interoperability cross database search integration web service

The majority attribute particular entity
For example occurrence Staff entity single value staffNo attribute therefore staffNo attribute referred
An attribute represents value derivable value related attribute set attribute necessarily entity
Some attribute may related particular entity
For example age pet derivable form date birth DOB attribute therefore age DOB attribute related
We refer age attribute derived attribute value derived DOB attribute
Age normally stored database would updated regularly
On hand date birth never change age derived date date birth stored instead age derived DOB attribute needed
Having identifies entity next step identify relationship exist entity
A relationship set association participating entity
As entity association uniquely identifiable within set
A uniquely identifiable association called relationship occurrence Clinic Has Veterinary Registers Pet Schedules Appointment IsContactedBy PetOwner Veterinary Performs Examination PetOwner Owns Pet Pays Invoice Attends Appointment Pet Undergoes Examination Attends Appointment Cardinality degree concern number instance involved relationship

Provide printout SQL code query output produced run query database developed
Query Question Display name address branch Petcare name veterinary doctor working branch
Any specialism veterinary doctor also show
Using SQL Code SELECT AS Branches Name AS Branches Address AS Veterinary Doctor Name AS Veterinary Specialism FROM clinic INNER JOIN veterinary ON The Result Using Query Designer The Result Query Question Display appointment whole Petcare organization
This ordered date
The result display branch appointment name veterinary doctor appointment date time appointment name animal appointment type animal breed animal
Using SQL code SELECT AS Branches Name AS Veterinary Doctor Name AS Appointment Date AS Appointment Time AS Pet Name AS Pet Type AS Pet Breed FROM appointment INNER JOIN clinic ON INNER JOIN veterinary ON AND INNER JOIN pet ON AND ORDER BY Appointment Date The Result Using Query Designer The Result Explain assumption made analyzing designing implementing database justify approach taken explain alternative approach could taken task
Discuss change would make improve work
This step concerned identifying candidate key entity selecting one primary key
In process identifying primary key note whether entity strong weak
In trying identify candidate key I observe clinic number Clinic entity veterinary number veterinary entity invoice number Invoice entity unique entire practice
On hand owner number PetOwner entity pet number Pet entity unique particular clinic
It uncommon company give different office degree local autonomy
However centralized database system sometimes appropriate uniqueness throughout company
In discussion PetCare management agreed number allocated across entire practice opposed branch
If decision would necessary add clinic number number unique within clinic gain uniqueness across practice
With mind I identify primary key foreign key
At point I logical data model Petcare
However data model may contain redundancy removed
More I relationship
Remove redundant relationship
relationship There number relationship PetOwner Pet Clinic Appointment closer examination useful identify redundant relationship
First note entity mandatory participation relationship PetOwner may many pet
Therefore given Appointment identify Owner POAttends relationship identify Pet Owns relationship
However given Appointment identify Pet PAttends relationship given Pet identify PetOwner Owns relationship suggests POAttends relationship redundant
In similar way PAttends relationship identify Pet Registers relationship identify Clinic involved Appointment suggests Schedules relationship also redundant
Note IsContactedBy relationship Clinic PetOwner also appears redundant
However PetCare note detail pet owner first make contact obtains detail pet first appointment IsContactedBy relationship retained
Business rule constraint I impose order protect database becoming inconsistent
Of six type business rule four identified previous step documented
I consider remaining two referential integrity business rule
There two issue consider Identify whether null allowed foreign key
In general participation child table relationship mandatory strategy null allowed
On hand participation child table optional null allowed
Identify existence constraint foreign key may inserted updated deleted
In general involves specifying two action foreign key ON UPDATE action ON DELETE action
Finally consider whether type constraint PetCare covered elsewhere data model
Such constraint generally called business rule
Foreign Key veterinary reference Staff veterinaryNo ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE NO ACTION Foreign Key clinicNo reference Clinic clinicNo ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE NO ACTION Foreign Key clinicNo reference Clinic clinicNo ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE NO ACTION Foreign Key ownerNo reference Owner ownerNo ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE Foreign Key clinicNo reference Clinic clinicNo ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE NO ACTION Foreign Key petNo reference Pet petNo ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE Foreign Key staffNo reference Staff staffNo ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE NO ACTION Foreign Key ownerNo reference Owner ownerNo ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE NO ACTION Foreign Key examNo reference Examination examNo ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE NO ACTION Foreign Key petNo reference Pet petNo ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE The logical database design complete fully documented
At point review logical data model supporting documentation user
We assume identify major design
This completes logical database design methodology Petcare
During logical database design produced design number base table represent entity relationship logical data model
This included description table attribute primary alternate foreign key integrity constraint attribute domain optional default value whether hold null whether derived
The design base table also included definition domain default value null indicator
For example Pet table Petcare may produce design using extended Database Design Language DBDL

In technique arranging complexity computer system
It work establishing level complexity person interacts system suppressing complex detail current level
The programmer work idealized interface usually well defined add additional level functionality would otherwise complex handle
For example programmer writing code involves numerical operation may interested way number represented underlying hardware
whether detail suppressed said leaving simply programmer work
In addition task sending email message across continent would extremely complex programmer start piece fiber optic cable basic hardware component
By using layer complexity created abstract away physical cable network layout presenting programmer virtual data channel task manageable
Abstraction apply control data abstraction action
The notion programming viewed way combine abstraction data code
The abstract definition used common family object different implementation behavior share meaning
The mechanism programming used define common interface
The recommendation programmer use abstraction whenever suitable order avoid duplication usually known
The requirement programming language provide suitable abstraction also called abstraction principle
Computing mostly operates independently concrete world The hardware implement interchangeable others
The software structured enable human create enormous system concentrating issue time
These architecture made specific choice abstraction
architecture inevitable complex
A central form abstraction computing language abstraction new artificial language developed express specific aspect system
help planning
processed computer
An example abstraction process generational development
Each stage used stepping stone next stage
The language abstraction continues example
Within programming language feature let programmer create new abstraction
These include
Some abstraction remain invisible operate design system
Some abstraction try limit range concept programmer need aware completely hiding abstraction turn built
The software engineer writer criticised effort claiming abstraction never completely hide detail however negate usefulness abstraction
Some abstraction designed interoperate abstraction example programming language may contain making call language
Different programming language provide different type abstraction depending intended application language
For example Analysts developed various method formally specify software system
Some known method include Specification language generally rely abstraction one kind another since specification typically defined earlier project abstract level eventual implementation
The specification language example allows definition class waterfall project remain abstract architecture specification phase project
Programming language offer control abstraction one main purpose use
Computer machine understand operation low level moving bit one location memory another location producing sum two sequence bit
Programming language allow done higher level
For example consider statement written fashion To human seems fairly simple obvious calculation
However step necessary carry evaluation return value assign value variable actually quite subtle complex
The value need converted binary representation often much complicated task one would think calculation decomposed compiler interpreter assembly instruction much le intuitive programmer operation shifting binary register left adding binary complement content one register another simply human think abstract arithmetical operation addition multiplication
Finally assigning resulting value variable labeled used later involves additional step looking variable label resultant location physical virtual memory storing binary representation memory location etc
Without control abstraction programmer would need specify step time simply wanted add multiply couple number assign result variable
Such duplication effort two serious negative consequence Structured programming involves splitting complex program task smaller piece clear interface component reduction complexity potential
In simple program may aim ensure loop single obvious exit point possible single exit point function procedure
In larger system may involve breaking complex task many different module
Consider system handle payroll ship shore office These layer produce effect isolating implementation detail one component assorted internal method others
programming embrace extends concept
Data abstraction enforces clear separation property detail implementation
The abstract property visible client code make use data data concrete implementation kept entirely private indeed change example incorporate efficiency improvement time
The idea change supposed impact client code since involve difference abstract behaviour
For example one could define called uniquely associate value may retrieved specifying corresponding key
Such lookup table may implemented various way even simple linear key value pair
As far client code concerned abstract property type case
Of course relies getting detail interface right first place since change major impact client code
As one way look interface form agreed behaviour data type client code anything spelled contract subject change without notice
In theory involves facility define object represent abstract actor perform work report change state communicate object system
The term refers hiding detail extending concept earlier programming language associate strongly data standardizing way different data type interact beginning
When abstraction proceeds operation defined enabling object different type substituted called
When proceeds opposite direction inside type class structuring simplify complex set relationship called
Various programming language offer similar facility abstraction support general strategy programming includes substitution one another similar role
Although generally supported image package may predetermine great many
This would leave minimum binding change
example feature le distinction use delegation
Individual object function abstracted flexibly better fit shared functional heritage
exemplifies another extreme relies heavily static binding turn certain flexibility problem
Although example offer alternate strategy achieving abstraction fundamentally alter need support abstract noun code programming relies ability abstract verb function noun data structure either process
Consider example sample fragment represent common farm animal level abstraction suitable model simple aspect hunger feeding
It defines class represent state animal function With definition one could create object type call method like In example class abstraction used place actual animal abstraction case generalisation
If one requires differentiated hierarchy animal differentiate say provide milk provide nothing except meat end life intermediary level abstraction probably DairyAnimal cow goat would eat food suitable giving good milk MeatAnimal pig steer would eat food give best
Such abstraction could remove need application coder specify type food could concentrate instead feeding schedule
The two class could related using stand alone programmer could define varying degree two type
These facility tend vary drastically language general achieve anything possible others
A great many operation overload data type data type effect degree inheritance mean achieve polymorphism
The class notation simply coder convenience
Decisions regarding abstract keep control coder become major concern design determining relevant relationship real world concern
In general determine appropriate abstraction one must make many small decision scope domain analysis determine system one must cooperate legacy analysis perform detailed analysis expressed within project time budget constraint design
In simple example domain barnyard live pig cow eating habit legacy constraint detailed analysis coder must flexibility feed animal available thus reason code type food class design single simple Animal class pig cow instance function
A decision differentiate DairyAnimal would change detailed analysis domain legacy analysis would entirely control programmer refer abstraction programming distinct abstraction domain legacy analysis
When discussing refers act considering le detailed safe definition observed program behavior
For instance one may observe final result program execution instead considering intermediate step execution
Abstraction defined precise model execution
Abstraction may respect property one answer question property equally well concrete abstract model
For instance wish know result evaluation mathematical expression involving integer worth need perform operation modulo familiar form abstraction
Abstractions however though necessarily
That possible get sound answer though abstraction may simply yield result
For instance may abstract student class minimal maximal age one asks whether certain person belongs class one may simply compare person age minimal maximal age age lie outside range one may safely answer person belong class one may answer I know
The level abstraction included programming language influence overall
The framework includes concept formalism
This framework allows designer programming language study abstraction characteristic design change abstraction influence language usability
Abstractions prove useful dealing computer program property computer program essentially see
As consequence automatic method deriving information behavior computer program either drop termination occasion may fail crash never yield result soundness may provide false information precision may answer I know question
Abstraction core concept
generally take place abstract version studied system
Computer science commonly present le commonly abstraction wherein level represents different model information process varying amount detail
Each level us system expression involving unique set object composition apply particular domain
Each relatively abstract higher level build relatively concrete lower level tends provide increasingly granular representation
For example gate build electronic circuit binary gate machine language binary programming language machine language application operating system programming language
Each level embodied determined level beneath making language description somewhat
Since many user database system lack familiarity computer database developer often hide complexity following level The lowest level abstraction describes system actually store data
The physical level describes complex data structure detail
The next higher level abstraction describes data database store relationship exist among data
The logical level thus describes entire database term small number relatively simple structure
Although implementation simple structure logical level may involve complex physical level structure user logical level need aware complexity
This referred
must decide information keep database use logical level abstraction
The highest level abstraction describes part entire database
Even though logical level us simpler structure complexity remains variety information stored large database
Many user database system need information instead need access part database
The view level abstraction exists simplify interaction system
The system may provide many database
The ability provide different level abstraction use
Some specifically generate design contain various level abstraction
Layered architecture partition concern application stacked group layer
It technique used designing computer software hardware communication system network component isolated layer change made one layer without affecting others

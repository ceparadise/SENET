Follow u As probably noticed live world defined three spatial dimension one dimension time
In word take three number pinpoint physical location given moment
On coordinate break longitude latitude altitude representing dimension length width height depth
Slap time stamp coordinate pinpointed time well
To strip even world would like single bead measured thread
You slide bead forward slide bead backward need one number figure exact location string length
Where bead

Now let upgrade world
This essentially flat map like playing field game Battleship chess
You need length width determine location
In Battleship say know location convergence horizontal E line vertical line
Now let add one dimension
Our world factor height depth equation locating submarine exact location Battleship requires two number submarine would demand third coordinate depth
Sure might charging along surface might also hiding foot meter beneath wave
Which
Could fourth spatial dimension
Well tricky question currently ca perceive measure anything beyond dimension length width height
Just three number required pinpoint location world world would require four
At moment likely positioned particular longitude latitude altitude
Walk little left alter longitude latitude
Stand chair exact spot alter altitude
Here get hard Can move current location without altering longitude latitude altitude
You ca fourth spatial dimension u move
But fact ca move fourth spatial dimension perceive one necessarily rule existence
In mathematician Theodor Kaluza theorized fourth spatial dimension might link general relativity electromagnetic theory source
But would go
Theoretical physicist Oskar Klein later revised theory proposing fourth dimension merely curled three spatial dimension extended
In word fourth dimension rolled unseen little like fully retracted tape measure
Furthermore would mean every point world would additional fourth spatial dimension rolled away inside
String theorist however need slightly complicated vision empower superstring theory cosmos
In fact quite easy assume showing bit proposing dimension including time
Wait let blow mind yet
One way envisioning imagine point world contains retracted tape measure geometric shape
One example shape look bit like cross mollusk

Think way A concrete wall look solid firm distance
Move closer however see dimple hole mark surface
Move even closer see made molecule
Or consider cable From distance appears single thick strand
Get right next find woven countless strand
There always greater complexity meet eye hidden complexity may well conceal tiny dimension
Yet remain certain three spatial dimension one time

In simply consisting collection identified least one
An array stored position element computed index mathematical formula
The simplest type data structure linear array also called array
For example array integer variable index may stored memory address element index address
The memory address first element array called first address foundation address
Because mathematical concept represented grid array also sometimes called matrix
In case term vector used computing refer array although rather correctly mathematical equivalent
Arrays often used implement especially word sometimes used synonym
Arrays among oldest important data structure used almost every program
They also used implement many data structure
They effectively exploit addressing logic computer
In modern computer many device memory array word whose index address
especially often optimized array operation
Arrays useful mostly element index computed
Among thing feature allows single iterative process arbitrarily many element array
For reason element array data structure required size use data representation
The set valid index tuples address element hence element addressing formula usually always fixed array use
The term often used mean kind provided consists collection value variable selected one index computed
Array type often implemented array structure however language may implemented data structure
The term also used especially description mean abstract array model ADT intended capture essential property array
Arrays better cache locality compared
The first digital computer used programming set access array structure data table vector matrix computation many purpose
wrote first program building
Array indexing originally done later using
Some mainframe designed successor used perform checking hardware
Assembly language generally special support array machine provides
The earliest programming language including support array
In class template exist array whose dimension fixed runtime well array
Arrays used implement mathematical well kind rectangular table
Many small large consist include array whose element
Arrays used implement data structure list
implementation data structure frequently simple requiring little space may poor space complexity particularly modified compared data structure compare
One large array sometimes used emulate particularly allocation
Historically sometimes way allocate dynamic memory portably
Arrays used determine partial complete program compact alternative otherwise repetitive multiple statement
They known context used conjunction purpose built interpreter whose altered according value contained array
The array may contain relative subroutine number acted upon statement direct path execution
When data object stored array individual object selected index usually
Indexes also called subscript
An index array value stored object
There three way element array indexed Arrays multiple dimension thus uncommon access array using multiple index
For example array three row four column might provide access element row column expression case indexing system
Thus two index used array three array array
The number index needed specify element called dimension dimensionality array
In standard array index restricted certain range consecutive integer consecutive value address element computed linear formula index
A array single dimension array type linear array
Accessing element involves single subscript either represent row column index
As example consider C declaration Syntax datatype anArrayname sizeofArray In given example array contain element value available type
In C array element index inclusive case
For example expression first last element respectively
For vector linear addressing element index located address fixed fixed constant sometimes called
If valid element index begin constant simply address first element array
For reason specifies array index always begin many programmer call element rather first
However one choose index first element appropriate choice base address
For example array five element indexed base address replaced index element
If numbering start constant may address element
For multidimensional array element index would address coefficient respectively
More generally array address element index For example int This mean array row column array integer type
Here store element stored linearly starting first row linear continuing second row
The array stored
This formula requires multiplication addition array fit memory
Moreover coefficient fixed power multiplication replaced
The coefficient must chosen every valid index tuple map address distinct element
If minimum legal value every index address element whose index zero
As case element index may changed changing base address
Thus array row column indexed respectively replacing cause renumbered respectively
Taking advantage feature language like FORTRAN specify array index begin mathematical tradition language like Fortran Pascal Algol let user choose minimum value index
The addressing formula completely defined dimension base address increment
It often useful pack parameter record called array
The size element minimum maximum value allowed index may also included dope vector
The dope vector complete array convenient way pas array argument
Many useful operation selecting swapping index reversing direction index performed efficiently manipulating dope vector
Often coefficient chosen element occupy contiguous area memory
However necessary
Even array always created contiguous element array slicing operation may create
There two systematic compact layout array
For example consider matrix In order layout adopted C statically declared array element row stored consecutive position element row lower address element consecutive row In order traditionally used Fortran element column consecutive memory element column lower address element consecutive column For array three index row major order put consecutive position two element whose index tuples differ one index
Column major order analogous respect index
In system use scanning array much faster successive element stored consecutive position memory rather sparsely scattered
Many algorithm use multidimensional array scan predictable order
A programmer sophisticated compiler may use information choose layout array
For example computing product two matrix would best stored order order
Static array size fixed created consequently allow element inserted removed
However allocating new array copying content old array possible effectively implement version array see
If operation done infrequently insertion end array require amortized constant time
Some array data structure reallocate storage store count number element array use called count size
This effectively make array fixed maximum size capacity example
More complicated formula occasionally used
For compact instance addressing formula polynomial degree
Both take deterministic worst case
Arrays take linear space number element hold
In array element size machine cache line size B byte iterating array element requires minimum ceiling cache miss element occupy contiguous memory location
This roughly factor better number cache miss needed access element random memory location
As consequence sequential iteration array noticeably faster practice iteration many data structure property called mean however using within local array even faster achievable
Libraries provide optimized facility copying range memory used move block array element significantly faster achieved individual element access
The speedup optimized routine varies array element size architecture implementation
array compact data structure
There may overhead
store index bound
It also happen element stored array require memory element stored individual variable several array element stored single array often called array
An extreme commonly used case every bit represents single element
A single thus hold different combination different condition compact form
Array access statically predictable access pattern major source
similar array add ability insert delete element adding deleting end particularly efficient
However reserve linear additional storage whereas array reserve additional storage
provide mechanism functionality without huge storage overhead index value sparse
For example array contains value index billion may benefit using structure
Specialized associative array integer key include
require O log time indexed access also permit inserting deleting element O log time whereas growable array require linear Œò time insert delete element arbitrary position
allow constant time removal insertion middle take linear time indexed access
Their memory use typically worse array still linear
An alternative multidimensional array structure
It us array array one dimension le
For two dimension particular alternative structure would vector pointer vector one row
Thus element row column array would accessed double indexing typical notation
This alternative structure allows row may different size general valid range index depends value preceding index
It also save one multiplication column address increment replacing bit shift index vector row pointer one extra memory access fetching row address may worthwhile architecture
The dimension array number index needed select element
Thus array seen function set possible index combination dimension space domain discrete subset
Thus array list data array rectangle data array block data etc
This confused dimension set matrix given domain number element array
For example array row column matrix form space
Similarly vector represented array size three

clustering operate rank order list thus one load relatively large matrix memory
Small Sweeney added variable threshold clustering effort map science globally using analysis document level
However choice threshold similarity criterion clustering algorithm remained somewhat arbitrary
Because focus relation latent dimension matrix eigenvectors could revealed using clustering Leydesdorff
A structural approach requires multivariate analysis example based rotation initial factor solution unit analysis may occupy similar position without necessarily maintaining strong relation Burt Leydesdorff

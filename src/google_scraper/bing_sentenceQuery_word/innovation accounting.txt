Accounting Computer Science challenging major requires math skill
Work time management organization order complete project time
You learn solve difficult algorithm code software program
This precise detailed orientated work requires analytical thinking well ability grasp abstract concept
Your coursework require independent research study well occasional group project
Build teamwork skill learn work peer solve problem
Students need develop advanced communication skill order explain complex concept simple manner
Creativity imagination help find new method solve problem
Students choose multidisciplinary major like Accounting Computer Science often order widen career option
Graduates form program option work accounting computer programming software development sort combination
In order become accountant need take CPA Exam well get master degree
Some Computer Science occupation also require schooling
Some many career could enter include budget analyst financial clerk government accountant management accountant public accountant computer information system manager software developer

Innovation accounting refers rigorous process defining empirically measuring communicating true progress innovation customer retention usage pattern whether company new product business unit within established company
The term innovation accounting well defined understood
However combining two term together take different meaning
When traditional accounting measure used measure innovation often effect stifling suffocating new product start company
This traditional accounting tends work best measuring established product concern
By definition new innovation limited operating history little revenue burning cash well excess revenue
In context financial ratio analysis cash flow analysis standard practice shed unflattering light new innovation especially comparison existing product business within established company
It critical use right metric understand cause effect
Using wrong metric damaging
Using market buzz PR hit product award often superficial approach
Despite many entrepreneur tend refer number retweets Facebook like legitimate market validation
For example network security company focused number resellers contractually signed resell new product indicate validation product
In reality vanity metric financial commitment part resellers
In another example number early sale actually false positive sold user required many modification original
There approach key metric
They must carefully selected evolve business matures
The metric must go beyond obvious prove objectively company moving towards sustainability
Ultimately company time move validated assumption quantitative financial model
Examples include metric address depth user engagement
There legitimate reason curve largely flat beginning new product business cycle
It founder team leader working hard uncovering business model work start lot thing need refined
In IBM confronted harsh reality missing opportunity establish early leadership many new tech market network router data communication internet
While several reason one important factor IBM applied rigorous metric new product established product led discontinued
When Lou Gerstner joined company CEO IBM darkest day recognised needed change developed Emerging Business Opportunity Group EBO charged identifying new billion dollar business IBM
One critical change Mr Gerstner implemented alter way new business opportunity evaluated
He brought entrepreneurial executive lead new venture tasked eliminating market ambiguity increasing strategic clarity
Ultimately IBM EBO approach resulted number new dollar business IBM major player IT space

The world computer taken giant stride forward past year many direct result research physical area like plasma physic nanotechnology quantum mechanic superconductors others
This research ongoing delivering even smaller device perform billion calculation palm hand
By choosing research career could part legacy

Friday October Halloween Eve aka Devil night
A night I working Halloween costume
Instead I Australian Accounting Awards wearing suit much scarier costume
Those know know last time I wore suit AIM Awards November event organiser insisted I wear one
The time Governor house assured simply would let building wearing jean
So I donned best suit rocked Westin Martin Place Accodex nominated Innovator Year award
I expecting win considering competitor aggregate revenue billion
I network mostly steal talented accountant Accodex sorry guy
Suffice say Accodex announced winner I almost spat drink
Now I time process victory I wanted open source innovation framework nothing really magical
Accodex accounting firm based Adelaide South Australia
It spun merger accounting firm Cirillo Hooper Company National Accounts
Most would understand industry currently state disruption
Stuart Spalding Rob Nixon suggest key element change I taken step coined term highlight current state play accounting world
In classic management theorist Peter Drucker state Opportunities innovation exist change industry Knowing merger Accodex purposely built capitalise state disruption
There English proverb go mother invention
Many early innovation Cirillo Hooper Company simply born necessity
This example incongruent innovation described Drucker
For example business serverless grand design serverless simply could afford server
Similarly fixed fee retainer implemented firm could afford wait money come business
In interview magazine I simply said Sacrifices made ultimately triggered biggest innovation Accodex really innovative eye
We employed incongruent innovation broke
We used simple framework I heard Rob Nixon define simply Off Duplicate
We simply looked outside accounting profession observed market leader across value chain fit within strategy
Here found Innovation invention lot small improvement stacked top
If want firm innovative stop sitting tree waiting apple land head
Take hard look vulnerable area firm find someone better emulate
Once fixed every leaky tap office spend much time want apple tree
Chris Hooper accounting futurist current CEO Tech Accounting firm Accodex
He also director Future Accountants Network member organization mission educate tomorrow accountant
He regular speaker circle also consults accounting practice help modernize firm

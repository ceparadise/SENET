In used describe fashion
First proposed computer scientist generalization arrow provide way expressing relationship step computation
Unlike monad arrow limit step one one input
As result found use among application
While arrow use recognized distinct class Hughes would publish first definition
Until monad proven sufficient problem requiring combination program logic pure code
However useful library certain efficient parser defied rewriting monadic form
The formal concept arrow developed explain exception monadic code process monad turned arrow
Since arrow active area research
Their underlying law operation refined several time recent formulation arrow calculus requiring five law
In form proper subset Hughes arrow
While believed arrow time since proven arrow even general
In fact arrow merely equivalent directly equal Freyd category
Like type class arrow thought set quality applied
In arrow allow represented Haskell symbol combine form
However actual term arrow may also come fact arrow correspond also known arrow category theory different Kleisli category
As relatively new concept single standard definition formulation logically equivalent feature required method strictly obey certain mathematical law
The description currently used Haskell two basic operation Although two procedure strictly necessary define arrow method derived make arrow easier work practice theory
As arrow third operation class category One helpful method derived combination previous three In addition procedure arrow must obey certain rule type may applied The remaining law restrict piping method behaves order composition reversed also allowing simplifying Arrows may extended fit specific situation defining additional operation restriction
Commonly used version include arrow choice allow computation make decision arrow allow step take output input
Another set arrow known arrow application rarely used practice actually equivalent monad
Arrows several benefit mostly stemming ability make program logic explicit yet concise
Besides avoiding creates opportunity
This turn theoretically lead better easier feature like
Although program strictly requires arrow generalize away much dense pure declarative code would otherwise require
They also encourage giving common linkage program step class definition
The ability apply type generically also contributes reusability keep simple
Arrows disadvantage including initial effort defining arrow satisfies arrow law
Because monad usually easier implement extra feature arrow may unnecessary often preferable use monad
Another issue applies many construct efficiently code arrow style used computer

In information specimen field note map used different way different community
Boundary object plastic interpreted differently across community enough immutable content maintain integrity
The concept introduced publication In article Star Griesemer describe importance boundary object method standardization development Berkeley
Some boundary object list include specimen field note map particular territory
These object interact member various social group including amateur collector museum professional used different end
This paper since widely cited concept boundary object adopted particularly management
Star developed concept book
Boundary object said allow coordination without consensus allow actor local understanding reframed context wider collective activity
Similarly describes boundary object entity link community together allow different group collaborate common task
Charlotte Lee extended concept boundary object consider period unstandardized destabilized organization object transient changing coin boundary negotiating artifact
evoke idea drawn contemporary develop concept boundary object learn BOTLs
This understanding boundary object acknowledges role process communication across social group
However also emphasizes fact human user boundary object especially access digital technology modify object meet need
Kimble Grenier criticise notion boundary object usually found literature mechanical ignoring effect intergroup politics local condition
They argue boundary object need seen context motivation people choose object well communicative role
Isto Huvila using example archaeological report argues creation boundary object always degree expression
As boundary object viewed politically neutral necessarily consensual

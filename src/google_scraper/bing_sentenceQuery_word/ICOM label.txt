In simplest term study information data manipulated algorithm solve problem mostly theory also practice
Computer science study computer strictly require use computer
Data algorithm possible compute using pen paper make computer science misnomer
Computer science akin mathematics prefer use term informatics instead
Computer science often get conflated three field related exactly All said people nowadays use computer science term field involves programming data analysis manipulation interaction software hardware
In word computer science many concentration If plan studying computer science know
Schools even agree computer science entail let alone agree discipline belong computer science heading
Here list common type computer science may encounter one specializes
As see computer science one broadest field today In order graduate college university computer science degree study likely include minimum I would tell somebody give computer science simply right trait characteristic
If want pursue mean pursue
Hard work perseverance overcome kind shortcoming field
A degree cost minimum four year life
Know getting minimize chance wasting precious year
Someone good fit computer science Problem solving core skill computer scientist software engineer information technologist
If naturally curious feel urge figure thing find joy computer science career guaranteed
Furthermore computer science one fastest advancing field world today
If desire keep new language new library new application etc
may soon overwhelmed unless stick legacy field
Computer science also highly creative
You literally creating code scratch unlike writer painter musician
You think outside box practice
need determination make side time time
If none applies
If computer science intrigue think take good fit congratulation
You waiting ahead
There one thing need know want In beginning taste explore many different area computer science
You might surprised one like best certain one fun actually
But know one focus become master
Dabbling many area rarely make far career
On hand specialized expert take far
Required field marked Great

Another organization invested promotion effective icon usage ICT information communication technology published guideline creation use icon
Many icon available Internet either purchase freeware incorporate new software
A second type hyperlink icon represents object common physical office space desktop environment
It includes basic icon used file file folder trashcan inbox together spatial real estate screen
electronic desktop
This model originally enabled user familiar common office practice function intuitively navigate computer desktop system
Desktop Metaphor pg
The icon stand object function accessible system enable user task common office space
These desktop computer icon developed several decade data file hierarchical storage system
file folder filing cabinet finally including trashcan
first coined term icon landmark PhD thesis Pygmalion A Creative Programming Environment
In work Smith envisioned scenario visual entity called icon could execute line programming code save operation later
Smith later served one principal designer became first commercially available personal computing system based desktop metaphor released
The icon desktop visible concrete embodiment corresponding physical object
The desktop icon displayed first desktop model easily recognizable user several decade later display main component desktop metaphor GUI
This model desktop metaphor adopted personal computing system last decade century remains popular simple intuitive navigation single user single system
It beginning century personal computing evolving new metaphor based Internet connectivity team user
In new model data tool longer stored single system instead stored someplace else cloud
The cloud metaphor replacing desktop model remains seen many common desktop icon file file folder trashcan inbox filing cabinet find place new metaphor
A type computer icon icon commercial software program available computer system
These brand icon bundled product installed system software
They function way hyperlink icon described representing functionality accessible system providing link either software program data file
Over beyond act company identifier advertiser software company
Because company program represent company product much attention given design done frequently commercial artist
To regulate use brand icon registered considered part company intellectual property
In order display number icon representing growing complexity offered device different system come different solution screen space management
The computer monitor continues display primary icon main page desktop allowing easy quick access commonly used function user
This screen space also invite almost immediate user customization user add favorite icon screen group related icon together screen
Secondary icon system program also displayed system
These secondary icon provide link like primary icon instead used show availability tool file system
Spatial management technique play bigger role mobile device much smaller screen real estate
In response mobile device introduced among visual device scrolling screen display selectable tab displaying group related icon
Even evolving display system icon remain relatively constant appearance function
Above icon must remain clearly identifiable display screen regardless position size

Another GUI icon exemplified face pictogram embedded
The smiley extension used computer text convey information binary shorthand frequently involving emotional context message
These icon first developed computer response limited storage transmission bandwidth used electronic messaging
Since become abundant sophisticated keyboard representation varying emotion
They developed keyboard character combination real icon
They widely used form electronic communication always goal adding context verbal content message
In adding emotional overlay text also enabled electronic message substitute frequently supplant messaging
These emoticon different icon hyperlink described
They serve link part system function computer software
Instead part communication language user across system
For computer icon customization modification possible fact expected user
A text hyperlink performs much function functional computer icon provides direct link function data available system
Although customized text hyperlink generally share standardized recognizable format blue text underlining
Hyperlinks differ functional computer icon normally embedded text whereas icon displayed screen real estate
They also displayed text either link friendly name whereas icon defined primarily
Because design requirement icon creation costly process
There plethora icon creation tool found Internet ranging professional level tool utility bundled software development program freeware
Given wide availability icon tool icon set problem arise custom icon mismatched style icon included system
Icons underwent change appearance early used photorealistic appearance featuring effect softening sharpening edge enhancement glossy appearance drop shadow rendered
Icon editor used early platform usually contain rudimentary capable modifying image icon pixel pixel using simple drawing tool applying simple image filter
Professional icon designer seldom modify icon inside icon editor use advanced drawing modeling application instead
The main function performed icon editor generation icon image
An icon editor resamples source image resolution color depth required icon
Other function performed icon editor icon extraction executable file exe dll creation icon library saving individual image icon

I ended enrolled BSc Economics course I particularly interested
My specific situation might generally applicable worldwide audience Internet technical study becoming ubiquitous
Computer Science however stop flying around mind I sure someone might facing dilemma I faced year ago point represent thought advice I believe might useful people The problem I learning thing I liked thing I try
The answer really simple stop thinking studying Computer Science probably study Computer Science
How know actually tried
You play safe
Start short online introductory course programming algorithm
Coursera time start get idea like code
Ruby would good language start simple avoids many complexity language
Watch video program along start getting excited would probably enjoy studying Computer Science
On hand like Computer Science get passionate coding possible area may suited Technical Writing
Writing documentation
This would require bit technical knowledge actually know writing spot error
Either way Computer Science change way think
During BSc I idea I would make possible convert computing
I realised however change line thinking either going back school another BSc rather finding role unrelated personality potential
It old saying picking something like well people pay
I knew I many year steer towards goal many year benefit advantage another degree I wanted take bigger risk find way exact moment
My thinking process fairly simple I experienced A lead believe B B true I take action I experienced studying something I like I change lead hypothesis faster I would graduate quicker I would dive thing I liked proper CS course
I accepted hypothesis true I graduated highest mark BSc I I wanted apply accepted really good BSc CS degree abroad
I time ready spend another year life starting moment I realised I could convert month
There Ivy League MSc Computer Science conversion course widely known
Their entry requirement involve good undergraduate degree strong passion Computer Science exactly I needed
These month course really intensive challenging life changing time
If passionate programming find course interesting logical importantly memorable
The actual studying homework programming assignment medium hard difficulty may seem paced bit fast push achieve great thing
Go designated prerequisite disastrous ignore prerequisite advise tremendously useful follow
Make sure understand code term math programming abstract thinking bug group project programming multiple computer language
A thing I realised converting Computing You WILL make mistake point find early learn identify even earlier next time move take personally
Make sure accept actively seek offer input colleague especially think input needed
New tool platform requirement APIs likely appear month month beauty technology
Just smile face new challenge
Attend hackathons competition coding finding smart solution interest problem coder know create something scratch
Having completed project show great way showcase work ability

Harvey Mudd College student Ellen Seidel Christine Chen work summer research project computer science
A Google engineer got fired controversial memo said might biological reason fewer woman engineer
But top computer science school proven cultural change increase number woman field
In percent computer science major Harvey Mudd College woman
That pretty low since Harvey Mudd school student interested science math technology
Then began tenure president college
Klawe computer scientist always told girl good thing
This whole idea woman lean liking one thing men another turn I think curriculum pedagogy well false say
Loading
In fact soon arrived Klawe joined effort change curriculum
First school changed name intro course called Intro Java programming language
Faculty came new name Creative Problem Solving Science Engineering Using Computational Approaches
And Klawe say college also address fact lot woman intimidated male student showed class
Many done programming high school would dominate discussion
So created second intro course student previous experience
Klawe say took away intimidation come class prior experience somebody else programming since eight
Klawe say also countered stereotype computer geek guy spent time alone basement
They deliberately made collaborative involving teamwork instead lonely say
Student Erin Paeng work trust Harvey Mudd College Human Experience Agent Teamwork lab
Student Erin Paeng work trust Harvey Mudd College Human Experience Agent Teamwork lab
Harvey Mudd intro computer class became among school popular
And instead percent given year number woman computer science major range percent percent
Harvey Mudd school seeing success effort
Carnegie Mellon also significantly raised number woman major computer science
Jane Margolis education researcher UCLA began study Carnegie Mellon
At time percent computer science major woman
It question capacity ability Margolis say
It question woman feeling welcome existence suspect
For example Margolis say computer science club men put woman think coding day night
And yet Margolis interviewed men found interest
Many would say I like thing besides computing
I like hike I like bike
But never felt like presence scrutinized
Carnegie Mellon instituted series reform
The school created woman computer club
The school made harder become computer science major always applicant good math science also show leadership quality
Today instead percent percent computer science major Carnegie Mellon woman
For company like Google percent woman technical position question whether something learned educational program
All Tech Considered explores technology changing culture connection

learn share knowledge build career
I trying find good definition get understanding really
It seems I must missing something obvious every time I read thread almost circular definition la thread thread execution way divide running task
Uh uh
Huh
It seems I read thread really concrete like process
It fact concept
From I understand way work processor executes command program termed need switch processing program bit store program currently executing somewhere Thread Local Storage start executing program instruction
And back forth
Such thread really concept one path execution program currently running
Unlike process really something conglomeration resource etc
As example definition really help much


From A thread computer science short thread execution
Threads way program divide termed split two simultaneously running task
Threads process differ one operating system another general thread contained inside process different thread process share resource different process multitasking operating system
So I right
Wrong
What thread really
Apparently thread also given call stack somewhat concrete
A thread independent set value processor register single core
Since includes Instruction Pointer aka Program Counter control executes order
It also includes Stack Pointer better point unique area memory thread else interfere
Threads software unit affected control flow function call loop goto instruction operate Instruction Pointer belongs particular thread
Threads often scheduled according prioritization scheme although possible design system one thread per processor core case every thread always running scheduling needed
In fact value Instruction Pointer instruction stored location sufficient determine new value Instruction Pointer
For instruction simply advance IP size instruction control flow instruction change IP predictable way
The sequence value IP take form path execution weaving program code giving rise name thread
A thread execution context information CPU need execute stream instruction
Suppose reading book want take break right want able come back resume reading exact point stopped
One way achieve jotting page number line number word number
So execution context reading book number
If roommate using technique take book using resume reading stopped
Then take back resume
Threads work way
A CPU giving illusion multiple computation time
It spending bit time computation
It execution context computation
Just like share book friend many task share CPU
On technical level execution context therefore thread consists value CPU register
Last thread different process
A thread context execution process bunch resource associated computation
A process one many thread
Clarification resource associated process include memory page thread process view memory file descriptor open socket security credential ID user started process
Processes like two people using two different computer use network share data necessary
Threads like two people using computer share data explicitly must carefully take turn
Conceptually thread multiple worker bee buzzing around address space
Each thread stack program counter thread process share memory
Imagine two program running time access object
Contrast process
Processes address space meaning pointer one process used refer object another unless use shared memory
I guess key thing understand In order define thread formally must first understand boundary thread operates
A computer program becomes loaded store computer memory begin execution
A process executed processor set processor
A process description memory contains vital information program counter keep track current position program
instruction currently executed register variable store file handle signal forth
A sequence instruction within program executed independently code
The figure show concept Threads within thus much information present memory description process shared across thread
Some information replicated stack stack pointer different memory area per thread register data
program main thread possibly one thread within program
Explicit operating system support required run multithreaded program
Fortunately modern operating system support thread Linux via NPTL BSD variant Mac OS X Windows Solaris AIX etc
Operating system may use different mechanism implement multithreading support
find information topic
That also
I going use lot text book Operating Systems Concepts ABRAHAM SILBERSCHATZ PETER BAER GALVIN GREG GAGNE along understanding thing
Any application resides computer form text code
We emphasize program process
A program passive entity file containing list instruction stored disk often called executable file
When start application create instance execution
This instance execution called process
EDIT As per interpretation analogous class instance class instance class process
An example process Google Chrome
When start Google Chrome process spawned The process responsible managing user interface well disk network
A new browser process created Chrome started
Only one browser process created
process contain logic rendering web page
Thus contain logic handling HTML Javascript image forth
As general rule new renderer process created website opened new tab several renderer process may active time
A process created type Flash QuickTime use
process contain code well additional code enables communicate associated renderer process browser process
To answer I think first know processor
A Processor piece hardware actually performs computation
EDIT Computations like adding two number sorting array basically executing code written Now moving definition thread
A thread comprises thread ID program counter register set stack
EDIT Definition thread intel website A Thread thread execution software term basic ordered sequence instruction passed processed single CPU core
So Renderer process Chrome application sort array number sorting take place execution
The grammar regarding thread seems confusing A process execution instance
Threads actual worker perform computation via CPU access
When multiple thread running process process provides common memory
EDIT All modern day computer one thread
The number thread computer depends number core computer
From Wikipedia Concurrent computing form computing several computation executed overlapping time sequentially one completing next start
This property may individual program computer So I could write program calculates sum number In program compute sum one process running thread execution I fork another process run different thread compute return result original process original process calculates sum
Unfortunately thread exist
A thread something tangible
You kill one others still running
You spawn new thread although thread process running separately inside process
On machine thread could run time
This taken Yahoo Answer A thread coding construct unaffect architecture application
A single process frequently may contain multiple thread
Threads also directly communicate since share variable
Processes independent execution unit state information
They also use address space interact process interprocess communication mechanism
However put simpler term thread like different task
So think something instance writing formula one paper
That considered one thread
Then another thread writing something else another piece paper
That multitasking come
Intel processor said AMD meant able perform multiple thread multitask much better
I sure logistics thread handled
I recall hearing processor going back forth I sure hopefully somebody else answer
The answer varies across different system different implementation important part Beyond thread could implemented within single process language runtime thread could coroutines thread could implemented within single process threading library thread could kernel construct
In several modern Unix system including Linux I familiar thread process merely thread share relatively thing parent
get memory mapping file table permission etc
Reading especially list flag really instructive
A thread nothing memory context Tanenbaum better put resource grouping execution rule
It software construct
The CPU idea thread exception processor hardware thread executes instruction
The kernel introduces thread process concept manage memory instruction order meaningful way
If want answer english here teacher told I asked You know run java program run program top bottom
Well thread basically way get around
Like opening two text box timer running time bunch stuff
I swear almost exactly said

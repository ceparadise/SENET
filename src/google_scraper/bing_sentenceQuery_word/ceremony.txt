discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

This serf important function set graduation Academic Regalia hood tam gown
The regalia hood color typically include four section shell fabric velvet edge satin field satin chevron
The color velvet edge determined using
That velvet edge hood color sometimes known Academic Regalia Colors represents specific degree discipline
The satin field chevron hood lining color represent university college school color
The overall size shape represents type degree bachelor master doctoral narrow end getting progressively longer higher ranking degree
Finally fabric shell color simply match fabric color graduation gown usually black sometimes another color depending institution
Associate degree use special cowl instead hood
Below official academic regalia hood color list
Your academic hood color ultimately decision institution
However official academic regalia color
See footnote PhD degree rule regarding multiple degree determining field chevron color
In determining academic regalia color please note following All PhD degree opposed Doctorate degree use PhD Blue dark blue academic color
For example Doctorate Psychology would include academic hood color color Gold however PhD Psychology would use dark blue
If unsure degree Doctorate PhD please contact administrative advisor determine precise degree title academic regalia hood color
If rule use one hood one color
You use hood color represents highest ranking degree Doctoral highest Masters second highest Bachelors third highest Associate lowest
If two different degree highest ranking degree generally use recently awarded degree hood
If official color dependant individual college university determine color used hood
Typically similar degree official chart chosen
For example degree advance computer science field usually school chooses Science Gold degree color
Hood Lining Colors Field Chevron The list describes velvet color
There three additional color typically go hood
They shell fabric usually black sometimes robe special color university us lining color
Hoods lined official color color college university conferring degree
More one color shown division field color variety way
Most school divide color using single chevron
Occasionally school might use one chevron chevron instead single field color equal division reverse chevron straight bar method
While Academic Apparel make variety hood please note online ordering system assumes single field single standard chevron
For unusual type hood use downloadable fax form
Starlight Washable Satin hood school color Indicates color yet available washable satin
These instead substituted acetate satin must dry cleaned
Polyester Taffeta hood school color The official Academic Costume Code Academic Ceremony Guide includes sentence read follows The various academic costume company maintain complete file approved color various institution
Once upon time long ago sentence correct
However college started springing across nation rapid rate last year institution started practice changing hood color depending style taste desire student body economics bulk manufacturing sometimes even yearly basis
We direct manufacturer academic regalia
This mean one good thing one bad thing perspective
The good thing price significantly lower university would charge sell yet quality better offer
That relatively lean organization independent year experience pay sale representative retail store large advertising marketing budget
The bad thing keep change university make regalia year therefore require customer make inquiry university discover current regalia color supposed school placing order
We suggest find advance ordering school color go field go chevron hood
You might also ask following additional information whether use side tam buying tam whether use tam mortarboard Master degree inquiring master gown regalia set whether use standard black gown hood shell color special color whether use embroidered school emblem symbol gown velvet dif look like fairly rare school use anything special regalia covered question
Generally best source information University book store student store
Someone bookstore information
You know right purchase gown manufacturer company contract university
By getting information purchasing regalia Academic Apparel saving money getting regalia set look least good school offer often look feel significantly better bulk manufactured chinese gown many college selling last longer gown
While would really like help obtain information hope day send survey year university asking data beyond ability right
If willing footwork find information know get superb robe hood tam u price beat

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

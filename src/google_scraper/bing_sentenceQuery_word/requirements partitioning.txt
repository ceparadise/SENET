creation one region manage information region separately
Partitioning typically first step preparing newly manufactured disk created
The disk store information partition location size area known operating system read part disk
Each partition appears operating system distinct logical disk us part actual disk
use program called create resize delete manipulate partition
When hard drive installed computer must partitioned format use
Partitioning drive divide total storage drive different piece
These piece called partition
Once partition created formatted used computer
Creating one partition following advantage Creating one partition following disadvantage compared single partition spanning disk area This section describes MBR partitioning scheme used historically among others computer system
As new computer use GPT partitioning scheme instead
For example partitioning scheme see general article
The total data storage space PC HDD MBR partitioning implemented contain four alternatively three primary partition
The located master boot record contains entry describes partition
The identified code found partition table entry
Some code may used indicate presence
Most used operating system bootloader examines partition table decide partition contains file system used reading writing data
A primary partition contains one file system
In early version system required called first partition
All Windows operating system Windows onwards located almost partition boot file etc
must reside primary partition
However factor PC see may also impose specific requirement partition must contain primary OS
The partition type primary partition either correspond file system contained within
mean either file system indicate partition special use
code usually indicates Linux partition
The file system made use number partition type code due limit various DOS Windows OS version
Though Linux operating system may recognize number different file system etc
consistently used partition type code
An HDD may contain one extended partition extended partition subdivided multiple logical partition
system may logical partition
With common practice use one primary partition active contain operating system file utility application user data
On Windows consumer computer C routinely assigned primary partition
Other partition may exist may may visible drive recovery partition partition diagnostic tool data
Microsoft drive letter correspond partition fashion may fewer drive letter partition
Microsoft include program allows creation deletion resizing FAT NTFS partition
The Windows Disk Manager Windows Vista Windows utilizes scheme fundamentally Windows XP DOS well many operating system
On operating system possible use multiple partition disk device
Each partition formatted
Multiple partition allow directory allocated filesystems
Such scheme number advantage A common configuration Linux desktop system use two partition one holding file system mounted
By default macOS system also use single partition entire filesystem use inside file system like Windows rather swap partition
In Solaris partition sometimes known
This conceptual reference slicing cake several piece
The term slice used operating system refer partition avoid confusion FreeBSD partitioning scheme
However partition referred partition worldwide
system computer user boot one two distinct operating system OS stored separate storage device separate partition storage device
In system menu give choice OS one OS time loaded
This distinct one operating system run virtual program within another operating system
An example Windows OS virtual machine running within Linux OS
The part UEFI standard layout physical
Many operating system support standard
When partition deleted entry removed table data longer accessible
The data remains disk overwritten
Partition Recovery may able locate file system recreate partition table includes entry recovered file system
Some disk utility may overwrite number beginning sector partition delete
For example Windows Disk Management Windows etc
used delete partition overwrite first sector relative sector partition removing
It still may possible restore partition backup boot sector available
HDDs compressed create additional space
In DOS early Microsoft Windows program except DR DOS Windows used
This compression done creating large file partition storing disk data file
At startup device driver opened file assigned separate letter
Frequently avoid confusion original partition compressed drive letter swapped compressed disk C uncompressed area often containing system file given higher name
Versions using NT kernel including recent version XP Vista contain intrinsic disk compression capability
The use separate disk compression utility declined sharply

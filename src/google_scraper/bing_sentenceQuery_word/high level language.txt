In strong detail
In comparison may use element easier use may automate even hide entirely significant area computing system
making process developing program simpler understandable relative language
The amount abstraction provided defines programming language
In programming language using commonly called
Examples autocodes
The first programming language designed computer created
However implemented time original contribution due largely isolated development although influenced language Superplan degree also Algol
The first really widespread language machine independent development IBM earlier system
defined committee European American computer scientist introduced well
It also first language clear distinction corresponding
Algol also introduced several concept construct first described formal method BNF
During roughly period introduced also called structs introduced fully general programming language first time
language refers higher level abstraction
Rather dealing register memory address call stack language deal variable array complex arithmetic boolean expression subroutine function loop lock abstract computer science concept focus optimal program efficiency
Unlike language language element translate directly machine native
Other feature string handling routine language feature file may also present
One thing note programming language language allows programmer detached separated machine
That unlike language like assembly machine language programming amplify programmer instruction trigger lot data movement background without knowledge
The responsibility power executing instruction handed machine programmer
language intend provide feature standardize common task permit rich debugging maintain architectural agnosticism language often produce efficient code optimization specific system architecture
border prevents programming technique applied situation computational limitation standard conformance physical constraint require access architectural resource fi response time hardware integration
programming exhibit feature like generic data interpretation intermediate code file often result execution far operation necessary higher memory consumption larger binary program size
For reason code need run particularly quickly efficiently may require use language even language would make coding easier
In many case critical portion program mostly language leading much faster efficient simply reliably functioning
However growing complexity modern architecture compiler language frequently produce code comparable efficiency programmer produce hand higher abstraction may allow powerful technique providing better overall result counterpart particular setting
language designed independent specific computing system architecture
This facilitates executing program written language computing system compatible support Interpreted program
language improved designer develop improvement
In case new language evolve one others goal aggregating popular construct new improved feature
An example maintains backward compatibility mean program library written Java continue usable even programming shop switch Scala make transition easier lifespan coding indefinite
In contrast program rarely survive beyond system architecture written without major revision
This engineering Penalty
Examples programming language active use today include many others
The term inherently relative
Some decade ago similar language often considered supported concept expression evaluation recursive function data type structure considered
Today many programmer might refer C lack large garbage collection etc
basically support scalar operation provides direct memory addressing
It therefore readily blend assembly language machine level
Assembly language may regarded higher level often still used without representation support concept constant limited expression sometimes even variable procedure
turn inherently slightly higher level used internally many processor
There three general mode execution modern language Note language strictly interpreted language compiled language
Rather implementation language behavior use interpretation compilation
For example interpreted even though typically compiled
Similarly Java show difficulty trying apply label language rather implementation Java compiled bytecode bytecode subsequently executed either interpretation compilation typically compiler JVM
Moreover compilation interpretation strictly limited description compiler artifact binary executable IL assembly
Alternatively possible language directly implemented computer computer directly executes HLL code
This known designed targeted specific language

There many programming language
To execute compiled interpreted
An IDE integrated development environment used write code test error translate program
designed solve problem
Programming language used implement algorithm
They create program communicate instruction computer
There many different type programming language
But ability Languages defined
instruction encoded language human use understand instruction language computer understand code
Languages also described

Microsoft Open Database Connectivity ODBC standard programming interface application developer database system provider
Before ODBC became defacto standard Windows program interface database system programmer use proprietary language database wanted connect
Now ODBC made choice database system highly irrelevant coding perspective
Application developer much important thing worry syntax needed port program one database another business need sudden change
Through ODBC Administrator Control Panel one specify particular database associated data source wherein ODBC application program written use
Think ODBC data source door name
Each door lead user particular database
For example data source named Sales Figures might SQL Server database whereas Accounts Payable data source could refer Access database
The physical database referred data source reside anywhere LAN
The ODBC system file installed user system Windows
Rather installed user setup separate database application SQL Server Client Visual Basic
When ODBC icon installed Control Panel us file called
It also possible conduct user ODBC data source program called
There version program maintained separate list ODBC data source
From programming perspective beauty ODBC application always written use set function call interface data source irrespective database vendor
The source code application change whether negotiates Oracle SQL Server
The two example used point follows
There ODBC driver available various dozen popular database system
Even Excel spreadsheet plain text file changed different data source
The operating system implicates Registry information written ODBC Administrator determine ODBC driver needed talk data source interface Oracle SQL Server
The loading ODBC driver transparent ODBC application program
In environment ODBC API even control many network issue application programmer
The advantage scheme various make user think must catch
The disadvantage ODBC efficient talking directly native database interface
ODBC various detractor make charge slow
Microsoft always proved critical factor performance quality driver software used
In humble opinion true
The availability good ODBC driver improved great deal recently
And anyway criticism performance somewhat analogous said compiler would never match speed pure assembly language
Maybe compiler ODBC give user opportunity write cleaner program mean user finish programming sooner
This faster compilation program application make computer get faster every year

Just human use language communicate different region different language computer also language specific
Different kind language developed perform different type work computer
Basically language divided two category according computer understands
There also type language include These language mutually exclusive language belong multiple category
The term also open interpretation language considered considered language continued develop
computer language either machine code close
A computer understand instruction given language English
It understand execute instruction given form machine language
binary
There two type language Machine language lowest elementary level programming language first type programming language developed
Machine language basically language computer understand usually written hex
In fact manufacturer design computer obey one language machine code represented inside computer string binary digit bit
The symbol stand absence electric pulse stand presence electric pulse
Since computer capable recognizing electric signal understands machine language
Assembly language developed overcome many inconvenience machine language
This another important language operation code operand given form alphanumeric symbol instead l
These alphanumeric symbol known mnemonic code combine maximum combination
ADD addition SUB subtraction START LABEL etc
Because feature assembly language also known Symbolic Programming Language
This language also difficult need lot practice master little English support language
Mostly assembly language used help compiler orientation
The instruction assembly language converted machine code language translator executed computer
computer language use format similar English
The purpose developing language enable people write program easily native language environment English
language basically symbolic language use English word mathematical symbol rather mnemonic code
Each instruction language translated many machine language instruction computer understand
Many language developed achieving variety different task
Some fairly specialized others quite general
These language categorized according use These language oriented towards computational procedure solving mathematical statistical problem
Examples include These language best able maintain data processing procedure problem involved handling file
Some example include These used string manipulation including search pattern inserting deleting character
Examples In OOP computer program divided object
Examples These programming language designed building This resource used help write article

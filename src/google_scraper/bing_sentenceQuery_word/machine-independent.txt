I often heard people mention class P independent machine model invariant change machine model something subroutine composition something
My question What precisely mean
precisely mean independent choice machine model
It make sense invariance change machine model whatever mean would make P theoretically natural class study sort way Euclidean geometry interested notion invariant similarity linear algebra interested notion depend particular choice basis
The analogy entirely accurate field interested invariant notion computer science still interested property particular machine model
While I understand mean independent choice basis I understand mean independent choice machine model
Is even unique concept several different concept used different context
I talked P specific example idea complexity theory otherwise sense P
Are one
Thanks helping clear
The class P usually defined class decision problem solvable polynomial time Turing machine
However get class replace Turing machine Turing machine RAM machine machine running C natively many machine
That meant class independent machine model
Other class TIME n much dependent machine model I think language computed linear time Turing machine Turing machine
The reason happy P make P natural class
You ask whether correct model Turing machine one tape two tape definition result class
The said TIME n example
You might want look Strong Efficient Thesis SCTT informal statement whatever efficiently computed natural device efficiently computed Turing machine
Thesis CTT drop efficiency requirement state whatever computed natural device computed Turing machine
Note never prove statement could principle disprove giving computational model people would deem natural computes something add efficiently SCTT Turing machine
A word caution CTT much older much universally believed SCTT past year people given lot often computational model always turned equivalent Turing machine term compute without efficiency requirement
In contrast lot evidence quantum computing serious challenge SCTT
See interesting discussion SCTT
answer nice however different angle fairly simple empirical answer
imagine applied measurement problem
take algorithm interest complexity say sorting algorithm O n log n time
run algorithm computer increasing input range computer handle graph result observe function
go computer repeat exercise
claim graph essentially roughly differ constant factor
justifies use notation equivalent constant factor definition complexity class tightly coupled
word major complexity class theoretical computer science regarded machine independent
hence study
natural mathematical object serve basic algorithmic building block somewhat akin prime number way
also relates P v NP question
two yet provably separated sense theoretical way discriminate algorithm mathematical proof nobody prove typical P algorithm faster although abstract proof based
word empirically measure algorithm get upper bound since tight lower bound difficult impossible far granularity theoretical TCS finer far
new theory related fine grained complexity theory attempt get better resolution
By posting answer agree

Almost program machine dependency run somewhat differently different type computer degree independence vary widely
program give flexibility buy new type computer continue using package instead learning new one
On hand program often take advantage special particular computer making program faster
Another term whereas usually refers computer device dependent refer dependency like

What mean say programming machine independent

Compare contrast four different programming paradigm

What operator precedence
b
Depending operator precedence value could associated expression

What mean say programming language strongly typed
Make sure use reference full explanation word

What mean say programming language machine independent
Ans A programming language enables programmer write program le independent particular type computer
Such language considered language
The assembly language considered close machine language

Compare contrast four different programming paradigm
Ans There hundred programming language use today
Some programming language specifically designed use certain application
Different programming language follow different approach solving programming problem A programming paradigm approach solving programming problem
A programming paradigm may consist many programming language
The Common Programming Paradigms Imperative Procedural Programming Programming Functional Programming Logic Programming Imperative Programming Paradigms In paradigm program series statement Machine independence programming examined
The expert compare contrast four different programming paradigm

This action might possible undo

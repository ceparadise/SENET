Influence diagram closely related decision tree often used conjunction
An influence diagram display summary information contained decision tree
It involves four variable type notation decision rectangle chance oval objective hexagon function rounded rectangle
Influence diagram also use solid line denote influence
Their appearance similar
Influence diagram show dependency among variable
This important distinction influence diagram
Decision tree offer much detail possible decision
An influence diagram involves variable type notation decision rectangle chance oval objective hexagon function rounded rectangle
If decision tree complex need either explained someone presented Influence Diagram helpful give higher level explanation discovered using decision tree
There many different way create influence diagram
They created using pen paper white boarded efficiently created diagramming software

An also called compact graphical mathematical representation decision situation
It generalization problem also problem following criterion modeled solved
ID first developed intuitive semantic easy understand
It adopted widely becoming alternative typically suffers number branch variable modeled
ID directly applicable since allows incomplete sharing information among team member modeled solved explicitly
Extensions ID also find use alternative representation
An ID three type plus one subtype three type arrow node
Nodes Arcs Given properly structured ID termed decision analysis represent three required component valid decision situation
Formally semantic influence diagram based sequential construction node arc implies specification conditional independency diagram
The specification defined criterion Bayesian network
According semantic every node probabilistically independent node given outcome immediate predecessor node
Likewise missing arc node node implies exists set node parent render independent given outcome node
Consider simple influence diagram representing situation planning vacation
The example highlight power influence diagram representing extremely important concept decision analysis known
Consider following three scenario Scenario best possible scenario decision situation since longer uncertainty care making decision
Scenario however worst possible scenario decision situation since need make decision without hint care turn
The usually better definitely worse move scenario scenario acquisition new information
The willing pay move called essentially
Likewise best move scenario scenario
The willing pay move called
The applicability simple ID value information concept tremendous especially decision made imperfect information patient disease etc
Influence diagram hierarchical defined either term structure greater detail term functional numerical relation diagram element
An ID consistently defined function mathematical representation referred WFID
WFIDs evaluated using operation yield answer large class probabilistic inferential decision question
More recent technique developed researcher concerning
An influence diagram uncertainty node Bayesian network also called
An arc connecting node implies relevant also relevant relationship

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
To give perspective first consider following diagram comparing Markov Chains HMMs MDPs POMDPs I sure credit
Recall HMM allows u model probability distribution sequence observation
pictured generalization HMMs model conditional distribution set random variable
When modeling problem time one appends time index model resulting
A tool known extends dynamic Bayesian network problem inclusion action effect evolution problem
dynamic influence diagram POMDPs compare
On surface seem like modeling problem type
What sort problem amenable tool
I quote paper DIDs Polich Gmytrasiewicz AAMAS A dynamic influence diagram computational representation POMDP
They continue soon afterward DIDs perform planning using forward exploration technique known reachability analysis
This technique explores possible state belief agent may future likelihood reaching state belief expected utility belief state
The agent adopts plan maximizes expected utility
DIDs provide exact solution finite horizon POMDP problem finite approximation POMDPs infinite horizon
To suggests DIDs author state one possible POMDP specific type solution method related
As limited approximate solution infinite horizon POMDPs also suggests DIDs represent POMDP

A visual representation problem showing variable involved influence relationship variable
They used decision analysis calculate expected value descriptive modeling providing conceptual tool thinking problem prior model development using tool like spreadsheet
A variable included influence diagram decision tree control decision maker
It usually represented visually square rectangle
A variable included influence diagram decision maker control
The possible value node usually associated probability distribution
Chance node usually environmental variable
An alternative name influence diagram used author guide spreadsheet development Read Baston
A variable included influence diagram represents measure included problem objective
For example financial problem goal increase profit outcome node might variable called profit
A variable included influence diagram show intermediate result
A structured approach problem solving attempt apply mathematical model help structure solve problem
A variable included influence diagram impact problem studied considered outside system
It special form chance node
It usually represented visually double lined circle

Each step sequence noted within diagram shape
Steps linked connecting line directional arrow
This allows anyone view flowchart logically follow process beginning end
A flowchart powerful business tool
With proper design construction communicates step process effectively efficiently
You notice flowchart different shape
In case two shape rounded end represent start end point process rectangle used show interim step
These shape known
There dozen symbol used flowchart
If new flowcharting important know represent using
Just word usage conveys certain message flowchart symbol also specific meaning
There several way make flowchart
Originally flowchart created hand using pencil paper
Before advent personal computer drawing template like helped flowchart maker work quickly gave diagram consistent look
Today flowchart typically created using diagramming software
There wide variety
Here commonly used one
Flowcharts originally used industrial engineer structure work process assembly line manufacturing

In finite
That consists finitely many edge directed one vertex another way start vertex follow sequence edge eventually loop back
Equivalently DAG directed graph sequence vertex every edge directed earlier later sequence
DAGs model many different kind information
A modeled DAG vertex cell edge whenever formula one cell us value another topological ordering DAG used update cell value spreadsheet changed
Similarly topological ordering DAGs used order compilation operation
The us DAGs model milestone activity large human project schedule project use little total time possible
block electronic circuit design operation language involve acyclic network processing element
DAGs also represent collection event influence either probabilistic structure record historical data version history system
DAGs also used sequence data representation collection string representation sequence binary choice
More abstractly relation DAG form partial order may represented DAG using reachability
Important computational problem DAGs include finding topological ordering construction largest smallest DAGs reachability relation respectively goal find subset vertex edge connecting rest graph
Transforming directed graph cycle DAG deleting vertex edge possible problem respectively directed graph made DAG contracting single supervertex
The problem finding solved DAGs contrast arbitrary graph shortest path algorithm slower longest path problem
The corresponding concept undirected graph without cycle
Choosing orientation forest produce special kind directed acyclic graph called
However many kind directed acyclic graph formed orienting edge undirected acyclic graph
Moreover every undirected graph assignment direction edge make directed acyclic graph
To emphasize DAGs thing directed version undirected acyclic graph author call
A formed collection vertex structureless object connected pair edge
In case edge orientation one vertex another vertex
A directed graph described sequence edge property ending vertex edge sequence starting vertex next edge sequence path form cycle starting vertex first edge equal ending vertex last edge
A directed acyclic graph directed graph cycle
A vertex directed graph said another vertex exists path start end
As special case every vertex considered reachable path zero edge
If vertex reach via nontrivial path path one edge path cycle another way define directed acyclic graph graph vertex reach via nontrivial path
A directed graph ordering vertex sequence every edge start vertex edge occurs earlier sequence ending vertex edge
A graph topological ordering cycle edge earliest vertex cycle would oriented wrong way
Therefore every graph topological ordering acyclic
Conversely every directed acyclic graph least one topological ordering
Therefore property used alternative definition directed acyclic graph exactly graph topological ordering
The relationship directed acyclic graph formalized vertex DAG
In partial order two vertex ordered exactly exists directed path DAG reachable
However different DAGs may give rise reachability relation partial order
For example DAG two edge reachability relation graph three edge
Both DAGS produce partial order vertex ordered
If DAG graph edge represents reachability relation
It edge whenever reach
That edge every related pair distinct element reachability relation may therefore thought direct translation reachability relation term
The method translating partial order DAGs work generally every finite partially ordered set graph vertex member edge pair element related automatically transitively closed DAG reachability relation
In way every finite partially ordered set represented reachability relation DAG
The DAG graph fewest edge represents reachability relation
It subgraph formed discarding edge also contains longer path connecting two vertex
Like transitive closure transitive reduction uniquely defined DAGs
In contrast directed graph acyclic one minimal subgraph reachability relation
If DAG reachability relation described partial order transitive reduction subgraph edge every pair
Transitive reduction useful visualizing partial order represent fewer edge graph representing order therefore lead simpler
A partial order drawing transitive reduction orientation edge shown placing starting vertex edge lower position ending vertex
Every directed acyclic graph ordering vertex starting endpoint every edge occurs earlier ordering ending endpoint edge
The existence ordering used characterize DAGs directed graph DAG topological ordering
In general ordering unique DAG unique topological ordering directed path containing vertex case ordering order vertex appear path
The family topological ordering DAG family reachability relation DAG two graph representing partial order set topological order
The problem counting directed acyclic graph studied
The number DAGs labeled vertex without restriction order number appear topological ordering DAG These number may computed conjectured proved number count positive
The proof matrix DAG matrix eigenvalue positive denotes
Because DAG adjacency matrix must zero diagonal adding preserve property matrix coefficient
A directed graph formed orienting edge
Every polytree DAG
In particular true formed directing edge outwards root tree
A also called strongly unambiguous graph mangrove directed graph one directed path either direction two vertex equivalently DAG every vertex subgraph reachable form tree
algorithmic problem finding topological ordering given DAG
It solved
Kahn algorithm topological sorting build vertex ordering directly
It maintains list vertex incoming edge vertex already included partially constructed topological ordering initially list consists vertex incoming edge
Then repeatedly add one vertex list end partially constructed topological ordering check whether neighbor added list
The algorithm terminates vertex processed way
Alternatively topological ordering may constructed reversing numbering graph traversal
It also possible check whether given directed graph DAG linear time either attempting find topological ordering testing edge whether resulting ordering valid alternatively topological sorting algorithm verifying algorithm successfully order vertex without meeting error condition
Any undirected graph may made DAG choosing vertex directing every edge earlier endpoint order later endpoint
The resulting edge called
Different total order may lead acyclic orientation graph fewer acyclic orientation
The number acyclic orientation equal given graph
Any directed graph may made DAG removing set vertex edge respectively touch cycle
However smallest set find
An arbitrary directed graph may also transformed DAG called single supervertex
When graph already acyclic smallest feedback vertex set feedback arc set condensation graph
The transitive closure given DAG vertex edge may constructed time using either test reachability vertex
Alternatively solved time exponent theoretical improvement bound
In transitive closure algorithm possible distinguish pair vertex reachable least one path length two pair connected path
The transitive reduction consists edge form path path connecting endpoint
Therefore transitive reduction constructed asymptotic time bound transitive closure
The take input directed acyclic graph weight vertex seek minimum maximum weight closure set vertex outgoing edge
The problem may formulated directed graph without assumption acyclicity greater generality case equivalent problem condensation graph
It may solved polynomial time using reduction
Some algorithm become simpler used DAGs instead general graph based principle topological ordering
For example possible find given starting vertex DAGs linear time processing vertex topological order calculating path length vertex minimum maximum length obtained via incoming edge
In contrast arbitrary graph shortest path may require slower algorithm longest path arbitrary graph find
Directed acyclic graph representation partial ordering many application system task ordering constraint
An important class problem type concern collection object need updated cell one cell changed piece computer software changed
In context graph vertex object updated edge connecting two object whenever one need updated earlier
A cycle graph called generally allowed would way consistently schedule task involved cycle
Dependency graph without circular dependency form DAGs
For instance one cell change necessary recalculate value cell depend directly indirectly changed cell
For problem task scheduled recalculation value individual cell spreadsheet
Dependencies arise expression one cell us value another cell
In case value used must recalculated earlier expression us
Topologically ordering dependency graph using topological order schedule cell update allows whole spreadsheet updated single evaluation per cell
Similar problem task ordering arise program compilation computer program optimization
A somewhat different formulation scheduling constraint used PERT method management large human project one first application DAGs
In method vertex DAG represent project rather specific task performed
Instead task activity represented edge DAG connecting two milestone mark beginning completion task
Each edge labeled estimate amount time take team worker perform task
The DAG represents project one control total time project
Individual milestone scheduled according length longest path ending vertex
A directed acyclic graph may used represent network processing element
In representation data enters processing element incoming edge leaf element outgoing edge
For instance electronic circuit design static block represented acyclic system computes function input input output function represented individual
In general output block used input unless captured register state element maintains acyclic property
Electronic circuit schematic either paper database form directed acyclic graph using instance component form directed reference lower level component
Electronic circuit necessarily acyclic directed
language describe system operation connection output operation input others
These language convenient describing repetitive data processing task collection operation applied many data item
They executed operation performed parallel process soon another set input becomes available
In straight line code sequence statement without loop conditional branch may represented DAG describing input output arithmetic operation performed within code
This representation allows compiler perform efficiently
At higher level code organization state dependency module component large software system form directed acyclic graph
Graphs vertex represent event occurring definite time edge always point early time vertex late time vertex edge necessarily directed acyclic
The lack cycle follows time associated vertex always increase follow graph never return vertex path
This reflects natural intuition causality mean event affect future never affect past thus
An example type directed acyclic graph encountered though case graph considered
The version history example version software associated unique time typically time version saved committed released
For citation graph document published one time refer older document
Sometimes event associated specific physical time
Provided pair event purely causal relationship edge represent event directed acyclic graph
For instance represents system probabilistic event vertex directed acyclic graph likelihood event may calculated likelihood predecessor DAG
In context DAG undirected graph created adding undirected edge parent vertex sometimes called replacing directed edge undirected edge
Another type graph similar causal structure vertex represent either decision made unknown information edge represent causal influence one vertex another
In instance diagram often used estimate expected value different choice intervention
The converse also true
That application represented directed acyclic graph causal structure either explicit order time example order derived derived graph structure
This follows directed acyclic graph
least one way put vertex order edge point direction along order
may seen directed acyclic graph vertex family member edge relationship
Despite name graph necessarily tree possibility marriage relative child common ancestor mother father side causing
The graph descent mother relationship woman descent father relationship men tree within graph
Because one become ancestor family tree acyclic
For reason version history system generally structure directed acyclic graph vertex revision edge connecting pair revision directly derived
These tree general due merges
In many algorithm maintains representing version history geometric structure course sequence change structure
For instance algorithm triangulation change replacing one triangle three smaller triangle point added flip operation replace pair triangle different pair triangle
The history DAG algorithm vertex triangle constructed part algorithm edge triangle two three triangle replace
This structure allows query answered efficiently find location query point Delaunay triangulation follow path history DAG step moving replacement triangle contains
The final triangle reached path must Delaunay triangle contains
In vertex document single publication date
The edge represent citation bibliography one document necessarily earlier document
The classic example come citation academic paper pointed article Networks Scientific Papers
In case paper corresponding vertex citation network
This important measure
provide another example judge support conclusion one case recalling earlier decision made previous case
A final example provided patent must refer earlier earlier patent relevant current patent claim
By taking special property directed acyclic graph account one analyse graph technique available analysing general graph considered many study
For instance give new insight citation distribution found different application highlighting clear difference mechanism creating citation network different context
Another technique trace citation link suggests significant citation chain given
Directed acyclic graph may also used collection sequence
In type application one find DAG path form given sequence
When many sequence share subsequence shared subsequence represented shared part DAG allowing representation use le space would take list sequence separately
For example computer science formed directed acyclic graph single source edge labeled letter symbol path source sink graph represent set English word
Any set sequence represented path tree forming tree vertex every prefix sequence making parent one vertex represent sequence one fewer element tree formed way set string called
A directed acyclic word graph save space trie allowing path diverge rejoin set word possible suffix represented single tree vertex
The idea using DAG represent family path occurs data structure representing binary function
In binary decision diagram vertex labeled name binary variable sink edge labeled
The function value variable value sink found following path starting single source vertex vertex follows outgoing edge labeled value vertex variable
Just directed acyclic word graph viewed compressed form try binary decision diagram viewed compressed form save space allowing path rejoin agree result remaining decision

Given directed graph G want simple cycle G maximal length
The cycle need induced subgraph G
What known optimization problem
Do know complexity
Is much harder decision problem detecting Hamiltonian cycle
How problem
For exact problem efficient algorithm exhaustive search using Johnson algorithm
Ideally complexity question I would like description similar related problem undirected graph Longest induced cycle Longest path Longest induced path
Longest cycle undirected graph discussed although I harder time understanding account
FWIW I particularly interested approximate solution strongly connected digraph vertex average vertex degree several induced tournament vertex
I playing genetic algorithm I like know whether better method available level performance I reasonably aim
By querying cycle length problem P
The following reduction FP problem If query compute output
If exactly one query search Connecting
Otherwise query instance representing query create new variable put variable clause create new clause negation variable
Connect path instead putting magenta edge page string graph together cyclically merging vertex vertex different query
For portion cycle traverse variable originally corresponding instance False direction truth value encoded direction along portion chain witness corresponding query else witness corresponding query
Use resulting witness compute output
since cycle use vertex must stay within single portion whereas cycle us vertex cyclic order use portion one query cycle use vertex ca longest cycle cycle us least one vertex must use must use many vertex possible portion portion original representing corresponding query satisfiable path portion us vertex else path portion us one vertex traverse variable originally instance False direction
Thus problem FP
That reduction go FP problem
For approximation main paper although I annoyed show thing state
Since fresh variable h R g h g force g False g used everywhere including R g constraint force take opposite truth value induces reduction n SAT
By digging section Proof Proposition one see reduction search version SAT search version bounded work even clause one variable
If I wrong last part previous sentence one replace R g h g R u g v R u v w R v g w
Since one output cycle size v replace edge along bottom figure path v vertex figure G copy input instance yield reduction digraph whose number vertex given full solution instance one exhaust vertex one efficiently find Hamiltonian cycle output graph given cycle output graph whose length exceeds v one efficiently find solution instance
Clearly last previous paragraph three sentence one might yield meaningful concrete lower bound input size
However one alternatively reduce modification promise pair path pair path together use vertex cost replacing Hamiltonian cycle cycle us vertex full
In positive direction That paper also reference algorithm consider give algorithm consider
You find going bottom paragraph page section efficiently find cycle
algorithm find seems plausible either one algorithm reference modified find cycle efficiently

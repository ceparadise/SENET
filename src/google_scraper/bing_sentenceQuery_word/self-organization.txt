spontaneous often seemingly purposeful formation spatial temporal spatiotemporal structure function system composed many component
In physic chemistry biology occurs open system driven away thermal
The process found many field also economy sociology medicine technology
Many object surrounding daily life furniture house car computer man made
On hand especially animate world object grow acquire form function without created human
The animal kingdom abounds example
It increasingly recognized even human may considered system well quite number manifestation human activity economy sociology
But process found also inanimate world formation cloud street planetary system galaxy etc
A fundamental question
In inanimate world positive answer could found large class phenomenon
In animate world far least insight could gained
In biology perhaps field controversy general principle need special rule mechanism individual case
The concept discussed ancient Greek philosophy see Paslack
In modern time discussed German philosopher Immanuel Kant Paslack particular dealt formation planetary system well German philosopher Schelling Paslack whose discussion remains rather vague however
In modern time discussed Ross Ashby Heinz von Förster within Cybernetics second order
It also discussed thermodynamics Nicolis Prigogine Heylighen
A systematic study phenomenon performed interdisciplinary field Haken concerned profound mathematical basis well experimental study phenomenon
The presently developing field least partly also concerned
The first theoretical treatment system concerned laser laser acronym light amplification stimulated emission radiation
As shall see term miss phenomenon however
This example show device utilize process
A typical example laser device provided glass tube filled molecule atom represent
At end face glass tube carry mirror one
Due mirror specific light wave stay longer time space cavity interact intensely atom molecule
The atom molecule energetically continuous excited electric current serf
Below critical value electric current device act lamp
The atom molecule emit randomly incoherent light wave track amplified stimulated emission
The light field amplitude Gaussian distributed
Above critical value electric current laser property light change qualitatively dramatically
Laser light consists single wave amplitude small amplitude slow phase diffusion superimposed
The transition irregular light lamp highly ordered light laser show namely coherent light
The emergent laser light wave called
Once established governs emission act individual atom molecule termed
Since joint action subsystem atom molecule generates order parameter laser light wave latter enslaves individual part atom molecule may speak circular
We add expert transition region typical phenomenon occur predicted measured great detail
In laser phase transition new temporal structure formed
action subsystem outside wave prescribed outside DC current increased
When control parameter increased ultra short pulse may occur
Generally instability hierarchy may occur
This least general characterized occurrence increasing number
Under specific condition including high loss due mirror laser light may show see also
The laser energy input electric current energy output besides wanted laser light comprises incoherent loss heat
The described behaviour laser device typical large class system behaviour many part degree freedom governed order parameter degree freedom
The virtue laser example rest upon fact laser property derived first principle quantum theory coupling heatbaths
A typical example kind given talk famous Cyberneticist Heinz von Foerster given many year ago conference marketing Vienna
During World War II Japan USA American admiral ship heavily damaged could give order fleet
Then American ship chose opponent
This problem closely related assignment problem N machine partly different capability assigned N job
While problem solved analytically still complicated assignment task
machine job worker supposed
An experimental access approximate solution may possible system Kernbach
Some system may show first second kind depending boundary condition initial condition parameter value etc
The theoretical treatment based microscopic well macroscopic phenomenological approach
Of particular interest question whether general principle irrespective nature individual part system
In synergetics Haken principle could found least first kind outlined
They based general concept order parameter slaving principle detail see article synergetics
The main issue reduction
In large class system dynamic described order parameter
This serf also basis application catastrophe theory Thom fully deterministic approach stochastic model see Cobb well chaos theory theory based use variable
The mathematical theory synergetics provides order parameter low dimensional equation derived provided basic microscopic equation known allows one formulate model equation term order parameter basic equation unknown
While principle unearthed synergetics come close spirit dynamic system theory rather abstract nature another line thought stress interpretation mechanism principle underlying
They traced back cybernetics concept positive negative feedback
According Erdi see also Erdi behind many phenomenon balance positive negative feedback Meinhardt see also Gierer Meinhardt put balanced antagonistic reaction

In influential model Nicolas Kaldor gave mechanism generation temporal oscillatory dynamic income capital assuming nonlinear dependence investment saving income

According embryological anatomical physiological study wiring neural network result interplay purely deterministic genetically regulated random highly complex mechanism
Fluctuations may operate organizing force accordance

End Erdi contribution contribution anonymous reviewer arise sand deposition behind small wind shelter increase wind shelter thereby accelerates sand deposition clear reaction
However sand deposited one position collect somewhere else
The depletion sand air antagonistic reaction
Thus homogeneous sand distribution instable situation
proceeds faster injury
More water collect incipient valley accelerating erosion
Meandering also patterning process make incipient valley wider
Like sand dune example water collected river longer contribute erosion elsewhere
Next large river second river emerge
observed Purwin group mentioned Haken also based mechanism
A gas discharge lead ion
Under influence ion accelerated producing ion lead increase local current etc
The resistance current supply global voltage breakdown restrict process
The formation localization lightning base
Whether resulting pattern stable oscillating depends relation time constant
If antagonistic reaction longer time constant reaction oscillation activation occur
An example time course infection The infection virus could sufficient trigger sickness since virus replicate
The antagonistic reaction mediated immune system much slower
It take day become sick week become healthy
What appears first inspection disadvantage fact good strategy
If immune system would much faster equilibrium virus production virus removal would established
After single infection would fight rest life virus
However due mode become sick short virus subsequently completely eliminated
This example also convenient illustrate spread moderately antagonistic reaction must local condition completely contrary condition making stable pattern space
This clearly satisfied case infection virus spread immune reaction local
Therefore infection occur epidemic wave
The true forest fire
Burning process since heat release burnable gas lead higher temperature triggering burning adjacent tree
etc
The antagonistic reaction result fire longer sustained ash antagonistic effect local
End contribution anonymous reviewer
One note caution concerning interpretation may order

They reconfigure changing demand thus keep functioning spite perturbation
Because used paradigm design adaptive robust artificial system Gershenson
The main idea engineer element system find solution perform desired function
This approach useful large problem domain solution fixed unknown
Thus engineer need reach solution sought constantly element

Do understand collaboration
Thanks research group dynamic understand group interact much better thought
I ask understand group interaction
Is ideal group size
What best balance independence
Is group interaction better worse design pattern group activity
We defined paradigm productive unproductive group interaction
Our challenge come fact model scale
It also reason suggested agile team size seven people plus minus two team member
As group size increase complexity line communication
A team six people line communication team seven people team nine people line communication member group produce n line communication
Yet spite problem complexity line communication colony ant reaching million worker interact fine mayfly swarm fly
Both group organized around common goal
How possible line communication principle absolute
To state simply absolute
We change line communication adjusting group interacts
This concept applied swarm drone software

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I heard mentioned context Agile Extreme Programming
It seems complement pairing
What exactly
When applied
How well
Instead everyone focusing different task everyone focus one task time completed
Then move next thing work together
This help team struggle completing story end sprint
Often team finish story none complete
This le useful completely finishing story since unfinished story effectively value end user
It easier get story completed everyone team focusing one story time
This motivation behind swarming
There difficulty
For instance QA ca always test thing built even designed
In case establish design together early QA write initially failing test design actual implementation
Swarming refers fact multiple people work together complete task story
In experience something often
Typically member team work different task different story
If someone falling behind desire finish task story early people stop working task swarm complete task mean work together single task story completed
We recently small number story fairly boring uninteresting work
I gave team small incentive pizza deadline end day finish work swarmed story knocked least couple day work one afternoon
They got work done way early team member went back whatever working
They got free lunch I got work done early could dragged due dull nature team got ahead sprint

Swarming nothing fancy term hey let u help
Swarming actually central concept agility
It something done problem
Swarming simplest form mean team work collaboratively item story work completion
The core concept quit starting start finishing
In word instead every developer working independently story team focus limited set together get item done sooner
Think difference system
If User Story task must done one hour assuming complication one developer could work task sequentially complete story hour two week given day sprint dev hour per day
What two developer split task worked concurrently
The hour work completed way one week
Add third see might done day
Swarming done several way Teams give story every developer tend much work progress WIP often many story get started done
This NOT best practice
Teams swarm tend le WIP complete story done I mean Developed Tested Approved ready deploy
Thus practice core agility
The following InfoQ describes one approach swarming Read article detailed explanation

exhibited entity particularly animal similar size aggregate together perhaps milling spot perhaps moving direction
It highly interdisciplinary topic
As term applied particularly insect also applied entity animal exhibit swarm behaviour
The term usually used refer specifically swarm behaviour bird refer swarm behaviour refer swarm behaviour fish
also gather huge swarm called although organism way animal
By extension term swarm applied also inanimate entity exhibit parallel behaviour swarm star
From abstract point view swarm behaviour collective motion large number
From perspective mathematical modeller behaviour arising simple rule followed individual involve central coordination
Swarm behaviour also studied physicist phenomenon requires development tool beyond available system thermodynamic equilibrium
Swarm behaviour first simulated computer simulation program
This program simulates simple boids allowed move according set basic rule
The model originally designed mimic flocking behaviour bird applied also schooling fish swarming entity
In recent decade scientist turned modeling swarm behaviour gain deeper understanding behaviour
Early study swarm behaviour employed mathematical model simulate understand behaviour
The simplest mathematical model animal swarm generally represent individual animal following three rule The computer program created simulates swarm behaviour following rule
Many subsequent current model use variation rule often implementing mean concentric zone around animal
In close animal focal animal seek distance neighbour avoid collision
Slightly away focal animal seek align direction motion neighbour
In outermost extends far away focal animal able sense focal animal seek move towards neighbour
The shape zone necessarily affected sensory capability given animal
For example visual field bird extend behind body
Fish rely vision perception relayed Antarctic rely vision hydrodynamic signal relayed
However recent study starling flock shown bird modifies position relative six seven animal directly surrounding matter close far away animal
Interactions flocking starling thus based rule rather metric rule
It remains seen whether applies animal
Another recent study based analysis high speed camera footage flock Rome assuming minimal behavioural rule convincingly simulated number aspect flock behaviour
In order gain insight animal evolve swarming behaviour scientist turned evolutionary model simulate population evolving animal
Typically study use simulate many generation model
These study investigated number hypothesis explaining animal evolve swarming behaviour predator confusion effect dilution effect many eye theory
The concept property function found hierarchical level present irrelevant lower often basic principle behind
An example leading emergence natural world occurs ant colony
The queen give direct order tell ant
Instead ant reacts stimulus form chemical scent larva ant intruder food buildup waste leaf behind chemical trail turn provides stimulus ant
Here ant autonomous unit reacts depending local environment genetically encoded rule variety ant
Despite lack centralized decision making ant colony exhibit complex behaviour even able demonstrate ability solve geometric problem
For example colony routinely find maximum distance colony entrance dispose dead body
A key concept field swarm intelligence
Stigmergy mechanism indirect coordination agent action
The principle trace left environment action stimulates performance next action different agent
In way subsequent action tend reinforce build leading spontaneous emergence coherent apparently systematic activity
Stigmergy form
It produce complex seemingly intelligent structure without need planning control even direct communication agent
As support efficient collaboration extremely simple agent lack memory intelligence even awareness
system natural artificial
The concept employed work
The expression introduced Jing Wang context system
Swarm intelligence system typically made population simple interacting locally one another environment
The agent follow simple rule although centralized control structure dictating individual agent behave local certain degree random interaction agent lead intelligent global behaviour unknown individual agent
Swarm intelligence research multidisciplinary
It divided natural swarm research studying biological system artificial swarm research studying human artefact
There also scientific stream attempting model swarm system understand underlying mechanism engineering stream focused applying insight developed scientific stream solve practical problem area
Swarm algorithm follow Lagrangian approach approach
The Eulerian approach view swarm working density swarm deriving mean field property
It hydrodynamic approach useful modelling overall dynamic large swarm
However model work Lagrangian approach following individual agent point particle make swarm
Individual particle model follow information heading spacing lost Eulerian approach
widely used algorithm inspired behaviour ant effective solving problem related swarming
The algorithm initially proposed since diversified solve wider class numerical problem
Species multiple queen may queen leaving nest along worker found colony new site process akin
SPP concept introduced special case model introduced Reynolds
A swarm modelled SPP collection particle move constant speed respond random perturbation adopting time increment average direction motion particle local neighbourhood
Simulations demonstrate suitable nearest neighbour rule eventually result particle swarming together moving direction
This emerges even though centralized coordination even though neighbour particle constantly change time see interactive simulation box right
SPP model predict swarming animal share certain property group level regardless type animal swarm
Swarming system give rise occur many different scale turning universal robust
It become challenge theoretical physic find minimal statistical model capture behaviour
another algorithm widely used solve problem related swarm
It developed first aimed social behaviour choreography bird flock fish school
The algorithm simplified observed performing optimization
The system initially seed population random solution
It search successive generation using find best solution
The solution find called
Each particle store position well best solution achieved far
The particle swarm optimizer track obtained far particle local neighbourhood
The remaining particle move problem space following lead optimum particle
At time iteration particle swarm optimiser accelerates particle toward optimum location according simple
Particle swarm optimization applied many area
It parameter adjust version work well specific application also work well minor modification across range related application
A book Kennedy Eberhart describes philosophical aspect particle swarm optimization application swarm intelligence
An extensive survey application made Poli
Researchers Switzerland developed algorithm based kin selection
The algorithm show entity time evolve result effective swarm behaviour
Examples biological swarming found mold people
The behaviour insect live ant bee wasp termite always source fascination child naturalist artist
Individual insect seem thing without central control yet colony whole behaves highly coordinated manner
Researchers found cooperation colony level largely
The group coordination emerges often consequence way individual colony interact
These interaction remarkably simple one ant merely following trail left another ant
Yet put together cumulative effect behaviour solve highly complex problem locating shortest route network possible path food source
The organised behaviour emerges way sometimes called
Individual ant exhibit complex behaviour yet colony ant collectively achieves complex task constructing nest taking care young building bridge foraging food
A colony ant collectively select
send worker towards best closest food source several vicinity
Such collective decision achieved using positive feedback mechanism
Selection best food source achieved ant following two simple rule
First ant find food return nest depositing chemical
More pheromone laid higher quality food source
Thus two equidistant food source different quality found simultaneously pheromone trail better one stronger
Ants nest follow another simple rule favor stronger trail average
More ant follow stronger trail ant arrive high quality food source positive feedback cycle ensures resulting collective decision best food source
If two path ant nest food source colony usually selects shorter path
This ant first return nest food source likely took shorter path
More ant retrace shorter path reinforcing pheromone trail
The successful technique used colony studied computer science robotics produce distributed system solving problem
This area led study ant locomotion search engine make use foraging trail storage networking algorithm
When honey bee swarm emerges hive fly far first
They may gather tree branch meter hive
In new location bee cluster queen send scout bee find suitable new nest scout bee experienced forager cluster
An individual scout returning cluster promotes location found
She us dance similar indicate direction distance others cluster
The excited finding excitedly dance
If convince scout check location found may take check proposed site promote site upon return
Several different site may promoted different scout first
After several hour sometimes day slowly favourite location emerges decision making process
When scout agree final location whole cluster take fly
Sometimes decision reached swarm separate bee going one direction others going another
This usually result failure group dying
A swarm may fly kilometre scouted location though specie may establish new colony within little meter natal nest
This collective decision making process remarkably successful identifying suitable new nest site keeping swarm intact
A good nest site large enough accommodate swarm litre volume well protected element receive certain amount warmth sun height ground small entrance resist infestation ant hence tree often selected
Similar ant leave chemical trail faeces well emitting airborne swarming mating
Other cockroach follow trail discover source food water also discover cockroach hiding
Thus cockroach exhibit group swarm behaviour emerges simple set individual interaction
Cockroaches mainly nocturnal run away exposed light
A study tested hypothesis cockroach use two piece information decide go condition dark many cockroach
The study conducted José Halloy colleague European institution created set tiny appear roach roach thus alter roach perception
The robot also specially scented would accepted real roach
swarming phase family
Some specie breed rapidly suitable condition subsequently become gregarious migratory
They form band swarm travel great distance rapidly stripping field greatly
The largest swarm cover hundred square mile contain billion locust
A locust eat weight gram plant every day
That mean one million locust eat one ton food day largest swarm consume day
Swarming locust found associated increased level cause locust change colour eat much become mutually attracted breed much easily
Researchers propose swarming behaviour response overcrowding study shown increased tactile stimulation hind leg specie simply encountering individual cause increase level serotonin
The transformation locust swarming variety induced several contact per minute period
Notably innate predisposition aggregate found hatchling desert locust independent parental phase
An individual locust response loss alignment group appears increase randomness motion aligned state achieved
This alignment appears intrinsic characteristic collective coherent motion
seasonal movement particularly specie
The distance vary specie specie case movement involve large number individual
In case individual migrate one direction may return next generation may instead migrate opposite direction
This significant difference
especially noted lengthy annual migration
In North America make massive southward migration starting August first frost
A northward migration take place spring
The monarch butterfly migrates north south bird regular basis
But single individual make entire round trip
Female monarch deposit egg next generation migration
The length journey exceeds normal lifespan monarch le two month butterfly born early summer
The last generation summer enters phase known may live seven month
During diapause butterfly fly one many overwintering site
The generation overwinters generally reproduce leaf overwintering site sometime February March
It second third fourth generation return northern location United States Canada spring
How specie manages return overwintering spot gap several generation still subject research flight pattern appear inherited based combination position sun sky Sun compass depends upon based antenna
Approximately world bird specie migrant
The primary motivation migration appears food example hummingbird choose migrate fed winter
Also longer day northern summer provide extended time bird feed young
This help bird produce larger related specie remain tropic
As day shorten autumn bird return warmer region available food supply varies little season
These advantage offset high stress physical exertion cost risk migration predation
Many bird migrate flock
For larger bird assumed flying flock reduces energy cost
The V formation often supposed boost efficiency range flying bird particularly long route
All bird except first fly one bird ahead
The upwash assist bird supporting weight flight way climb maintain height indefinitely rising air
Geese flying save energy flying updraft wingtip vortex generated previous animal formation
Thus bird flying behind need work hard achieve lift
Studies show bird V formation place roughly optimum distance predicted simple aerodynamic theory
Geese may conserve energy would need fly alone
found radar study fly km per hour faster flock flying alone
The bird flying tip front rotated timely cyclical fashion spread flight equally among flock member
The formation also make communication easier allows bird maintain visual contact
Other animal may use similar drafting technique migrating
example migrate close formation lobster train sometimes hundred mile
The Mediterranean sea present major obstacle soaring bird must cross narrowest point
Massive number large stork pas area migration time
More common specie counted hundred thousand autumn
Other barrier mountain range also cause funnelling particularly large diurnal migrant
This notable factor migratory bottleneck
This concentration bird migration put specie risk
Some spectacular migrant already gone extinct notable
During migration flock mile km wide mile km long taking several day pas containing billion bird
The term shoal used describe group fish including group school used closely knit group specie swimming highly synchronised polarised manner
Fish derive many benefit shoaling behaviour including defence predator better predator detection diluting chance capture enhanced success higher success finding mate
It also likely fish benefit shoal membership increased efficiency
Fish use many trait choose shoalmates
Generally prefer larger shoal shoalmates specie shoalmates similar size appearance healthy fish kin recognised
The oddity effect posit shoal member stand appearance preferentially targeted predator
This may explain fish prefer shoal individual resemble
The oddity effect would thus tend homogenise shoal
One puzzling aspect shoal selection fish choose join shoal animal similar given know appearance
Experiments shown shoal preference learned ability innate
A zebrafish tends associate shoal resemble shoal reared form
Other open question shoaling behaviour include identifying individual responsible direction shoal movement
In case movement member shoal seem know going
In case foraging behaviour captive shoal kind led small number experienced individual knew food available
Radakov estimated herring school North Atlantic occupy cubic kilometre fish density metre
That several billion fish one school
Between May July huge number spawn cool water follow current cold water northward along east coast South Africa
This great migration called creates spectacular feeding frenzy along coastline marine predator dolphin shark gannet attack school
Most small form large swarm sometimes reaching density individual animal per cubic metre
Swarming defensive mechanism confusing smaller predator would like pick single individual
The largest swarm visible space tracked satellite
One swarm observed cover area square kilometer square mile ocean depth meter foot estimated contain million ton krill
Recent research suggests krill simply drift passively current actually modify
Krill typically follow
By moving vertically ocean cycle swarm play major part mixing deeper water water surface
Until recently assumed spend day greater depth rise night toward surface
It found deeper go reduce activity apparently reduce encounter predator conserve energy
Later work suggested swimming activity krill varied stomach fullness
Satiated animal feeding surface swim le actively therefor sink mixed layer
As sink produce faeces may mean important role play Antarctic carbon cycle
Krill empty stomach found swim actively thus head towards surface
This implies vertical migration may occurrence
Some specie form surface swarm day feeding reproductive purpose even though behaviour dangerous make extremely vulnerable predator
Dense swarm may elicit among fish bird mammal predator especially near surface
When disturbed swarm scatter individual even observed instantaneously leaving behind decoy
In Gandomi Alavi presented appears modelling behaviour krill swarm
The algorithm based three main factor movement induced presence individual ii foraging activity iii random diffusion
group tiny found sea lake
Many specie drifting sea water others living ocean floor
Copepods typically millimetre long teardrop shaped body large
Although like crustacean armoured small specie thin armour entire body almost totally transparent
Copepods compound median single eye usually bright red centre transparent head
Copepods also swarm
For example monospecific swarm observed regularly around lake
Swarms density one million copepod per cubic metre
Typical swarm one two metre diameter exceeded cubic metre
Copepods need visual contact keep together disperse night
Spring produce swarming provide food copepod
Planktonic copepod usually dominant member turn major food organism many marine animal
In particular copepod prey assemble vast swarm
Some copepod extremely fast predator sensed jump high speed millimetre see animated image
Photo School herring swarm copepod

Swarms also prey copepod Planktonic copepod important
Some scientist say form largest animal earth
They compete title
Because smaller size relatively faster growth rate however evenly distributed throughout world ocean copepod almost certainly contribute far world ocean global ocean perhaps group organism together
The surface layer ocean currently believed world largest carbon sink absorbing billion ton carbon year equivalent perhaps third thus reducing impact
Many planktonic copepod feed near surface night sink deeper water day avoid visual predator
Their moulted exoskeleton faecal pellet respiration depth bring carbon deep sea
Many organism called live ocean lake
When certain condition present high nutrient light level organism reproduce explosively
The resulting dense swarm phytoplankton called
Blooms cover hundred square kilometre easily seen satellite image
Individual phytoplankton rarely live day bloom last week
Scientists attributed swarm behavior plant hundred year
In book wrote plant growth resembled swarm observed elsewhere nature
While referring broad observation plant morphology focused root shoot behavior recent research supported claim
Roots particular display observable swarm behavior growing pattern exceed statistical threshold random probability indicate presence communication individual root apex
The primary function plant root uptake soil nutrient purpose drive swarm behavior
Plants growing close proximity adapted growth assure optimal nutrient availability
This accomplished growing direction optimizes distance nearby root thereby increasing chance exploiting untapped nutrient reserve
The action behavior take two form maximization distance repulsion neighboring root apex
The transition zone root tip largely responsible monitoring presence hormone signaling responsive growth pattern appropriate
Plant response often complex integrating multiple input inform autonomous response
Additional input inform swarm growth includes light gravity also monitored transition zone root apex
These force act inform number growing main root exhibit independent release inhibitory chemical establish appropriate spacing thereby contributing swarm behavior pattern
Horizontal growth root whether response high mineral content soil due growth produce branched growth establish also form independent root swarm
Swarming also used describe grouping kind
Myxobacteria swarm together wolf pack actively moving using process known keeping together help intercellular molecular
A collection people also exhibit swarm behaviour pedestrian soldier swarming parapet

The group people exhibited similar behavioural pattern flock five percent flock changed direction others would follow
If one person designated predator everyone else avoid flock behaved much like school fish

One hot topic computer science study unconventional form computation
This motivated two line thought
The first computer hugely energy eight order magnitude worse theoretically possible
The second evolved many much efficient form computation specific task pattern recognition
Clearly ought able much interest different way thing
Various group tried computing exotic substance even single celled organism called
Today look one curious variation computer exploit swarming behaviour soldier crab
First little background theory behind idea
Back early couple computer Fredkin Tommaso might possible build computer billiard ball
The idea channel would carry information encoded form presence absence billiard ball
This information processed gate billiard ball either collide emerge direction result ballistics collision collide emerge velocity
Now Gunji Kobe University Japan couple pal built essentially billiard ball computer using soldier crab
We demonstrate swarm soldier crab implement logical gate placed geometrically constrained environment say
These creature seem uniquely suited form information processing
They live sand tidal lagoon emerge low tide swarm hundred thousand
What interesting crab appear demonstrate two distinct form behaviour
When middle swarm simply follow whoever nearby
But find edge swarm change
Suddenly become aggressive leader charge watery distance swarm tow accident turbulence find inside swarm
This turn hugely robust behaviour easily controlled
When placed next wall leader always follow wall direction controlled shadowing swarm mimic presence predatory bird eat crab
Under condition swarm crab follow wall like rolling billiard ball
So happens two crab ball collide
According Gunji co experiment ball merge continue direction sum velocity
What behaviour remarkably robust noise largely crab individual behaviour generates noise indistinguishable external noise
These creature evolved cope noise
That immediately suggested potential application computing say Gunji co
If ball crab behave like billiard ball straightforward build pattern channel act like logic gate
And exactly Gunji co done
These guy first simulated behaviour soldier crab computer special pattern channel
Then built one lab test idea real crab
To fair result mixed
While Gunji co found could build decent OR gate using soldier crab much le reliable
However early day say may possible produce better result making condition inside computer
No crab harmed making computer say Gunji So computer information carrier swarming ball soldier crab

I currently studying compiler construction book Compilers Principles Techniques Tools Edition page
understand kind method
E conversion pair
technical term associated
I know proper name seeing standard way lexically analyze text
You divide token specific type
For sake parsing next step parsing chain need lexeme step road need know semantic content sometimes called lexeme
For example parser care number need know number
Further road suffice know number
Even would need know integer specifically
Some lexeme example various operator though principle could group say together
We need separate syntactically different different due operator precedence
These need annotation

I problem catch real meaning term
In term software development define generically
Does different meaning term different context language
Thanks
If google get amongst others following two definition seem applicable If combine two land somewhere near commonly meant talking token programming
Pretty vague yes used many different context
One example authentication system user log
When system authenticated user instead repeating process every request token created represents fact user authenticated
This token used subsequent request
In case fact user authenticated token represents fact
Tokens identifier keywords literal operator punctuators
But ca consider White space comment token though act separator token
One meaning term Software Development authentication signature issued server defined time interval In compiler Lexical analyzer scanner Reads input stream fuse character source text token language
sequence character collective meaning
The character sequence forming token called
Consider following assignment statement newvalue oldvalue rate The lexical analyzer generate following token
A token object value Wikipedia disambiguation term refer Computing section Token seen seal middle age courrier representig king duke bishop pope anything went riding realm realm needed authenticated true representative claim passing gate kingdom

already pointed several definition add
In security protocol one side want make sure side opposed impostor one side previous session
Replay attack generally carried unauthorized user replaying session legitimate user try imitate
So first side sends number string supposed parrot back either securely performing kind transformation preferably requiring secret side expected
Both original item transformed item sometimes called token
However cause confusion cryptographic token RSA keyfobs generally use algorithm determine proper response display human type
So sense term often used like nonce challenge original simply response answer transformed version
Then computer networking
Granted exactly programming got program network work overlap
One style networking flow control generally considered obsolete called
Rather configuration common Ethernet day token ring arranged surprise surprise ring formation
Each station could essentially agreement among station
long since looked sure whether supposed station designate current
When done limit would token next workstation along ring defined direction
This referring seemed associated rather likely something else
As see one many word huge number definition
think least English many word could make meaning would ruin SO many good
Smallest individual element program called Token
Everything see inside program token
There generally five type token Keyword reserved word whose meaning already defined programming language
We use keyword purpose inside programming
Every programming language set keywords
Examples int void return etc Note These keywords common C C influenced language
Identifiers name given different programming element
Either name given variable function programming element follow basic naming convention listed num Num etc
number add num etc
Operators symbol given arithmetical logical operation
Various programming language provides various set operator
Separators used separate different programming element
The various type separator used programming Space Tab New line
Literals constant value used performing various operation calculation
There basically three type literal Still question
Ask

A token special frame passed node node around ring network
When get node need transmit data node change token data frame transmits recipient
A token essential inner working token ring network
The token handled single node time
The bearer token one allowed send data around network recipient node within network
The bearer token writes address recipient data sent sends next node series
When sender node sends token next node node read address
If node intended recipient sends data next node
Finally recipient node read data know recipient take data sends token back sender address message indicating data received
The token sent around ring reach token
After using token node release back network node able use
Although token ring transmission seems slow process user rarely notice data communication occurs rapidly

I want understand authentication mean
I searched internet could find anything understandable
I think well explained quoting key sentence long article The general concept behind authentication system simple
Allow user enter username password order obtain token allows fetch specific resource without using username password
Once token obtained user offer token offer access specific resource time period remote site
In word add one level indirection authentication instead authenticate username password protected resource user authenticates way within session limited duration obtains token return us token authentication session
Advantages many user could pas token obtained automated system willing trust limited time limited set resource would willing trust username password every resource allowed access forevermore least change password
If anything still unclear please edit question clarify WHAT clear I sure help
From Authentication relies signed token sent server request
What benefit using approach
cooky CORS play well across different domain
A approach allows make AJAX call server domain use HTTP header transmit user information
need keep session store token entity conveys user information
The rest state life cooky local storage client side
serve asset app CDN
javascript HTML image etc
server side API
tied particular authentication scheme
The token might generated anywhere hence API called anywhere single way authenticating call
start working native platform iOS Android Windows etc
cooky ideal consuming approach simplifies lot
since relying cooky need protect cross site request
would possible sib site generate POST request existing authentication cookie none
presenting hard perf benchmark network roundtrip
finding session database likely take time calculating validate token parsing content
A piece data could possibly created contains enough data identify particular user
You might present login information ask might present ask perform action
created using various combination various technique field cryptography well input wider field security research
If decide go create system best really smart
A token piece data created server contains information identify particular user token validity
The token contain user information well special token code user pas server every method support authentication instead passing username password directly
authentication security technique authenticates user attempt log server network secure system using security token provided server
An authentication successful user prove server valid user passing security token
The service validates security token process user request
After token validated service used establish security context client service make authorization decision audit activity successive user request
The question old technology advanced current state JSON Web Token JWT open standard RFC passing claim party web application environment
The token designed compact usable especially web browser single SSO context
It string character associated user database way
That token used authorize user access related content application
To retrieve token client side login required
After first time login need save retrieved token data like session session id everything token access resource application
Token used assure authenticity user
When register new website often sent email activate account
That email typically contains link click
Part link contains token server know token associate account
The token would usually expiry date associated may hour click link activate account
None would possible cooky session variable since unknown device browser customer using check email

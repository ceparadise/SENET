In data element made available time
A stream thought item processed one time rather large batch
Streams processed differently normal function operate stream whole potentially unlimited data formally stream potentially unlimited data finite
Functions operate stream producing another stream known connected analogously
Filters may operate one item stream time may base item output multiple item input
The term stream used number similar way Streams used underlying data type
The term stream also applied multiple set data associated single filename
Most often one main stream make normal file data additional stream contain
Here stream used indicate variable size data opposed fixed size metadata differs stream used otherwise meaning data available time potentially infinite

This guide designed help understand difference parallel serial interface including SCSI ATA SAS SATA
For year parallel interface widely used system
The need increased flexibility storage system made standard inefficient option
A parallel interface channel capable transferring data parallel mode transmitting multiple bit simultaneously
Almost personal computer come least one parallel interface
Common parallel interface include SCSI ATA
Short small computer system interface parallel interface standard used Apple Macintosh computer PCs many UNIX system attaching peripheral device computer
Nearly Apple Macintosh computer excluding earliest Macs recent iMac come SCSI port attaching device disk drive printer
SCSI interface provide data transmission rate megabyte per second
Also known IDE ATA disk drive implementation integrates controller disk drive
ATA used connect hard disk drive drive similar peripheral support interface transfer
So parallel interface SAS SATA drive
A lot actually
It architectural limitation parallel interface serial technology like SAS SATA address
In contrast multiple parallel data stream data transmitted serially single steam wrapping multiple bit packet able move single stream faster parallel technology
Abbreviated SAS Serial Attached SCSI evolution parallel SCSI serial peripheral interface controller linked directly disk drive
SAS performance improvement traditional SCSI SAS enables multiple device different size type connected simultaneously thinner longer cable signal transmission support
In addition SAS drive
Often abbreviated SATA Serial ATA evolution Parallel ATA physical storage interface
Serial ATA serial link single cable minimum four wire creates connection device
Transfer rate Serial ATA begin
Starting SATA extends capability ATA offer transfer rate starting year development moved mainstream disk interface
The successor SCSI interface SAS speed
Additionally also address parallel interface issue drive addressability limitation number device per port connection
SAS device communicate SATA SCSI device backplanes SAS device identical SATA device
A key difference SCSI SAS device addition SAS device two data port resides different SAS domain
This enables complete failover redundancy
If one path fails still communication along separate independent path
Another big advantage SATA ATA cabling connector
The serial interface reduces amount wire needed transmit data making much smaller cable size making easier route install SATA device
The IDE cable used parallel ATA system bulkier Serial ATA cable extend long Serial ATA cable extend one meter
In addition cabling new design connector also used reduces amount crosstalk wire connector design also provides easier routing better air flow
Serial interface offer improvement older parallel SCSI serial version storage application environment
These benefit include better performance better scalability also better reliability parallel interface limit speed reliable data transfer
SAS SATA drive also operate environment SCSI ATA
For example using faster SAS drive primary storage offloading older data cheaper SATA disk subsystem something could achieved SCSI ATA

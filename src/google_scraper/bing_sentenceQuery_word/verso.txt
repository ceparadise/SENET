discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major

Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

These day almost TOO many choice degree

The major
It asks whether every problem whose solution quickly verified technically verified also solved quickly polynomial time
The underlying issue first discussed letter
The precise statement P versus NP problem introduced seminal paper The complexity theorem proving procedure considered many important open problem
It one seven selected carry US prize first correct solution
The informal term used mean existence algorithm solving task run time complete task varies polynomial function size input algorithm opposed say
The general class question algorithm provide answer polynomial time called class
For question known way find answer quickly one provided information showing answer possible verify answer quickly
The class question answer polynomial time called stand nondeterministic polynomial time
Consider example problem easy verify whose answer may difficult compute
Given partially Sudoku grid size least one legal solution
A proposed solution easily verified time check solution grows slowly polynomially grid get bigger
However known algorithm finding solution take difficult example time grows grid get bigger
So Sudoku quickly checkable seem quickly solvable
Thousands problem seem similar fast check slow solve
Researchers shown fast solution one problem could used build quick solution others property called
Decades searching yielded fast solution problem scientist suspect none problem solved quickly
However never proven
An answer question would determine whether problem verified polynomial time like Sudoku also solved polynomial time
If turned would mean problem harder compute verify could solved polynomial time answer could verified polynomial time
Aside important problem computational theory proof either way would profound implication mathematics cryptography algorithm research multimedia processing many field
Although versus problem formally defined previous inkling problem involved difficulty proof potential consequence
In mathematician John Nash wrote letter NSA speculated cracking sufficiently complex code would require time exponential length key
If proved Nash suitably skeptical would imply today would call since proposed key easily verified polynomial time
Another mention underlying problem occurred letter written
Gödel asked whether known could solved pointed one important discovery mathematical proof could automated
The relation studied part dealing resource required computation solve given problem
The common resource time many step take solve problem space much memory take solve problem
In analysis model computer time must analyzed required
Typically model assume computer given computer present state input one possible action computer might take performs action one
In theory class consists defined solved deterministic sequential machine amount time size input class consists decision problem whose positive solution verified given right information equivalently whose solution found polynomial time machine
Clearly
Arguably biggest open question concern relationship two class In poll researcher believed answer believed answer yes unsure believed question may currently accepted axiom therefore impossible prove disprove
In year later poll repeated
The number researcher answered believed answer believed answer yes believed question may currently accepted axiom therefore impossible prove disprove said either know care want answer yes problem resolved
To attack question concept useful
problem set problem reduced polynomial time whose solution may still verified polynomial time
That problem transformed problem
Informally problem problem least tough problem
problem least hard problem problem reduced polynomial time
problem need need solution verifiable polynomial time
For instance instance problem transformed mechanically instance Boolean satisfiability problem polynomial time
The Boolean satisfiability problem one many problem
If problem would follow
However many important problem shown fast algorithm known
Based definition alone obvious problem exist however trivial contrived problem formulated follows given description M guaranteed halt polynomial time exist input M accept
It given input simple check whether M accepts input simulating M verifier particular instance problem encoded machine M take solution verified input
Then question whether instance yes instance determined whether valid input exists
The first natural problem proven
As noted proof satisfiability contains technical detail Turing machine relate definition
However problem proved provided simpler way show many problem also including discussed earlier
In case proof show could solve Sudoku polynomial time could use complete polynomial time
This turn give solution problem partitioning triangle could used find solution provides solution general boolean satisfiability
So polynomial time solution Sudoku lead series mechanical transformation polynomial time solution satisfiability turn used solve problem polynomial time
Using transformation like vast class seemingly unrelated problem reducible one another sense problem
Although unknown whether problem outside known
A number succinct problem problem operate normal input computational description input known
Because shown problem outside require polynomial time
In fact solved significantly le exponential time
Examples include finding perfect strategy chess board board game
The problem deciding truth statement requires even time
Fischer proved every algorithm decides truth Presburger statement length runtime least constant
Hence problem known need exponential run time
Even difficult
They completely solved algorithm sense particular algorithm least one input algorithm produce right answer either produce wrong answer finish without giving conclusive answer otherwise run forever without producing answer
It also possible consider question decision problem
One class consisting counting problem called whereas problem asks Are solution
corresponding problem asks How many solution
Clearly problem must least hard corresponding problem since count possible solution immediately tell least one solution exists count greater zero
Surprisingly problem believed difficult correspond easy example problem
For problem easy tell whether solution exist thought hard tell many
Many problem hence among hardest problem since polynomial time solution would allow polynomial time solution problem
It shown Ladner exist problem neither
Such problem called problem
The example problem believed
They problem known
The computational problem determining whether two finite
An important unsolved problem complexity theory whether graph isomorphism problem
The answer known believed problem least
If graph isomorphism collapse second level
Since widely believed polynomial hierarchy collapse finite level believed graph isomorphism
The best algorithm problem due run time graph vertex
The computational problem determining given integer
Phrased decision problem problem deciding whether input factor le
No efficient integer factorization algorithm known fact form basis several modern cryptographic system algorithm
The integer factorization problem even
If problem polynomial time hierarchy collapse first level
The best known algorithm integer factorization take expected time factor integer
However best known problem run polynomial time although indicate problem lie respect complexity class
All discussion assumed mean easy mean hard assumption known
It common reasonably accurate assumption complexity theory however caveat
First always true practice
A theoretical polynomial algorithm may extremely large constant factor exponent thus rendering impractical
On hand even problem shown even may still effective approach tackling problem practice
There algorithm many problem solve optimality many instance reasonable time
The empirical time problem size algorithm surprisingly low
An example work surprisingly well practice despite exponential run par best known algorithm
Second type computation conform Turing machine model defined
According poll computer scientist believe
A key reason belief decade studying problem one able find algorithm important known problem see
These algorithm sought long concept even defined among first found existing problem time shown
Furthermore result would imply many startling result currently believed false
It also intuitively argued existence problem hard solve solution easy verify match experience
If world would profoundly different place usually assume
There would special value creative leap fundamental gap solving problem recognizing solution found
On hand researcher believe overconfidence believing researcher explore proof well
For example statement made The main argument favor total lack fundamental progress area exhaustive search
This opinion weak argument
The space algorithm large beginning exploration
The resolution also show simple question may settled deep theory
Being attached speculation good guide research planning
One always try direction every problem
Prejudice caused famous mathematician fail solve famous problem whose solution opposite expectation even though developed method required
One reason problem attracts much attention consequence answer
Either direction resolution would advance theory enormously perhaps huge practical consequence well
A proof could stunning practical consequence proof lead efficient method solving important problem
It also possible proof would lead directly efficient method perhaps proof size bounding polynomial big efficient practice
The consequence positive negative arise since various problem fundamental many field
Cryptography example relies certain problem difficult
A constructive efficient solution problem would break existing cryptosystems including These would need modified replaced solution inherently based equivalence
On hand enormous positive consequence would follow rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problem
For instance many problem type
Efficient solution problem would enormous implication logistics
Many important problem problem also problem efficiently solvable could spur considerable advance life science biotechnology
But change may pale significance compared revolution efficient method solving problem would cause mathematics
Gödel early thought computational complexity noted mechanical method could solve problem would revolutionize mathematics If really machine φ n k n even k n would consequence greatest importance
Namely would obviously mean spite undecidability mental work mathematician concerning question could completely replaced machine
After one would simply choose natural number n large machine deliver result make sense think problem
Similarly say would transform mathematics allowing computer find formal proof theorem proof reasonable length since formal proof easily recognized polynomial time
Example problem may well include
Research mathematician spend career trying prove theorem proof taken decade even century find problem instance took three century prove
A method guaranteed find proof theorem one exist reasonable size would essentially end struggle
stated come believe P NP reserved impact possible proof I believe equality P NP turn helpful even proved proof almost surely nonconstructive
A proof showed would lack practical computational benefit proof would nevertheless represent significant advance computational complexity theory provide guidance future research
It would allow one show formal way many common problem solved efficiently attention researcher focused partial solution solution problem
Due widespread belief much focusing research already taken place
Also still leaf open hard problem
For example possible SAT requires exponential time worst case almost randomly selected instance efficiently solvable
described five hypothetical world could result different possible resolution complexity question
These range Algorithmica problem like SAT solved efficiently instance Cryptomania generating hard instance problem outside easy three intermediate possibility reflecting different possible distribution difficulty instance problem
The world problem tractable average case called Heuristica paper
A workshop studied status five world
Although problem remains open despite prize huge amount dedicated research effort solve problem led several new technique
In particular fruitful research related problem showing existing proof technique powerful enough answer question thus suggesting novel technical approach required
As additional evidence difficulty problem essentially known proof technique fall one following classification known insufficient prove These barrier another reason problem useful algorithm demonstrated problem would solve problem way excluded result
These barrier also led computer scientist suggest versus problem may standard axiom system like proved disproved within
The interpretation independence result could either algorithm exists problem proof constructed
ZFC algorithm problem may exist impossible prove ZFC algorithm correct
However shown using technique sort currently known applicable problem decided even much weaker assumption extending PA integer arithmetic would necessarily exist algorithm every problem
Therefore one belief complexity theorist problem efficient algorithm would follow proof independence using technique possible
Additionally result implies proving independence PA ZFC using currently known technique easier proving existence efficient algorithm problem
While versus problem generally considered unsolved many amateur professional researcher claimed solution
comprehensive list
As list contained purported proof
An August claim proof Vinay Deolalikar researcher received heavy Internet press attention initially described relatively serious attempt two leading specialist
The proof reviewed publicly academic expert field pointed two possibly fatal error proof
In September Deolalikar reported working detailed expansion attempted proof
However opinion expressed several notable theoretical computer scientist indicate attempted proof neither correct significant advancement understanding problem
This assessment prompted May article call proof attempt thoroughly discredited
The problem restated term expressible certain class logical statement result work
Consider language finite structure fixed including relation
Then language expressed addition suitable least
Effectively combination order allows definition recursive function
As long signature contains least one predicate function addition distinguished order relation amount space taken store finite structure actually polynomial number element structure precisely characterizes
Similarly set language expressible existential logic restricted exclude relation function subset
The language correspond logic
Thus question proper subset reformulated existential logic able describe language finite linearly ordered structure nontrivial signature logic least fixed point
The word existential even dropped previous characterization since former would establish turn implies
No algorithm problem known run polynomial time
However algorithm known problem property algorithm run polynomial time accepting instance although enormous constant making algorithm impractical
However algorithm qualify polynomial time running time rejecting instance polynomial
The following algorithm due without citation example
It correctly accepts language
It run polynomial time input If algorithm accepting language
Accepting mean give yes answer polynomial time allowed run forever answer also known
This algorithm enormously impractical even
If shortest program solve polynomial time bit long algorithm try least program first
Conceptually speaking problem take input alphabet Σ output yes
If say unbounded memory produce correct answer input string length step constant independent input string say problem solved place class
Formally defined set language decided deterministic Turing machine
That deterministic Turing machine deterministic Turing machine satisfies following two condition defined similarly using nondeterministic Turing machine traditional way
However modern approach define use concept
Formally defined set language finite alphabet verifier run polynomial time notion verifier defined follows
Let language finite alphabet Σ
exists binary relation positive integer following two condition satisfied A Turing machine decides called called
In general verifier
However must verifier run polynomial time
Let Clearly question whether given equivalent question whether member COMPOSITE
It shown COMPOSITE verifying satisfies definition identify natural number binary representation
COMPOSITE also happens
There many equivalent way describing
Let language finite alphabet following two condition satisfied Alternatively another problem reduced
This common way proving new problem

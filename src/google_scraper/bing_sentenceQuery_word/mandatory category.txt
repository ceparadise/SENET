New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio city investing million establish computer science instruction every public school city
This announcement impressive hardly surprising u watching computer science education landscape evolve rapidly last eight year
Interest computer science CS university level declined bust came back vengeance
Since student enrollment computer science increasing
As professor computer science worked extensively improve CS education undergraduate graduate level I know many want go field computer science
The number female student racial minority remain distressingly low
But often student preparation encouragement succeed work
So challenge expanding computer science education public school system
The start new millennium saw many ups down area computer science
Enrollment computer science computer engineering degree peaked height That year survey university computing department conducted Computing Research Association reported undergraduate major institution
But soon bust number new major dropped rapidly
By Taulbee survey reported undergraduate institution
Despite tech downturn following bust computing industry grew rapidly throughout
So computing industry sounding alarm dire shortage trained computing professional
Indeed year Bureau Labor Statistics predicted computing would professional sector projected growth rate
Starting u academia started notice student class lot
In spring I undergraduate program director UMBC CS program held emergency meeting decide handle fact section required discrete math class waiting list
We debated whether start real trend blip
Within year two every computer science professor country knew blip
As scrambled hire faculty increase class size try find way accommodate increasingly long waiting list student kept coming
In recent Taulbee survey reported nearly major computer science computer engineering another information science category reported earlier Taulbee survey increase remarkable seven year since enrollment low
But face many challenge
Often student want major computer science computational thinking mathematical preparation succeed coursework
We also enough broaden interest computing percentage female computer science CS major remains low several racial minority also significantly underrepresented African Americans representing estimated major Hispanics representing around
According nonprofit focused expanding access computing education school state permit computer science class count toward high school graduation usually math science technology education credit compared nine state
No state however actually require computer science class graduation
As result vast majority student take even single computer science course throughout education principal report school offer CS course includes programming high school certified offer AP computer science fewer student took AP CS exam representing fewer AP exam student leave high school little knowledge computational thinking design
The good news many state moving rapidly expand instruction computing education
In Chicago announced comprehensive plan establish computer science instruction every public school starting elementary school
Since San Francisco New York City joined rank
Arkansas recently became first state announce offer computer science class
Even state fully adopted statewide universal computer science education
On average state adopted recommended learning standard developed Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA premier professional organization computing education
Although state adopted elementary school standard grade nearly half state adopted high school standard grade
Moreover standard adopted state focus skill abstract computational concept therefore prepare student well advanced computing course
An additional concern broadening computing education challenge finding qualified teacher
Arkansas example scrambling hire train enough qualified teacher
As Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson stated time new mandate became law high school teacher across entire state actually prepared teach computer science
This gap desire computer science class availability prepared teacher exists across country
Standards teaching computer science also either lacking consistent across state boundary
A Association Computing Machinery ACM CSTA state two state District Columbia specifically require CS certification teach computer science class
An additional seven state require CS certification teach Advanced Placement computer science
In state teaching certification computer science CS offered mandated state certification system ineffective program offered information readily available requirement complex understood met teacher incentive obtain CS certification order teach CS class
Moreover demand computer science class increase teacher field little computer science background tapped teach class
The computer science education community working develop consistent standard across state boundary
In meantime concern emerging
For example requiring certification exacerbate teacher shortage problem many computer science course currently taught teacher without computer science certification
There also real growing concern attracting keeping highly qualified teacher since teacher also get hired industry
While great deal progress since still long way go

A program focus computer theory computing problem solution design computer system user interface scientific perspective
Includes instruction principle computational science computer development programming application variety situation
A student majoring computer science must excel use computer physical science mathematics English
This student independent able concentrate able handle frustration effectively
The required elective course would take major vary considerably among institution
Courses listed illustrative breadth topic likely experience major field

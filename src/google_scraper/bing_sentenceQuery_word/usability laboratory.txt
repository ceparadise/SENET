A place done
It studied sake evaluating system
Depending kind system evaluated user sits front stand front system interface alongside give user task perform
Behind number watch interaction make note ensure activity
Very often testing observing room placed alongside
In case video audio observation transmitted wireless network broadcast via video monitor video beamer loudspeaker
Usually session interaction detail
defined effectively user use product brochure application website software package video game achieve goal
Usability testing practice used within field design user experience allows designer interact user directly product make necessary modification prototype product whether software device website
The purpose practice discover missed requirement kind development seen intuitive ended confusing new user
By testing user need interact product designer able ass product capacity meet intended purpose
Usability lab help optimize design work flow understanding voice customer understanding customer really
Through session specified location designer stakeholder anyone else involved project observing process customer interacts current
To understand user need engineer must observe people actually using computer system collect data system usability
usability testing usually small specific sample size better obtain qualitative data product
The participant cooperate engineer understand user interacts system tested testing
Through process developer able identify issue product
To aid fixing problem observer pay strict attention important customer response market
The cause failed design ad design decision usually attributed lack information
A poor user experience ruin product launch drive user away good impact reputation company
Usability test formal informal attempt gather data user experience interface Angelo device software site many
Usability test wide range involvement field product development
Usability lab usually feature two room
One room containing lab system tested usability necessary equipment device tracker
Here participant asked come provided task complete test specific idea product sometimes allowed explore product trying certain feature
In formal lab typically second room
Here observation room held allows stakeholder designer developer party involved project observe understand thing might found intuitive among team actually complex feature
Choosing participant lab testing involves consideration
Not anyone suitable participant test
It vital recruit participant similar site user usability testing
Developers designer user refrain using internal staff participant unless individual involvement design development site product represent target audience
It also good idea compensate participant taking time schedule involve self voluntary experiment however restriction
For example paid time
The number user test also important consideration recruiting participant
Usability test cost money resource unfortunately limited especially project
One effective approach consider using five participant
Zero user give zero insight
The moment single user observed lab setting insight product immediately gained
Features current design need redesigned revisited essentially fix anything helping user experience
However limit many user considered add user learn le le keep seeing thing
User research process observing understanding people interact different object everyday life
These range anywhere website software product hardware gadget

Digital Marketing Analytics Blog On blog talked often
Web Analytics usually simply help u understand What
Clickstream data typically tell u something happened
We stressed important know Why order derive actionable insight around customer behavior website outcome behavior
Essentially people weird stuff website clickstream tell u ask
That Eureka moment
Early blog I talked great way continuous listening methodology come website visitor
In post cover grand daddy UCD User Centric Design methodology Lab Usability Testing
Since many u Web Analytics community optimal awareness methodology go detail lab usability test conducted
Hopefully elevate awareness appear super smart next time someone invite u participate one
We cover From uber perspective User Research science observing monitoring interact everyday thing website software hardware drawing conclusion improve thing
Sometimes lab environment complete one way mirror camera pointed participant time people native environment office home etc
Lab usability test measure user ability complete task
In typical usability test user attempt complete task set task using web site software product
Each task specified goal effectiveness efficiency satisfaction identified specified context use
A typical study eight twelve participant participate test
Early test five user pattern begin emerge highlight part customer experience process working well causing problem
Lab test conducted User Centric Design Human Factors expert typically supported note taker
Key stake holder connected website product participate Observers job get close understanding customer experience
Stake holder business owner engineer developer web analyst product manager etc anyone something website customer experience
Tests conducted live version website beta version HTML PowerPoint prototype even paper printout
These paper prototype sometimes called approximate user might otherwise see computer screen save development team produce product
Usability test typically held specially designed room called usability lab
The lab split two room divided mirrored window allows observer watch test without seen test subject
However conduct usability lab without lab
All need room computer promise test observer remain silent test subject sight behind throughout test
As test subject work task test moderator observes
The moderator take note user action record whether participant able complete task length time taking step
While participant working task moderator limit interaction providing initial task instruction occasionally prompting participant explain comment
For example participant say easy moderator might say tell This neutral prompt encourages participant explain thought happened worked well
Because moderator make comment assist participant forced use would home complete task
All note taker busy taking comment session making note important point
Observers
Sometimes observer option interacting moderator ask participant question clarify something
Often time lab usability test also recorded video later review also present larger audience company
Usability test best optimizing UI design work flow understanding voice customer understanding customer really
There four different stage conducting successful Lab Usability test
The main step preparation phase The rubber hit road get see real people
The main step phase Main step phase Traditional role UCD Experts Researchers might end step I feel role continues post test result presentation collaborate business owner keep momentum business owner fix problem offer service UCD expertise partner website developer designer improve site experience
Finally forget measure success post implementation
So spent money testing outcome
Did make money
Are customer satisfied
Do lower abandonment rate
The way keep funding effort like going show consistent track record success impact either bottom line customer satisfaction improvement
Some obvious tip conducting successful test Before test see simply throw real site ask million people come site think
Besides remember web Both User Researchers Web Analysts benefit tremendously close sustained partnership ultimate combination qualitative quantitative
So think
Are User Researcher UCD Human Factors Specialist
Do agree quant guy post
Do tip u
Share experience feedback critique via comment
Couple related post might find interesting Or could
Excellent summary
I spent two year observational research user spot
A couple key point I add
It essential key decision maker stakeholder observing user
Unless witness hard time validating actionable insight suggested user behavior
The greatest benefit I found uncovering latent need user
thing like I wish button I could click right
When majority group feel something missing help achieve goal great benefit ONLY kind research provide
Behavior vary segment
Younger folk use
way older folk ca imagine
Also segment wired others
thing like screen resolution broadband impact behavior need taken account lab align customer base
There variance geography well though le likely well
You need act data
I ca tell many wireframes I created lab rotted someone hard drive
There fear change want reap reward listening customer
Facial expression sometimes tell anything user say
My experience le task based make session natural experience get user
Thus insight line actual behavior
People always natural usrge please ask something type environment
I could go bringing qualitative tool attention quantitative world
Jonathan Very insightful post Avinash
I manage Web Analytics team large company lot I learn
Our team far removed qualitative element I need make case management need address
I also heard lab test answer everything Research team framework provide around use testing helpful
Hi Avinash Awesome post
This favorite topic nice read thought well
Jonathan make interesting point making session le
I recently presentation Amy Africa ECMOD London described test people given budget given set period spend
She described candidate would thing like send text message friend cool test end failing make purchase
One point case people use web site isolation
We distracted
More web distraction top one
Conducting usability test relevant environment whether home office frightening
Avinash I think deeper subject border along line traditional qualitative marketing research
Some step mentioned recruitment candidate done internally without need outside recruiting suppose depends availibility resource select
I recommend checking Handbook Online Marketing Research well website UI find post soon
Avinash There lot tool around day claiming usability testing tool Userfly Open Hallway Clixspy
I really class usability testing tool
However two seen perhaps deserve second look UserZoom
I wondered whether seen thought
Both claim able provide quantitative usability metric

User Experience Research Training Consulting User testing done anywhere witness international study carried equipment fit bag
It almost matter conduct user testing
If lucky fancy multiple camera mirror
The key benefit lab ability leave user facilitator alone
The method evangelizing usability get many
A good usability lab comfy observation room snack encourages invaluable side effect user testing designer developer manager become emotionally invested fixing usability problem seen
What
After dedicated lab space usually appears company reached stage
Luckily long close door ensure privacy focus study participant
Some common location user testing include The key element user testing facilitator skill drawing without biasing user facilitator analytical skill determining observation user behavior
These two crucial point depend specific location lot advanced equipment hand
Nielsen Norman Group run often test client location
For vast majority user research
Here photo study Sydney Australia last month The equipment That
We ran study conference hotel provided coffee cup
The three reason The big screen also allows additional observer besides facilitator sit slightly behind user still see screen
You want observer far user concerned
Unfortunately testing need bit equipment
Although user typically bring phone tablet need fancier camera capture small screen
That camera requires bag usually ship ahead time
Here one artifact Sydney study We stick sign like door test location unaccustomed usability study associated protocol
We really want hotel staff interrupt study want people wandering hallway looking meeting poke head room
If conduct user testing company might nice sign say something like Usability Study Progress
This give bit internal PR colleague pas conference room note testing
But test hotel outside location much assume anybody understand usability bad disturb test user study
We therefore go Recording Session everybody understands
People might even quiet pas room
For international testing lucky client invest flying one observer
Still sometimes nice able accommodate multiple observer ca squeeze behind user chair
In case one option hook shown photo study ran Hong Kong Here simply used HD TV available hotel thus ship around
Because projected image user screen fairly large handful observer crowd around TV
As photo show user viewpoint observer pretty much screened bulk television
Again want observer sight mind far user concerned
If many observer run video cable adjourning conference room use projector generate large image user screen want
It bit trickier pipe sound trick using speakerphone simply muting one observation room
No equipment
That excuse testing design
You test use laptop I sure anyway
Although like show video clip research training seminar study even need webcam recording software
No usability lab
Not excuse either
As I shown test almost anywhere country including
small amount equipment either scavenge site bring bag
The one thing need however

One best way teach usability engineering provide student authentic appropriate project experience
However challenge find project meaningful completed within term
Rosson Carroll recommend scenario case study starting point UE student assignment
This paper describes similar yet alternative approach generating student project observation analysis place instance campus library
The collaboration benefit student library
In Introduction Usability Engineering Oregon State University student learn basic method design including evaluation software system user interface
The major assignment course work usability engineering process team
Over span project student team identify usability problem library web site information technology service propose novel solution prototype solution employ usability testing method evaluation product refine prototype using evaluation feedback previous step
The final prototype presented library staff understanding library may implement solution
The point exercise systematically analyze library information system discern function population support
The assignment also help student identify potential usability problem base final project
This activity employ element ethnography called ethnographic study
True ethnography requires proper training longer period time available term hence activity termed ethnomethodological
The approach obviously scope similar one used Given Leckie large comprehensive observational study two Canadian public library
In study researcher captured data sixty variable making repeated sweep library noting user particular space specified time
Students took role complete observer
In word student team observed interact library user
Student researcher permitted question interact library staff faculty needed
Because level detachment student researcher able gain snapshot user activity library
However snapshot enough give sense power ethnomethodological research design spotlight potential problem area library service
The result second iteration class higher degree feasibility
Projects included online study room reservation system currently paper system improved interface display large plasma screen Information Commons several perspective improving appearance functionality online library catalog especially locating material library
From group prototype likely library address room reservation system identified problem first second set student project
Because library requires room reservation system integrate patron information database likely library purchase software work ILS solve problem rather building system locally
An unrealized aspect collaboration student idea strong potential developed implemented
Ideally would venue student
One idea student elaborate project later curriculum perhaps senior design course
Another idea build partnership pursuing funding student work library implement idea
This would build student vitas improving library service
The library also benefited partnership
Librarians staff astounded student inventive novel sometimes provocative solution usability problem
The problem student addressed often known people library seeing student new approach seemingly intractable usability issue energized library staff
Some energy translated improvement library service
Academic library wealth expertise near hand tapping rich strengthens library community serve
Librarians liaison role great position scout new way build partnership faculty student
In way library reach partner expert community

Usability Evaluation evaluation quality usability interface design
Two common method used evaluation process Heuristic Evaluation analytical method User Testing empirical method
Both method strength limitation depending objective context usability evaluation
Heuristic evaluation usability inspection technique first developed Jakob Nielsen colleague Sharp
According Jakob Nielsen Heuristic evaluation usability engineering method finding usability problem user interface design attended part iterative design process
It usually conducted small group evaluator presented interface design required evaluate whether element follows set established usability principle
The inspection interface performed individual evaluator
Independently evaluator work interface several time least twice
The first round get feel flow interaction whilst second inspect specific various dialogue element interface
All problem encountered recorded listed respective heuristic
evaluation completed evaluator allowed communicate finding aggregated
This procedure important order ensure independent unbiased evaluation evaluator Jakob Nielsen
The rational grouping back evaluator discover many problem possible one single evaluator would able find problem
Different evaluator discover different problem
The Heuristic Evaluation developed Jakob Nielsen Mack consists ten general principle rule thumb
They Visibility system status Match system real world User control freedom Consistency standard Error prevention Recognition rather recall Flexibility efficiency use Aesthetic minimalist design Help user recognize diagnose recover error Help documentation
However evaluator may add new heuristic element heuristic supplement general heuristic
Ease Organizing Evaluation It easy
Being independent evaluator inspect anytime long product inspected
The whole inspection process handled evaluator without intervention anybody final part evaluation session whereby come together discus everything discovered
Before final part evaluator repeat inspection several time least twice
Less Cost Compared user testing evaluation need proper laboratory heuristic evaluation involves lesser cost time
The number evaluator much le person compared user testing method requires many user participating effective
Heuristic inspection also conducted anywhere even office industry premise
Effective Detection Problems By virtue experience knowledge quite easy evaluator identify major minor problem interface
The evaluator discussion session help identification problem missed overlooked evaluator
Single Evaluator Problem detection Heuristic Evaluation done single individual evaluator
However hard one person discover usability problem interface
According Nielsen averaging project single evaluator found usability problem interface
Not Providing Systematic Problem Fixes evaluation provide systematic way generate fix usability problem way ass probable quality design
The Paradox Less Cost Employing single evaluator reduce cost
But risk coverage problem
Thus necessary engage evaluator mean higher cost
The Risk Professional Differences If evaluator part development team may aware technical limitation design certain design decision made
This may lead difference development team evaluator may impede communication problem correction usability problem identified usability evaluation
Capturing low priority problem As Heuristic evaluation loosely structured hood evaluator capture problem may important correct
It waste time cost evaluator addressing kind problem evaluator also product developer
User testing usability evaluation method employ evaluator observe record performance user test session
According Helen Sharp quoted Dumas Redish goal test whether product developed usable intended user population achieve task designed
Thus method finding problem area engaging person similar target user perform certain task
Administered user testing laboratory controlled environment within scheduled time user required perform either certain task navigating menu information searching reading different typeface specific task
During user testing session evaluator user action order infer action related usability issue design interface Nielsen
The evaluator record everything user
The participant attitude action behavior facial expression remark kind gesture recorded
The Strength Empirical Method Identifying product problem observing empirically user interaction interface give better understanding problem need user
It enhanced followed brainstorming session
The Productive Aspect Brainstorming The brainstorming aloud session evaluator user encourages user talk share experience
This obviously help discovery many problem correction improvement product
Users Need Come First Sometimes evaluator software development specialist biased view user want need
User test neutralize situation telling really needed expected user perspective
Giving priority problem raised user also cool professional difference evaluator system developer
Problem Determining The Right Number User Testers The problem decide many user ideal test
There different opinion pertaining right number user engaged lab
A research study conducted Virzi show problem uncovered based group group user
Such case user number implies cost
However practically easy decide number optimum number user participate usability testing result may differ tested different context environment time
Functionalities Sometimes test could cover functionality product constraint time environment
Inability Capture Minor Usability Problems Though method evaluation good discovering major HCI problem quite difficult observe minor usability problem typographic inconsistency
There possibility even gesture observed user interpreted differently individual evaluator
Judging strength weakness Heuristic Evaluation User Testing rather difficult conclude either method better
It versus approach
Ideally good method advantage complement

The presence big actively alternating photograph right page leaving big white space left side waste website space
With placement make upper part Homepage
Active item Yemen Branch thumbnail branch presented hypertext Sabah Kota Bharu Sri Damansara visibly located
Even Application flag visible website open
Surprisingly Application functioning
When clicked lead nothing inactive flag
Usabilty Problems To User Poorly arranged may put user
A user find difficulty searching required item page
Icons visible waste user time searching right page information guidance
For example user search branch somewhere page go next page look Twintech branch
There occurance poor feedback system basic information
For example application form icon clicked feed back
Instead displaying user requested online application form nothing shown
This cause potential college applicant abandoning screen
Online Application put case
The single level Menu somewhat take longer searching time user
This affect flexibility ease navigation control website content
It convenient user select item content making choice main menu
Twintech Yemen Branch icon poorly located
It would visible located top page Homepage instead bottom page
Likewise active hypertext icon branch Malaysia placed Homepage instead user look link branch Kota Bharu Sarawak Malaysia
They located menu
Information Convocation redundant
On Homepage information convocation located three place
It would le confusing information placed one banner
As user need scroll go page search branch
The heuristic conformed Aesthetic Minimalist Design This attention given Homepage layout give visual impact user
Basic content item visibly arranged attractive user
The scattered arrangement active online Twintech branch result Online Application flag somewhat discourage user continue browsing
Also arrangement big photograph top page create big white space inactive thumbnail picture randomly page spoil attractiveness website
Flexibility Efficiency Use In relation comment poor arrangement active icon limit efficiency accessing page website
Consistency Standards The many form text title subtitle paragraph caption font size depict inconsistency oversight basic standard
Even one page user discover low contrasting title line use fade text mistaken hypertext function
The Menu Search Function General Navigation Problems The Problems The Menu rightly located upper left Homepage consists five menu item Home Student Programmes Studies About Us Contact Us
However Menu designed feature could facilitate user selection quickly especially Studies Student About Us
Usability Problem To The User If user want access specific Programme
Biotechnology user go Programme page user select list
If multilevel menu user easily access page one click
Menu consisting five main item also affect speed access rest content
In relation menu contain adequate basic content
For example Us menu information college organizational structure though established University College year ago
Even user click Us Us menu relevant information
The Heuristic Not Conformed User Control Freedom The single level menu delay quick operation user
A user search look perhaps hidden required information
Flexibility Ease use Relating control problem existing feature menu design limit flexibility user
Instead selecting item direct menu user undergo several search process
Consistency Standards Menu design reach normal standard sophistication
Simply standard pay attention way interface system plea user
The Problems These two problem kind
Both box lead nothing
The Application placed every page website
However user click get application form display anything
In fact take quite minute downloading time give Time Out message
Several attempt made getting result
Likewise website button also demonstrates feedback
It function expected
The search ineffective
There feedback inputting requested information refreshed page
For example Student page word typed Search box displayed Homepage instead page
Also clicking active Convocation picture bring convocation information page Homepage
Usability Problems To The User The Application put user potential college applicant
Perhaps user may try time
But feedback session waste user time also lead distress
It took minute wait Online Application get expired message
The duration considered long interface efficiency standard
Regarding Search box sheer waste time user requested information provided
In fact Search result display Homepage
The feedback appeared picture icon clicked Homepage displayed
This kind feedback undoubtedly bring mental distress frustration user
It affect smoothness navigation flow
The Heuristics Not conformed Visibility system status For three active item feedback system unsatisfactory
The Online Application failed produce application page Search box also failed search right information bring Homepage user active Convocation also led user Homepage
So website course kept user informed something else user interested
Error prevention Error prevention alert flashed signaled user especially failing display online application form
Flexibility efficiency use As function functioning expected website give opportunity user browse explore easily freely learn content
Consistency Standards From result obtain poor feedback system clear website inspected user tested satisfactorily
The designing web missed basic interface standard helping user joyful experience
User control freedom The user able experience freedom moving around browsing process hampered active yet icon button
The Problems There quick page exiting
A user use standard button exit task
So user want exit page quickly user scroll Home button right bottom page using Space arrow
There also hypertext line located visibly working area user look Home button page using page approach
Even disappointing take quite time
It would better Home Previous page button placed active page visible place easy reach screen
Usability problem The User Since exit built interface design user either exit clicking home button far page using Arrow Window upper Left corner exit
As example Webmail clicked prompt window user enter Name
If user decide carry like exit page user use button window quick exit icon
However moment Cancel button clicked displayed another webmail window Log In
At page user exit quickly Home button anywhere
A user click Arrow browser go back Homepage
The exit system particular page
This quite inconvenience take step exit
The heuristic conformed User Control Freedom Under heuristic principle interface function emergency exit leave unwanted state without go extended dialogue
But case user step exiting clicking Arrow key
Consistency Standards To today standard system help user exit one key stroke instead going several step
Flexibility Efficiency use After inspection done obvious interface system designer overlooked efficiency use heuristic facilitate expert novice user
The Problems In general colour contrast text writing may distress user
The choice low shade grey used date line small paragraph strain eye user
In contrast use blue Us box occupying almost whole screen surprise user
Some smudgy letter address readable
Usability problem To The User The low colour contrast together small font tends strain eye user eye
As normally experienced fade text line usually indicate hypertext web
This may confuse user lead disappointment distress
As visally clear due small font fade grey line quite annoying user
A user spend time focusing text read
Even grey shade colour contrast well font size contrast title helping user see line paragraph clearly conveniently
Further Faculty page mix red black colour paragraph
In contrast Us page display bold sizable font quite irritating visual
With blue background black smudgy writing user familiar language find difficulty reading understanding message word
The heuristic conformed Consistency Standards Using low fade grey colour text conform principle contrast effectiveness conveying message
There inconsistency choice colour shade colour used convey certain content website
Aesthetic minimalist design The display text visual mixed colour font reduce aesthetic aspect website
It sore user stay long web
Based Heuristic Evaluation conducted problem discovered mainly pertains Visiblity system status User control freedom Consistency standard Flexibility efficiency use Aesthetic minimalist design
The heuristic inspection conducted could get feedback heuristic namely Match system real world Error prevention Recognition rather recall Help user recognize diagnose recover error Help documentation
Perhaps due nature web designed give college information rather interactive interface system
One aspect highlighted Application Box
As Application page accessed difficult inspect whether system Error Prevention system
So far alert found
Basic major problem rectified IUCTT Feedback system Homepage layout Menu quality Home button Quick Exit button whole text quality
The application flag put potential applicant
Likewise failure button fulfill user request result user frustration
The feedback display Homepage instead expected page address whenever user click More branch irritating
The appearance layout Homepage well limited menu function may affect interface efficiency effectiveness
The layout Homepage screen page visually attractive
There many white space homepage page
Regarding Menu menu
Thus Menu function could improved facilitate navigation website content
To today standard tt single level multilevel well increase menu item five seven item wherever relevant
The Us page look irritating due black bold font
For greater flexibility ease interface interaction system incorporate easy access Home Quick Exit button increase efficiency effectiveness navigation
The text whole website improved term colour contrast font size text title subtitle date hypertext letter case choice lower upper case like
Judging text webdsite inferred part given attention
The text part website need improved taking aesthetic aspect consideration
Other minor problem addressed inactive picture arrangement active thumbnail picture visibility layout website page
For improvement website heuristically user testing method interest user

I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


In confused act mechanism combine simple build complicated one
Like usual result function passed argument next result last one result whole
Programmers frequently apply function result function almost programming language allow
In case composition function interesting function right used later
Such function always defined language make easier
The ability easily compose function encourages breaking apart maintainability
More generally big system might built composing whole program
Narrowly speaking function composition applies function operate finite amount data step sequentially processing handing next
Functions operate potentially infinite data known instead connected analogous function composition execute
For example suppose two
Composing mean first compute use compute
Here example The step combined give name intermediate result Despite difference length two implementation compute result
The second implementation requires one line code colloquially referred highly composed form
Readability hence maintainability one advantage highly composed form since require fewer line code minimizing program surface area
DeMarco Lister empirically verify inverse relationship surface area maintainability
On hand may possible overuse highly composed form
A nesting many function may opposite effect making code le maintainable
In functional composition even natural performed usually primary method program design
The example Which take whatever stack apply g f leave result stack
See corresponding mathematical notation
Now suppose combination calling f result g frequently useful want name foo use function right
In language define new function implemented composition
Example long form intermediate would work well
Example In language way create new function define program source mean function ca composed
In functional programming language function composition naturally expressed operator
In example given becomes using composition operator
read
The composition operator defined Haskell using The first line describes type
take pair function return function
Note Haskell require specification exact input output type f g relation f must accept g return
This make
operator
Variants especially together treatment function lend extremely well recursive definition compositional operator
like built function composition operator main difference spelled
Also like could define operator
In fact following Perl code used define implementation
In programming language write mechanism perform function composition
In way define composition group function using function use Python In define function take two function f g produce function In define Func take two Funcs f g produce Func Languages like let construct binary operator Notions composition including ubiquitous numerous strand research separately evolved
The following sampling kind research notion composition central
Whole program system treated function readily composed input output allowing easy composition successful become operating system
side effect violate therefore cleanly composable
However consider state world running code input output get clean function
Composition function corresponds running procedure one
The formalism us idea incorporate side effect functional language

Computer science also strong connection discipline
Many problem science engineering health care business area solved effectively computer finding solution requires computer science expertise knowledge particular application domain
Thus computer scientist often become proficient subject
Finally computer science wide range specialty
These include computer architecture software system graphic artifical intelligence computational science software engineering
Drawing common core computer science knowledge specialty area focus particular challenge
Finally importantly computer scientist computer scientist fun

Computer science often defined systematic study algorithmic process theory design analysis implementation application
An algorithm precise method usable computer solution problem
The term come last name Persian author Abu Mohammed ibn Musa al Khowarizmi
wrote early textbook mathematics
Some computer scientist study broad class algorithm others study algorithm specific task
Algorithms must written notation
Often notation used programming language algorithm written programming language transformed executed digital computer
Such algorithm called computer software
Computer science also concerned large software system collection thousand algorithm whose combination produce significantly complex application
For system new issue become prominent reliability security dependability scalability modifiability computer software hardware
Another aspect computer science impact discipline
Computer science thinking namely modeling process algorithm major impact researcher field
The field called computer science born though root extend back nineteenth century even earlier
One early founder field Alan Turing citizen published famous paper entitled On Computable Numbers Application Entscheidungsproblem
In paper introduced concept abstract computing device later dubbed Turing machine
It precisely simplicity model permitted scientist ask answer fundamental question nature computation
Any computer simulated Turing machine converse also true
Moreover complexity Turing machine computation yield insight efficiency computation real computer
Two famous mathematical logician made early contribution computer science Alonzo Church Kurt G del
Church developed system called lambda calculus make possible logically precise expression mathematical proposition
The lambda calculus proved model functional programming popular LISP programming language used lambda calculus theoretical base
Of equal import Church thesis state every effectively calculable function
The importance result tie numerical computation string manipulation initially surprising result
Kurt G del best known proof G del Incompleteness Theorems
As early proved fundamental result axiomatic system showing axiomatic mathematical system proposition proved disproved within axiom system
In particular consistency axiom proved
Computer science founded solely mathematician
An equally important group electrical engineer focused actually building computing machine
identified spurred need computing device machine could help carry mechanic war
Enlisted cause greatest scientist day
One Howard Aiken built Automatic Sequence Control Calculator Mark I
Another groundbreaking effort development ENIAC computer John Mauchly John Presper Eckert Moore School Electrical Engineering University
Mauchly Eckert turn influenced John Vincent Atanasoff widely recognized inventor world first electronic computer computer ABC machine
The ABC machine employed basic unit modern digital computer including binary arithmetic separate arithmetic unit vacuum tube emulating logical switching circuit adder
The John von Neumann worked closely Mauchly Eckert among many result usually credited idea stored program computer idea computer would contain within program processing data well data
During early period great deal computer science work focused understanding refining essential element computer system
software developed facilitate control functional unit computer processor input output device
Programming language devised programmer could easily express computation wished accomplish
FORTRAN Formula Translation developed John Backus team IBM around first popular programming language
Its focus efficient numerical calculation
LISP LISt Processor developed John McCarthy MIT around focused symbolic programming
Both language major impact though le popular still use early century
As definition computer science systematic study algorithm surprising decade period study algorithm dominant
One aspect research development theory algorithm
Building theory Church Turing computer scientist asked question Is algorithm Turing machine decides whether machine eventually stop started initial state
This termed Halting Problem
The Halting Problem shown unsolvable
Another aspect theory algorithm problem reducibility
For example shown algorithm exist Halting Problem would possible solve Hilbert tenth problem namely given Diophantine equation determine procedure decides finite number step equation integer solution
Computer scientist shown Hilbert problem reducible Halting Problem therefore unsolvable
A second aspect algorithm study concern development new algorithmic solution specific problem
Topics sorting searching graph theory closely studied algorithmic point view
Many new efficient algorithm topic produced example Hoare Quicksort algorithm sorting hashing technique searching Tarjan algorithm determining graph planarity name
As search new algorithm proceeded new technique analyzing performance algorithm developed
Methodologically analysis become standard question address presenting algorithm
There standard mathematical notation presenting result
Algorithm design technique identified example search greedy method dynamic programming
No discussion computer science would complete without discussion famous problem Does P NP
P set problem solved deterministic polynomial time
That mean problem input size N must way solve problem F N step polynomial F polynomial even N high power
For example sorting set N number done polynomial time
This problem set NP set problem one solve nondeterministic polynomial time
That mean problem input size N must way solve problem F N step polynomial F
In NP however program allowed make lucky guess though must prove solution correct
Many problem NP example traveling salesman finding Hamiltonian cycle satisfiability propositional expression finding maximum clique integer knapsack problem optimal scheduling problem
All problem P also NP
You need use nondeterministic guess NP program want
But P NP
This problem first posed Steven Cook
No one ever proven equal one ever proven
But despite failure P NP
problem contributed great deal understanding algorithm
This come computer scientist able identify large class problem reducible solving one problem immediately lead solution others
This class called problem
The fact problem intuitively difficult NP follows fact may prove P equal NP problem algorithm
In original formulation P NP
problem Cook showed satisfiability problem find assignment value Boolean variable logical statement make true member problem called Cook Theorem
However despite many effort one ever shown problem also Because one found example many researcher believe P equal NP
And yet computer science relatively new lot difficult problem remained unsolved century someone came solution perhaps one need time
The saw great deal work field artificial intelligence AI
AI subfield computer science concerned computational understanding intelligent behavior creation system produce behavior
One approach develop computer program mimic way human behave
A second approach produce computational model intelligent behavior regardless whether model imitates human process
One earliest example latter approach James Slagle SAINT program performing symbolic integration level college freshman
AI researcher early emphasized heuristic approach
Heuristics differ algorithm may converge produce correct exact answer experience show often produce acceptable answer
For example computer play chess must evaluate worth position every step
Since computationally infeasible work worth possible move researcher developed heuristic return numerical assessment worth future move
Returning Alan Turing article published described game human interrogator attempt determine solely basis written interrogation whether identity person answering question fact person computer
This come known Turing test
This challenge inspired great deal AI research
Of special mention ELIZA program developed Joseph Weizenbaum appears emulate nondirective therapist
If person interrogated say I happy ELIZA might respond Why happy
go
Other researcher attempted develop computer program would exhibit behavior believed sign human intelligence
Playing chess proving mathematical theorem two area intense study
There many subareas artificial intelligence including natural language understanding general problem solving knowledge representation reasoning learning machine vision robotics autonomous agent
An important phenomenon success industry producing miniaturized computer processor
This brought personal computer
Initially machine might include byte memory disk floppy drive processor whose speed might KHz le
The cost machine approximately
As technology improved price steadily dropped capability enhanced computer moved exclusive domain government large corporation home small business arena
A personal computer might billion byte memory disk capacity gigabyte processor whose speed MHz megahertz might cost le
Word processing accounting spreadsheet became dominant application
But little effect computer science per se
In research started back Department Defense led digital network computer called ARPAnet became accessible everyone Internet
Research packet switching network protocol led development transmission control protocol standard enables pair connected computer communicate
As number Internet user grew computer scientist began study best exchange information
This culminated development Tim
In early century new issue challenged computer researcher
People studied digital sensor thousand coordinated thing like predict weather
Others developed method connecting thousand idle personal computer together work single problem GRID computing
And simulation physical process atomic level could achieved digital computer speed reached Teraflop level thousand billion instruction per second
The digital computer center computer science
Abstract model developed hope capturing essential element model need sufficient accuracy conclusion reflect actually occur real digital computer
Algorithmic thinking requires one express solution problem sequence step one sufficiently precise could translated elemental step digital computer analyze efficiency step
Another fundamental mode thinking computer scientist representation namely way data stored algorithm making use data compute efficiently
For example phone book organized alphabetically easily locate person phone number know name
On hand know phone number want know name person number phone book useless
Organizing data question answered efficiently end goal data representation
Representation refer way organize data also way encode data
For example one represent mathematical expression need differentiated integrated one encode speech sound movie compact yet able faithfully rendered
Compression algorithm succeeded reducing size popular song approximately megabyte million character feature movie using best encoding scheme day requires approximately megabyte
The former transferred across Internet matter minute latter requires several hour
Computer scientist researching side problem studying increase bandwidth network also improving degree compression algorithm work
Library science concerned archiving text digital library information efficiently accurately retrieved
With advent Internet digital library causing major change traditional library
Management science concerned development computer model help business perform planning forecasting function
It also us computer database store business transaction mine transaction better understand critical element company
Economics us computer model forecast economic condition evaluate effect varying strategy
Medicine biology use computer model diagnose treat disease
Modern imaging method magnetic resonance imaging MRI critically rely computer graphic algorithm software
Psychology cognitive science concerned understanding human thought emotion
Computer model used gain insight operation human mind nervous system
Linguistics concerned use computer speech recognition synthesis machine translation language
Computer scientist differing approach problem
Theoreticians aim bring order rapidly emerging subfields
They attempt develop model analytic method help understand going
In computer science area formal model exist automaton theory switching theory graph theory formal language
However field operating system programming language compiler theory limited impact
Experimenters build system use test variety question
Performance analysis comparison different architecture often result experimentation
Computer science originated within mathematics mainly mathematical logic electrical engineering use Boolean algebra switching theory describe electronic circuitry
Conversely computer science strongly influenced mathematics
In case computer used help prove theorem
One example question whether four color sufficient coloring planar map called Four Color problem
This problem remained unsolved one hundred year Four Color Theorem proven Kenneth Appel Wolfgang Haken
As part proof four color sufficient use computer investigate large finite number potential counterexample
Computer science equally strong connection engineering many way connection much stronger mathematics
Computers indispensable come designing building complex structure skyscraper submarine computer
system manufacturing rely combination computer graphic specialized algorithm complex supporting software provide engineer set tool one master complexity involved
In late early new bond grew physical science computer science
The field physic chemistry biology geology astronomy posed grand challenge experiment problem require massive computation
sequencing one problem
Biologists view DNA encoding information needed generate unique organism
The international effort sequence billion DNA letter human genome accomplished April considered many one ambitious scientific undertaking time
Computer science played pivotal role
All sequence data generated Human Genome Project deposited public database made freely available scientist around world
Assembling interpreting data required new level coordination collaboration computer scientist biologist formulate necessary computing algorithm approach visualization system
In short computing fundamentally changed way biologist science parallel computing system enabled genome analysis modern search engine allowing access unprecedented amount biological data
Another grand challenge Human Brain Project
This effort involving neuroscientist information scientist computer scientist engineer physicist mathematician
The goal produce new digital capability providing World Wide Web WWW based information management system form interoperable database associated data management tool
Tools include graphical interface information retrieval data analysis visualization manipulation biological modeling simulation
It expected neuroscience database interoperable database genomic protein database
From two example many one see researcher many field regarding computation third paradigm scientific investigation alongside theory experimentation

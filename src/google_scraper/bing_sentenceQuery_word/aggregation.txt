I understand composition OOP I able get clear idea Aggregation
Can someone explain
Simple rule Example A Company aggregation People
A Company composition Accounts
When Company cease business Accounts cease exist People continue exist
Example simplified A Text Editor owns Buffer composition
A Text Editor us File aggregation
When Text Editor closed Buffer destroyed File destroyed
From Aggregation differs ordinary composition imply ownership
In composition owning object destroyed contained object
In aggregation necessarily true
For example university owns various department chemistry department number professor
If university close department longer exist professor department continue exist
Therefore University seen composition department whereas department aggregation professor
In addition Professor could work one department department could part one university
So ownership relationship composition owned object also destroyed owner aggregation object contained exist independently
Update Apologies answer far simplistic hindsight
provides excellent definition answer There single explanation
Different author mean different thing aggregation
Most really mean anything specific
Composition Association Aggregation Association Composition Association If life contained object totally depends container object called strong association Aggregation Association If life contained object depends container object called weak association Example mixture way combine simple object data type complex one
Compositions critical building block many basic data structure collection differs ordinary composition imply ownership
In composition owning object destroyed contained object
In aggregation necessarily true Both denotes relationship object differ strength
UML notation different kind dependency two class Since Engine Car relationship Composition
Here implemented Java class
Since Organization Person employee relationship Aggregation
Here look like term Java class aggregation simple collection like bag marble composition implies dependency like hinge box car aggregate passenger get without breaking car functionality tire component remove one car longer function correctly note spare tire aggregate
I always look composition
car engine I look aggregation related purpose
So staying car analogy aggregation may represent journey may involve bringing car passenger together
The journey car passenger I aggregating data related specific scenario
When journey completed car passenger go
When car ended car engine normally destroyed together
Semantically set made subset right
Therefore The aggregation subset exists independently father set
As monitor unplugged computer connected another
The composition subset depends existence father set
As leaf part tree liver part body
These concept talk kind dependency two object class conceptually
Directly program aggregation father object disposes aggregate object disposed
In scenario composition composite son object persist father object dispenses
How simple example An array object composition
An array pointer object aggregation
If I delete first one content vanish
The second one hand vanish without affecting member existence unless specific method deletes object pointer deleted
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

Association represents static relationship shared among object two class
So relationship object two class called association
An association say kind dependency object
It either weak Strong dependency
Consider example Teacher Student class
Multiple student associate single teacher single student associate multiple teacher
This kind weak relationship ownership student teacher life cycle maintained
form call relationship
It strong type
Child object parent object deletes child object also deleted
Consider example set class Engine Car
The object Engine said composed Car object Engine leave without Car object relationship said whole Engine part Car object
Here life cycle Engine managed Car object
If Car get destructed associated composite object like Engine also get destroyed
Thus composition relationship specifies lifetime part classifier dependent lifetime whole classifier
public class Engine


public class Car Engine e new Engine
Yet another example Composite relationship consider set classed Person Leg Hand
The object Leg Hand composed within Person object
The life cycle Leg Hand object maintained Person object
Also see Leg Hand object leave independently without Person object
And note strong relationship Leg Hand object Person
The difference aggregation composition object exists independently us aggregation object meaning outside relationship us composition Let take example Department teacher
A single teacher belong multiple department delete department teacher object destroy
We think relationship
Let u take another example Company Employee class
The employee said aggregated Company
The Employee working company relationship company
The employee object still survive even say Company object exists
I conclude taking real world example aggregation composition
Consider scenario University owns various department physic chemistry department number professor
If university close department longer exist professor department continue exist
Therefore University seen composition department whereas department aggregation professor
In addition Professor could work one department department could part one university

This question already answer What difference aggregation composition dependency
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
implies relationship child exist independently parent
Example Class parent Student child
Delete Class Students still exist
implies relationship child exist independent parent
Example House parent Room child
Rooms exist separate House
The two form hence relationship
weaker form relationship code term indicates class us another parameter return type
Dependency form
almost completely identical except used life child completely controlled parent
The taken object installed different one
Also car get totaled tire necessarily destroyed
When object destroyed get destroyed
A relationship two object changing one may affect
separable part whole
The part identity separate part
You could pick part move another object
real world example wheel car bloodcell body part whole
You move part another object
like property
real world example curve road personality person car property object object Note relation aggregate one design composition another
Its relation used specific design
sensitive change
amount rain weather headposition bodyposition Note Bloodcell Blood could Composition Blood Cells exist without entity called Blood
Blood Body could Aggregation Blood exist without entity called Body
An object associated relationship exist outside containing object
Appointment owner Person Calendar TestResult Patient
On hand object containing object exist outside containing object
Door House Employee Department
A relates object request service another object therefor dependent object
As client service want service interface remain constant even future service offered
Aggregation composition term people OO world acquired via UML
And UML poor job defining term demonstrated example Barbier What This Thing Called Aggregation
Formalization Relationship Unified Modeling Language
I think coherent definition aggregation composition given interested
I suggest look cited work
Regarding dependency highly abstract relationship type object mean almost anything
Containment Here access inner object use outer object
We reuse contained object
Aggregation Here access inner object without using outer object
One object may contain another part attribute
So containment need physical
computer system warranty

Information come u direction
Our bank provide u account information cell phone provide u phone number message information government provide u revenue tax information
As constantly looking way slice dice effort understand
But would surprised know also combine
And put together way make easier manipulate
Indeed
This combining process creates whole easier describe work
The process called aggregation
process combining thing
That putting thing together refer collectively
As example think phone number cell phone
You refer individually mother number best friend number etc
But easier think collectively phone number list
It also important realize member aggregation still property whole
In word phone number list remains phone number
The process combining altered way
As mentioned use aggregation refer group item whole
That main purpose
But also provides one significant benefit simplifies accessing individual item refer part whole
Consider
This aggregating mechanism creates group ordered entry individual entry referred index
If think powerful idea
It mean group referred name say X
And member referred index X X forth
A number computer language support idea
In addition array number aggregating mechanism used programming language
Some example include Get FREE access day create account
To recap process grouping thing together
We use aggregation refer group item whole individual item part whole
There number example aggregation computer programming language
Some common one include

In confused way simple complex one
Compositions critical building block many basic data structure including well used programming
In programming language object typed type often divided composite noncomposite type composition regarded relationship type object composite type
object simpler type

Consider relation automobile part specifically composed object including
This relation might fixed computer program composition relation
However real world relation softer fuzzier
The engine one automobile may replaced engine another automobile meaning relation better described composition
Generally speaking time pass look like composition tend turn aggregation aggregation tend turn looser
Composition must distinguished process adding detail general data type create specific data type
For instance car may specific type vehicle
Subtyping describe relationship different object instead say object type simultaneously object another type
In programming language composite object usually expressed mean reference one object another depending language reference may known resulting composition
Fields given unique name one distinguished others
However reference necessarily mean object composite
It called composite object refers really part
independent existence
For detail see section
In two way modelling composition Composition aggregation
Beware UML composition narrow meaning ordinary language Composition depicted solid line
Composition kind association composite object sole responsibility disposition component part
The relationship composite component strong relationship composite object take ownership component
This mean composite responsible creation destruction component part
An object may part one composite
If composite object destroyed component part must destroyed
The part life transferred another object
Composition enforces encapsulation component part usually member composite object
The general form depicted solid line
Aggregation kind association specifies relationship aggregate whole component part
This relationship aggregate component weak relationship component may survive aggregate object
The component object may accessed object without going aggregate object
The aggregate object take part lifecycle component object meaning component object may outlive aggregate object
The state component object still form part aggregate object
The code show source code likely look like
This example composition
In example primitive type combined form composite structure
Each structure age name employment type
Objects composited recursively use
Consider tree
Each node tree may branch leaf word node tree time belongs another tree
One implementation recursive composition let object reference others type
In C example binary tree defined like If pointer valid node thought branch referring tree point
If node leaf
In way recursion terminated
Another use tagged union
For
see
call record structure language often keep record hidden inside instance language family simply call record
first widespread support record directly got COBOL got le indirectly ALGOL provides structure class latter via
Arrays composite data type
For example traditional linked list declaration Note ALGOL newtype name appears left equality notably construction made read left right without regard priority
Fortran array lacked formal definition
Typically compound structure built using statement Ada brought OOP concept tagged type equivalent class Ada added support verification contract
Arrays string inherited FORTRAN new reserved word introduced FORTRAN updated included concept called NAMELIST
Common Lisp provides structure ANSI Common Lisp standard added CLOS class
For detail composition see
Aggregation differs ordinary composition imply ownership
In composition owning object destroyed contained object
In aggregation necessarily true
For example owns various department department number professor
If university close department longer exist professor department continue exist
Therefore University seen composition department whereas department aggregation professor
In addition Professor could work one department department could part one university
Composition usually implemented object contains another object
For example In aggregation object may contain reference pointer object responsibility
Sometimes aggregation referred composition distinction ordinary composition aggregation unimportant
The code would transform following UML Class diagram In Microsoft aggregation mean object export owner one several another object owns
Formally similar aggregation
However instead implementing exported interface calling interface owned object interface owned object exported
The owned object responsible assuring method interface inherited actually invoke corresponding method owner
This guarantee reference count owner correct interface owner accessible exported interface private interface owned object accessible
Composition used store several instance composited data type referred containment
Examples container
In containment depicted multiplicity depending issue ownership indicating data type composed unknown number instance composited data type

In one basic concept asks number element node edge need removed disconnect remaining node
It closely related theory problem
The connectivity graph important measure resilience network
A graph path every pair vertex
In connected graph vertex
A graph connected
A graph G said exist two node G path G node endpoint
A graph one vertex connected
An graph two vertex disconnected
In two called connected contains
Otherwise called
If two vertex additionally connected path length
single edge vertex called
A said connected every pair vertex graph connected
A maximal connected subgraph
Each vertex belongs exactly one connected component edge
A called replacing directed edge undirected edge produce connected undirected graph
It connected contains directed path directed path every pair vertex
It simply contains directed path directed path every pair vertex
The maximal strongly connected subgraphs
A connected graph set vertex whose removal render disconnected
The size minimal vertex cut
A graph called vertex connectivity greater
More precisely graph complete said contains least vertex contain set vertex whose removal disconnect graph defined largest
In particular vertex denoted vertex cut
A two vertex set vertex whose removal graph disconnect
The size smallest vertex cut separating
Local connectivity symmetric undirected graph
Moreover except complete graph equal minimum nonadjacent pair vertex
also called also called
A graph connected sometimes called
Analogous concept defined edge
In simple case cutting single specific edge would disconnect graph edge called
More generally edge cut set edge whose removal render graph disconnected
The size smallest edge cut local two vertex size smallest edge cut disconnecting
Again local symmetric
A graph called edge connectivity greater
A graph said connectivity equal minimum degree
A graph said equal minimum degree
A graph said every minimum vertex cut isolates vertex
A graph said deletion minimum vertex cut creates exactly two component one isolated vertex
A graph minimum vertex cut separate graph exactly two component
More precisely connected graph said minimum consist vertex adjacent one vertex
A connected graph said minimum consist edge incident vertex
A cutset called cutset contain neighborhood vertex
Then G A G defined analogously
One important fact connectivity graph characterizes connectivity graph term number independent path vertex
If vertex graph collection path called independent two share vertex
Similarly collection two path share edge
The number mutually independent path written number mutually path written
Menger theorem asserts distinct vertex equal also adjacent equal
This fact actually special case
The problem determining whether two vertex graph connected solved efficiently using
More generally easy determine computationally whether graph connected example using count number connected component
A simple algorithm might written follows By Menger theorem two vertex connected graph number determined efficiently using algorithm
The connectivity computed minimum value respectively
In computational complexity theory class problem problem determining whether two vertex graph connected proved equal
Hence undirected graph connectivity may solved space
The problem computing probability random graph connected called network reliability problem computing whether two given vertex connected problem
Both

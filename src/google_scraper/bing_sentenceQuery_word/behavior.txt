You make educated guess present observe thing
Human behavior like
Everything say tell world going inside
Because psychologist ca observe thought emotion behavior important part psychology since beginning discipline
In early though study behavior became even important introduced world
Pavlov studying digestion dog discovered dog began drool whenever saw person charge feeding
He designed experiment ringing bell whenever dog fed
Pretty soon dog would salivate whenever heard bell even food sight
What Pavlov dog demonstrated
In classical conditioning neutral stimulus sound bell presented time another unrelated stimulus food
The stimulus automatically produce response drooling food
This
After neutral stimulus also produce response Pavlov dog drooled sound bell
This called

You might wondering Pavlov dog human behavior
Classical conditioning happens human time
Imagine ate favorite taco got sick
Chances wo want taco quite
That classical conditioning taco neutral stimulus getting sick stimulus
After two presented together taco sound good conditioned response
Psychologist expanded idea conditioning
He built box placed rat inside
When bar box pressed rat would rewarded piece food
At first rat wandered around box aimlessly
Eventually though rat learned get food every time pressed bar began press often
idea behavior shaped reward punishment like Skinner rat learning press bar get food
If got chocolate cake every got class clean bathroom every time got think grade would look like
That operant conditioning work
Besides conditioning many influence human behavior
Society play big role behavior
If society value opinionated people likely vocal opinion grow society impolite talk idea

interdisciplinary study process
It examines nature task function broad sense
Cognitive scientist study intelligence behavior focus nervous system represent process transform
Mental faculty concern cognitive scientist include understand faculty cognitive scientist borrow field
The typical analysis cognitive science span many level organization learning decision logic planning circuitry modular brain organization
The fundamental concept cognitive science thinking best understood term representational structure mind computational procedure operate structure
The cognitive science began intellectual movement often referred
A central tenet cognitive science complete understanding attained studying single level
An example would problem remembering phone number recalling later
One approach understanding process would study behavior direct observation
A person could presented phone number asked recall delay time
Then accuracy response could measured
Another approach measure cognitive ability would study firing individual person trying remember phone number
Neither experiment would fully explain process remembering phone number work
Even technology map every neuron brain available known neuron firing would still impossible know particular firing neuron translates observed behavior
Thus understanding two level relate imperative
say new science mind need enlarge horizon encompass lived human experience possibility transformation inherent human This provided functional level account process
Studying particular phenomenon multiple level creates better understanding process occur brain give rise particular behavior
gave famous description three level analysis See also entry
Cognitive science interdisciplinary field contributor various field including
Cognitive scientist work collectively hope understanding mind interaction surrounding world much like science
The field regard compatible physical science us well often comparing output model aspect human cognition
Similarly field psychology doubt whether unified cognitive science led researcher prefer science plural
Many consider cognitive scientist hold view view mental state process explained function
According account functionalism even system robot computer ascribed cognition
The term cognitive cognitive science used kind mental operation structure studied precise term
This conceptualization broad confused cognitive used tradition cognitive formal rule truth conditional semantics
The earliest entry word take mean roughly
The first entry show word one time used context discussion theory
Most cognitive science however presumably believe field study anything certain knowledge sought Plato
Cognitive science large field cover wide array topic cognition
However recognized cognitive science always equally concerned every topic might bear relevance nature operation mind
Among philosopher classical cognitivists largely avoided social cultural factor emotion consciousness psychology
However decline behaviorism internal state affect emotion well awareness covert attention became approachable
For example situated embodied cognition theory take account current state environment well role body cognition
With newfound emphasis information processing observable behavior longer hallmark psychological theory modelling recording mental state
Below main topic cognitive science concerned
This exhaustive list
See list various aspect field

Artificial intelligence AI involves study cognitive phenomenon machine
One practical goal AI implement aspect human intelligence computer
Computers also widely used tool study cognitive phenomenon
us simulation study human intelligence may structured
See section computational modeling Research Methods section
There debate field whether mind best viewed huge array small individually feeble element
neuron collection structure symbol scheme plan rule
The former view us study mind whereas latter emphasizes symbolic computation
One way view issue whether possible accurately simulate human brain computer without accurately simulating neuron make human brain
Attention selection important information
The human mind bombarded million stimulus must way deciding information process
Attention sometimes seen spotlight meaning one shine light particular set information
Experiments support metaphor include task Cherry study Mack Rock
In dichotic listening task subject bombarded two different message one ear told focus one message
At end experiment asked content unattended message subject report
The ability learn understand language extremely complex process
Language acquired within first year life human normal circumstance able acquire language proficiently
A major driving force theoretical linguistic field discovering nature language must abstract order learned fashion
Some driving research question studying brain process language include To extent linguistic knowledge innate learned Why difficult adult acquire infant acquire How human able understand novel sentence
The study language processing range investigation sound pattern speech meaning word whole sentence
often divide language processing
Many aspect language studied component interaction
The study language processing closely tied field linguistics
Linguistics traditionally studied part humanity including study history art literature
In last fifty year researcher studied knowledge use language cognitive phenomenon main problem knowledge language acquired used precisely consists
found human form sentence way apparently governed complex system remarkably unaware rule govern speech
Thus linguist must resort indirect method determine rule might indeed rule exist
In event speech indeed governed rule appear opaque conscious consideration
Learning development process acquire knowledge information time
Infants born little knowledge depending knowledge defined yet rapidly acquire ability use language walk recognize people object
Research learning development aim explain mechanism process might take place
A major question study cognitive development extent certain ability learned
This often framed term debate
The view emphasizes certain feature innate organism determined endowment
The view hand emphasizes certain ability learned environment
Although clearly genetic environmental input needed child develop normally considerable debate remains genetic information might guide cognitive development
In area example argued specific information containing universal grammatical rule must contained gene whereas others Jeffrey Elman colleague argued Pinker claim biologically unrealistic
They argue gene determine architecture learning system specific fact grammar work learned result experience
Memory allows u store information later retrieval
Memory often thought consisting store
memory allows u store information prolonged period day week year
We yet know practical limit memory capacity
memory allows u store information short time scale second minute
Memory also often grouped declarative procedural form
subset memory fact specific knowledge specific meaning specific experience
Who first president
What I eat breakfast four day ago
allows u remember action motor sequence
ride bicycle often dubbed implicit knowledge memory
Cognitive scientist study memory psychologist tend focus memory bear interrelationship cognition memory
One example could mental process person go retrieve memory
Or differentiates cognitive process recognition seeing hint something remembering memory context recall retrieving memory
Perception ability take information via process way
two dominant sens allow u perceive environment
Some question study visual perception example include How able recognize object Why perceive continuous visual environment even though see small bit one time
One tool studying visual perception looking people process
The image right Necker cube example bistable percept cube interpreted oriented two different direction
The study stimulus also fall domain perception
Action taken refer output system
In human accomplished motor response
Spatial planning movement speech production complex motor movement aspect action
Consciousness awareness whether something external object something within oneself
This help mind ability experience feel sense
Many different methodology used study cognitive science
As field highly interdisciplinary research often cut across multiple area study drawing research method
In order description constitutes intelligent behavior one must study behavior
This type research closely tied
By measuring behavioral response different stimulus one understand something stimulus processed
Lewandowski Strohmetz review collection innovative us behavioral measurement psychology including behavioral trace behavioral observation behavioral choice
Behavioral trace piece evidence indicate behavior occurred actor present litter parking lot reading electric meter
Behavioral observation involve direct witnessing actor engaging behavior watching close person sits next another person
Behavioral choice person selects two option voting behavior choice punishment another participant
Brain imaging involves analyzing activity within brain performing various task
This allows u link behavior brain function help understand information processed
Different type imaging technique vary temporal spatial resolution
Brain imaging often used
require mathematically logically formal representation problem
Computer model used simulation experimental verification different specific general
Computational modeling help u understand functional organization particular cognitive phenomenon
There two basic approach cognitive modeling
The first focused abstract mental function intelligent mind operates using symbol second follows neural associative property human brain called subsymbolic
Other approach gaining popularity include use theory also technique putting symbolic model connectionist model correspondence integration
often drawn also gaining popularity
All approach tend generalized form integrated computational model intelligence order applied explanation improvement individual
Research method borrowed directly also help u understand aspect intelligence
These method allow u understand intelligent behavior implemented physical system
Cognitive science given rise model human perception influential development part
It also given rise new theory many theory
It made presence known well constituting substantial wing modern
Fields cognitive science influential understanding brain particular functional system functional deficit ranging speech production auditory processing visual perception
It made progress understanding damage particular area brain affect cognition helped uncover root cause result specific dysfunction
The cognitive science began intellectual movement called
Cognitive science prehistory traceable back ancient Greek philosophical text see includes writer
However although early writer contributed greatly philosophical discovery would ultimately lead development psychology working entirely different set tool core concept cognitive scientist
The modern culture cognitive science traced back early sought understand organizing principle mind
McCulloch Pitts developed first variant known model computation inspired structure
Another precursor early development
instrumental development
The modern computer would play central role cognitive science metaphor mind tool investigation
The first instance cognitive science experiment done academic institution took place established working within social psychology department conducting experiment using computer memory model human cognition
In published scathing review book
At time Skinner paradigm dominated psychology
Most psychologist focused functional relation stimulus response without positing internal representation
Chomsky argued order explain language needed theory like attributed internal representation characterized underlying order
The term coined commentary concerned state research
In decade journal founded
The founding meeting held resulted cognitive science becoming internationally visible enterprise
In started first undergraduate education program Cognitive Science led
In assistance Professor Stillings became first institution world grant undergraduate degree Cognitive Science
In first Cognitive Science Department world founded
In early much cognitive science research focused possibility
Researchers would write computer program language attempt formally characterize step human being went instance making decision solving problem hope better understanding human also hope creating artificial mind
This approach known symbolic AI
Eventually limit symbolic AI research program became apparent
For instance seemed unrealistic comprehensively list human knowledge form usable symbolic computer program
The late saw rise research paradigm
Under point view often attributed mind could characterized set complex association represented layered network
Critics argue phenomenon better captured symbolic model connectionist model often complex little explanatory power
Recently symbolic connectionist model combined making possible take advantage form explanation
Some recognized name cognitive science usually either controversial cited
Within philosophy familiar name include writes computational system perspective known controversial argument advocate
Others include advocate also known articulating famous writing question nature word thought
In realm linguistics influential also become notable political commentator
In prominent
Popular name discipline psychology include
Anthropologists involved collaborative project cognitive social psychologist political scientist evolutionary biologist attempt develop general theory culture formation religion political association
Computational theory model simulation also developed like James McClelland Philip
Other contribution made Marvin Minsky Alan Turing John von Neumann
Licklider Noam Chomsky

A primary key unique identifier record
When table created one field typically assigned primary key
While primary key often number may also text field
For example database contains definition computer term would make sense term listed database
By defining Term field primary key would ensure term listed database
While table primary key usually assigned specific field also comprised multiple value
For example database news article might use title date field uniquely identify entry
By combining Title Date field primary key would ensure entry title day
If multiple field table duplicate value database management system also allow field defined Unique
This similar setting field primary key exactly thing
The primary key also act pointer record provides simple way DBMS search sort access record
It also help relate record across multiple table
Therefore multiple field within table defined Unique table one primary key
The primary key field must also defined record set
After undefined identifier useful

In SQL database one column uniquely identify row table
The primary key defined using PRIMARY KEY constraint either creating table altering table
Each table one primary key
The column defined primary key inherently NOT NULL constraint meaning must contain value
If table altered add primary key column defined primary key must contain blank NULL value
If column primary key constraint added
Also relational database adding primary key creates table index improve speed finding specific row data SQL query run table


In primary key relational table uniquely identifies record table
Databases use key compare sort store record create relationship record
Choosing primary key database one important step process
It normal attribute guaranteed unique Social Security number table one record per person generated database management system globally unique identifier GUID Microsoft
may consist single attribute multiple attribute combination
Primary key unique link related information table primary key used
It must entered record created never changed
Each table database column two specifically primary key
Imagine STUDENTS table contains record student university
The student unique student ID number good choice primary key STUDENTS table
The student first last name good choice always chance one student might name
Other primary key include ZIP code email address employer change represent many people
The identifier must unique
Even Social Security number change Social Security Administration reassigns number someone affected identity theft
Some people even Social Security number
When choose right primary key database lookup speedy reliable
Just remember There error

Database structure generally divided two respect namely flat database relational database
Relational database easier understand flat database
Because relational database simple design easy data operation
Database also relational structure found table store data
On table consists column row column define type information saved
Basically database useful time retain information categorized logically
For example want save information data database enterprise school group matter business become table
In database relationship relationship one one many many one many The key set column used identify access particular row row
Identified key explanatory table index constraint reference
The column part one key
A unique key key constrained two value
Unique key column contain NULL
For example column number employee defined unique key value column identifies one employee
No two employee number worker
The mechanism used enforce uniqueness index unique key
Unique index table column collection ordered column identifies value specify function unique row
A unique index contain NULL
The key one unique key defined table selected first important key
There one primary key table
A primary index automatically created primary key
The main index used database manager efficient access table row allows database manager enforce uniqueness primary key
You also specify index key column efficiently access data processing query
If table natural unique key order arrival method used distinguish unique row use time stamp part key help
Weld Line Automation Weld Line Programming If column table contains duplicate determine key one column
A key one column composite key

If composite key easily defined also considered create new column unique
A foreign key field table corresponding relationship candidate key table
Foreign key used table
For example suppose two table customer includes customer data order table includes customer order
Intention order must associated client customer table
To place foreign key order table relates key customer table
Identifying foreign key column set column table refers column set column another table
Column table must reference key pillar super key referenced table
Value reference column line must occur single row referenced table
Thus row reference table contain value exist referenced table except potentially null
In way reference made link information together important part database normalization
Various row table reference may refer row referenced table
Most time reflects parent table reference table many child table referencing table relationship
Below example relationship Company also schedule Contact
Tables company parent link
In child contact schedule Field CompanyID table show contact contacted company owned
Diversification foreign key defines many record child table link record master table
In example child diversity since company number contact
Primary Key Foreign Key Relationship It Primary Foreign Key figure relationship two key

common real world easy read Parents child
In figure show One Product attributed Many
The line product continuous line small dotted line
This mean field Primary Key Table
A dotted line show existence Foreign Key
Relationship important real world able see around u every day
For example many customer may order product
Many product ordered customer
This called Relationship
It implemented directly Database Table relationship
The solution create intermediate table record combination exist Customer Product
For example customer ordered three product three record customer intermediate table
Low key combination parent table primary key intermediate table

data update easy without change information different file
info always date chance remaining old data forgotten file
typo avoid problem data type Excel dreaded syndrome
avoid unwanted conversion like November November validated data data entry filter impossible data existing information
With database combine different data easily
No force data different format
Do away intermediate Excel spreadsheet often generated manipulating data
And often dare delete case contain important information
Data manipulation done using query
This mean Structured Query Language SQL merge update manage data user need know SQL perform complex task
In Microsoft Access example Visual Query Builder provides simple intuitive interface make query
A database adjusted reveal new area investigation present large quantity data intuitive form
Often pattern become apparent data
With special database possible new way data many different source brought together displayed quickly fast
Ends Excel file subtlety different
Never sure correct file delete case
With relational database dilemma past
Your data set analysis created using query stored database
No copy made data instead link query directly statistic
The main goal development guarantee system enjoy longer life maintenance cost much le
This process system contained behavior reused included recent behavior
The ultimate goal new development Objects operational system prone model real world complete fashion traditional method
Objects organized class object behavior
Based object rather data processing system far reliable traditional system especially new behavior built existing object
Because object dynamically called accessible new object created time
New object inherit data attribute one many object
Behavior inherited novel behavior added without performing function existing system
Database Object capability expanded additional tie new data type access method function available object oriented programming
add character string data type
Complex data type combine feature data type already exist database
able determine data type text containing desired time number byte used create user defined data type opaque
also add virtual processor
By using encapsulation database object want contact form table
For example Table includes name address phone number email address contact
Through class encapsulating Contacts combine information table one
So query database information generate report style designed include information

A primary key special relational database table column combination column designated uniquely identify table record
A primary key main feature A primary key either existing table column column specifically generated database according defined sequence
The primary key concept critical efficient relational database
Without primary key closely related foreign key concept relational database would work
Almost individual deal primary key frequently unknowingly everyday life
For example student routinely assigned unique identification ID number citizen uniquely identifiable Social Security number
For example database must hold data stored commercial bank
Two database table include store basic static customer data name date birth address Social Security number etc
store various bank account data account creation date account type withdrawal limit corresponding account information etc
To uniquely identify customer column combination column selected guarantee two customer never unique value
Thus certain column immediately eliminated surname date birth
A good primary key candidate column designated hold Social Security number
However account holder may Social Security number column candidacy eliminated
The next logical option use combination column surname date birth email address resulting long cumbersome primary key
The best option create separate primary key new column named
Then database automatically generates unique number time customer added guaranteeing unique identification
As key created column designated primary key within SQL script creates table null value automatically rejected
The account number associated allows secure handling customer query also demonstrates primary key offer fastest method data searching within table
For example customer may asked provide surname conducting bank query
A common surname Smith query likely return multiple result
When querying data utilizing primary key uniqueness feature guarantee one result

A foreign key column group column relational database table provides link data two table
It act table reference primary key another table thereby establishing link
The majority table relational database system adhere foreign key concept
In complex database data warehouse data domain must added across multiple table thus maintaining relationship
The concept referential integrity derived foreign key theory
Foreign key implementation complex primary key
For column acting foreign key corresponding value exist link table
Special care must taken inserting data removing data foreign key column careless deletion insertion might destroy relationship two table
For instance two table customer order relationship created introducing foreign key order table refers customer ID customer table
The customer ID column exists customer order table
The customer ID order table becomes foreign key referring primary key customer table
To insert entry order table foreign key constraint must satisfied
An attempt enter customer ID present customer table fails thus maintaining table referential integrity
Foreign key constraint either immediate deferred
By default foreign key constraint immediate
A violation immediate foreign key constraint throw exception immediately
Deferred foreign key constraint reported commit
Some referential action associated foreign key action include following Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

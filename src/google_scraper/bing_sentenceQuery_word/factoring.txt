Factoring algebra lot like baking
I see cake
Is birthday
Oh I sorry I get anything
But since I I
Mmm I really taste baking soda
Ca
No
Well definitely baking soda cake
OK I ca taste
That combined ingredient form something new yummy cake
In algebra take expression stir together make new expression
But even though may obvious term started ingredient still
You ca take baking soda finished cake factor original term expression
Let learn
Here expression
Let say want factor
We define finding term multiplied together get expression
Our expression important part like ingredient bake
First two term
The term number variable number variable multiplied together
Terms separated plus minus sign
constant number
It constantly variable symbol standing number know
coefficient
Notice prefix
The coefficient multiplies variable
It codependent cooperating coefficient
Now need find factor
This like looking baking soda usually bit easier
It like picking raisin oatmeal cookie
You may get hand little dirty cookie le sure
A factor term extracted equation
Think number
Its factor
Why
Because
With extract
Each term multiple
If factor
Note reverse

And getting u back
What
Is common factor
No
call relatively prime
Remember prime number factor
Relatively prime number shared factor
Let practice factoring
Here expression
OK factor

What
prime
So relatively prime
Does mean ca factor
Are going eat raisin
No
Look variable

We factor
That get u
Cookie crisis averted
To check work let put back together


That get u
Excellent
Let try another
OK might immediately see factor
It like seeing unwanted olive pizza stand
But else
share factor
factor include
factor include
Where overlap

Get FREE access day create account
What factor
If factor
That better pizza still olive speak
We want greatest common factor
That simply biggest shared factor
Here
If factor get
Let check

That good
And
Good
This pizza safe eat
How one

Well
We extract
Then get time plus
What time

So
That bit like asking ice cream cone minus ice cream
To summarize learned factoring algebra
To factor find term multiplied together make expression
Expressions consist various term
A term certain part like constant variable coefficient
When factor algebra looking greatest common factor shared term expression
If number relatively prime like ca factor constant

A used real world set number need represented different scale order fit specific
For instance bit hold value large
If used represent value scale factor would introduced
Notice scale factor extends range also decrease
In example instance number could represented stored represents real world stored represents real world
Certain number format may chosen application convenience programming certain advantage offered hardware number format
For instance early processor natively support representing fractional value integer used store representation real world value applying scale factor real value
By necessity done since hardware support fractional value
Once scaled representation real value stored scaling ignored value need come back real world
For instance adding two scaled value valid unscaling value adding real value scaling result former much easier faster
For operation however scaling important
Multiplication instance need take account fact number scaled
As example consider two real world value
The real world multiplication real world value Now suppose storing value scale factor
If simply multiply stored representation get following Note scaled real world value simply product likewise scaled representation
Also note write answer reason simple PZ answer
You see rearranging statement line following equivalent Note substituted line
You see result NOT
If answer could simply store directly since scale factor built case addition subtraction
For multiplication however see product two scaled value extra scaling built
As long taken account still need convert performing operation need divide result storing back
You stored result multiplication fine storing result storing scaled representation result
As already mentioned many older processor possibly current one natively support fractional mathematics
In case fractional value scaled integer multiplying ten power whatever decimal precision want retain
In word want preserve digit right decimal point need multiply entire number
Or working binary want save digit right would multiply number alternately value place left
For example consider following set real world fractional value Notice digit right decimal place
If want save information word lose need multiply number giving u integer value also note number stored integer require least bit realistically
Certain processor particularly common industry built support arithmetic format
Since fractional part number take bit field range value possible fixed point value le number bit would provide integer
For instance bit field unsigned integer store value unsigned fixed point fractional bit bit left integer value store integer value note value two field store fixed point field also store fractional value integer value
It therefore common scaling factor used store real world value may larger maximum value fixed point format
As example assume using unsigned bit fixed point format fractional bit integer bit
As mentioned highest integer value store highest mixed value store
If real world value want manipulate range need scale value order get fixed point
Note use scale factor scaling give u greater greatest value store fixed point format
work scale factor however fit range
Let use scale factor convert following real world value scaled representation Scaling scale factor give u following value Note however many value truncated contain repeating fraction
When try store fixed point format going lose precision seem precise integer
This interesting problem said could fit different value bit format trying store value range possible value
As turn problem scale factor introduced unnecessary precision requirement
The resolution problem find better scaling factor
For information
An example illustrated certain scale factor cause unnecessary precision loss
We revisit example explore situation
We storing representation real data bit unsigned fixed point field integer bit fractional bit
This give u range decimal
Our real world data integer range decimal
Note unique value may want store bit field plenty since bit unique configuration
In example given picked scale factor number would small enough fit range
However began scaling following real world data We discovered precision fraction going problem
The following box illustrates showing original data scaled decimal value binary equivalent scaled value
Notice several binary fraction require fractional bit provided fixed point format
To fit field would simply truncate remaining bit giving u following stored representation Or decimal And need bring back real world need divide scale factor giving following real world value Notice changed
For one thing integer anymore immediately indicating error introduced storage due poor choice scaling factor
Most perfect scale factor probably always get error introduced scaling process
However certainly may possible pick better scaling factor
For one thing note dividing number power two shifting bit right power two
It thing decimal divide shift decimal digit one place right divide shift two place right
The pattern bit change move
On hand divide number NOT integer power changing bit pattern
This likely produce bit pattern even bit right binary point artificially introducing required precision
Therefore almost always preferable use scale factor power two
You may still lose bit get shifted right end field least wo introducing bit shifted end
To illustrate use power two scale factor let use factor data set
The binary value original data set given As already knew fit bit
Scaling dividing shifting bit place right
All really mean inserting binary point first four last four bit number
Conveniently exact format fixed point field
So suspected since number require bit represent integer take bit scale fit fixed point format

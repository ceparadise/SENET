submitted These healthiest animal eat consume lot resource reach stage killed meat eat much
Post comment
These healthiest animal eat Only bred fatty grow quickly possible
consume lot resource reach stage killed meat Actually chicken cow killed relatively young
Cows couple year chicken several week hatching
On per volume basis raising chicken cow contained environment cheap VERY profitable
It might good ENVIRONMENT expensive
eat much
Because cheap affordable source protein used rare
Steak roast adorning table purview wealthy
So became status symbol like Coach bag became profitable produce finally became possible produce en masse
While hunting deer might cost le limited ability supply market game meat
Also everyone taste venison wild boar quality control harder
When speaking diverse small mid size farm answer would synergy
In general animal sustainable protein source producing fertilizer vegetable
farm
These particular animal exclusive benefit provide farmer similar protein source
As far healthy eat quite excellent protein source land mammal
Fat content could said good thing meat nutritionist gospel change yearly I
The caloric content bovine quite vast cow also produce gallon milk per day depending breed
Goats milk compare cow milk
This quite exclusive Oxen commonly muscle behind moving earth timber prior mechanized farming since cheaper work horse
Chickens low nonexistent individual maintenance ready slaughter month low feed almost immediately usable fertilizer also lay egg per day per hen summer
Easily contained automatically roost home dusk
Pigs also great store caloric investment large animal provides unique waste disposal farm easy contain feed bacon
I think answer question animal taste need mentioned
Humans tend prefer available ultimately market largest hand deciding animal farmer provide
None aside market statement applies factory farming fwiw
Pigs unique waste disposal farm I scared ask I
Can elaborate
feed literally anything
They eat anything thing add compost would waste otherwise
Certain vegetable processing leftover table food scrap etc
Yes human remains movie make
This excellent answer
Chickens pig eat basically whatever much le picky appear get food poisoning
Any household grows cook food able easily feed handful chicken free
Pigs might require little garbage keep year round
You course get feeder pig spring someone else keep garden kitchen leaving year processed fall
Not small number easy keep fed everything produce make even better veggie following year
Reminds old joke modern farming method take one perfect solution divide separate multiple problem Once growing veggie easy source pork chicken becomes clear next step food security saving money source milk
Cows sheep incredible awesome animal planet
You may need eat protein need protein eat vitamin need ruminates like cow sheep eat grass create whatever body need simple raw material
So common large animal rural homestead large feed garbage eats grass incredibly common plant requires little additional care
Plus keep grass low help keep snake rabbit annoying animal back
removed removed At least chicken part popularity come blandness
We managed breed chicken point take chicken make acceptable least pretty much meat eating society world without much work

You might curious learn classic story Scrum chicken pig cartoon
My name I creator
This inaugural Scrum chicken pig cartoon
Since original publication cartoon series September I made update content page
Please visit learn current information Implementing Scrum real world
If interested real world conversation Implementing Scrum real world If interested Certified Scrum Training please visit This story first ongoing series help explain Scrum And
What Scrum Do get correct time
Probably
And OK
The plan u learn
So using Chicken Pig
The story depicted weird help others explain two main type people Scrum
I amazed Human Resource Departments many company I shut example probably matter time
This still best example I know explain role cartoon series reflects
The basic premise Chicken Pig seen cartoon example
Here easy definition Chickens versus Pigs
A Pig someone skin game
My friend super awesome person
aptly refers people role Having Bacon Pig role considered core team member
Performers
People DO work
Get
I would consider role Pigs team
A Chicken someone something gain Pigs performing end really contribute day day getting thing Their egg renewable resource many get laid egg
I get asked following question many people starting use Scrum Can I Pig Chicken time No
You Pig Chicken time
This something I work middle manager struggle daily basis
The concept take coaching constant gentle reminder
I call something want see organization
A video commentary cartoon viewed posted February I hope simplicity cartoon get point across

Good stuff
No fluff
I promise
Learn available service around

Really
I conversation

learn share knowledge build career
As I learning Scrum seems part iteration may chicken become pig come time part
Then go back chicken
Is correct thinking
That stake iteration change iteration
work
software built get planned coded tested refined done
I wrong thinking
Thanks
As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Unless team stakeholder project
Pigs Scrum team member product owner scrum master developer tester
Chickens people want product customer management
The time I see person product team
Then team pig work putting line also customer want product
You pig as line regard project success failure
Based experience understanding SCRUM role change sprint
Either chicken pig
A pig one get work done
developer chicken one gain something pig work
product owner
EDIT Just found definition chicken pig For duration iteration either pig chicken ca
As team member particiapants sprint always working iteration backlog
Assuming Iteration mean time period set team producing potentially shippable product increment also known sprint
In opinion either chicken pig change iteration sprint
If experiance role changing like sprint probably long person really chicked whole time
There pig chicken article say part I would consider role Product Owner ScrumMaster pig team
Product Owner Scrum Master Team pig role Stakeholders customer vendor Managers chicken role
Based I say generally changing pig chicken
swapping pig chicken role Sprint endanger initial contract made prior start thus endangering successful delivery
The concept pig chicken Scrum metaphor otherwise known project management field product development cycle
The short memorable funny starting eatery make great metaphor help explaining stakeholder concept without resorting management lingo
One great thing make current management technology accessible
Making would say software system
So chicken indirect stakeholder turn pig direct stakeholder vice versa development cycle
Can person chicken pig time
Answering latter definite person either chicken pig context single project whichever stake greater
The whole chicken pig division idea giving greater decision making power responsibility project stage people directly involved interested positive outcome pig limiting interference coming sometimes powerful external player chicken
Can role change project
Yes
Scrum development methodology aim putting collective responsibility outcome entire team
Agile especially Scrum promotes attitude
Not structured method instance one weakness team responsibility end soon interim deliverable accepted
functional spec shift weight issue surface much project onto shoulder unfortunate team member responsibility make project successful later development stage usually developer
Scrum iteration called Sprint aimed delivering complete change spec product instead sort interim deliverable
The team provides lot input deciding go Sprint subsequently collectively commit delivering change
That creates contract team outside world
Changing role Sprint endanger contract
If pig becomes chicken longer responsible seeing Sprint completion putting burden dealing shortcoming work onto shoulder remaining team member
When chicken becomes pig Sprint realistically commit something agreed came board
Hence best role stay unchanged duration Sprint
In Team Scrum book chicken pig sprint
And probably Scrum Gurus tell Teams change Sprints either
If part Team stake change Sprint Team responsible piece potentially shippable code commited produce
If think way like I responsible backend part feature built first half sprint wrong track
However Scrum book without thinking right may wrong decision might team member valuable also responsibility good opinion
I work primarly startup including one
In case I act role Lean Development call Chief Engineer Product Director
I lead technologist well product manager voice customer
If got someone like organization might need departmentalize role strictly Scrum orthodoxy suggests start make use methodological tradition approach need Scrum often

What learned avian brain behavior last year contradicts hundred year misinformed view chicken bird
Much previously thought exclusive domain human primate communication brain cognitive function social behavior discovered chicken bird
It nothing short revolution understanding chicken
Recent scientific research chicken behavior confirms many observed chicken closely year long known true chicken far intelligent cognitively sophisticated previously believed
While intelligence level morally relevant criterion treat others finding help u debunk prejudice harmful stereotype chicken contribute utterly abysmal status society
To frank treat like unfeeling unthinking object
In fact chicken turkey combined represent animal killed food
Some billion globally slaughtered year six week age
One striking discovery made researching subject modern domesticated chicken contrary popular belief much common wild jungle fowl descends
As author Annie Potts point Despite different circumstance wild domestic fowl behaviour permitted natural expression remain This contradicts common belief natural behavior desire essentially bred domestic chicken
Chickens distinct vocalization communicate wide range information pertaining territory mating nesting distress danger fear contentment food discovery
A January feature story The Scientific American called open explaining chicken deceptive cunning posse communication skill par primate us sophisticated signal convey intention
When making decision chicken take account prior experience knowledge surrounding situation
It solve complex problem empathizes individual The lead researcher SA article also published numerous depth scientific report study chicken behavior August also featured recent documentary watch clicking title
Among many striking finding work Smith provides multiple example chicken use highly complex form communication using signal functionally referential representational form communication observed many primate bird raven chickadee
One example kind communication male entice female food form immediately lead mating
This mean female take time eavesdrop evaluate male behavior also must form various male reputation providing food commit various experience memory
Only female express mating preference
Another example Smith offer submissive male flock use clever deceptive strategy court female diverting attention away dominant male would otherwise derail plan
The objective outsmart dominant male attracting potential mate away without getting wise submissive male intention
And strategy often succeeds
Potts cite example chicken responding call indicating presence novel food much food call known food
Thus appears cognitive process involved representational thinking chicken similar required associative learning A hierarchal order important social life chicken
The head rooster protects territory group inhabits well chick hen group
Groups composed dominant hen remain close head rooster well submissive hen rooster keep closer periphery
Roosters display number courting ritual attract mate
Hens attracted rooster based physical behavioral characteristic
The pecking order established maintains order stability within group
Additionally Smith identifies specific chicken behavior demonstrate complex social world including individual tend others learn likely imitation emulation An article called July present finding research team Imperial College London found area brain human bird important cognition memory problem solving wired region brain similar Professor Murray Shanahan author study wrote Birds evolving separately mammal around million year hardly surprising microscope brain bird look quite different mammal
Yet bird shown remarkably intelligent similar way mammal human Yet many animal ethicist behavioral expert point problem comparison prevent u authentic understanding chicken think feel
Karen Davis president presented tremendously analysis comparison article entitled
Leading avian neurologist researcher argues instead ranking animal according simplistic anthropocentric model intelligence would accurate assessment recognized many different measure kind intelligence
And evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff explains article comparison silly dangerous suggest animal suffer le smarter one
Moreover never able know certain form intelligence animal might posse could simply outside human understanding
As author Annie Potts explains While chicken display feeling comparable human grief fear happiness doubt also posse exceptional form emotion consciousness even rigorous scientific test may begin uncover simply inimitable perspective chicken register conceptually experientially within human yet another measure cognition awareness animal mind
Science aside u easily identify emotion animal close like dog cat
And u spend lot time around chicken see visceral diverse expression emotion yet society still generally believe chicken express emotional state act emotion
But case chicken behavior emotion science proving popular opinion wrong
A Spring gained important new insight mind domestic hen discovering first time show clear physiological behavioral empathic response chick
We found adult female bird posse least one essential underpinning attribute empathy ability affected share emotional state another reported Jo Edgar PhD student involved Bristol study
The research team belief finding great importance since chicken modern agriculture routinely forced witness pain suffering death flock mate
Such witnessing trauma distress could exacerbate already animal forced live
Those u observe chicken daily basis see memory recall action wide variety everyday situation
Recent science tell u chicken recognize individual face even several month separation
They also confirm chicken consider future practice benefit later reward something previously believed exclusive human primate
As stated earlier chicken learn trial error
They retain learned past experience recall apply learned future situation
Researcher Monash University Australia released study chicken behavior May
An important part study involved observation mother hen chick specifically mother hen taught young edible food item chick learned retained learned mother hen modified teaching based progress chick learning
One recent high profile study chicken behavior veteran researcher Christine Nicol University Bristol credit chicken ability perform complex skill within day hatching basic arithmetic self control basic structural engineering skill develop human toddler year
The mass medium turned comparison catchy headline like Ethologist University Trento Italy widely recognized pioneer chicken behavior cognition research specifically newly hatched chick
His work demonstrates chick born understanding basic arithmetic geometry physic advanced quick learning retention
Italian psychologist Rosa Rugani Lucia Regolin Vallortigara showed single object smaller set object
The chick study found imprint bond object mother flock mate
The complex numerical ability manipulate number performing simple arithmetic
We know rhesus monkey know chick explain researcher
In recent interview Vallortigara explains Basically I use young domestic chick investigate origin knowledge I interested core knowledge ability like number space time cause I trying clarify much ability already available birth interaction object world may shaped learning experience
We found indeed newly hatched chick posse surprisingly sophisticated ability birth know basic principle physic solidity could perform basic arithmetic small numerousness deal geometry enclosed surface orient While scientific researcher appear reluctant extrapolate ethical implication work chicken behavior many identify routine chicken farming practice present serious ethical problem
From stage chicken science presented confirms chicken exploited meat egg endure staggering degree physical psychological suffering
Neuroscientist Lesley Rogers author argues compelled understand cognitive ability chicken bird exploited least respected avian specie
Even Vallortigara claim see ethical implication discovery nonetheless make clear ethical judgment say Moreover exploitation billion chicken every year biological requirement animal flesh morally indefensible
When easily make choice harm animal Karen Davis eloquently articulates article Much research chicken behavior biology motivated poultry industry objective efficiently exploit chicken resource
As author Annie Potts point book It coincidence first creature full genome map chicken Gallus studied specie world
Every biological feature experimented aim rendering chicken serviceable Free Harm opposes animal breeding exploitation includes animal testing recognize even observational study conducted natural environment possible encourage natural behavior present ethical problem
Aside ethical challenge observational study chicken behavior intended benefit specie rather industry exploit may great value changing society attitude toward chicken
The bird study spared life agricultural commodity
And researcher work rehome animal sanctuary private individual care companion
While science provides important empirical validation understanding chicken behavior anyone inquisitive mind interest chicken learn great deal observing interacting
In short time individual personality rich life experience revealed
Free Harm documented using photo story provide intimate portrayal chicken pleasure getting know
Karen Davis also offered compelling chronicle year experience rescued bird sanctuary essay A future article focus learning chicken behavior sanctuary

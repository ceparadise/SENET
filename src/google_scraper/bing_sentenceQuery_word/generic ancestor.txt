In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

Suppose I What fast algorithm constructing complete family tree using information
family forest everyone may related single common ancestor
This homework book
It derived issue I coupling adaptive finite element code blackbox mesh generation software boiled core problem expressed analogy share mathematical structure
Right I O method seems horribly inefficient
Thank help
I implemented Gilles suggestion Matlab tested
Here pseudocode code unit test script
I release public domain
We finite set D person relation x mean x
This relation following property Let given data structure following operation defined We also use data structure node contains person set child
If tree write person root node set child
A set tree
We start empty forest add person one one
At step relationship forest relationship ancestor relation
We define recursive function insert tree forest
forest F tree none element tree related person F
Let x
First check whether x ancestor existing person split set F according property x F
Let C subset F consisting descendant x root tree descendant x element also descendant transitivity F remaining subset
By antisymmetry none person C ancestor x
None element related person C assumption
Let u tree root person x set child root C
By chain assumption x ancestor one tree F
Iterate tree F determine one ancestor x root splitting operation one set guaranteed contain one element
Start empty forest iteratively graft person D grafting person mean grafting tree person root child
From remark algorithm easy prove recursive call graft valid relative node tree inserted inside tree x ancestor tree iff x
graft F performs n ancestor test n number person F one test per root F one test per root descendant new node test performed recursive call applies subset F including root
The complexity operation linear number ancestor test performed
Therefore forest construction algorithm performs n ancestor test n total number person
In fact easy see never performs test twice
The overall complexity therefore O
In worst case possible n test performed
This happens two person related unavoidable case
follows somewhat informal description O algorithm build dag V E expressing ancestor relation subsequently thin family tree
dag node person involved edge shall represent ancestor relationship u v E u ancestor v
let n
step build transitive closure ancestor relation iterating pair candidate adding u v E iff
complexity O
step determine source node dag
source node represent minimal element ancestor relation seen partial order
note exactly source node per connected component since consider ancestor among sex
thus edge ending given node v actually forward edge introduced transitive closure underlying family tree
step actually implemented part step counting incoming edge visited node adding node v indeg v heap deleting node indeg v heap
completion step heap contains node indeg ie
source node
node max inserted deleted heap step contributes O n n
step perform depth first search tha dag starting source node
node visited first time record distance current source node immediate predecessor current dfs root path
node visited current root path length greater recorded node set length immediate predecessor value current dfs path delete recorded edge dag
dfs finished dag reduced family forest
every edge visited max complexity O E
step work dag contain crossing edge
therefore given pair u v V never different path u v equal length
summary O O n n O E O By posting answer agree

I working type system hit upon problem seems similar lowest common ancestor
Given two type I need find smallest sequence conversion result target type
If I simple type tree I know get result unfortunately I slightly complex graph structure
That graph key point
It unidirectional loop ever formed
Due unlimited number type however produced statically
The distance path generally quite low
It feel like tree bunch shortcut edge
Initially I looked lowest common ancestor mainly described tree algorithm
I yet given hope I could adapt
The possibility would generic algorithm
I hoping somebody seen problem similar one give reference approach
It seems familiar enough I assume something must exist I searching wrong
Here attempt describe formally
Let graph G V vertex set outgoing edge V
Note graph dynamic possibly infinite way construct form G V entire graph
A path formed vertex following available edge node

The length path equal number vertex sequence
There cycle possible
The set path two node expressed Pnm
Note Pnm determined empty finite number step
Enumerating entire Pnm set practically possible
The problem finding shortest path two vertex third vertex
That given find path exist length length minimal
If lowest common ancestor two type always exists unique structure
Computing lowest common ancestor possible worst case runtime complexity good I would expected intuitively

In based another object class using implementation
Inheritance language mechanism one object acquires property behaviour parent object
Inheritance allows programmer create class built upon existing class specify new implementation maintain behaviour realizing interface independently extend original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise
An inherited class called parent class super class
The term inheritance loosely used programming narrow use reserved programming one class another corresponding technique programming instead called one object another
Inheritance
In language inheritance subtyping agree whereas others differ general subtyping establishes relationship whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship necessarily semantic relationship inheritance ensure
To distinguish concept subtyping also known whereas inheritance defined known
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship
Inheritance contrasted one object another object object one class contain object another class see
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
Inheritance invented
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language
Multiple Inheritance programming widely supposed difficult implement efficiently
For example summary book actually claimed adding Multiple inheritance impossible
Thus multiple inheritance seemed challenge
Since I considered multiple inheritance early found simple efficient implementation technique
I could resist challenge
I suspect case fashion affected sequence event
In JDK Java support multiple inheritance
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level
A derived class derivative class inherits one entity one class called
The semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits superclass
The general form defining derived class Some language support construct also
For example define specification class also inherited heir
The superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality specialized subclass inherit modify supplement
The software inherited subclass considered subclass
A reference instance class may actually referring one subclass
The actual class object referenced impossible predict
A uniform interface used invoke member function object number different class
Subclass may replace superclass function entirely new function must share
In language class may declared adding certain class declaration
Examples include final keyword onwards sealed keyword
Such modifier added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration
Such sealed class restrict particularly developer access precompiled
The sealed class subclass easily deduced reference pointer object class actually referencing instance class instance subclass exist instance superclass reference type violates type system

Because exact type object referenced known execution used instead also called requires one lookup depending whether supported programming language used
Just class may method declaration may contain method modifier prevent method overridden
replaced new function name type signature subclass
A method unoverridable simply accessible class class member function true though
A sealed method frozen feature overridden
If superclass method invocation superclass method
Some language require method specifically declared virtual
others method virtual

An invocation method always statically dispatched
address function call determined
Static dispatch faster dynamic dispatch allows optimisation
Inheritance used two class
Many permit class object replace implementation inherited
This process usually called
Overriding introduces complication version behavior instance inherited class one part class one parent base class
The answer varies programming language language provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class
For instance base method property overridden subclass marked virtual abstract override modifier
An alternative overriding inherited code
Implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass code base class
By default subclass retains operation base class subclass may operation replacing implementation
In following Python example subclass override method base class
The base class comprises operation compute sum two integer
The subclass functionality base class exception operation transforms number square replacing operation transforms number respectively
The subclass therefore compute sum two integer
In quarter class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor
The primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance instance reusing class necessarily substituted instance inherited class
An alternative technique explicit requires programming effort avoids substitutability issue
In private inheritance used form without substitutability
Whereas public inheritance represents relationship delegation represents relationship private protected inheritance thought implemented term relationship
Another frequent use inheritance guarantee class maintain certain common interface implement method
The parent class combination implemented operation operation implemented child class
Often interface change supertype child implement behavior described instead parent class
Inheritance similar distinct
Subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction said establish relationship subtype existing abstraction either implicitly explicitly depending language support
The relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance language support inheritance subtyping mechanism
For example following code establishes explicit inheritance relationship class subclass subtype used wherever specified via reference pointer object
In programming language support inheritance relationship base class derived class relationship implementation mechanism code reuse compared relationship
Inheritance even programming language support inheritance subtyping mechanism necessarily entail
It entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected see
Compare
In OOP language notion code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another
Using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraint
For example consider class contains person name date birth address phone number
We define subclass called contains person grade point average class taken another subclass called contains person employer salary
In defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restriction desirable The alternative inheritance
This technique support polymorphism code reuse separating behavior primary class hierarchy including specific behavior class required business domain class
This approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modification run time allows one class implement behavior instead restricted behavior ancestor class
Implementation inheritance controversial among programmer theoretician programming since least
Among author advocate interface inheritance instead favor
For example mentioned proposed overcome static nature inheritance class
As fundamental solution problem introduces distinct relationship combining property inheritance composition new concept
According main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary form modification base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral change subclass
Using interface avoids problem implementation shared API
Another way stating inheritance break
The problem surface clearly open system client code expected inherit class substituted system class algorithm
Reportedly Java inventor spoken implementation inheritance stating would include redesign Java
Language design decouple inheritance subtyping interface inheritance appeared early modern example programming language
Complex inheritance inheritance used within insufficiently mature design may lead
Another issue inheritance subclass must defined code mean program user add new subclass
Other design pattern allow program user define variation entity runtime

Is easy way obtain generic parameter ancestor class
immediate parent class discussed ancestor class hierarchy
For example Let say class How could I know given particular descendant class example type parameter ancestor class
Note information present compile time
For example I know instantiated
In way instantiated
So possible reflection
Note I interested runtime value parameter compile time data
Thanks help
Well Here approach
I saying best even good approach I saying might able adapt need
This probably still I think would Class class name far I get
I know get Class Type Type interface empty cast something get class like GenericArrayType ParameterizedType TypeVariable WildcardType
I presumed
So improved version I stumped go

I stumbled upon someone answer question regarding implementing tree node
I wanted get someone thought using Forest Data Structure implement Family Genealogy Tree consist multiple node child
I may use Forest Tree however representation I searched found look similar disjointed set I want parent node already child
I hope make sense I saying
Any advice comment could offer would much appreciated
I hope I clear enough understanding problem
If I let know otherwise following help
Just clear I consider context genealogy
A tree simply branching structure
In genealogy could consider latest child root create tree describes ancestry person
Yes latest child root oldest known ancestor
This quite probably really want anyways
Now complicated family issue like man child two different woman run problem tree
If separate tree child father need duplicated able occur tree
Unpractical say least
As Neil mentioned comment time switch graph model
Most important clear typical confusion The general populace speaks something called Family genealogy tree computer scientist must realize tree tree per definition given computer science biology matter
We clear concise mathematical definition tree data structure genealogy tree match
Why
Simply computer science tree different branch able grow back together
With family possible
Quite drastically could case father two childrens spawn
Moral implication aside result view representable tree
Enter world graph A graph generic term thing connected
Hence every computer science tree also graph
A special restricted one course
In graph root anymore node similar property called source
There also leaf anymore node similar property called sink
In term genealogy limit result graph making DAG directed acyclic graph
It directed two node declare one parent side one child side
For example could always point parent child one direction feasible
If want able traverse structure direction may even consider undirected variant
Acyclicity simply mean circle data structure
It pretty clear applies genealogy unless want count time traveling implied option becoming father mother
In DAG number node connection
You however add arbitrary limitation
For example connection go parent child child node could restricted maximum
That graph theory lingo saying person two parent
Hence I suggest take close look directed acyclic graph underlying graph theory general
Also note pay
If want software development know graph
They one general data structure apply almost everything
They always best choice course one powerful thing arsenal
These post old input anyway
First I think solution much simpler using graph
I would implement class let u call Node person name attribute may like keep person family
Then need another attribute add class Node array reference type Node
These child particular parent
At first set null instantiate number child based link particular parent
For example class may start like This way oldest known grandfather root Node
Node number child based real case reference object type etc You probably need write method traversing forest order able print search particular person etc
You may look data structure book java C learn implementing tree general
I hope useful one need implement forest using paradigm

Rookie Unlike Array Linked List linear data structure tree hierarchical data structure
One reason use tree might want store information naturally form hierarchy
For example file system computer file system If organize key form tree ordering BST search given key moderate time quicker Linked List slower array
like guarantee upper bound O Logn search
We key moderate time quicker Arrays slower Unordered Linked Lists
like guarantee upper bound O Logn
Like Linked Lists unlike Arrays Pointer implementation tree upper limit number node node linked using pointer

In two node DAG lowest
deepest node descendant define node descendant direct connection lowest common ancestor
The LCA shared ancestor located farthest root
Computation lowest common ancestor may useful instance part procedure determining distance pair node tree distance computed distance root plus distance root minus twice distance root lowest common ancestor
In lowest common ancestor also known
In node point parent lowest common ancestor easily determined finding first intersection path root
In general computational time required algorithm height tree length longest path leaf root
However exist several algorithm processing tree lowest common ancestor may found quickly
example preprocesses tree linear time provide LCA query
In general DAGs similar algorithm exist complexity
The lowest common ancestor problem defined Dov Harel first develop optimally efficient lowest common ancestor data structure
Their algorithm process tree linear time using subsequent lowest common ancestor query may answered constant time per query
However data structure complex difficult implement
Tarjan also found simpler le efficient algorithm based data structure
Baruch Schieber simplified data structure Harel Tarjan leading implementable structure asymptotic preprocessing query time bound
Their simplification based principle two special kind tree lowest common ancestor easy determine tree path lowest common ancestor computed simply minimum level two queried node tree node may indexed way lowest common ancestor reduce simple binary operation index
The structure Schieber Vishkin decomposes tree collection path connection path structure binary tree combine two simpler indexing technique
Omer Berkman Uzi Vishkin discovered completely new way answer lowest common ancestor query achieving linear preprocessing time constant query time
Their method involves forming graph formed input tree doubling every edge using tour write sequence level number node order tour visit lowest common ancestor query transformed query seek minimum value occurring within subinterval sequence number
They handle problem combining two technique one technique based precomputing answer large interval size power two based table lookup query
This method later presented simplified form Michael Bender
As previously observed range minimum problem turn transformed back lowest common ancestor problem using technique
Further simplification made
A variant problem dynamic LCA problem data structure prepared handle LCA query intermixed operation change tree rearrange tree adding removing edge This variant solved using O logN time modification query
This done maintaining forest using dynamic tree data structure partitioning size maintains decomposition tree allows LCA query carried logarithmic time size tree
Without preprocessing also improve naïve online algorithm computation time O log storing path tree using random access list still permitting tree extended constant time
This allows LCA query carried logarithmic time height tree
While originally studied context tree notion lowest common ancestor defined directed acyclic graph DAGs using either two possible definition
In edge DAG assumed point parent child
In tree lowest common ancestor unique DAG node pair node may much LCAs existence LCA pair node even guaranteed arbitrary connected DAGs
A algorithm finding lowest common ancestor given find ancestor return maximum element intersection two set
Better algorithm exist analogous LCA algorithm tree preprocess graph enable LCA query
The problem solved optimally sparse DAGs mean algorithm due
present unified framework Directed Acyclic Graphs DAGs compute least upper bound two vertex constant time
Their framework us adaptive asymptotic cost depend number cross edge DAG
Consequently possible achieve time sparse DAGs constant time LCA
A library work available public use
present method extends computation LCA disjunctive ancestor semantic similarity measure
He defines ancestor disjunctive difference number distinct path two node ancestor different using lower common ancestor
The problem computing lowest common ancestor class arises implementation system
The LCA problem also find application model found

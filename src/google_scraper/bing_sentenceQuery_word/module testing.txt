The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
A module separate unit software hardware
Typical characteristic modular component include allows used variety system allows function component system
The term first used architecture
In computer programming especially older language output language known distinguish set language statement sometimes known
In mainframe system IBM object module linked together object module form
The load module executable code ran computer
concept similar function contained within unit programming code separate function developed separate unit code code easily maintained reused different program
newer idea inherently encompasses modular programming
In computer hardware electronics module relatively compact unit larger device arrangement designed separately installed replaced serviced

I question entry mean module testing test many aspect tester
I puzzling solve problem method Equivalence Classing
Because I think initializing Ac Kh equivalence classing
Thanks entry hope answer question Yes module testing tester test many input possible
In case test possible input need use equivalence class limit number test case
But particular example tester test legal input
Now suppose PokerLib Hand class consists card
There combination combination
If working sort gambling machine company like Bally code absolutely must correct would need test combination
This would best done tester using module testing external test harness
But developer could still use unit testing eliminate many bug possible
Chris You quite correct definition crux issue
The IEEE long ago published specific definition unit testing module testing also element testing component testing almost never used practice
The folk adopted term Unit Testing refer development related activity automatically associate term Unit Testing
Ultimately terminology intended clarify simplify communication I never quibble formal definition IEE anyone else
Your idea using term interaction interesting sure improvement clarity computer program thought sort ineraction change machine state
Maybe chat PNSQC
From Chris BlainSent August PMTo James McCaffreySubject RE Your blog entry The Difference Between Unit Testing Module Testing View blog entry seems discussion always run exact definition unit module
Your post seems argue developer test unit tester test module
Maybe could expand definition clarifying goal unit testing module testing contrast would clearer Taking another tack I wonder replaced module interaction might closer useful idea
If take definition tester interested module testing give lot work
However interaction something I think time likely developer thinking especially write module really enjoy blog looking forward presentation Comments closed

Modular programming process subdividing computer program separate
A module separate software component
It often used variety application function component system
Similar function grouped unit programming code separate function developed separate unit code code reused application
programming OOP compatible modular programming concept large extent
Modular programming enables multiple programmer divide work debug piece program independently
Modules modular programming enforce logical boundary component improve maintainability
They incorporated interface
They designed way minimize dependency different module
Teams develop module separately require knowledge module system
Each every modular application version number associated
This provides developer flexibility module maintenance
If change applied module affected subroutine changed
This make program easier read understand
Modular programming main module many auxiliary module
The main module compiled executable EXE call auxiliary module function
Auxiliary module exist separate executable file load main EXE run
Each module unique name assigned PROGRAM statement
Function name across module unique easy access function used main module must exported
Languages support module concept IBM Assembler COBOL RPG FORTRAN Morpho Zonnon Erlang among others

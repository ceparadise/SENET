Hardware configuration reference detail system resource setting allotted specific device
Many computer specialist improve hardware performance adjusting configuration may also include setting motherboard BIOS well bus speed
With newer technology computer PnP allowing OS detect configure external internal peripheral well adaptor
PnP ability locate configure hardware component without needing reset jumper dual package DIP switch
Each device hardware configuration setting may include following All hardware device configuration setting affect performance system function
Hardware configuration information may include During POST basic system BIOS search system configuration determine device present interface CPU
After POST computer system configuration found CPU us information process instruction data
Configuration information stored several way using DIP switch jumper complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS
Today peripheral device use PnP DMA IRQ address
Older system PnP require new device set using jumper DIP switch

I looking official definition CSCI Configuration Item deliver expect contract defines subsystem shall developed configuration item
I spend time famous search tool found lot explanation CSCI wikipedia acronym directory I found standard pointer standard like yet tell done point view
I ask contractor QM representative stated acceptance test CI requires forget CI configuration plan assign serial number
I expected see SRS SDD ICD SVD SIP document acceptance test documentation subsystem As far I tell CSCI defined logic HWCI Hardware Configuration Item simply defined CSCI configuration item
More clear definition superseded CSCI An aggregation software satisfies end use function designated separate configuration management acquirer
CSCIs selected based tradeoff among software function size host target computer developer support concept plan reuse criticality interface consideration need separately documented controlled factor
I think would make sense map CSCI deliverable application
A CSCI require basically one set SRS SDD

Configuration refer either combination
For instance typical configuration PC consists floppy drive modem drive
Many software product require certain For example software might require display monitor particular minimum amount main memory
When install new sometimes need mean set various switch hardware define value software
For example device program may need know type video adapter type connected computer

Selected item system hardware software combination hardware software Government acquiring activity configuration management concern designated Configuration Items CIs
CIs basic unit configuration management
They may vary widely complexity size type aircraft ship tank electronic system software program test meter round ammunition
Regardless form size complexity configuration CI documented controlled
CI selection separate system component identifiable subset purpose managing development
For CI To define control performance system CI mean hardware software component must designated CIs mean performance requirement component must Government control
The requirement met component designated CI established controlled via Contractor design engineering release process
Government control occurs change lower level component impact performance specification CI
Initial CI selection reflect optimum management level early acquisition
Initially Engineering Manufacturing Development Phase II CIs usually deliverable separately installable unit system item requiring significant management attention interface Contractor Prime etc
During Production Operational Support Phase III individual item required logistics support designated separate procurement also CIs
As shown view designated CI may depend contracting tree view originates
Note Government acquires system using detail rather performance specification Government view may eventually include CIs shown figure
Computer software item typically control functionality system almost always designated CIs
The term CI encompasses hardware software statement handbook applies hardware software term HWCI CSCI used
Typically top tier CIs directly relate line item contract work breakdown structure
The determination need designate CIs normally simple straight forward
However many case item also selected based management need program
Some primary reason designating separate CIs Although initial CI selection generally occurs early acquisition process consequence lasting affect many aspect program management system engineering acquisition logistics configuration management
CI selection establishes level Government configuration control throughout system life cycle
Selecting CIs separate system individually identified component purpose managing development support
Government CI designation reflect optimum level acquisition support
During acquisition level contracting activity specifies contract accepts individual component system logistics activity organize assign responsibility report modification maintenance action support
During concept exploration program definition risk reduction phase system architecture established program work breakdown structure developed major CIs selected
These activity provide basis Supportability Plan program turn dictate selection CIs
Development acquisition retrofit hardware software interface affected breakout key system element CIs early stage development effort
Many engineering requirement consideration influence selection CIs
Throughout development support allocation engineering effort organization rooted selection CIs
Developing contractor participate selection process provide recommendation based upon engineering technical consideration
Selection CIs iterative process occurring period PD RR phase production
Either Government contractor may make initial recommendation CI candidate result system engineering analysis however contractor normally tasked provide comprehensive recommendation
CI selection criterion applied contractor recommendation decide item managed CIs Government
Decisions designate specific candidate CIs decision time come Government control normally involve integrated team acquisition program management system engineering acquisition logistics working configuration management

In mechanism enforcing limit access resource environment many
A lock designed enforce policy
Generally lock thread cooperates acquiring lock accessing corresponding data
Some system also implement attempting unauthorized access locked resource force entity attempting make access
The simplest type lock binary
It provides exclusive access locked data
Other scheme also provide shared access reading data
Other widely implemented access mode exclusive
Another way classify lock happens prevents progress thread
Most locking design requesting lock allowed access locked resource
With thread simply wait spin lock becomes available
This efficient thread blocked short time avoids overhead operating system process
It inefficient lock held long time progress thread holding lock depends preemption locked thread
Locks typically require hardware support efficient implementation
This support usually take form one instruction
These instruction allow single process test lock free free acquire lock single atomic operation
architecture option using special instruction instruction prefix disable interrupt technique work machine
Proper support lock multiprocessor environment require quite complex hardware software support substantial issue
The reason required concurrency one task executes logic
For example consider following code The example guarantee task lock since one task testing lock time
Since task detect lock free task attempt set lock knowing task also setting lock
possible substitute atomic locking operation available
Careless use lock result
A number strategy used avoid recover deadlock livelocks
The common strategy standardize lock acquisition sequence combination lock always acquired specifically defined cascade order
Some language support lock syntactically
An example follows The code lead problem instance accessed publicly
Similar C also synchronize entire method using attribute
Before introduced lock granularity one need understand three concept lock There tradeoff decreasing lock overhead decreasing lock contention choosing number lock synchronization
An important property lock
The granularity measure amount data lock protecting
In general choosing coarse granularity small number lock protecting large segment data result le single process accessing protected data worse performance multiple process running concurrently
This increased
The coarse lock higher likelihood lock stop unrelated process proceeding
Conversely using fine granularity larger number lock protecting fairly small amount data increase overhead lock reduces lock contention
Granular locking process must hold multiple lock common set lock create subtle lock dependency
This subtlety increase chance programmer unknowingly introduce
In example lock could protect order increasing granularity part field field record data page entire table
Coarse granularity using table lock tends give best performance single user whereas fine granularity record lock tends give best performance multiple user
used mean ensuring transaction synchronicity

making transaction processing concurrent interleaving transaction using ensures concurrent execution transaction turn equivalent serial ordering transaction
However deadlock become unfortunate locking database
Deadlocks either prevented locking order transaction detected using
An alternate locking database synchronicity avoiding deadlock involves use totally ordered global timestamps
There mechanism employed manage action multiple purpose prevent lost update dirty read
The two type locking resource protection synchronization many disadvantage Some strategy avoid problem
For example avoid biggest problem deadlock
Alternatives locking include method like programming technique
However alternative method often require actual lock mechanism implemented fundamental level operating software
Therefore may relieve level detail implementing lock problem listed still needing dealt beneath application
In case proper locking depends CPU providing method atomic instruction stream synchronization example addition deletion item pipeline requires contemporaneous operation needing add delete item pipe suspended manipulation memory content required add delete specific item
Therefore application often robust recognizes burden place upon operating system capable graciously recognizing reporting impossible demand
One programming biggest problem lock hard combine small correct module equally correct larger program without modifying module least knowing internals
advocate give following example banking application design class allows multiple concurrent client deposit withdraw money account give algorithm transfer money one account another
The solution first part problem The second part problem much complicated
A routine correct would In concurrent program algorithm incorrect one thread halfway another might observe state withdrawn first account yet deposited account money gone missing system
This problem fixed completely taking lock account prior changing two account lock taken according arbitrary global ordering prevent deadlock This solution get complicated lock involved function need know lock
Programming language vary support synchronization

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

The abbreviated type usually awarded three four year collegiate study possibly awarded fewer year depending factor institution course requirement academic calendar
In case awarded five year
In general computer science degree program emphasize mathematical theoretical foundation computing
The core curriculum may depending school result degree including In many institution degree introduced upgrade regular bachelor program usually requires least one additional year study
Because computer science wide field course required earn bachelor computer science degree vary
A typical list course requirement includes topic Some school may place emphasis require additional course Beyond basic set computer science course student typically choose additional course variety different field Some school allow student specialize certain area computer science

Often cost computed year expressed percentage cost item
For example company might express holding cost
If company inventory cost cost carrying holding inventory estimated per year
Neglecting account step lead excess wasted lost damaged inventory turn loss business
A happens stock sold market price fallen purchased
The item worthless valued original purchased price
The difference purchase price current lower price amount
Any inventory must reflected expense income statement
An example poor inventory analysis management recent rebranding flop

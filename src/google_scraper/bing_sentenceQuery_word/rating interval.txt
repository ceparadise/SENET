Natalie teacher hold MA English Education progress PhD psychology
Imagine psychologist want study see whether eating breakfast help kid focus
You think student eat healthy breakfast best math quiz student eat unhealthy breakfast perform middle student eat anything breakfast worst math quiz
So study
Where even begin
In research one first thing identify factor change
For example whether person eats breakfast variable varies person person perhaps day day
A person eat healthy breakfast eat unhealthy breakfast eat breakfast
If eating breakfast vary every single person would eat exact thing breakfast every single morning
Likewise performance math test variable varies person person
Susie might great math quiz Jonas fails
Or Susie might well today well tomorrow
Whatever reason score math quiz change therefore variable
So know variable eating breakfast math performance
But measure
There four major scale type measurement variable nominal ordinal interval ratio
The scale measurement depends variable
Let look closer four scale type variable fall category
You might noticed difference two variable
While score math test reported number eating breakfast numeric
A person eats healthy breakfast unhealthy breakfast breakfast
These number category
A measurement deal variable number value
In word put order would matter
Think number jersey football player
Is player wearing number better player player wearing number
Maybe anything number wear
Jersey number value far telling u anything ability player way identify
Other example variable measured nominal scale include gender race number pool ball
Sometimes statistical analysis researcher give variable numeric value
For example might say student eat healthy breakfast student eat unhealthy breakfast student eat breakfast
These number way mark group really value
Let say instead looking grade specific math quiz want look letter grade overall course student
So Susie A Jonas D student Bs Cs Fs
In case letter completely meaningless
Unlike football player jersey example know Susie better Jonas
But much better
An measurement look variable order matter difference matter
When think think word
In case letter grade really know much better A We know A better B better C
But A four time better D
Is two time better
In case order important difference
Have ever filled one customer service survey company send
They might ask question like experience today
ask rate scale
Those ordinal
Other example variable measured ordinal scale include difficulty hard medium easy order finishing race first place second place
Okay want measure something difference number matter
For example decide temperature person breakfast matter
We believe kid eats hottest breakfast best math test kid eats coldest breakfast worst
Get FREE access day create account
When order difference level variable matter ratio measured
Intervals distance two thing remember looking distance level variable
Temperature good example variable measured interval scale
If one kid eats breakfast another eats one difference two breakfast
That tell u something far apart
Likewise last month today know many degree warmer
But note would say half warm today last month
That make sense
That difference meaningful ratio
But ratio meaningful well difference
Let go back original idea
We want look nominal variable eating breakfast also want look score student math quiz
If Susie get test Jonas get know Susie twice well Jonas
The score percentage
That number tell u much one thing comparison another thing
Variables measured number order difference ratio meaningful
Think like say twice much one number relation another one measured ratio scale
Things like number minute commute weight height ratio
Susie spend twice long commuting half weight twice height Jonas
In psychological measurement research design four major scale measurement used talk variable
A includes variable order unit matter
consist variable order matter difference unit matter
An look variable order difference meaningful ratio unit meaningful
Finally made variable order difference ratio matter
You able describe four major measurement scale used identify variable provide example watching video lesson

FREE In Google Play FREE Win Phone Store Most chess rating calculation originate idea Hungarian Arpad Elo pictured
A physic professor Elo devised basis calculating rating based simple statistical concept
His fundamental idea player chess skill conforms called normal distribution
A normal distribution shaped roughly like outline bell shown
Figure Bell Curve This assumption given player skill normally distributed mean given day player may perform either better worse given enough game player level play distributed normally
As turn player skill general also roughly distributed fashion bell curve
In idealized distribution middle value x axis zero plot player rating x axis low score left high score right height curve corresponding number player rating
There overall average skill level perfect normal distribution corresponds highest middle bell
There people whose skill cluster around average fewer people lower skill level course much collective envy another small group people high level
You see current rating curve indeed notice resemble bell
When play game earn point win lose point opponent win
If draw higher rated player earn smaller number point
Elo idea derive computation based assumption normal distribution player strength using rating representation strength
Suppose play number game tournament
You would expected defeat player smaller rating
Awarding win loss draw play game weaker player stronger player opponent strength would expected accumulate point
However suppose actually game lost still drew two game
Your actual point would
The basic computation adjust rating Elo system equation form New Rating Old Rating k actual point expected point k constant number

In example old rating new rating would computed follows actual point expected point
The US Chess Federation USCF adopted essentially formula FIDE adopted
However system used either organization today exactly system used
In bright young Statistics major Princeton University begun study chess rating wrote senior thesis topic
After speaking USCF President work invited join USCF rating committee later becoming chairman post hold day
Mark Glickman pictured young student name today referred Professor Glickman student Boston University
Glickman wrote Harvard doctoral dissertation viewed deficiency Elo rating system devised replacement dubbed Glicko system I regard humorous tribute predecessor Professor Elo
I love clever people
It Glicko system us calculate rating
One Glickman innovation recognize rating estimation true strength uncertainty regarding rating
This uncertainty represented dubbed Rating Deviation
This merely chess talk statistician call Standard Deviation number represents uncertainty
The larger number uncertainty surrounding rating
In normal distribution average value along x axis rating deviation give interval within confidence true strength lie
If know care statistic regard religious axiom accept faith
If refer Figure see confidence interval standard deviation
Another innovation Glickman observation player rating actually le reliable measure true strength player played game period time
Suppose rating current average member
That rating computed game others
It true strength never truly known except perhaps Deity even Kasparov probably know
Your rating estimate true strength
And played rated game past month
Do trust rating much rating another player played game past day
Glickman think built time factor equation allows decay Rating Deviation passage time
That period time passed Rating Deviation take larger value representing fact le certain rating accuracy playing regularly
Yet third innovation Glicko system equation recompute rating depend upon rating rating deviation also depend upon opponent rating deviation
For reason gain point opponent may lose either fewer point depending upon respective rating rating deviation
I reprint Glick equation much complex Elo equation mathematically curious overview includes equation found
For true math geek read Glickman full technical article published journal Improvements Glicko found
Finally I point Glicko system used
If already know Erik
I tried supplement rather duplicate Erik description
I hope enjoyed brief overview rating determined next time peek see many point stand gain lose begin new game appreciate work went providing answer
As strive become better player person remember choose move carefully chess life
Postscript I would like thank Mark Glickman correcting inaccuracy regarding Elo assumption normal distribution original post

What scale actually mean depends number represent
Numbers grouped type level nominal ordinal interval ratio
Nominal simple ratio sophisticated
Each level posse characteristic preceding level plus additional quality
Nominal Nominal hardly measurement
It refers quality quantity
A nominal level measurement simply matter distinguishing name male female
Even though using number denote quantity
The binary category used computer nominal level measurement
They category classification
Nominal measurement like using categorical level variable described section Introduction module
Ordinal Ordinal refers order measurement
An ordinal scale indicates direction addition providing nominal information
example ordinal level measurement
Ranking experience nine scale tell u higher experience ranked six
Many psychological scale inventory ordinal level measurement
Interval Interval scale provide information order also posse equal interval
From previous example knew distance rating scale would interval scale
An example interval scale temperature either measured Fahrenheit Celsius scale
A degree represents underlying amount heat regardless occurs scale
Measured Fahrenheit unit difference temperature difference
scale measurement devised opinion attitude
Constructing involves understanding mathematical statistical principle beyond covered course
But important understand different level measurement using interpreting scale
Ratio In addition possessing quality nominal ordinal interval scale ratio scale absolute zero point none quality measured exists
Using ratio scale permit comparison twice high much
Reaction time long take respond signal sort us ratio scale measurement time
Although individual reaction time always greater zero conceptualize zero point time state response millisecond twice fast response time millisecond
Applications The level measurement particular variable defined highest category achieves
For example categorizing someone extroverted outgoing introverted shy nominal
If categorize people shy neither shy outgoing outgoing ordinal level measurement
If use standardized measure shyness inventory would probably assume shyness variable meet standard interval level measurement
As whether might ratio scale shyness although might able measure zero shyness would difficult devise scale would comfortable talking someone time shy someone else

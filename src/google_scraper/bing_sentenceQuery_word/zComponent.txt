I familiar concept vector magnitude direction I also keep coming across reference vector context programming example seems stl library come fairly frequently SO
My intuition context fairly primitive construct often used represent something along line variable length array storing size magnitude I presume would really helpful somebody could provide complete explanation preferably including used practice
From Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Furthermore vector typically hold object make class hold information vehicle store fleet vector
Nice thing vector aside resizing still allow access constant time individual element via index like array
The tradeoff resizing hit current capacity reallocate sometimes copy memory
However capacity increasing algorithm double capacity time hit barrier never hit heap available turn perhaps dozen time worst case throughout program operation
In mathematics vector thought combination direction magnitude
However also thought coordinate
For example vector magnitude angle degree horizontal represents point plane
This point also represented Cartesian coordinate pair
This pair also mathematical vector
In programming name vector originally used describe sequence scalar number
A vector length represents point plane vector length represents point space
A vector length represents point space mathematician trouble thinking thing
In modern programming library name vector come generally mean sized sequence value necessarily number
Changing size length dimensionality mathematical vector something would normally unless kind projection operation
But changing length programming vector contains sequence string might common operation
The mathematical vector used data structure computer science necessarily obey tensor transformation rule
They array expand contract noted earlier
Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Vectors good Since least two answer pasted might also want read rest description I understand confusion name I used confused
It helped idea Vector graphic programming closer mathematical definition
In math Vector thought matrix arbitrary length length number dimension coordinate system
In OO language vector essentially matrix array hence name
They anything coordinate unless programmer decides use task rare I never seen
They also usually mathematical operator matrix multiplication similar operation
So nature similarity end
I leave answer explain feature us OO container already handle
From To model computer memory use new kind data structure called vector
Abstractly vector compound data object whose individual element accessed mean integer index amount time independent index
Vectors programming basically dynamic array storage handled automatically allowing expanded contracted best thing also allow access constant time individual element via index like regular array
lot information need understand surround question
It contrast vector array
Also Stroustrup chapter Most computing involves creating collection
A class main purpose holding object called
The useful container
A sequence element given type
The element stored contiguously memory
So STL vector collection value way like mathematical meaning
Besides data structure vector also term pointer code

interrupt vector point interrupt code invoked
To help remember CS meaning word may helpful refer Latin root vehere mean convey carry
Thus vector carry contains thing generally speaking

In providing generic functionality selectively changed additional code thus providing software
A software framework provides standard way build deploy application
A software framework universal reusable provides particular functionality part larger facilitate development product solution
Software framework may include support program compiler code library tool set bring together different enable development
Frameworks key distinguishing feature separate normal The designer software framework aim facilitate software development allowing designer programmer devote time meeting software requirement rather dealing standard detail providing working system thereby reducing overall development time
For example team using develop banking website focus writing code particular banking rather mechanic request handling
Frameworks often add size program phenomenon termed
Due driven application need competing complementary framework sometimes end product
Further due complexity APIs intended reduction overall development time may achieved due need spend additional time learning use framework criticism clearly valid special new framework first encountered development staff
If framework used subsequent job taskings time invested learning framework cost code familiar project staff many programmer keep copy useful boilerplate common need
However framework learned future project faster easier complete concept framework make solution set familiarity code production logically rise
There claim made size code eventually bundled output product relative efficiency conciseness
Using library solution necessarily pull extra unused extraneous asset unless software linker making tight small wholly controlled specified executable module
The issue continues industry experience shown effective framework turn evolve common code enterprise instead using generic framework developed third party general purpose
An example would user interface application package office suite grows common look feel attribute method disparate bundled application grow unified suite tighter smaller suite product share integral utility library user interface
This trend controversy brings important issue framework
Creating framework elegant versus one merely solves problem still art rather science
Software implies clarity conciseness little waste extra extraneous functionality much user defined
For framework generate code example elegance would imply creation code clean comprehensible reasonably knowledgeable programmer therefore readily modifiable versus one merely generates correct code
The elegance issue relatively software framework stood test time best framework able evolve gracefully underlying technology built advanced
Even evolved many package retain legacy capability bloating final software otherwise replaced method retained parallel newer method
Software framework typically contain considerable housekeeping utility code order help bootstrap user application generally focus specific problem domain According Pree software framework consist
define overall architecture software system say basic component relationship
These remain unchanged frozen instantiation application framework
represent part programmer using framework add code add functionality specific project
In environment framework consists
framework consists existing class
When developing concrete software system software framework developer utilize hot spot according specific need requirement system
Software framework rely Do call u call
This mean class example new subclass receive message predefined framework class
Developers usually handle implementing

While studying Assemblers I came across idea I got like Relocatable machine code code dependent static RAM location
The assembler specifies RAM need program
The memory placed wherever linker find room
Is idea correct
If done assembler
And example Absolute Machine Code
instruction set pc relative addressing meaning take address program counter related address instruction executing add offset use accessing memory branching something like
would calling relocatable
Because matter instruction address space thing want jump relative
Move whole block code data address still relatively distance apart relative addressing still work
If equal skip next instruction work wherever three instruction skip one skipped one skip
Absolute us absolute address jump exact address read exact address
If equal branch
The assembler doesnt compiler programmer
Generally eventually compiled code end absolute addressing particular code consists separate object linked together
At compile time compiler cant know object end possible know external reference far away cant generally assume close enough pc relative addressing generally range limit
So compiler often generate placeholder linker fill absolute address
It depend operation instruction set factor external address problem solved
Eventually though based project size linker end absolute addressing
So usually command line option generate position independent code example might something compiler support
compiler linker extra work make item position independent
An assembly language programmer assembler generally doesnt get involved creates machine code instruction tell generate
memap linker script MEMORY ram ORIGIN LENGTH SECTIONS ram Makefile part care What I showing mixture position independent instruction position dependent instruction
two instruction example shortcut force assembler add style memory location linker fill u
location
filled address absolute address code work function notmain must address relocatable
portion example also demonstrates position independent code well pc relative addressing I talking way instruction set work time execution pc two instruction ahead basically case instruction memory pc executing add instruction state get
But moved exact machine code instruction address move surrounding binary including thing reading
basically And instruction machine code still work doesnt
code sitll hast fixed address bit ldr pc blx dont
Although disassembler show based address bl bne also pc relative find looking instruction set documentation would pc executed instruction
And negative two complement see bulk machine code sign extended added program counter basically say branch backward instrucitons
Same go ffffa mean equal branch backward instruction
Remember instruction set arm assumes pc two instruction ahead back mean forward two back effectively back
If remove Then entire program end position independent accident I happened known would happen I told tool simply I made everything close didnt use absolute addressing
lastly say wherever linker find room notice linker script I tell linker put everything starting I didnt specify file name function told otherwise linker place item order specified command line
code second linker placed code wherever linker room right code start
And easy way see position independent isnt without research instruction would change linker script put code address
see machine code change doesnt
Anything actually contains address inside code absolute address
Programs contain address within code everything done relative address run address
The assembler programmer
I done bit past small stuff usually easy go beyond range relative jump becomes quite pain
IIRC two approach slip relative jump routine add known offset current address push return
In old day third approach calculating writing code longer acceptable
It long enough I wo swear approach
IIRC way call something without absolute address push address want return calculate address push return
Note practice usually use hybrid approach
The assembler linker store information needed make adjustment program loaded memory modified run whatever address loaded
The actual image memory thus absolute file disk work like relative without headache normally introduces
Note approach used higher level language actually produce native code
Basically absolute mode mean code RAM variable placed exactly tell assembler relocatable mean assembler build code chunk specifies RAM need placed wherever linker find room
I sure accepted answer necessarily correct
There fundamental difference Relocatable Code considered Code
Now I coding assembly long time many different architecture I always thought machine code coming three specific flavour Let firstly discus code
This code assembled instruction relative one
So branch instance specify offset current Instruction Pointer Program Counter whichever want call
Code position independent consist one segment code data also contained within segment section
There exception data embedded within segment benefit usually passed onto operating system loader
It useful type code mean operating system need perform operation order able start executing
It run anywhere loaded memory
Of course type code problem namely thing like able segregate code data might suitable differing memory type limitation size relative start moving range etc
name
quite like code many way subtle difference
As name suggests type code relocatable code loaded anywhere memory usually relocated fixed executable
In fact architecture use type code embed thing like reloc section purpose fixing relocatable part code
The downside type code relocated fixed almost becomes absolute nature fixed address
What give relocatable code major advantage reason prevalent code around allows code easily broken section
Each section loaded anywhere memory fit requirement relocation code reference another section relocation table thus section tied together nicely
The code usually relative architecture need anything might range assembled relocatable instruction consists offset added load address
It also mean limitation imposed issue
The final type code
This code assembled work one specific address work loaded specific address
Branch jump instruction contain fixed exact absolute address
It type code usually found embedded system whereby guaranteed piece code loaded specific address thing loaded
On modern computer absolute code would work code need loaded wherever free memory never guarantee certain memory range available
Absolute code advantage though mainly generally fastest executing platform dependent
relocatable mean assembler build code chunk specifies RAM need placed wherever linker find room

process assigning load address locatable code program adjusting code data program reflect assigned address
A usually performs relocation conjunction process searching file library replace symbolic reference name actual usable address running program
Relocation typically done linker also done relocating running program
Some architecture avoid relocation entirely deferring run time known
segmented various type
Example segment include others
The relocation table list created translator stored object executable file
Each entry table fixup absolute address object code must changed loader relocates program refer correct location
Fixups designed support relocation program complete unit
In case fixup table relative base address zero fixups must changed loader move table
In architecture fixup cross certain boundary segment boundary aligned word boundary illegal flagged error linker
Far pointer offset used address space available point code data within absolute segment actual depends program loaded memory known program loaded
Instead segment relative value DOS EXE file
These segment need corrected executable loaded memory
The EXE us relocation table find segment need adjusted
With Windows operating system mandatory provide relocation table EXE file since first image loaded virtual address space thus loaded preferred base address
For DLLs EXEs opt exploit mitigation technique introduced Windows Vista relocation table become mandatory possibility binary may dynamically moved executed even though still first thing loaded virtual address space
When running native binary Windows Vista ASLR Address Space Layout Randomization mandatory thus relocation section omitted compiler
The executable format shared library format used system allows several type relocation defined
The linker read segment information relocation table object file performs relocation The following example us architecture MIXAL assembly language
The principle architecture though detail change

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I come back PIC programming year I relearning everything
I looking section MPASM manual discus relocatable code
And I come conclusion I puzzled absolute code used
Take case For intent purpose absolute code
So I see change udata line remove
Then linker place want
But override linker script specify exact position I mentioning stackexchange rarely mentioned reason one would ever use absolute code relocatable humble opinion
While typing Stackexchange suggested superb response one place I seen linker mentioned
I question though Can I use dot lead section name
Like
I seen used I sure validity
In mind way keeping label Initial cap variable name lower section name start dot seperate namespaces
I puzzled idata directive
If data initialised
Is code block I call set initial data
I love use instead setting initial data init section
I want use large block data buffer
I using I use FSR flat memory mode point cleanly across bank
My issue I tell assembler linker I using say bank purpose
If I use keyword protected linker I use udata assembler
Or I pick memory put FSR start writing
And Why earth book tutorial Gooligum excepted insist using absolute lecturer keep using
It seems totally bizarre promote absolute relocatable long past due date
I realise opinion might within Stackexchange guideline either terribly important know relocatable code exists
There two main reason still see absolute mode MPASM code Originally lot religious people strongly held belief
They think absolute mode easier somehow using linker hard learn
Basically know want bother learning different way even far better way make excuse
Yes using relocatable mode obvious
It I ever used well PIC project
I advantage starting PICs right linker introduced
I never investment absolute code protect
In case ancient history simply good reason today
Note absolute mode even option newer toochains like dsPIC
Some substantial advantage using relocatable code The common hack using CBLOCK absolute mode define variable creates symbol sequential value know represent address variable
Since system know memory location used variable ca detect tell collision overflow
In absolute mode code end end detection warning different part different page therefore require PCLATH manipulation jump call
Worse yet change every build code modified
It might fine one build get subtle bug page boundary happens end start end loop
There advantage compelling make absolute code blatantly stupid choice
There really excuse
While overall advantage overwhelming issue need considered relocatable mode apposed absolute mode
The main one using bare UDATA know bank variable build time
This prevents optimization
I get around specifying bank local variable module usually single bank limited global state
Local variable within module forced particular bank something like UDATA section defined linker file forced bank
That still let linker allocate variable within bank get error put much stuff one bank
This scheme mean end bank allocation per module still lot better bank allocation without overflow detection get absolute mode
Since code bank variable known build time I optimize bank setting
I macro set bank track current bank setting
On classic PIC DBANKIF set direct bank needed macro emits instruction bank bit STATUS
A second redundant DBANKIF never emits code
I therefore use DBANKIF front variable reference minimum necessary bank setting instruction actually included code
This result nicely optimized code single assembly constant change I want local variable different bank
The bank switching code automatically adjusted accordingly
Since DBANKIF related macro track bank state source code order pay attention
For example system ca know code another place different live bank setting may jump code
For reason I macro either tell logic bank setting actually tell explicitly know
For example code label UNBANK following
That tell bank tracking system invalidate assumption
The next DBANKIF explicitly set bank bit system start tracking
The way I deal page use convention upper two bit PCLATH always set page currently executing code page defined separate memory region linker file
That guarantee one code section wo straddle bank boundary
Usually module contains single named code section effectively code within module use local GOTO CALL without PCLATH manipulation
The flip side assume code section another page PIC one page
This mean CALL remote subroutine set PCLATH target page restore return
I GCALL global call GJUMP global jump macro single line source code
I like follow longer comment question I I want use large block data buffer
I using I use FSR flat memory mode point cleanly across bank I want post answer interest show incredibly easy processor use larger buffer tandem relocatable
If look LKR processor interest case see part Note part section
Then code And
It really straightforward
The linker know exactly put even think
Use fsrs write point buffer use movwi moviw write buffer
Relocatable linker make easy

In collection used often
These may include configuration data documentation help data message template specification
In referred
A also collection implementation behavior written term language interface behavior invoked
For instance people want write higher level program use library make instead implementing system call
In addition behavior provided reuse multiple independent program
A program invokes behavior via mechanism language
For example simple C behavior library invoked using C normal
What distinguishes call library function versus another function program way code organized system
Library code organized way used multiple program connection code part program organized used within one program
This distinction gain hierarchical notion program grows large program
In case may internal library reused independent large program
The distinguishing feature library organized purpose reused independent program user need know interface internal detail library
The value library lie reuse behavior
When program invokes library gain behavior implemented inside library without implement behavior
Libraries encourage sharing code fashion ease distribution code
The behavior implemented library connected invoking program different
If code library accessed build invoking program library called
An alternative build executable invoking program distribute independently library implementation
The library behavior connected executable invoked executed either part process starting execution middle execution
In case library called loaded
A dynamic library loaded linked preparing program execution
Alternatively middle execution application may explicitly request module
Most although programmer also create custom library
Most modern provide library implement majority system service
Such library service modern application requires
As code used modern application provided system library
The earliest programming concept analogous library intended separate definition program
brought COMPOOL Communication Pool concept popular attention although adopted idea software
Following computer science principle Comm Pool purpose permit sharing System Data among many program providing centralized data description
also included primitive capability library system described inadequate library facility retrospect
Another major contributor modern library concept came form innovation
FORTRAN subprogram compiled independently compiler lacked
So prior introduction module FORTRAN subprogram impossible
Finally historian concept remember influential
Simula first language nearly identical modern concept used
The concept Simula also progenitor
Even developed originally Simula class could included library file added compile time
Libraries important program process resolve reference known library module
The linking process usually automatically done program search set library module given order
Usually considered error link target found multiple time given set library
Linking may done executable file created whenever program used
The reference resolved may address jump routine call
They may main program one module depending upon another
They resolved fixed relocatable address common base allocating runtime memory module referenced
Some programming language may use feature called whereby linker aware integrated compiler linker know external reference used code library never actually even though internally referenced discarded compiled application
For example program us integer arithmetic arithmetic operation exclude library routine
This feature lead smaller application file size reduced memory usage
Some reference program library module stored relative symbolic form resolved code library assigned final static address
process adjusting reference done either linker
In general relocation done individual library address memory may vary depending program using library combined
avoids reference absolute address therefore require relocation
When linking performed creation executable another object file known
In case linking usually done may also done
A also known one intended statically linked
Originally static library existed
Static linking must performed module recompiled
All module required program sometimes statically linked copied executable file
This process resulting file known program
A static build may need used desired
A file intended shared shared object file
Modules used program loaded individual shared object memory rather copied linker creates single monolithic executable file program
Shared library statically linked meaning reference library module resolved module allocated memory executable file created
But often linking shared library postponed loaded
Most modern shared library file format executable file
This offer two main advantage first requires making one loader rather two single loader considered well worth added complexity
Secondly allows executables also used shared library
Typical combined executable shared library format Unix Windows
In older environment stack based data local allowed shared library code significant restriction placed shared library code
Library code may shared memory multiple well disk
If virtual memory used process would execute physical page RAM mapped different address space process
This advantage
For instance system application often hundred kilobyte size loaded quickly majority code located library already loaded purpose operating system
Programs accomplish RAM sharing using lead complex flexible architecture using common virtual address Windows
These system make sure various trick like address space reserving slot shared library code great probability shared
A third alternative used successor
This allows code place significant restriction code placed shared
In case different version shared library cause problem especially library different version file name different application installed system require specific version
Such scenario known named Windows
Most modern operating system method eliminate situation use application specific private library
Dynamic linking linking performed program loaded executed rather executable file created
A dynamically linked library DLL dynamic shared object DSO system library intended dynamic linking
Only minimum amount work done executable file created record library routine program need index name number routine library
The majority work linking done time application loaded load time execution run time
Usually necessary linking program called dynamic linker linking loader actually part underlying
However possible exceedingly difficult write program us dynamic linking includes dynamic linker even operating system provides support dynamic linking
Programmers originally developed dynamic linking operating system starting MTS built late
Since shared library system change often system compute likely load address shared library system needed store information library executables
If every shared library loaded undergone process load predetermined address speed process dynamic linking
This optimization known macOS Linux
Disadvantages technique include time required precompute address every time shared library change inability use requirement sufficient virtual address space use problem alleviated adoption architecture least time
Loaders shared library vary widely functionality
Some depend executable storing explicit path library
Any change library naming layout file system cause system fail
More commonly name library path stored executable operating system supplying method find library based algorithm
If shared library executable depends deleted moved renamed incompatible version library copied place earlier search executable would fail load
This called existing many platform
The infamous Windows variant commonly known
This problem occur version library uniquely identified program reference library full unique identifier
The DLL hell problem earlier Windows version arose using name library guaranteed unique resolve dynamic link program
To avoid DLL hell later version Windows rely largely option program install private partial retreat use shared mechanism prevent replacement shared system DLLs earlier version
check determine proper place load DLLs implement DLLs check directory defined order
First Windows check directory loaded program directory set calling function System Windows directory current working directory finally directory specified PATH
Applications written framework since also check primary store shared dll file remove issue
used flexible system collecting list library number known location similar PATH concept system first start
Moving library around cause problem although user incur time cost first starting system
Most system search path specifying file system look dynamic library
Some system specify default path others dynamic loader
Some format specify additional directory search library particular program
This usually overridden although disabled setgid program user ca force program run arbitrary code root permission
Developers library encouraged place dynamic library place default search path
On downside make installation new library problematic known location quickly become home increasing number library file making management complex
Dynamic loading subset dynamic linking involves dynamically linked library loading unloading request
Such request may made implicitly explicitly run time
Implicit request made compile time linker add library reference include file path simply file name
Explicit request made application make direct call operating system API run time
Most operating system support dynamically linked library also support dynamically loading library via linker
For instance us API function based system including UNIX system use
Some development system automate process
Although originally pioneered dynamic linking reach used consumer late
It generally available form operating system early
During period OOP becoming significant part programming landscape
OOP runtime binding requires additional information traditional library supply
In addition name entry point code located within also require list object depend
This one OOP main advantage inheritance mean part complete definition method may different place
This simply listing one library requires service another true OOP system library may known vary system system
At time many developer worked idea program display running desktop computer would use service data storage processing
For instance program computer would send message minicomputer return small sample huge dataset display
RPC already handled task standard RPC system
Soon majority minicomputer mainframe vendor instigated project combine two producing OOP library format could used anywhere
Such system known supported remote access
Microsoft COM example system local use DCOM modified version support remote access
For time object library held status next big thing programming world
There number effort create system would run across platform company competed try get developer locked system
Examples include DOE PDO Microsoft number system
After inevitable cooling marketing hype object library continue used programming distributed information system
rough OOP equivalent older type code library
They contain describe characteristic define action involve object
Class library used create object characteristic set specific value
In OOP language like distinction clear class often contained library file like Java instantiated object residing memory although potentially able made separate file
In others like class library merely starting point includes entire state environment class instantiated object
Another solution library issue come using completely separate executables often lightweight form calling using RPC network another computer
This approach maximizes operating system code needed support library code used provide application support security every program
Additionally system require library exist machine forward request network
However approach mean every library call requires considerable amount overhead
RPC call much expensive calling shared library already loaded machine
This approach commonly used make heavy use remote call notably system
Code generation library generate transform
They used data access framework testing generate dynamic proxy object
They also used intercept field access
The system store file directory
The filename always start end suffix static library shared object dynamically linked library
Some system might multiple name dynamically linked library name name remaining name name might include major version library full version number example system would filename second major interface revision dynamically linked library
The file sometimes found library directory archive usable system
The system inherits static library convention library stored file use dynamically linked library suffix instead
Most library macOS however consist framework placed inside special directory called wrap library required file metadata
For example framework called would implemented bundle called either dynamically linked library file symlink dynamically linked library file
usually suffix although file name extension may identify dynamically linked library
library
The interface revision either encoded file name abstracted away using interface
Depending compiled file either static library representation dynamically linkable library needed compilation known
Unlike world us different file extension linking file one must first know regular static library import library
In latter case file must present run time

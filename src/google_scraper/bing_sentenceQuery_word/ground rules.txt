Some absorb thing well reading
They mostly look written tutorial ignore video except place I mention video include major thing missing text video demonstrating something naturally visual
Other student really like hear see time traditional presence professor introducing material
For class professor traditional presentation provided lot video
You replay bit video many time need stop video think I pose question likely give answer shortly video
I repeat In case Python need download unzip
If would like alternate explanation many Python resource listed briefly described many home site Python Further material centered Python course note main part video Google Box URLs
Other reference linked directly course schedule
Look schedule happening next due next
university ID email aharrin Email preferably communication Piazza see always appreciated online software set separate synchronous time work individually
Initially I plan online classroom open regular class also I get email AM morning saying want meet office hour period
If good time complete discussion hopefully connect long enough agree time
Note day class day completely Wednesday rather Tuesday
These initial time may well get modified
Private information professor individual student handled University system
It mostly used grade homework submission grader comment
The public course material posted directly web
For programming using Python python installation operating system keep changing
Be sure read
These supersede system instruction tutorial
special hardware likely need online exam used class
See We using Adobe Connect software regular synchronous meeting
You might also use software separate collaboration pair
Promptly see first meet
Also look communication time get together test software minimize time spent futzing environment want together getting coursework
Go select Student put Loyola email address asked
Later signing return site URL
Piazza online learning community sort social medium course
I using number semester
You encouraged pose conceptual technical question publicly offer answer others
Pose question specific work exercise privately
Your first entry signing response request introduce class
I started first response
Add text box
The student fill promptly even first class easier arrange partner programming assignment
We also use Piazza private Journal entry individual student discussed
Entries Piazza come several form general comment question answer discussion issue problem edits previous entry wiki
Entries directed privately instructor
It mean shared editable space If think improve something posted publicly anyone
Be careful question comment would help homework problem If post everyone see entry need general conceptual enough give away solution detail
Do look early homework think post question get early help
Here suggestion using individual type Piazza contribution Here idea Suggestions optimizing Piazza use learning community highly encouraged
Initially make sure respond invitation join add response Introduce Yourself note
Communication encouraged particularly content might resonate others course
Make sure log give preferred email address
I generally send announcement Piazza I strongly suggest set Piazza frequent update via email
I may occasionally send important note override email preference get notified immediately
We meet online
Be sure promptly read test computer internet microphone hardware
I try meeting space opened minute class time
Class good place get sense others class give discus suggestion online class voice general question comment let u respond
I plan record synchronous session
set beginning class
I forget
Please try log class consistently
It real group contact online course
In class long established class period I spend time helping individual individual problem
With online setup I meet people individual question wide range time I
It may people want arrange individual meeting directly class separate time
Directly class common time
Also short publicized office hour go thing right make agreement meet time mutually convenient
I happy give extensive help outside class people log class
If first pas idea enough better together pas maybe pas needed Learning spiral process rate varies person individual topic
Everyone get particularly help
Do NOT shy asking help including repeated help
Most help individual need need help
Points comparable within individual category I take average
Averages different category combined using weight
For example student end exam scaled final exam scaled would final numerical grade
Only raw grade appear Sakai scaled weighted grade
The raw grade Sakai allow easy checking accuracy recording
Please check periodically correct u necessary
With convention
Sorry I seem block seeing
I convert course letter grade following minimum requirement A B C D
If consistently displayed knowledge ability class discussion show exam I may raise grade
Note one way display effort thought question
The tentative exam due date The university starting use online proctoring service help reinforce value grade show others record
You take exam proctored remotely service called Examity
Examity proctoring adheres University policy safety security personally identifying information helpful ensuring academic integrity online course
Detailed instruction use Examity provided course begin please log soon possible receiving instruction set profile
To use Examity need make sure meet following technical requirement If question concern contact Examity technical support team via email phone
The exact time constraint set likely generous three hour take exam likely evening exam day
We discus
Exams cover material discussed class reading material web assignment
Exams always cumulative NOT include new material class immediately exam
This way always time question digesting class
You always allowed least two x inch side note exam
Do write thing exam see incomplete incorrect without making comment acknowledging better know wrong wrong think right
If must miss exam let know well advance
Then good reason possibly make arrangement
I little sympathy people inform fact good reason
I may completely excuse exam sick unable participate long enough
Most often take exam usual time I want take little later
If excuse prepared take exam decide take anyway get change mind see poor grade
Being sick way get one chance everyone else
I may allow delay exam due illness I let reexamined due poor grade
Time fly fun
I hope fun many course feel pressure commit enough time course fly week rather usual week semester
Plan intense fun experience
If figure hour per week per credit normal semester course moving time fast let sink need plan hour week hour synchronous class
We time waste first day
There issue even hour available restricted time You encouraged program partner work enough flexibility schedule arrange many hour also suit partner
Not partner could make course harder
The class day spaced evenly
Having video watch schedule mean even workload get ahead Thursday Monday
It even important week semester keep ahead much possible lot people finally get topic get sleep
You lot night sleep thing
Part keeping sure get help promptly first sign trouble
Contact
Then next sign trouble contact
Your journal discussed another way get feeling
You still need actively suggest connect need help online environment
Students used face face class material presented fixed pace must make major adjustment commitment keep largely course
Help always available put work regularly see help need proactive getting help
We use Piazza private journal entry three time week
Your journal entry successive initial private note I write first class
For Maria instance I would use note title Maria Journaling
My note remind thing include journal entry At bottom thread note like Piazza note place labeled
Make next journal entry
Make three journal entry per week I plan make Piazza day entry due
Initially ongoing assignment work Python Tutorial
You keep work tutorial asked turn chapter time
You given name file instructed create
I expecting name
There assignment class day shown along written graded assignment generally submitted assignment submission system
Assignments due end date specified unless otherwise stated
Programming assignment turned time running correctly
If program running correctly get help turn even late
It hard see code working
Graded assignment either listed program may work homework generally assignment
Working program homework problem essential understanding course material giving insufficient attention almost surely affect exam performance
As see exam description important able apply concept
When something always able think chose process
The process final answer important later
Getting right final answer work test result thought process
You must give credit BY NAME person assist completing assignment
Be sure make clear nature amount help received
Failure acknowledge help PLAGIARISM dealt accordingly
If give help also state assignment helped
See Academic Dishonesty
Late work penalized per day including weekend
If special reason assignment turned late preferably speak directly first
I consider penalty
If I accept reason ALSO make comment top source code main program
This reminder help
In short semester keeping extra important
Start early get help need early
Preferably assignment come material
Preferably start early enough get help need due date something work get working submission even late
It demonstrated Pair Programming two people collaborating one problem one person coding look either directly modern technology afar whether beginner student seasoned professional allows project done better faster confidence also student learn least well enjoyment process
You option pair programming course assignment
Your exam NOT pair however
Read page also page pair programming mostly work planned
An outside person refers someone pair partner one
On joint assignment limit communication pair partner pair partner need listed helping
I may read code comment
You must acknowledge help clearly explaining extent
You may read outside person code permissible talk solution problem actual code
Anyone discus problem
You may allow outside person read code get idea
It permissible talk solution judicious hint give
Again student responsible listing help documentation take help gave

In triggered advent software engineering discipline
This term originated critical development complexity happened due rapid growth computational power
At time computing power machine became overwhelming number software development project budget late unsuccessful
One example first General payroll system launched Louisville Kentucky late budget missing crucial feature Topi Tucker
Irrespective human effort complexity hardware software system hard cope mean old method technique
The challenge dramatic NATO arranged conference world leader IT research practice searched efficient response
At conference term coined used Naur Randell
Another term suggested conference Bauer software engineering
The idea apply engineering method material production new domain concurrent software system order make software project accurate predictable
This software engineering approach feasible though method practice used differ substantially used material production
Specifically expert examined bridge instance complex material system
The attendee concluded distribution time cost lifecycle phase especially maintenance different software material production
This new software engineering discipline need new methodology technique tool
The focus software engineering discipline production substantially complex high quality software system
Concerning software complexity least two dimension identified technical management complexity Booch
To measure software product complexity quality set attribute metric suggested
The quality attribute included performance reliability security fault tolerance usability strategic reusability maintainability importance depended product size scope Lattanze
The complexity metric included product size term line code function point nesting level cyclomatic complexity number sophisticated one Debbarma Debbarma Chakma Jamatia
These metric assisted strategy later general approach transformed elaborate product estimation technique software development methodology Jensen
Researchers argue whether crisis software engineering yet Colburn Hsieh Kehrt Kimball still exists Buettner Dai Pongnumkul Prasad
This happens fundamental difference lifecycles software material product
One critical difference software material production distribution time cost development lifecycle phase
Therewith maintenance time cost consuming often exceeds software project expense Schach
The crucial difference software production often depends dramatically upon human factor
These human factor relate management aspect software complexity whereas technology factor relate technological aspect
Certain product category far complex term management term technology however influence human factor development largely underestimated
For software product category enterprise information system defense management information system neglecting human factor often result project delay even failure Booch

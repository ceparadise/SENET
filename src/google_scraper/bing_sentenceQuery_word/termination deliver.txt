Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I reading terminate TCP connection handshake required FIN FIN ACK ACK
However closing connection Wireshark display FIN ACK FIN ACK ACK never display FIN
However establishing connection Wireshark clearly display three handshake SYN SIN ACK ACK
So I kinda confused closing connection three handshake displayed like
A TCP implementation might send standalone FIN first closing segment
However send FIN ACK instead
The latter strictly better implementation bundle free ACK FIN segment without making longer
This ACK still room segment ACK number ignored waste bandwidth
Hence ACK simply case receiver missed
This true TCP segment
Hence except first SYN segment sender information ACK number segment usually ACK flag
By posting answer agree

Determine isoefficiency term due termination Consider termination detection scheme Section
In algorithm weight may become small may eventually become zero due finite precision computer
In case termination never signaled
The algorithm modified manipulating reciprocal weight instead weight
Write modified termination algorithm show capable detecting termination correctly
Consider termination detection algorithm spanning tree minimum diameter mapped onto architecture given parallel computer
The center tree vertex minimum distance vertex farthest
The center spanning tree considered root
While executing parallel search processor either idle busy
The termination detection algorithm requires work transfer system acknowledged ack message
A processor busy work sent work another processor corresponding ack message received otherwise processor idle
Processors leaf spanning tree send stop message parent become idle
Processors intermediate level tree pas stop message parent received stop message child become idle
When root processor receives stop message child becomes idle termination signaled
Since possible processor receive work sent stop message parent processor signal received work sending resume message parent
The resume message move tree meet previously issued stop message
On meeting stop message resume message nullifies stop message
An ack message sent processor transferred part work
Show using example termination detection technique correctly signal termination

I reading technical documentation every quirky detail normal human easily realizes typo le well chosen formulation fact profound base concept fundamentally affect future design
In said document I find term
What
Also
In mind digit character set something numeric set character consisting character set yes set
Perhaps define term question exclusion possible case definition
So would good example following
My guestimation
It number said
Use word numeric specify opposed say thumb
Although always way one point history Unicode Standard made explicit digit usable numeric character used compose number
These digit numeric value ranging
In Unicode character property code point general category also character property
In word alias fact
For example basic digit along general category numeric value Therefore thing far Unicode concerned
certainly number count decimal number hence digit
Superscripts vulgar fraction considered example We also interesting case includes thing Roman Numeral
These considered number letter digit use composition There many digit basic ten Common script however
For example many besides
Those digit note
They Common script
Here number common script digit
Some interesting numeric value see
And example number Basic Multilingual Plane make available code point Unicode
Venturing astral plane find delight glad asked
If gave specific context like subject matter surrounding verbiage might able give targeted answer
For given know phrase appears technical document strong suspicion merely unnecessarily verbose way say
I think disambiguation numeral finger play though I could change mind depending subject document
A numeric digit smallest instance call inadequately define
Your definition inadequate fails include phrase algebraic
Your definition also presupposes base go answer
For base adjust accordingly
The standard terminology numeric
All literal called literal
The operational distinction two normal arithmetic done former latter
Thus arbitrary string digit necessarily numeric literal zip code telephone number without punctuation classic example
The reason specify arithmetic called computed arbitrary alphanumeric data using internal numeric code character check data transmission integrity much spirit called another case special numeric computation done string digit

I sure I understand method
Can someone explain
All I know I read This method return numeric value represented character specified radix
I sure radix represents
According description returned I assumed method get character return numeric value ASCII table I guess true
Are familiar numerical base
For example base equal base equal base etc
That essentially take character specified base return numerical value base
If provide value greater specified base example return signifying invalid value
The method isDigit true character Unicode decimal digit value character decomposition le specified radix
In case decimal digit value returned

I started reading I trouble understanding one part
Here excerpt page The output program run The declaration declares ndigit array integer
Array subscript always start zero C element This reflected loop initialize print array
A subscript integer expression includes integer variable like integer constant
This particular program relies property character representation digit
For example test determines whether character c digit
If numeric value digit This work consecutive increasing value
Fortunately true character set
By definition char small integer char variable constant identical ints arithmetic expression
This natural convenient example integer expression value corresponding character stored c thus valid subscript array ndigit
The part I trouble understanding part necessary expression
If character small integer author say digit character correspond numeric value
Digit character correspond numeric value
They correspond encoding value case ASCII
IIRC ascii value
And luckily example character set value stored order character set
So subtracting ASCII value ASCII digit return true value
The numeric value character system ASCII value
The ASCII value etc
By subtracting value character becomes becomes etc
By writing actually need know ASCII value system using ASCII could using
The thing matter value consecutive increasing integer
It convert ASCII code key keyboard value zero
int x result would zero
In character encoding digit placed consecutively character set
In ASCII example start etc
If want numeric value given digit subtract get right value
The advantage using instead specific value code portable character set much le effort
If access character string character get ASCII value back even character happen number
Fortunately guy designed character table made sure character sequential simply convert ASCII number subtracting
That code
I admit confusing see first time rocket science
The value

In terminology unit roughly corresponds unit symbol form
Examples character include common mark

The concept also includes correspond symbol particular natural language rather bit information used process text one language
Examples control character include well instruction device display otherwise process text
Characters typically combined
Computers communication equipment represent character using assigns character something quantity represented sequence typically transmitted
Two example usual encoding encoding
While character encoding map character number bit sequence instead represents character using series electrical impulse varying length
Historically term widely used industry professional refer often defined programming language
Likewise widely used refer specific repertoire character mapped specific bit sequence numerical code
The term used describe particular visual appearance character
Many computer consist glyph indexed numerical code corresponding character
With advent widespread acceptance Unicode character increasingly seen unit independent particular visual manifestation
The defines member set element used organisation control representation data
Unicode definition supplement explanatory note encourage reader differentiate character grapheme glyph among thing
Such differentiation instance wider theme
For example א often used mathematician denote certain kind also used ordinary Hebrew text
In Unicode two us considered different character two different Unicode numerical identifier though may rendered identically
Conversely water 水 may slightly different appearance text Chinese text local may reflect
But nonetheless Unicode considered character share code point
The Unicode standard also differentiates abstract character paired numeric code facilitate representation computer
The also addressed Unicode
For instance Unicode allocates code point combining trema ï
This make possible code middle character word naïve single code point combination character diacritic LATIN SMALL LETTER I COMBINING DIAERESIS
Both considered canonically equivalent Unicode standard
A data type size exactly one turn defined large enough contain member basic execution character set newer C standard code unit implies minimum size bit
The exact number bit checked via macro
By far common size bit POSIX standard bit
Since requires least bit store single code point usually impossible store one inside single instead encoding must used
Unfortunately fact character historically stored single byte led two term used interchangeably documentation
This often make documentation confusing misleading multibyte encoding used led inefficient incorrect implementation string manipulation function
Modern POSIX documentation attempt fix defining character sequence one byte representing single graphic symbol control code attempt use byte referring char data
However defines array element type char
Unicode also stored string made code unit larger
These called
The original C type called
Due platform defining bit others defining bit recent version added
Even object stored might character instance often stored array
Other language also type
Some use bit like Others use bit order represent value
A word character special meaning aspect computing
A word character within ASCII typically mean letter alphabet upper lower case digit underscore
It might dependent localization encoding use
For example word character French Russian Greek used word fédération Αγορά Примечания

Computer program use data type organise different type data program
Data also constant variable within program function

There also many character invisible screen character
Most provide called
Each represents single character predefined set ASCII
Each character pattern
Most programming language data type called used data value made ordered sequence character hello world
A string contain sequence character visible invisible character may repeated
The number character string called length hello world length made letter space
There usually restriction maximum length string
There also thing contains character length
A string
If constant usually written sequence character enclosed single double quotation mark ie hello
All keyboard input text output form character string

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
A digit element taken whole comprises system numeration
Thus digit number specific context
In Arabic numbering system digit element set
In number system digit element set
This system used computer two digit represent logic low high state
The term binary digit compressed computer parlance
Other numbering system used computing include system
In octal number system digit element set
In hexadecimal system digit element set A B C D E F
The term digit often used represent number specific position larger number number fraction expressed using radix point
For example decimal number number thousand digit number hundred digit number ten digit number one digit number tenth digit number hundredth digit
In biology anatomy term refers finger toe human animal
In robotics term refer small useful appendage end effector robot hand

It also called And seems true today Wikipedia entry seems pretty bare
Definition Definition The main difference Definition allows decimal Definition
For example I list
Definition would yeild
Definition would yeild
Dave Koelle implement definition example say thus supporting definition correct
In linked code code treat
string decimal numeric substring
Dave Koelle note glitch saying There currently glitch come point specifically period treated string decimal point
To word numeric would imply decimal practice seems case unless specifically noted include decimal
What Order Sort mean exactly without additional qualifier
For example In Natural Order Sort decimal decimal would additional qualifier
Which definition correct Natural Order Sort
v Alphanumeric sort mean every character compared according ascii representation
Natural sort treat consecutive digit one chatacter actually compare integer
There place decimal compare two number form look like decimal compare
So natural sort compare decimal really mean
The example coincidence like reading float sorting give good order adding subtracting defined
Same identified part decimal comparison shifted
The separator might given anything change result inconsistent

While function variable macro special operator provide basic building block language building block program data structure use
As Fred Brooks observed Representation essence programming
Common Lisp provides support data type typically found modern language number integer floating point complex character string array including multidimensional array list hash table input output stream abstraction portably representing filename
Functions also data type Lisp stored variable passed argument returned return value created runtime
And type beginning
They defined language standard programmer count available tend easier implement efficiently tightly integrated rest implementation
But see later chapter Common Lisp also provides several way define new data type define operation integrate data type
For however start data type
Because Lisp language detail exactly different data type implemented largely hidden
From point view user language data type defined function operate
So learn data type learn function use
Additionally data type special syntax Lisp reader understands Lisp printer us
That instance write string number list
I describe syntax different kind object I describe function manipulating
In chapter I cover scalar data type number character string
Technically string true scalar string sequence character access individual character manipulate string function operates sequence
But I discus string function manipulate single value also close relation several string function character counterpart
Math Barbie say hard
Common Lisp ca make math part easier tend get way lot le programming language
That surprising given mathematical heritage
Lisp originally designed mathematician tool studying mathematical function
And one main project MAC project MIT Macsyma symbolic algebra system written Maclisp one Common Lisp immediate predecessor
Additionally Lisp used teaching language place MIT even computer science professor cringe thought telling student leading Lisp support exact ratio
And various time Lisp called upon compete FORTRAN numeric computing arena
One reason Lisp nice language math number behave like true mathematical number approximation number easy implement finite computer hardware
For instance integer Common Lisp almost arbitrarily large rather limited size machine word
And dividing two integer result exact ratio truncated value
And since ratio represented pair arbitrarily sized integer ratio represent arbitrarily precise fraction
On hand numeric programming may willing trade exactitude rational speed offered using hardware underlying operation
So Common Lisp also offer several type number mapped implementation appropriate representation
Floats also used represent result computation whose true mathematical value would irrational number
Finally Common Lisp support complex number number result thing taking square root logarithm negative number
The Common Lisp standard even go far specify principal value branch cut irrational transcendental function complex domain
You write numeric literal variety way saw example Chapter
However important keep mind division labor Lisp reader Lisp evaluator reader responsible translating text Lisp object Lisp evaluator deal object
For given number given type many different textual representation translated object representation Lisp reader
For instance write integer number way reader translate object
When number printed back say REPL printed canonical textual syntax may different syntax used enter number
For example The syntax integer value optional sign followed one digit
Ratios written optional sign sequence digit representing numerator slash another sequence digit representing denominator
All rational number canonicalized read read number
Rationals printed reduced form integer value printed integer syntax ratio numerator denominator reduced lowest term
It also possible write rational base
If preceded rational literal read binary number legal digit
An indicates octal number legal digit indicates hexadecimal legal digit
You write rational base base always written decimal
Additional digit beyond taken letter
Note radix indicator apply whole rational possible write ratio numerator one base denominator another
Also write integer value ratio decimal digit terminated decimal point
Some example rational canonical decimal representation follows You also write number variety way
Unlike rational number syntax used notate number affect actual type number read
Common Lisp defines four subtypes number short single double long
Each subtype use different number bit representation mean subtype represent value spanning different range different precision
More bit give wider range precision
The basic format number optional sign followed nonempty sequence decimal digit possibly embedded decimal point
This sequence followed exponent marker computerized scientific notation
The exponent marker consists single letter followed optional sign sequence digit interpreted power ten number exponent marker multiplied
The letter double duty mark beginning exponent indicates point representation used number
The exponent marker uppercase equivalent indicate short single double long float respectively
The letter indicates default representation initially used
Numbers exponent marker read default representation must contain decimal point followed least one digit distinguish integer
The digit number always treated base digit syntax work rational
The following example number along canonical representation Finally complex number written syntax namely followed list two real number representing real imaginary part complex number
There actually five kind complex number real imaginary part must either rational kind number
But write however want complex written one rational one part rational converted float appropriate representation
Similarly real imaginary part float different representation one smaller representation
However complex number rational real component zero imaginary part since value mathematically speaking rational represented appropriate rational value
The mathematical argument could made complex number component complex type number zero imaginary part always different object number representing real component
Here example number written complex number syntax The basic arithmetic operation addition subtraction multiplication division supported different kind Lisp number function
Calling function two argument equivalent calling function first two argument calling resulting value rest argument
For example equivalent
With one argument return value return negation reciprocal
If argument type number rational floating point complex result type except case result operation complex number rational component yield number zero imaginary part case result rational
However complex number argument real one number argument converted nearest value largest representation actual argument
number smaller representation also converted larger representation
Similarly argument complex real argument converted complex equivalent
Because truncate Common Lisp provides four flavor truncating rounding converting real number rational floating point integer truncates toward negative infinity returning largest integer le equal argument
truncates toward positive infinity returning smallest integer greater equal argument
truncates toward zero making equivalent positive argument negative argument
And round nearest integer
If argument exactly halfway two integer round nearest even integer
Two related function return modulus remainder truncating division real number
These two function related function follows Thus positive quotient equivalent negative quotient produce different result
The function provide shorthand way express adding subtracting one number
Note different macro
function return new value modify place
The following equivalence show relation The function numeric equality predicate
It compare number mathematical value ignoring difference type
Thus consider mathematically equivalent value different type equivalent generic equality predicate would consider inequivalent difference type
The generic equality predicate however us compare number
If called two argument return true value
Thus The function conversely return true argument different value
The function order rational number word real number
Like function called two argument case argument compared argument right
To pick smallest largest several number use function take number real number argument return minimum maximum value
Some handy function test whether single real number equal le greater zero
Two predicate test whether single integer argument even odd
The suffix name function standard naming convention predicate function function test condition return boolean
The function seen far beginning mathematical function
Lisp also support logarithm exponentiation basic trigonometric function inverse hyperbolic function inverse
It also provides function get individual bit integer extract part ratio complex number
For complete list see Common Lisp reference
Common Lisp character distinct type object number
That character number language treat tend run problem character encoding change say ASCII Unicode
Because Common Lisp standard mandate particular representation character today several Lisp implementation use Unicode native character encoding despite Unicode gleam standard body eye time Common Lisp standardization wrapped
The read syntax character object simple followed desired character
Thus character
Any character used including otherwise special character whitespace
However writing whitespace character way human readable alternative syntax certain character followed character name
Exactly name supported depends character set Lisp implementation implementation support name
Thus write instead though latter technically legal
Other semistandard name implementation must use character set appropriate character
The main thing character putting string I get later chapter compare character
Since character number ca use numeric comparison function
Instead two set function provide analog numeric comparators one set
The analog numeric function
Like take number argument return true character
The insensitive version
The rest character comparators follow naming scheme comparators named prepending analogous numeric comparator version spell comparator name separated hyphen
Note however spelled logical equivalent rather verbose
Like numeric counterpart function take one argument
Table summarizes relation numeric character comparison function
Other function deal character provide function among thing testing whether given character alphabetic digit character testing case character obtaining corresponding character different case translating numeric value representing character code actual character object
Again complete detail see favorite Common Lisp reference
As mentioned earlier string Common Lisp really composite data type namely array character
Consequently I cover many thing string next chapter I discus many function manipulating sequence string one type
But string also literal syntax library function performing operation
I discus aspect string chapter leave others Chapter
As seen literal string written enclosed double quote
You include character supported character set literal string except double quote backslash
And include two well escape backslash
In fact backslash always escape next character whatever though necessary character except
Table show various literal string read Lisp reader
Note REPL ordinarily print string readable form adding enclosing quotation mark necessary escaping backslashes want see actual content string need use function designed print output
For example see type string containing embedded quotation mark REPL hand show actual string content You compare string using set function follow naming convention character comparison function except prefix rather see Table
However unlike character number comparators string comparators compare two string
That also take keyword argument allow restrict comparison substring either string
The argument specify starting inclusive ending exclusive index substring first second string argument
Thus following compare substring bar two argument return true
The argument keyword argument omitted altogether indicate corresponding substring extends end string
The comparators return true argument differ except return index first string mismatch detected
If first string prefix second return value length first string one greater largest valid index string
When comparing substring resulting value still index string whole
For instance following compare substring bar baz return index first string Other string function allow convert case string trim character one end string
And I mentioned previously since string really kind sequence sequence function I discus next chapter used string
For instance discover length string function get set individual character string generic sequence element accessor function generic array element accessor function
Or use accessor
But function others topic next chapter let move
Fred Brooks Anniversary Edition Boston
Emphasis original
Mattel Teen Talk Barbie Obviously size number represented computer finite memory still limited practice furthermore actual representation used particular Common Lisp implementation may place limit size number represented
But limit going well beyond astronomically large number
For instance number atom universe estimated le current Common Lisp implementation easily handle number beyond
Folks interested using Common Lisp intensive numeric computation note naive comparison performance numeric code Common Lisp language C FORTRAN probably show Common Lisp much slower
This something simple Common Lisp lot seemingly equivalent one language
Because Lisp dynamic typing support thing arbitrary precision rational complex number seemingly simple addition lot addition two number known represented machine word
However use declaration give Common Lisp information type number using enable generate code much work code would generated C FORTRAN compiler
Tuning numeric code kind performance beyond scope book certainly possible
While standard require many Common Lisp implementation support IEEE standard arithmetic Institute Electrical Electronics Engineers
also possible change default base reader us number without specific radix marker changing value global variable
However clear path anything complete insanity
Since purpose number make efficient use hardware Lisp implementation allowed map four subtypes onto native type appropriate
If hardware support fewer four distinct representation one type may equivalent
Computerized scientific notation scare quote commonly used computer language since day FORTRAN actually quite different real scientific notation
In particular something like mean true scientific notation would written x
And confuse matter true scientific notation letter stand base natural logarithm something like x superficially similar completely different value approximately
For mathematical consistency also called argument case return appropriate identity
Roughly speaking equivalent operator Perl Python equivalent C Java
Technically exact behavior C specified standard
Even Java designed beginning use Unicode character theory Unicode going character encoding future run trouble since Java character defined quantity Unicode standard extended range Unicode character set require representation
Ooops
Note however literal string printed passing second argument since certain sequence character special meaning
To safely print arbitrary string say value variable write format

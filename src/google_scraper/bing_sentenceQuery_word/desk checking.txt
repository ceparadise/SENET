Desk checking informal manual test programmer use verify coding algorithm logic program launch
This enables spot error might prevent program working
Modern debugging tool make desk checking le essential past still useful way spotting logic error
Desk checking similar process proofreading exercise programmer run line code identify error check logic
Typically programmer print code go pencil paper exercise
He may run manual test algorithm checking work correctly contain coding error
This usually involves creating table column containing line number variable condition input output depending check making
Even experienced programmer make mistake desk check may help catch fix program go formal run
Running desk check quick inexpensive
The programmer wrote code typically check identifies issue fix spot project move onto next stage
If desk check error cause problem later line might delay project
Errors may also harder identify later stage
A desk check guarantee programmer find mistake
It also subject human error
Programmers may miss thing need fixed simply wrote code close objective
Getting different programmer desk check may solve issue
However person running check also need understand requirement behind code evaluate work
Desk checking sometimes part broader testing process
In structured walkthrough example programmer part peer group review analyzes work prior launch
The programmer typically give material review group member meeting
During meeting walk group code
Ideally group spot error exist make viable suggestion improvement
Projects may one walkthrough stage checking issue understanding requirement coding accuracy
An error occurred
Try later

A desk check informal manual process verifying programming logic algorithm program launched
A desk check help programmer find bug error would prevent application functioning properly
Although useful technique spotting error modern debugging application tool made desk check le relevant essential previously
A desk check focus logic value variable
This quite different test plan focus internal working logic rather mostly focus input output required application
A desk check performed help table column line number column condition column column column variable
The line number column help specifying line line executed
The condition column help showing working evaluating condition
The column help showing input output help evaluating input received user output displayed logic
The column variable help evaluating calculation using variable
The start possible input walk algorithm line line
The line assigned line number proceed one taking account change value variable
All information captured table column
The evaluation usually done help paper similar proofreading
There many benefit associated desk checking
It find expose issue error algorithm
It also help verifying algorithm performs intended designer programmer
It fast inexpensive technique
It help identifying error logic early stage evaluation
A desk check foolproof
It duty make sure traversed possible path logic make use every data set required
Desk checking subject human error evaluator need understand requirement evaluating logic

A brief tutorial Computer Science term Desk Checking

Freelance Writer Think thing every day posting status update downloading song checking class schedule online Do think would cool design technology make device work better
To invent new one
To help make people life job easier
Then maybe right path
But first let set thing straight
Computer scientist people call printer stop working
And sit dark cubicle day without talking anyone
Whatever think computer science wrong say Dianna Xu Chair Computer Science Department Bryn Mawr Pennsylvania
So
Computer scientist use technology solve problem
They write software make computer new thing accomplish task efficiently
They create application mobile device develop website program software
And find everywhere big tech firm government agency startup nonprofit
It everyday computing say Liz Burd Chancellor Learning Teaching University Newcastle Australia
It building tool enable everyday One biggest thing computer science major learn logically think problem find way solve
Chris Stephenson Executive Director Computer Science Teachers Association add good computer scientist also understand teamwork good communicator
They work people time say including come CS background
No matter brilliant point explain someone product work code Stephenson say
Bobby Schnabel Dean School Informatics Computing chair Association Computing Machinery Education Policy Committee say student go computer science like working computer
Others want solve problem technology
Whatever passion CS degree great foundation kind job
Anokwa nine year old first programmed computer
It father used teaching journalism Indianapolis Anokwa allowed touch anyway entering online competition win faster modem
In high school started business repairing computer classmate parent
In college earned two degree one computer science Butler one electrical engineering
There Anokwa began think people could use computing change world better
After computer everywhere desk pocket inside device use every day
Software powerful say
During graduate school Anokwa spent six month volunteering public health organization Rwanda helped introduce electronic medical record system used nationwide
That experience inspired Anokwa develop Open Data Kit platform replaces paper form smart phone tablet computer
Its tool used world
Election observer use monitor poll Egypt health worker Kenya use track effort combat HIV Brazilians use measure illegal logging rainforest
Anokwa partner eventually started company called Nafundi consults client using tool like Open Data Kit
These day I lot programming Anokwa say
Those skill head
All skill I need I learned first couple year Brown meant study philosophy enrolled Lexington Virginia
But also liked tinkering computer
He took class logic class computer programming
It might seem like two subject anything common Brown liked relied logical thinking
It seems like straightforward correlation say
The summer graduating computer science degree went back hometown Memphis Tennessee got job lifeguarding country club
Through someone met found next job helped company find new employee department
Outside work joined informal group programmer
That met founder website called MyRepresentatives
The site make easy people live Memphis area find represents local state federal government
Brown started working site lead developer
It unpaid valuable position
He working MyRepresentatives month landed paid job Lindsey Software company design program public housing agency work today
The computer programming class Lynch took high school one favorite
I liked knowing logic understanding thing work say
How work solve problem She majored computer science Colchester Vermont learned little bit everything computing programming language mathematical principle behind technology managing website attack problem system
The biggest thing degree gave perfect foundation build career Lynch say
In experience general degree
A technical degree general Now technical analyst Esri software company us sophisticated mapping technology called geographic information system GIS
Lynch even know GIS joined Esri imagine working industry
Among thing company software used map damage Hurricane Sandy left East Coast illustrate federal government sent money different project
Lynch design application company use Esri software
In job help customer work colleague develop test application
She like different thing every day
Every month something change I get cutting edge happening field say
Umali might playing day since company Turbine develops world popular online game sometimes need play make sure everything work correctly
Turbine make game like Dungeons Dragons The Lord Rings
Umali work behind scene keep game running smoothly making sure user sign want play list top player date
It energetic dynamic environment say
Umali graduated computer science degree Troy New York
Since several job software industry managing data people access need
Technology changed lot since college Umali say computer science major taught timeless skill like examine process information
They taught u principle break problem manageable piece say
Then prepared learn innovation field like new programming language
Overall Umali say studying computer science lead cool job wide range industry
It broad field say

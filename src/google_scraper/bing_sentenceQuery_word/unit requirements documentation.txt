It becoming le common see paper documentation
Documentation distributed via website software product application
Professionals educated field termed documentalists
This field changed name us term documentation still exists effort reintroduce term documentation field study
While associated standard easily available publicly guide source topic may serve purpose

David Berger provided several principle document writing regarding term used procedure numbering even length sentence etc
The following list guide dealing specific field type The procedure documentation vary one sector one type another
In general may involve document drafting formatting submitting reviewing approving distributing reposting tracking convened associated regulatory industry
It could also involve creating content scratch
Documentation easy read understand
If long wordy may misunderstood ignored
Clear Short Familiar word used maximum word sentence
Only gender hyper neutral word used cultural bias avoided
Procedures numbered performed

Technical writer corporate communicator professional whose field work documentation
Ideally technical writer background subject matter also writing managing content information architecture
Technical writer commonly collaborate subject matter expert SMEs engineer technical expert medical professional type client define create content documentation meet user need
Corporate communication includes type written documentation required company
The following typical software documentation type The following typical hardware service documentation type Documentation include feasibility report technical documentation operational documentation log book etc
There many type software application used create documentation
SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER SDF A common type software document written software engineer simulation industry SDF
When developing software simulator range embedded avionics device terrain database way full motion control system engineer keep notebook detailing development build project module
The document wiki page MS word document environment
They contain section section detail communication interface software
Often section used detail proof concept track error enhancement
Finally section document software tested
This document conformance client requirement
The result detailed description software designed build install software target device known defect
This build document enables future developer maintainer come speed software timely manner also provides roadmap modifying code searching bug
SOFTWARE FOR NETWORK INVENTORY AND CONFIGURATION These software tool automatically collect data network equipment
The data could inventory configuration information
The request create database basis information IT responsible
It also basis IT documentation
Examples include XIA Configuration
Documentation preferred term process populating criminal database
Examples include TIDE gang database

In computer hardware software product development documentation information describes product user
It consists product technical manual online information including online version technical manual help facility description
The term also sometimes used mean information product contained design document detailed code comment white paper blackboard session note
Without strong analytical skill software tester succeed project may fail

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

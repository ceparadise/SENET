Visual performing art
Health human ecology Kiernan Mathews Cathy Trower director research director Coache respectively said varying level subjectivity tenure process probably contributed gap physical science visual performing art
The issue physical science thing much concrete term expectation said Trower
If get grant get published get tenure
Satisfaction tenure clarity high among junior faculty member physical science visual art ranked among last
It harder define excellence art said Mathews
Expectations tenure also divided gender woman displaying significantly le satisfaction process men
Women expressed lower level satisfaction several area including number hour worked amount time research balance compatibility tenure track raising child
Shelley Correll associate professor sociology Stanford University said survey gender finding consistent campus across country
Almost university survey look woman harder time coordinating work family woman end work home work child care make work faculty member harder said
One Correll past study showed significantly higher proportion female professor male peer found workload excessive
She attributed pattern related child care greater source stress woman men
The stress outside workplace affect amount time research said
Londa Schiebinger director Stanford Michelle Clayman Institute Gender Research said found female faculty member take greater share housework male colleague
You take woman twice much home male counterpart said
Marc Goulden director data initiative University California Berkeley said past study found woman science married child percent le likely male counterpart achieve tenure entering job
He suggested Coache data highlight need institution offer new family policy resource
The gender gap remains consistent across survey academic discipline including field social science woman typically well represented
Trower suggested trend invalidates notion critical mass woman academe needed ensure gender equality
You would think well get woman discipline gender difference go away said Trower
And I think data saying enough necessarily woman
Despite imbalance humanity faculty member expressed high satisfaction ability raise child remaining tenure track
I think speaks fact humanity situation scientist feel said Trower
I think probably supportive culture men woman take time family
Business faculty member also showed high satisfaction ability combine work family ranking highest ability balance professional personal time
Mathews Trower said hoped disciplinary association individual institution would take note research improve job satisfaction faculty member
The whole idea create great workplace said Trower
We encourage provost talk dean talk department chair engage senior faculty conversation

learn share knowledge build career
My understanding far please correct I wrong While sound theoretical point view I feel I need detail ideally written example better grasp concept
I personally refer way Mike Cohn defined CoS
Here excerpt online chapter example Every project initiated set objective
Your current project may create best word processor
Creating best word processor however typically one objective project
There almost certainly additional objective regarding schedule budget quality
These objective thought customer product criterion used gauge success project
Way back I high school assigned write paper book Moby Dick I would always ask teacher long paper
respond something like page I knew primary condition satisfaction
There course number additional unwritten condition satisfaction paper would well written work English
At start release planning team product owner collaboratively explore product condition satisfaction
These include usual schedule budget agile team typically prefer treat quality
The team product owner look way meet condition satisfaction
The product owner may example equally satisfied release five month includes one set user story release month later includes additional user story
Sometimes however product condition satisfaction met
The team build best word processor build next month
When feasible solution found condition satisfaction must change
Because release planning exploration product condition satisfaction highly iterative illustrated Figure
Once release plan covering approximately next three six month established used input planning first iteration
Just release planning began consideration product condition satisfaction iteration planning
For iteration product condition satisfaction typically feature like developed next test feature
As example consider travel site includes user story user I want able cancel In discussing story product owner developer learn condition satisfaction story include Like release planning iteration planning iterative
The product owner team discus various way best meeting condition satisfaction iteration
Feedback loop shown Figure resulting new product increment back box start release iteration planning
Based experience developing product increment iteration team may gained knowledge experience affect planning one level
Similarly showing product increment existing likely user may generate new knowledge would cause change plan
An agile team incorporate change plan extent lead product
To sum I see use term All close understanding although I ideally prefer PO provide Acceptance Criteria rather validating one developed team
I think SCRUM term mean When define user story always collect acceptance criterion Product owner
User story exist unless collect acceptance criterion
Development team never defines
It responsibility PO define acceptance criterion
Acceptance criterion user story selected sprint change sprint
The reason team commited user story based estimate done initial acceptance criterion
The user story done pass acceptance criterion test sprint
Conclusion For acceptance criterion condition satisfaction boundary user story conversation
Example As customer I need pay order credit card I make online shopping
Acceptance criterion At point stated Visa MasterCard supported example AMEX
Ladislav Actually I sure much difference acceptance criterion CoS definition done something bit different
It validation story must pas order considered complete criterion whereas acceptance criterion CoS seem different variation acceptance criterion
Acceptance Criteria specific story
These mostly business rule story must pas considered done
Conditions Satisfaction another term AC
The confusion come fact someone coach trainer practitioner started name AC second term CoS
Anything outside AC given specific name AC
One core principle agility Transparency
Under fall use common language shared understanding help u describe reach goal
This question related confusion good live example Transparency important agility
It accident first sentence mostly
This common thing across user story listed every user story
DoD example commonality left AC known shared understanding everyone
The accepted answer add confusion matter
I hope help

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Here I encountered word I really understand meant value A critical value point point scale test statistic beyond reject null hypothesis derived level significance test
You may used hypothesis test like However also hypothesis test slightly different way Basically rather mapping test statistic onto scale significance level mapping significance level onto scale test statistic one critical value
The two method completely equivalent
In theoretical underpinnings hypothesis test based notion null hypothesis rejected test statistic fall critical region
The critical value boundary critical region
If test like test one critical value case like two

In book Exercise show piece code compute value polynomial The exercise assumes clock cycle needed addition multiplication respectively
The reader asked explain According exercise answer iteration need update variable operation need addition multiplication latter dominates latency causing ultimate CPE
But I think data flow something like So longest path previous value new value going execution unit
Therefore longest time cycle
I want ask Any explanation CPU architecture execution unit pipeline unit appreciated
I know I bit late party book absolutely right
As verify timing code CPE indeed second answer wrong
But first one also wrong
It say MULs must performed time possible Nehalem architecture I suspect modern processor
Remember one FP MUL unit different FP ADD unit shown book ed
later What happens instead LOADs assumed always present cycle cache First feed MUL
Immediately feed remember pipeline
cycle get new value cycle result
At point new computation stage MUL
So cycle rest ops want restricted
Of course easy need cycle FP ADD get new
So becomes obvious limiting factor computation
Which mean looking critical path whatever look specifically path old value new
In case path consists one FP ADD
threw first The critical path indeed cycle question asks CPE like time output one cycle loop
Other first last cycle processor addition previous iteration loop current multiplication time operand dependent
The first iteration loop take full cycle iteration loop take cycle run making actual CPE cycle

I agree book way presenting critical path confusing
Their definition critical path simply path take longest path path also operation operand depends previous operation order
This definition make finding critical path rather intuitive
The critical path longest path graph case eight clock
This say critical path Prioritized Topological Orders Without resource constraint shortest schedule given critical path longest path graph
A metric useful priority function height node length longest path graph originating node
I think found error book
You consider contacting author correct future printing
The critical path longest one data flow graph according book must straight line effect single register rather add whose result intermediate operand next operation
About question get done continuing read rest
Especially comparing data flow graph one helpful
If understood clear answer book reasonable

Engineers specialist technical information
As complexity problem increase increasing need engineer apply critical thinking context problem solving
This article demonstrates value use developing abstract thought engineering especially student In school widely used least reputable method solving problem Critical From understanding work long dead philosopher solving differential equation Critical Thinking like sort intellectual panacea
Although everyone agree Critical Thinking usually good thing difficult explain exactly even difficult teach
For engineer problem solving essentially profession
Critical thinking abstract thought invaluable tool complement engineer technical expertise
In paper first goal define exactly critical thinking
From discus example highlight importance abstract thought well effort teach classroom
Finally look applied Senior Project perhaps future work general
To begin look two definition critical thinking
In article Jessop argues critical thinking comprised three major skill analysis synthesis evaluation
She go quote statement Scriven define term explicitly Critical Thinking intellectually disciplined process actively skillfully conceptualizing applying analyzing synthesizing evaluating information gathered generated observation experience reflection reasoning communication guide belief action
quoted Jessop Analysis breaking problem part finding relationship
Synthesis thinking way solve problem either incorporating new information combining part different way
Finally evaluation making judgment result using evidence hand
According Scriven critical thinking combined process analysis synthesis evaluation
Since trying use critical thinking guide belief action synthesis generation new idea solution necessary component
However creating new solution difficult impossible without understanding problem lead analysis
The process critical thinking though stop synthesis
Out result synthesis stage may better others
Moreover possible none result actually solve problem
Because necessary evaluate result order find best answer
To better understand definition apply example
Let assume want egg breakfast
For part process might putting butter pan breaking egg cooking
For many different way prepare egg
For example could whisk egg make scrambled egg maybe want hard boiled egg instead
Finally need evaluate result
There many different criterion one take least amount time delicious healthiest etc
In order apply critical thinking problem goal understand problem find possible solution evaluate result
For comparison look another definition critical thinking
Qiao writes When one used method principle scientific thinking everyday life practicing critical thinking
So scientific critical thinking The first thing come mind thinking scientific thinking scientific method first comparison seems little odd
For reference step scientific method presented follows Wikipedia In step see similarity earlier definition critical thinking
Earlier stated critical thinking composed analysis synthesis evaluation
While engineer typically begin problem instead question gathering information resource definitely part analysis
In case understanding problem question priority
In critical thinking next step would synthesis
A scientist may trying answer question forming hypothesis need imagine different possibility find answer fit engineering
Lastly step could considered one way evaluate result synthesis
While scientist may test hypothesis experiment engineer may run simulation create prototype
The point either case though make sure ensure idea earlier actually work
Although defined critical thinking engineer perspective surprising apply loosely discipline science
After capacity critical thinking limited useful engineer alone
Writers philosopher mathematician many discipline make use critical thinking well
Even process slightly different least analysis synthesis evaluation lie heart critical thinking
As technical example critical thinking let u examine problem Tufts University student encountered research summer
This student writing image processing code robot camera mounted
The code retrieve video display already written student focus image processing part
As simple test student wrote piece code find number black pixel video frame
The code easy test since pixel could made black covering camera
The problem occurred student code tried count pixel camera covered
In case pixel black student recorded fraction number
So student use critical thinking solve problem
First took account available information tried find possible source problem
The input video frame apparent size x pixel matched output displayed
Repeating test black pixel consistently returned fraction
When student modified code check pixel color result found expected number pixel first problem appeared related detecting black pixel
The student however tested part code thoroughly fairly confident source problem
Continuing analysis student decided directly save video frame display
Upon seeing result student saw problem found solution
While given video frame room x pixel actual image stored upper left hand corner x image
Thus student code correct originally surmised actually returning correct number
The code display video turn expected input resized image x video feed student originally saw
From rest problem straightforward
For synthesis student decided use upper left corner given image ignore rest pixel
The result efficient original code since process x image ignored pixel skewing result
This example demonstrates importance analysis critical thinking
Without understanding problem unlikely student would found solution starting synthesis step
In case solution test make sure worked relatively simple synthesis evaluation step important
Nevertheless applying step tandem allowed problem successfully solved
For part critical thinking typically something reserved liberal art especially English Philosophy
Even standardized test like SATs critical reading section
However discussed earlier critical thinking limited liberal art also integral part science engineering
Recently ABET pushing emphasis communication skill understanding global context today problem engineering curriculum
Previously even ABET accreditation process acknowledged school trained student able apply technical knowledge also lead work well team
ABET belief new objective achieved inclusion writing critical thinking engineering classroom Gunnink Bernhardt
Although people agree critical thinking focus school variety proposed method single class solution stand
Even though treating critical thinking individual effort paper suggested use group discussion forum order encourage critical thinking Radzi et Jacob et al
After defining critical thinking article Jessop suggests course based Brainstorming Critical Reading
For brainstorming section student given problem course week student must engineer solution
For critical reading section student given number journal article read evaluate
Naturally brainstorming half mainly concerned synthesis aspect critical thinking critical reading half focus analysis aspect Jessop
The hope course practicing step student become better critical thinking future
As mentioned earlier Qiao writing critical thinking school China
Qiao go state The nature authority two form textbook authority teacher authority
Laws rule textbook golden precious beyond manner doubt
Science teacher prolocutor
In order promote critical thinking sense skepticism Qiao suggests History Philosophy Science HPS Education approach
In addition usual Science student learn Qiao belief valuable learn History Philosophy behind advancement
While Jessop strategy purely engineer perspective Qiao approach relies idea critical thinking restricted engineer
Instead capacity critical thought developed study history philosophy
Despite difference method goal
In order tackle increasingly difficult problem engineer require technical knowledge
To end need teacher expert whose job train engineer bring critical thinking classroom
In paper attempted answer question like What critical thinking Why important As stated critical thinking thought similar scientific method main point problem definition understanding search solution evaluation iteration
Since critical thinking powerful tool problem solving seen recent effort include engineering curriculum
The final question want answer How apply senior project
The answer lost question relatively simple
Each properly scoped planned aim solve problem
In light strive solve problem intelligently say using critical thinking
This mean fully researching understanding problem creating new solution finding old one evaluating result
When result failure go back look solution try solved problem
So see critical thinking important essential part senior project

The critical value approach involves determining likely unlikely determining whether observed test statistic extreme would expected null hypothesis true
That entail comparing observed test statistic cutoff value called
If test statistic extreme critical value null hypothesis rejected favor alternative hypothesis
If test statistic extreme critical value null hypothesis rejected
Specifically four step involved using critical value approach conducting hypothesis test In example concerning mean grade point average suppose take random sample student majoring mathematics
Since test statistic degree freedom
Also suppose set significance level α chance making Type I error
The critical value conducting test versus denoted probability α

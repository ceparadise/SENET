About independence computer science I talking source code independence
It probably time provide lecture large talking computer science
I wanted start post quick review google result computer science independence software architecture independence
I admit result really convincing
In opinion one major weakness computer science nowadays lack theoretical abstraction
For instance good student mine know java interface insight general principle underlying Whatever profile Independence computer science
More precisely mean allow software much hurt
Changes may numerous different nature
The list proposal hesitate ask question start discussion practical example
First agile developer right
You ca prevent
Loosely speaking two way face
The pragmatic way
The theoretical one good requirement good architecture
These two approach antagonistic
Coding pattern practical thing something apply real many inspired sound principle something abstract know merit see next section
Are already applying
No

It help making explicit thinking detecting change fearing major
When I start learning new third party library I write test assert understanding library
Such sandbox test stay alive software providing shield third party change ensure assumption stay correct
Also first thing I optimizing convincing I reach good black box test coverage chunk code I plan refactor writing additional test course
And
When I sure something related I encapsulate uncertainty inside given extremely precise strong specification
Some example These technique extremely powerful case
Detecting reacting future change lot easier
An important source change related
Many software module consume data way data described
data structure used critical importance
Each module intuitive
For instance web page present big table result input big table data present tree input tree
Preprocessing simply mean introducing data converter needed
A previous table rendered navigating entire object model typical ORMs following association making count etc
Such rendering technique strongly hurt change object structure
Encapsulating conversion object model big table data inside dedicated well tested function evolve lot better
Even function easier
In opinion nature computer science best pattern software
Unfortunately pattern also difficult use right way dangerous abstracting much definitely kill software
Abstracting difficult define let start Abstraction process result generalization reducing information content concept observable phenomenon typically retain information relevant particular purpose
The last part sentence worth reading
Let discus
From point view blog source format I use writing paper link pair target location render This abstraction sufficient encloses relevant information practical purpose link blog source
The way thesis link implemented another story From development point view abstracting enforcing separation un related concern instance
The pattern presented practical coding pattern
The reason using driven theoretical concept even important
Below four abstract concept drive developer work almost everyday software architecture capture notion dependency link module
Two module strongly coupled dependency link strong changing one necessary imply changing something second one well
A good architecture enforces
Introducing interface Java instance generally mean provided interface well designed I add
pattern also help reducing coupling lot
related coupling
While wrong bit subtle
Cohesion capture notion
Somewhat strangely coupling even introduces dependency link ensuring cohesion naturally implies related module
The explanation fact relies kind dependency talking
Let go back example rendering result table HTML template render data prepared specific function
Both strong cohesion former depends second
However dependency link weaker expected even data wrong template may render
As interesting consequence module tested independently
And correct integration probably correct well table present accurate result
This discussion naturally lead next point
general principle underlying small achievement taken altogether allow bigger one
In experience separation concern also THE key notion apply coding pattern best way
Introducing abstraction without gaining along separation concern may lead API le stable harder understand harder maintain
capture notion module
This interesting question ask designing architecture secret module
If ca answer question probably something wrong decomposition
Think though somewhat le coding pattern force encapsulating design choice external library
data come
link actually rendered HTML page

specific place word introduce secret help reaching
There something really nice four theoretical principle extremely correlated
Encapsulating specific design choice introducing new module instance generally reduces coupling introduces better separation concern naturally lead good cohesion information hiding place
Unfortunately reverse also true forget encapsulate design choice also augment coupling reduce cohesion
If design choice questioned later software likely extremely difficult refactor reacting change challenging
A simple word sometimes requires long discourse Coding pattern mine
I really grateful Axel van Lamsweerde thesis promotor introducing underlying principle Requirements Engineering course
While sure origin I think principle initially proposed David Parnas Barry Boehm

Sept Convocation AM PM session Convocation Room Friend Center Please note Dean date May Best poster located outside CS
The Computer Science Department offer two style independent work advising seminar individual
The IW seminar allow student faculty advisor shared interest meet weekly group
Students individual IW project work schedule meeting advisor independently
All student except AB senior eligible satisfy IW requirement either advising style
AB BSE thesis must advised individually
Most student plan independent work first time sign
Specifically includes AB junior BSE student signed COS first time
Though seminar targeted independent work student open COS major working senior thesis
The content IW seminar include independent work project also guidance choose project evaluate progress design experiment collaborate others make presentation project management skill
These skill essential becoming effective researcher provide great training working company startup
Thus IW seminar perfectly suited student independent work first time
A list title abstract provided help choose amongst IW seminar
The instructor topic may change every semester
If already done previous semester independent work want work project outside scope topic offered IW seminar make arrangement Princeton faculty advise individually
To contact faculty would like work discus potential project idea well semester start certainly IW Sign Up deadline
Initial inquiry probably best email meeting discus possible project topic follow
A list provided help choose advisor contact
Faculty updating web page new research idea time
Also check web page research project page faculty know taken class
Please note Princeton faculty advisor COS independent work long significant computer science component project check IW Coordinators sure
In fact many student done project past often advised faculty another department COS faculty
Note list linked includes faculty done research CS student past looking interdisciplinary project CS student future
If selecting advisor advised COS project good idea also COS department
Once selected IW seminar found individual project advisor must indicate selection filling
The form asks choose one following option I independent work seminar next semester usual choice IW student I research professor next semester usual choice senior BSE student previous IW experience I senior thesis year usual choice senior AB student plus senior BSEs I form independent work next semester If select first option I independent work seminar asked indicate seminar would like take Independent Work Seminar section IW Sign Up form
The form ask enter ranked preference every seminar like writing seminar freshman year optionally provide paragraph text describing interest independent work
Then use information match seminar best assign top choice
However demand seminar exceeds capacity may assigned another priority
You notified assignment semester start
If select second third option advised individually fill Independent Work Individual section IW Sign Up form
You provide name faculty agreed advise tentative title word description planned project
Please work closely faculty advisor IW Sign Up form deadline work detailed project plan possible
You revisit IW Sign Up form many time like adjust selection
If fill form deadline assigned IW seminar individual advisor discretion
During first day semester meeting explain key requirement review schedule semester provide information seminar
Attendance mandatory student starting IW semester
Here recent meeting
During second half semester also meeting provide student information guideline These session provide critical information content include formatting use work
They mandatory student IW first time
Three four week semester must submit page written proposal describing intended project plan
The written proposal following section By Monday midterm week advisor must fill checkpoint form
The purpose form make sure making good progress project
It serf checkpoint provide feedback department whether making consistent progress whether meet advisor often whether potential roadblock completing proposed project
Preparing checkpoint document supposed difficult take much time
All must write brief description accomplished far remains done
The checkpoint form divided three part As guideline meeting approximately weekly advisor updating progress
Of course happen naturally IW seminar
If setting schedule meet advisor every week time highly recommended
Failure meet advisor almost certainly cause get behind schedule could even cause fail course make enough progress
As rule thumb try allocate hour time per week progress independent work project
During last week semester must give presentation describing project small group people
There four step must complete sign time slot upload slide advance talk give presentation time slot provide feedback presenter within time slot
You make presentation presentation tool Keynote PowerPoint long export PDF
Although many talk organization possible strongly recommended adhere following outline Note point may relevant type project others probably require one slide
Please feel constrained number slide feel address every point raised
Please tell coherent story trying well solution work
staying within time limit
Please use image graphic support point wherever possible minimizing use text slide
In particular please put text say slide boring
The text slide short sentence phrase convey key point quick glance sentence paragraph provide entire script talk
Many excellent research talk composed almost exclusively picture graph
Your slide uncluttered easy read visually appealing
Most presentation program slide background reasonable scheme text bullet etc
You probably use use background distracts content slide
Similarly use clipart animation gratuitously make talk zippier
The slide convey content clearly possible without distraction slide organized sized colored etc
important aspect presentation great effect ease viewer follow idea
given audience least one instructor several student
All project nine minute long talk plus three minute question
given audience least one instructor several student
For project nine minute long talk plus three minute question
For project twelve minute talk plus three minute question
If talk long cut middle manage time carefully
Please read section prepare
Also sure practice advance possible friend go talk advisor
Your advisor able give good feedback content style presentation
You assessed proposal content clarity effectiveness presentation
You assume audience specialized knowledge field
Assume audience group senior undergraduate Princeton necessarily taken course closely related research area
provided instructor student
You expected stay pay attention talk time slot fill feedback form one
Theses feedback form collected distgributed student group provide tip help improve presentation skill
Every thesis must adviser second reader
The second reader review thesis provides input grade
So may want choose involve second reader early project
If adviser faculty member Computer Science Department second reader must faculty member Computer Science Department
Students IW Thesis must submit written draft paper
This expected full thesis include complete outline give practice technical writing
It least page long
You discus exact requirement paper advisor
However general paper might contain one following component If good job writing draft reuse material chapter final thesis
For example paper could introduction final thesis related work section final thesis
Every IW project result written final report describing goal related work approach implementation result conclusion project using much outline suggested
Unlike oral presentation must extremely concise due time constraint written report delve detail cite relevant previous work present result many experiment table plot etc
The written final report look like professional document font margin
template formatting guideline used produce document using LaTeX BibTex
It contain proper bibliography text properly attributed
Failing cite appropriate source idea table text diagram serious violation Princeton code ethic
If unsure cite idea research paper properly create bibliography speak advisor tell exactly
Your report graded basis technical content organization creativity idea quality writing
The another resource assistance writing research paper
The final written report project page long
Theses page long
Relevant chart table diagram included accompanying caption
Be sure refer chart main body text clearly explaining nature purpose
The technique padding paper using multiple figure avoided
If lengthy code auxiliary example detailed algorithm long proof supplementary data kind may appropriate include entirety main body report
However encouraged include auxiliary data feel appropriate final portion report clearly labeled Appendix
The Appendix may long necessary may extend beyond page limit
Talk advisor write final report
It usually best start writing report early semester refine continuously throughout semester
Talk advisor exactly looking report
The best report prepared enough time adviser read draft give comment revision
For additional resource write report slide write good research paper list example previous year

For additional help note offer student writer free conference experienced fellow writer trained consult assignment discipline
The Princeton Writing Program also offer resource writer broad range technical field WSE
Every independent work student produce poster display final poster session
The poster session typically held Friend Center Convocation Room
There one poster session January Fall independent work student one poster session May Spring independent work student
Usually student side bulletin board mount display
Most people conventional poster display
However encourage student come new creative way communicate intellectual content thesis student faculty
Thumb tack mounting conventional poster provided
If considering something unconventional please check Undergraduate Coordinator Independent Work Coordinators well advance determine idea feasible
In general space limited creative idea wonderful need fit space conventional poster presentation
During poster session various faculty student walk poster poster
When faculty member student arrives poster prepared give clear interesting explanation project
Think like miniature informal presentation
Your talk well structured introduction set context explain main goal research followed technical detail work build
prove
interesting tricky bit catch people attention
followed result experimental data demo proof followed related work future work conclusion
You talk memorized
In fact often better seem natural
However useful think practice might say
During poster session faculty student wander poster poster engage conversation research
Therefore poster created way best help explain intellectual content importance creativity overall coolness IW project faculty member student working outside area research
Like good research talk start conversation faculty member explanation basic problem solving important
Once faculty member understands problem move explaining interesting element solution problem
After explaining basic solution move discussing experiment proof done evaluate validate idea
Do afraid explain negative result experiment showed idea necessarily pan thought might
Sharing negative result part good science
Remember like good talk picture graph chart often worth word
Also remember like good talk poster presentation must practiced order effective
Give practice presentation advisor friend
Have friend try think difficult question answer middle presentation prepared
You ready give presentation even presentation faculty member walk

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field

You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

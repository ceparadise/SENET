Here hierarchy might apply computer Sometimes fourth R added three basic one generally standing either rethink recover
Rethink sometimes added front hierarchy meaning consider option think impact environment
Recover last R refers practice putting waste product use
For example decomposing garbage produce methane gas one greenhouse gas landfill site recover burn energy rather letting dissipate

In Butler Lampson gave talk
Here opinion worked
Basically everything Yes still important today
Looking Maybe category This unfortunately still Maybe
Between continued demand compute chip expose plenty parallelism programmer
Concurrency gotten much easier deal really extracting anything close full performance available much easier
In Lampson comment came threading lock conditional variable PARC thought creating something programmer could use take advantage parallelism decade evidence wrong
Lampson remark parallel programming need put parallelism little box wizard go write code box
Not much changed since
Also note I using criterion judge
Whenever say something work someone drop say wait PhD demonstrates someone done thing nine program demonstrate Idris fact widely used large scale production system
I take Lampson view vast majority programmer literally incapable using certain class technology class technology probably succeeded
On recent advancement parallelism Intel outside couple big company one really taking advantage yet
They also added hardware support STM recently still clear much STM help usability designing large scale system
If Maybe certainly No
In lot folk probably majority folk believed RISC going take world doomed
In Apple IBM Motorola got together create PowerPC PPC chip going demolish Intel consumer market
They opened Somerset facility chip design collected lot best folk going world changing effort
At upper end market DEC Alpha chip getting twice performance Intel threat workstation market serious enough Microsoft ported Windows NT Alpha
DEC started project dynamic translation Alpha time project started projected performance basically running emulation Alpha substantially better native Intel chip
In Intel released Pentium Pro
At time better workstation integer performance anything else including much expensive chip targeted workstation floating point performance within factor chip
That immediately destroyed viability mainstream PPC chip IBM pulled Somerset venture everyone gave really trying produce desktop class PPC chip
Apple continued sell PPC chip cook bogus benchmark make chip look even remotely competitive
By time DEC finished dynamic translation effort translation barely faster native floating point code substantially slower integer code
While impressive technical feat enough convince people switch Alpha killed DEC attempt move workstation PC market
In workstation still mostly RISC machine supercomputer mix custom chip RISC chip chip
Today Intel dominates workstation market supercomputer market also moved towards
Other POWER RISC ISAs mostly wiped like managed survive moving embedded market like MIPS profitable enough Intel pursue vigor
You see kind instruction set arbitrage MIPS ARM able take advantage
Cavium ARM sell network card offloads lot processing NIC bunch cheap MIPS ARM processor respectively board
The processor inherently better processing packet Intel CPUS priced low enough Intel compete price want cannibalize higher margin chip sale lower margin chip
MIPS ARM concern MIPS flunked processor market ARM yet get
If best thing say RISC chip manage exist area profit margin low Intel care exactly great evidence RISC victory
That Intel ceded low end market might seem ironic considering Intel origin always aggressive moving upmarket thing transitioned DRAM SRAM flash ceding barely profitable DRAM market competitor
If threat ARM business model threat ISA
And ISA ARM biggest inroad mobile personal computing came earlier ISAs really
In area dominated modern ISA hopeless continue hopeless year continue dominate ISAs
In retrospect reason RISC chip looked good could fit complete RISC microprocessor onto single chip true chip time
But got transistor mattered le
It possible nitpick RISC saying modern processor translate ops RISC internally listened talk time people thought external RISC ISA would much lower overhead RISC would win clearly happened
Moreover modern chip also fusion order fuse operation decidedly operation
A clean RISC ISA beautiful thing
I sometimes Dick Sites admire turn beauty really critical commercial success ISA
This huge Yes
Every language become successful since GC designed normal user use manage memory
In five year Rust D might make last sentence untrue even happens GC still yes category
Yes I think although I sure Lampson referring
Lampson said reuse maybe sometimes work UNIX filter OS DB browser also flaky
There widely used substitute OLE service oriented architecture also seem fit definition
Looking No category Still No
You make case many thing today inspired capability capability originally presented still really horizon
I find capability interesting lot people I know went phase enamored everyone tried implement seems become disillusioned
I person observe none folk worked CAL TSS system perhaps first capability based system actual user wanted build capability based system experience
In interview Lampson also talk given large complexity burden ROI capability low system system know
The counterargument No answer capability exist mobile mobile taking world make answer Yes consumer OS share sort system forseeable future
It depends qualifies fancy type system fancy mean something least fancy Scala Haskell No
That even true relax standard type system
Boy would I love able everyday programming ML F seems particularly nice pretty far
In C mainstream along maybe Visual Basic Pascal Java rise
And maybe Perl time people thought scripting language something use real development
PHP Python Ruby JavaScript existed mostly used small niche
Back Tcl one widely used scripting language exactly widely used
Now PHP Python Ruby JavaScript mainstream Tcl mainstream C
C probably language league language term popularity Go look like language growing fast enough catch foreseeable future
Since bunch dynamic language language type system specifically designed fancy
Maybe I get use F project another year thing look promising
I lean towards Maybe one although arguably No
Functional language still quite niche functional programming idea mainstream least crowd
You might say I generous functional programming I soft spot immutability
That fair
In Functional language unnatural use knife fork diplomatic protocol bookkeeping host thing modern civilization found useful
Any discipline unnatural take master break extreme situation
That reason reject particular discipline
The important question whether functional programming unnatural way Haiku unnatural way Karate unnatural
Haiku rigid form poetry poem must precisely three line seventeen syllable
As poetry writing purely functional program often give one feeling great aesthetic pleasure
It often enlightening read write program
These undoubted benefit real programmer interested laboring program already work
They accept language discipline unless used write program solve problem first time Karate occasionally used deal real problem present
A person learned discipline Karate find directly applicable even brawl one else know Karate
Can said functional programmer today computing environment
No
Many people would make case today
I agree matter opinion matter fact
Maybe
Formal method high impact area
Model checking omnipresent chip design
Microsoft probably impact formal chip design tool combined clang fair amount static analysis built forth
But formal method still quite niche vast majority developer apply formal method
No
In David Parnas talk ICSE premier software engineering conference fact even ICSE paper influential paper award including two Parnas paper
Basically Parnas criticism still true today
One suggestion distinct conference researcher practitioner taken much academic conference like ICSE FSE conference like StrangeLoop PyCon
Yes
In fact RPCs widely used I seen multiple RPCs considered harmful talk
Yes
These ubiquitous startup zero distributed system expertise regularly use distributed system provided Amazon Microsoft totally fine
The system perfect infamous downtime incident compare bit error rate random storage something like EBS Azure Blob Storage distributed system look bad
Maybe
As formal method handful project high real world impact get lot mileage security research
But security still first class concern programmer
What worked computer system research
Not every Yes still Yes today seven Maybes Nos upgraded one downgraded
And top lot topic like neural network even worth adding list No unambiguous Yes today
In I taking SATs applying college
Today I really far career landscape changed substantially many previously impractical academic topic widely used industry
I probably twice much time end career
After reviewing Lampson talk I much optimistic research area yielded much impact yet like capability based computing fancy type system
It seems basically impossible predict area become valuable next thirty year

action practice using something whether original purpose conventional reuse fulfil different function
It distinguished breaking used item make manufacture new product
Reuse taking reprocessing previously used item help save time money energy resource
In broader economic term make quality product available people organization limited mean generating job business activity contribute economy
Historically financial motivation one main driver reuse
In developing world driver lead high level reuse however rising wage consequent consumer demand convenience product made reuse low value item packaging uneconomic richer country leading demise many reuse program
Current environmental awareness gradually changing attitude regulation new packaging regulation gradually beginning reverse situation
One example conventional reuse doorstep delivery refillable example include use plastic box instead box
Reuse certain potential advantage Disadvantages also apparent These service facilitate transaction redistribution unwanted yet perfectly usable material equipment one entity another
The entity benefit either side service donor seller recipient buyer business nonprofit school community group individual
Some maintain physical space reuse center others act matching service virtual exchange
Reuse center generally maintain warehouse truck
They take possession donated material make available redistribution sale
Virtual exchange physical space truck instead allow user post listing material available wanted free low cost online material exchange website
Staff help facilitate exchange material without ever taking possession material
Virtual exchangees include Consumer resource exist exchanging usable material site often grassroots entirely nonprofit movement people giving getting stuff free town
It reuse keeping good stuff landfill
Membership normally free
In addition resource point consumer local national location reuse repurposing material normally accepted program
With technological innovation new application shorter product lifetime ever increasing quantity waste electrical electronic equipment
The environmental pressure associated well documented include material energy loss increase air water land pollution waste treatment method
The incorrect disposal treatment electrical electronic equipment also pose threat human health particularly involving illegal export
One way address increase product longevity either extending product first life addressing issue repair reuse recycling
Reusing product therefore extending use item beyond point discarded first user preferable recycling disposal least energy intensive solution although often overlooked
The EU Circular Economy Package recognises importance extending product lifetime includes repair reuse product action plan ensure product reach optimum lifespan
If target reducing greenhouse gas emission reached reuse need included part whole life cycle approach
A strong second hand exists charity shop high street car boot sale online auction site maintaining popularity regular TV show featuring buying selling auction
Inadequate repair infrastructure However reuse electrical electronic equipment product remains low due inadequate infrastructure lack repair network product
Local authority collection system better suited handling waste handling good preserving reuse potential
Retailer delivery staff trained handle good carefully
So need radical rethink move unwanted still useable item market place
Is case changing approach producer responsibility insisting producer finance collection reuse additionally drive consumer choice reuse repair remanufacture whilst addressing cost recycling disposal
There opportunity producer waste management company local authority make repair reuse habitual whilst require change householder behaviour change raising awareness also require investment infrastructure logistical operation
Is time insist product designed longer lifetime
That disassembled repaired reused recycled
Business model providing opportunity This would necessarily poor strategy business business model provide opportunity retain ownership valuable product component leasing servicing repair
While choice made consumer ultimately determine success venture huge potential reuse good material deliver social economic environmental benefit
The EU Circular Economy Package Scottish Circular Economy Strategy national reuse target set Spanish Government example government recognising good good value mainstream option working towards making reuse easier consumer
In environmental term reuse ought common recycling energy recovery financial environmental cost simple refurbishment product fraction original manufacturing cost
If going serious living Circular Economy need recognise value waste ensure resource kept economy longer slow use valuable raw material ensure product reused material recycled rather landfilled
The involved reuse organization repair overhaul industry take valuable part CRTs refurbish factory environment order meet specification new product
copy machine example refurbishing factory USA
large aircraft remanufacturing factory Singapore recently announced opening tractor refurbishing plant China
Some factory operate competition OEM
When refurbished item resold new label used monitor CRTs made TVs camera resold new label found legal court
When item resold OEM name informally considered gray market item sold used legal represented OEM product eligible considered counterfeit black market
The automobile part industry USA governed law disclosure used part state used required sanitized destroyed
Whether law place protect consumer black market item protect manufacturer hindsight obsolescence often area intense debate
Fuji Photo Film Jazz Photo recent example war patent holder refurbishing factory
To quote District Court New Jersey program offer customer financial incentive return reuse
Although longer common international experience showing still effective way encourage packaging reuse
However financial incentive unless great may le incentive convenience statistic show average milk bottle returned time whereas lemonade bottle deposit returned average time
Refillable bottle used extensively many European country example bottle refillable returned consumer
These system typically supported regulation
Sainsbury Ltd operated cash refund scheme penny back scheme
The scheme reported save tonne plastic per annum
The scheme extended penny back voucher contributed school registered scheme estimate raise saving plastic tonne per annum
In developing nation like India Pakistan cost new bottle often force manufacturer collect refill old glass bottle selling drink
India Pakistan also way reusing old newspaper Kabadiwalas buy reader scrap value reuse packaging recycle
Scrap intermediary help consumer dispose material including metal plastic
These apply primarily item packaging example company involved regular transportation good central manufacturing facility warehouse warehouse retail outlet
In case considerable benefit using reusable transport packaging plastic crate pallet
The benefit reuse primarily due low additional transport cost involved empty lorry returning empty crate
There recent attempt get public join closed loop reuse scheme shopper use reusable plastic basket place carrier bag transporting good home supermarket basket fit specially designed trolley making shopping supposedly easier
There initiative encourage packaging reuse company introducing certain commodity mainly soap powder cleaning fluid content transferred use reusable package kept customer saving packaging passed onto customer lower shelf price
The refill pack reused minimal package carrying product home requires le material one durability feature reclosable top convenient shape etc
required easy use product avoiding transport cost emission returning reusable package factory
Some item clothes child toy often become unwanted wear due change owner need preference reused selling giving new owner
Regiving take place informally family friend neighbour environmental organisation charity give item could afford new
Other organization website new used good offered America school teacher life extended help schoolchildren
The average American example throw away pound used clothing rag
With population approximately million people translates billion pound used clothing textile tossed landfill year
This partly motivated movement whose member promise buy anything new year rely reusing item otherwise would thrown away
Reuse reduces inline program help raise money good cause
Printer reused
They sorted brand model refilled resold back manufacturer
The company refill ink reservoir resell consumer
recycled way ink cartridge using toner instead ink
This method highly efficient energy spent melting recreating cartridge
Repurposing use tool use another tool usually purpose unintended original
Typically repurposing done using item usually considered junk garbage
A good example would style house us tire insulating wall bottle glass wall
Reuse limited repeated us purpose
Examples repurposing include using tire plastic drum composting bin
A virtual exchange facilitates use waste product one process raw material another
As new life reuse finished item avoids environmental cost disposing waste obtaining new raw material may still possible nature process make avoiding production waste recycling back original process impossible
This sort scheme need far broader base currently case requires organization setting waste brokerage list currently available waste quantity available
One problem demand waste known shown material longer waste sellable commodity often price market waste cement kiln dust lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer
In former organic household waste collected used fodder pig
This integrated system made possible state control agriculture complexity continuing market economy German reunification meant system discontinued
The nutrient
nitrogen phosphorus potassium micronutrient organic matter contained excreta traditionally reused agriculture many country still reused agriculture day unfortunately often unregulated unsafe manner
This particularly problem many developing country
Mexico India Bangladesh Ghana untreated poorly treated wastewater used directly agriculture
The WHO Guidelines set framework reuse done safely following multiple barrier approach
Work led better understanding wastewater reuse safely implemented practice
Reuse sanitised excreta agriculture also called closing loop approach sanitation agriculture central approach
Determining balance several effect reuse interact often best accomplished formal
For example research shown reusing product reduce emission carbon footprint relative complete product life cycle
A relatively unknown effective way reduce emission carbon footprint reusing product
Often relative carbon footprint manufacturing unknown
A scientific methodology developed calculate much emission reduced buying used second hand hardware versus new hardware durability greener network calculator
There many way measuring positive environmental economic social impact data
These include A charge item reflects environmental cost manufacture disposal
This make environmental benefit using one reusable item instead many disposable one financial incentive
Such charge introduced country
differs reuse break item raw material used make new item opposed reusing intact item
As extra processing requires energy rule thumb reuse environmentally preferable recycling though recycling significant part play often make use item broken worn otherwise unsuitable reuse
However transport emission significant portion environmental impact reuse recycling case recycling prudent course reuse require long transport distance
A complex may required product design phase determine efficacy reuse recycling neither produce accordingly
Besides physical resource often reused notably software drive computer also explains use every modern device
And proposed way improve education assembling great library shareable reused
Software reuse grew standard library
It main principle today
Instead constantly reinventing software wheel like others building vast collection reusable software object
Reuse information tremendous organization whose translated many language
system store text already translated dozen language retrieval reuse
Reuse older software popular among
Most time used run older software platform
Sometimes older operating system reused computing role demand lot computing power
However widespread availability secondhand computer extreme low price largely supplanted immediate opportunity using DOS repurposing application especially since something like found XP computer

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
Recycling practice reusing item would otherwise discarded waste
Variations recycling include involves adding value item reuse involves breaking item substance component element reuse anything salvaged
alternative approach involves avoiding acquisition unnecessary item would eventually recycled dealt waste
practice reusing distributing reuse electronic equipment component rather discarding end life cycle
Discarded electronics electronic component creating serious problem toxic element involved manufacture
Usually discarded computer electronic device functional could passed another individual organization
Often even device resold donated

also called use existing software knowledge build new software following
code reuse practiced earliest day
Programmers always reused section code template function procedure
Software reuse recognized area study software engineering however date proposed basing software industry reusable component
Code reuse aim save time resource reduce redundancy taking advantage asset already created form within software product development process
The key idea reuse part written one time used construction program written later time
Code reuse may imply creation separately maintained version reusable asset
While code common resource selected reuse asset generated development cycle may offer opportunity reuse software component test suite design documentation
The good example code reuse
Programmers may decide create internal abstraction certain part program reused may create custom library use
Some characteristic make software easily reusable high
For newly written code use piece existing code kind interface mean communication must defined
These commonly include call use
In organization practice formalized standardized also known engineering
The general practice using prior version extant program starting point next version also form code reuse
Some code reuse involves simply copying code existing program new one
While organization realize benefit new product approach subsequently saddled many problem caused
Many researcher worked make reuse faster easier systematic integral part normal process programming
These main goal behind invention became one common form formalized reuse
A somewhat later invention
Another newer mean use software program create new program certain type based set parameter user choose
Fields study system
Concerning motivation driving factor reuse Reuse categorized Concerning form structure reuse code often discouraged form code duplication requires every bug corrected copy enhancement made reused code need manually merged every copy become
However benefit isolation flexibility change reused code easier packaging deployment version management
Systematic software reuse strategy increasing productivity improving quality software industry
Although simple concept successful software reuse implementation difficult practice
A reason put forward dependence software reuse context implemented
Some problematic issue need addressed related systematic software reuse A common example code reuse technique using
Many common operation converting information among different format accessing external storage interfacing external program manipulating information number word name location date etc
common way needed many different program
Authors new program use code software library perform task instead wheel writing fully new code directly program perform operation
Library implementation often benefit covering unusual arcane case
Disadvantages include inability tweak detail may affect performance desired output time cost acquiring learning configuring library
A design pattern general solution recurring problem
Design pattern conceptual tangible modified fit exact need
However abstract class interface reused implement certain pattern
Developers generally reuse large piece software via application framework
Though framework usually applicable family application
In function used many case design pattern framework formerly used
encompasses reuse code simply retro program run older computer
In employed software exploit method
When attacker able directly input code modify control flow program example presence code injection defense redirect control flow code sequence existing memory
Examples attack programming
A component extent represents set collaborative class one class interface
The interface responsible enabling replacement component
Reusable component also isolated synchronized SCM repository using component source code management technology
The whole concept code reuse also encompass engineering application outside software
For instance allows creating reusable design

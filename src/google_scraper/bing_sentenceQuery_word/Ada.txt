language developed early Department manner
Languages Department Defense standard application language include encapsulation feature allow programmer specify rule interaction concurrent procedure task

The early programming language named second Tuesday October become Lovelace Day contribution woman science technology engineering mathematics honoured

December November English writer chiefly known work proposed mechanical computer
She first recognise machine application beyond pure calculation published first intended carried machine
As result often regarded first recognise full potential computing machine first computer
Ada Lovelace legitimate child poet wife Annabella Lady Wentworth
All born wedlock woman
Byron separated wife month Ada born left England forever four month later
He died disease Ada eight year old
Her mother remained bitter promoted Ada interest mathematics logic effort prevent developing father perceived
Despite Ada remained interested Byron upon eventual death buried next request
She often ill childhood
Ada married
King made Earl Lovelace Ada turn became Countess Lovelace
Her educational social exploit brought contact scientist author used education
Ada described approach poetical science Analyst Metaphysician
When teenager mathematical talent led long working relationship friendship fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage also known father computer particular Babbage work Analytical Engine
Lovelace first met June mutual friend private tutor
Between Ada translated article Italian military engineer engine supplemented elaborate set note simply called
These note contain many consider first computer algorithm designed carried machine
Lovelace note important early
She also developed vision capability computer go beyond mere calculating many others including Babbage focused capability
Her mindset poetical science led ask question Analytical Engine shown note examining individual society relate technology collaborative tool
She died age
Byron expected baby glorious boy disappointed wife gave birth girl
Augusta named Byron called Ada Byron
On January Ada mother Annabella Byron behest left parent home taking Ada
Although English law time gave father full custody child case separation Byron made attempt claim parental right request sister keep informed Ada welfare
On April Byron signed Deed Separation although reluctantly left England good day later
Aside acrimonious separation Annabella continually made allegation Byron immoral behaviour throughout life
This set event made Ada famous Victorian society
Byron relationship daughter never saw
He died eight year old
Her mother significant parental figure life
Ada shown family portrait father covered green shroud twentieth birthday
Her mother became Baroness Wentworth right
Annabella close relationship young Ada often left care mother Judith Hon
Lady Milbanke doted grandchild
However societal attitude favoured husband separation welfare child acting present loving mother rest society
This included writing anxious letter Lady Milbanke Ada welfare cover note saying retain letter case use show maternal concern
In one letter Lady Milbanke referred Ada I talk satisfaction shall glad
In teenage year several mother close friend watched Ada sign moral deviation
Ada dubbed observer Furies later complained exaggerated invented story
Ada often ill beginning early childhood
At age eight experienced headache obscured vision
In June paralysed bout
She subjected continuous bed rest nearly year may extended period disability
By able walk crutch
Despite ill Ada developed mathematical technological skill
At age future Lady Fairy Charles Babbage affectionately called decided wanted fly
Ada went project methodically thoughtfully imagination passion
Her first step February construct wing
She investigated different material size
She considered various material wing paper oilsilk wire feather
She examined anatomy bird determine right proportion wing body
She decided write book illustrating plate finding
She decided equipment would need example compass cut across country direct road could surmount mountain river valley
Her final step integrate steam art flying
In early Ada affair tutor caught tried elope
The tutor relative recognised contacted mother
Annabella friend covered incident prevent public scandal
Ada never met younger daughter Lord Byron
Allegra died age five
Ada contact daughter Byron Augusta Leigh purposely avoided Ada much possible introduced Court
Lovelace became close friend tutor introduced Charles Babbage
She strong respect affection Somerville corresponded many year
Other acquaintance included scientist author
She age seventeen became popular belle season part brilliant mind
By Ada regular Court started attending various event
She danced often able charm many people described people dainty although Byron friend described large young woman something friend feature particularly mouth
This description followed meeting February Ada made clear Hobhouse like probably influence mother led dislike father friend
This first impression last later became friend
On July married becoming Lady King
They three home Surrey Scottish estate house London
They spent honeymoon Worthy Manor Ashley Combe near Somerset
The Manor built hunting lodge improved King preparation honeymoon
It later became summer retreat improved time
From family main house Towers rebuilt fashion architect Houses Parliament
They three child born May called Annabella born September born July
Immediately birth Annabella Lady King experienced tedious suffering illness took month cure
Ada descendant extinct husband made Viscount Ockham meaning Ada became Countess Lovelace
In Ada mother assigned teach Ada child act moral instructor Ada
He quickly fell encouraged express frustrated affection claiming marriage meant would never act unbecoming manner
When became clear Carpenter trying start affair Ada cut
In Lovelace daughter Lord Byron Augusta Leigh told Ada mother father also Medora father
On February Ada wrote mother I least
In fact merely I felt scarcely doubt considered improper hint I way suspected
She blame incestuous relationship Byron instead blamed Augusta Leigh I fear inherently wicked ever
In Ada flirted scandal first relaxed relationship men husband led rumour affair secondly love gambling
She apparently lost horse later
The gambling led forming syndicate male friend ambitious attempt create mathematical model successful large bet
This went disastrously wrong leaving thousand pound debt syndicate forcing admit husband
She shadowy relationship Andrew Crosse son John onwards
John Crosse destroyed correspondence death part legal agreement
She bequeathed heirloom father personally left
During final illness would panic idea younger Crosse kept visiting
Throughout illness continued education
Her mother obsession rooting insanity accused Byron one reason Ada taught mathematics early age
She privately schooled mathematics science noted researcher scientific author century
One later tutor mathematician logician
From seventeen mathematical ability began emerge interest mathematics dominated majority adult life
In letter Lady Byron De Morgan suggested daughter skill mathematics could lead become original mathematical investigator perhaps eminence
Lovelace often questioned basic assumption integrating poetry science
While studying wrote De Morgan I may remark curious transformation many formula undergo unsuspected beginner apparently impossible identity form exceedingly dissimilar first sight I think one chief difficulty early part mathematical study
I often reminded certain sprite fairy one read one elbow shape next minute form dissimilar Lovelace believed intuition imagination critical effectively applying mathematical scientific concept
She valued much mathematics viewing tool exploring unseen world around u
Lovelace died age age father died November probably exacerbated physician
The illness lasted several month time Annabella took command Ada saw excluded friend confidant
Under mother influence religious transformation coaxed repenting previous conduct making Annabella executor
She lost contact husband confessed something August caused abandon bedside
What told unknown
She buried request next father Hucknall Nottinghamshire
A memorial plaque Latin father chapel attached Horsley Towers
Throughout life Lovelace strongly interested scientific development fad day including
After work Babbage Lovelace continued work project
In commented friend Woronzow Greig desire create mathematical model brain give rise thought nerve feeling calculus nervous system
She never achieved however
In part interest brain came inherited mother madness
As part research project visited electrical engineer Andrew Crosse learn carry electrical experiment
In year wrote review paper Baron published appear progressed past first draft
In year cancer struck wrote mother mentioning certain production working regarding relation math music
Lovelace first met June mutual friend Mary Somerville
Later month Babbage invited Lovelace see prototype
She became fascinated machine used relationship Somerville visit Babbage often could
Babbage impressed Lovelace intellect analytic skill
He called The Enchantress Number
In wrote Forget world trouble possible multitudinous thing short Enchantress Number
During period Lovelace translated Italian mathematician article Babbage newest proposed machine
With article appended set note
Explaining Analytical Engine function difficult task even many scientist really grasp concept British establishment uninterested
Lovelace note even explain Analytical Engine differed original Difference Engine
Her work well received time scientist described supporter writing
The note around three time longer article include Section G complete detail method calculating sequence Engine could run correctly Babbage Analytical Engine built
Only Difference Engine built completed London
Based work Lovelace widely considered first computer programmer method recognised world first computer program
Section G also contains Lovelace dismissal
She wrote The Analytical Engine pretension whatever anything
It perform
It follow analysis power anticipating analytical relation truth
This objection subject much debate rebuttal example paper
Lovelace Babbage minor falling paper published tried leave statement criticism government treatment Engine unsigned would imply written also
When ruled statement signed Babbage wrote Lovelace asking withdraw paper
This first knew leaving unsigned wrote back refusing withdraw paper
The historian theorised His action suggested enthusiastically sought Ada involvement happily indulged name
Their friendship recovered continued correspond
On August dying cancer Lovelace wrote asking executor though letter give necessary legal authority
Part terrace Worthy Manor known Lovelace Babbage reputed walked discussing mathematical principle
In Babbage invited give seminar Analytical Engine
young Italian engineer future wrote Babbage lecture transcript subsequently published October
Babbage friend commissioned Ada Lovelace translate Menabrea paper English
She augmented paper note added translation
Ada Lovelace spent better part year assisted input Babbage
These note extensive Menabrea paper published Taylor
Ada Lovelace note labelled alphabetically A In note G describes Analytical Engine compute
It considered first published algorithm ever specifically tailored implementation computer Ada Lovelace often cited first computer programmer reason
The engine never completed program never tested
In century death Ada Lovelace note Babbage Analytical Engine republished
The engine recognised early model computer note description computer software
In note Lovelace emphasised difference Analytical Engine previous calculating machine particularly ability programmed solve problem complexity
She realised potential device extended far beyond mere number crunching
In note wrote The Analytical Engine might act upon thing besides object found whose mutual fundamental relation could expressed abstract science operation also susceptible adaptation action operating notation mechanism engine Supposing instance fundamental relation pitched sound science harmony musical composition susceptible expression adaptation engine might compose elaborate scientific piece music degree complexity extent
This analysis important development previous idea capability computing device anticipated implication modern computing one hundred year realised
ascribes Lovelace insight regarding application computing process based logical symbol observation textile When saw mechanical loom used direct weaving beautiful reminded Babbage engine used punched card make calculation
This insight seen significant writer Betty Toole Benjamin Woolley well programmer whose project Plan aim constructing first complete Analytical Engine
According historian computing Babbage specialist Ada saw something Babbage sense failed see
In Babbage world engine bound number What Lovelace Ada Byron number could represent entity quantity
So machine manipulating number number represented thing letter musical note machine could manipulate symbol number one instance according rule
It fundamental transition machine number cruncher machine manipulating symbol according rule fundamental transition calculation looking back present high ground modern computing looking sifting history transition transition made explicitly Ada paper
Though Lovelace referred first computer programmer biographer historian computing claim otherwise
article All one program cited note prepared Babbage three seven year earlier
The exception prepared Babbage although detect
Not evidence Ada ever prepared program Analytical Engine correspondence Babbage show knowledge
Bruce Collier later wrote biography Babbage wrote PhD thesis Lovelace made considerable contribution publicizing Analytical Engine evidence advanced design theory way
Eugene Eric Kim Betty Alexandra Toole consider incorrect regard Lovelace first computer programmer Babbage wrote initial program Analytical Engine although majority never published
Bromley note several dozen sample program prepared Babbage substantially predating Lovelace note
Dorothy Stein regard Lovelace note reflection mathematical uncertainty author political purpose inventor social cultural context written blueprint scientific development
In book defends Lovelace contribution
While acknowledging Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithm Analytical Engine prior Lovelace note Wolfram argues nothing Ada computation Bernoulli number
Babbage certainly helped commented Ada work definitely driver
Wolfram suggests Lovelace main achievement distill Babbage correspondence clear exposition abstract operation Babbage never
specialist known work Babbage analyzed four claim Lovelace lecture Babbage analytical engine According fourth claim substance
He explained Ada promising beginner instead genius mathematics began studying basic concept mathematics five year Babbage conceived analytical engine could made important contribution published first computer program instead actually writing
But agrees Ada person see potential analytical engine machine capable expressing entity quantity
Lovelace portrayed play novel film novel featured unseen character whose personality forcefully depicted annotation effort archive father lost novel

extended language
It language support extremely strong typing explicit concurrency offering task synchronous message passing protected object
Ada improves code safety maintainability using compiler find error favor runtime error
Ada international standard current version known Ada defined
Ada originally designed team led contract DoD supersede programming language used DoD time
Ada named credited first computer programmer
Ada originally targeted system
The Ada revision designed improved support system numerical financial OOP
Features Ada include package synchronous nondeterministic
Ada added support including
The syntax Ada minimizes choice way perform basic operation prefers English keywords else symbol
Ada us basic arithmetical operator avoids using symbol
Code block delimited word declare begin end end case followed identifier block close
In case conditional block avoids could pair wrong nested language like C Java
Ada designed development large software system
Ada package compiled separately
Ada package specification package interface also compiled separately without implementation check consistency
This make possible detect problem early design phase implementation start
A large number check supported help avoid bug would detectable language would require explicit check added source code
For example syntax requires explicitly named closing block prevent error due mismatched end token
The adherence strong typing allows detection many common software error wrong parameter range violation invalid reference mismatched type etc
either otherwise
As concurrency part language specification compiler case detect potential deadlock
Compilers also commonly check misspelled identifier visibility package redundant declaration etc
provide warning useful suggestion fix error
Ada also support check protect access unallocated memory error range violation array access error detectable bug
These check disabled interest runtime efficiency often compiled efficiently
It also includes facility help program verification
For reason Ada widely used critical system might lead serious consequence accidental death injury severe financial loss
Examples system Ada used include railway banking military space technology
Ada dynamic
Ada generic untyped implicitly declare pointer type
Instead dynamic memory allocation deallocation must take place explicitly declared
Each access type associated handle detail memory management programmer either use default storage pool define new one particularly relevant
It even possible declare several different access type designate type use different storage pool
Also language provides compile time run time ensures outlive type object point
Though semantics language allow automatic inaccessible object implementation support default would cause unpredictable behaviour system
Ada support limited form also creative use storage pool provide limited form automatic garbage collection since destroying storage pool also destroys object pool
Ada designed resemble English language syntax resembling denotes comment text
Comments stop end line danger unclosed comment accidentally voiding whole section source code
Prefixing line column skip code clearly denoted column repeated page
There limit nesting comment thereby allowing prior code section even larger section
All character allowed comment symbolic formula E
To compiler treated allowing continued parsing language
The semicolon null statement
A single without statement terminate allowed
Unlike standard Ada language definition known sometimes
Thus common reference Ada programmer programmer implementing Ada compiler
Apart reference manual also extensive rationale document explains language design use various language construct
This document also widely used programmer
When language revised new rationale document written
One notable tool used many Ada programmer aid writing Ada source code
In DoD concerned number different programming language used embedded computer system project many obsolete none supported safe modular programming
In HOLWG formed intent reduce number finding creating programming language generally suitable department requirement
After many iteration beginning original eventual programming language named Ada
The total number programming language use project fell
The HOLWG working group crafted series document stating requirement felt programming language satisfy
Many existing language formally reviewed team concluded existing language met specification
Requests proposal new programming language issued four contractor hired develop proposal name Red led Benjamin Brosgol Green led Blue led John Goodenough Yellow led Jay Spitzen
In April public scrutiny Red Green proposal passed next phase
In May Green proposal designed Jean Ichbiah CII Honeywell Bull chosen given name
This proposal influenced programming language Ichbiah group developed
The preliminary Ada reference manual published ACM SIGPLAN Notices June
The Military Standard reference manual approved December birthday given number honor Ada Lovelace birth year
In took advantage speech criticize Ada overly complex hence unreliable subsequently seemed recant foreword wrote Ada textbook
Ada attracted much attention programming community whole early day
Its backer others predicted might become dominant language general purpose programming work
Ichbiah publicly stated within ten year two programming language would remain Ada
Early Ada compiler struggled implement large complex language performance tended slow tool primitive
Compiler vendor expended effort passing massive ACVC validation suite required another novel feature Ada language effort
The first validated Ada implementation NYU translator certified April
NYU implemented set language
A number commercial company began offering Ada compiler associated development tool including others
In US Department Defense began require use Ada software though exception rule often granted
The Department Defense Ada mandate effectively removed DoD began embrace technology
Similar requirement existed country Ada required NATO system involving command control function Ada mandated preferred language application country Sweden Germany Canada
By late early Ada compiler improved performance still barrier full exploitation Ada ability including tasking model different programmer used
Because Ada support feature used military application also commercial project software bug severe consequence commercial rocket space system railway transport banking
For example system software written Ada
Developed collaboration consultant became arguably Ada project civilian military
The Canadian Automated Air Traffic System written million line Ada count
It featured advanced distributed processing distributed Ada database design
Ada also used air traffic system UK Interim Future Area Control Tools Support iFACTS air traffic control system designed implemented using Ada
It also used system rail system metro suburban train Paris London Hong Kong New York City
The language became standard without change became
This version language commonly known Ada date adoption ANSI sometimes referred also Ada date adoption ISO
Ada joint standard published February making Ada first ISO standard programming language
To help standard revision future acceptance funded development
Presently GNAT Compiler part
Work continued improving updating technical content Ada programming language
A Technical Corrigendum Ada published October major Amendment published March
At conference Stockholm Ada Resource Association ARA announced completion design latest version Ada programming language submission reference manual International Organization Standardization ISO approval
published December
Other related standard include
Ada programming language featuring control structure reserved word
However Ada also many data structuring facility abstraction included original
Such construct part inherited inspired
A common example language This program compiled using freely available open source compiler executing Ada type system based set predefined allows user declare type
This declaration turn based internal representation type describing goal achieved
This allows compiler determine suitable memory size type check violation type definition compile time run time range violation buffer overrun type consistency etc
Ada support numerical type defined range modulo type aggregate type record array enumeration type
Access type define reference instance specified type untyped pointer permitted
Special type provided language task type protected type
For example date might represented Types refined declaring subtypes Types modifier etc
Private type accessed limited type modified copied within scope package defines
Ada add additional feature extension type
Ada language meaning flow control structured standard statement
All standard construct deep level early exit supported use also supported command seldom needed
Among part Ada program package procedure function
Example Package specification Package body This program compiled using freely available open source compiler executing Packages procedure function nest depth also logical outermost block
Each package procedure function declaration constant type variable procedure function package declared order
Ada language support concurrency
The fundamental concurrent unit Ada limited type
Tasks specified two part task declaration defines task interface similar type declaration task body specifies implementation task
Depending implementation Ada task either mapped operating system thread process scheduled internally Ada runtime
Tasks entry synchronisation form
Task entry declared task specification
Each task entry one statement within task body
If control flow task reach accept statement task blocked corresponding entry called another task similarly calling task blocked called task reach corresponding accept statement
Task entry parameter similar procedure allowing task synchronously exchange data
In conjunction statement possible define accept statement similar Dijkstra
Ada also offer
Protected object construct use guard instead conditional variable signaling similar conditional critical region
Protected object combine data encapsulation safe mutual exclusion monitor entry guard conditional critical region
The main advantage classical monitor conditional variable required signaling avoiding potential deadlock due incorrect locking semantics
Like task protected object limited type also declaration part body
A protected object consists encapsulated private data accessed within protected object procedure function entry guaranteed mutually exclusive exception function required side effect free therefore run concurrently function
A task calling protected object blocked another task currently executing inside protected object released task leaf protected object
Blocked task queued protected object ordered time arrival
Protected object entry similar procedure additionally
If guard evaluates false calling task blocked added queue entry another task admitted protected object task currently executing inside protected object
Guards whenever task leaf protected object time evaluation guard changed
Calls entry entry signature
A task requeued blocked added queue target entry mean protected object released allows admission another task
The statement Ada used implement entry call accepts selection entry also guard abort
The following example illustrates concept concurrent programming Ada
A pragma conveys information compiler allow specific manipulation compiled output
Certain pragmas built language
Examples common usage compiler pragmas would disable certain feature type checking array subscript boundary checking instruct compiler insert object code lieu function call inline function
The SPARK language consists robust safer subset Ada language us contract describe specification component form suitable static dynamic verification
In contract encoded Ada comment ignored standard Ada compiler processed SPARK Examiner associated tool
SPARK contrast us Ada aspect syntax express contract bringing core language
The main tool SPARK GNATprove based infrastructure almost entirety GNAT Ada

called world first computer programmer
What write world first machine algorithm early computing machine existed paper
Of course someone first Lovelace woman
Lovelace brilliant mathematician thanks part opportunity denied woman time
Ada Byron teenager met Cambridge mathematics professor Charles Babbage invented mechanical computer designed produce mathematical table automatically
Babbage never built actual machine due personal setback financing difficulty
By moved design first general purpose computer used punch card input output
This machine also lacked financing never built
Babbage Difference Engine worked
Babbage impressed brilliant young woman corresponded year discussing math computing developed Analytical Engine
In Babbage gave lecture engine University Turin
Luigi Menabrea mathematician future Italian prime minister transcribed lecture French
Ada late known Countess Lovelace commissioned translate transcript English
Lovelace added note lecture ended three time long actual transcript

Lovelace note made clear understood Analytical Engine well Babbage furthermore understood make thing computer
She suggested data input would program machine calculate Bernoulli number considered first computer program
But Lovelace visionary understood number could used machine could manipulate number could made manipulate
She predicted machine like Analytical Engine could used
Of course came another year
Babbage impressed Lovelace contribution dubbed How young woman get opportunity show world talent century
Mathematical intelligence thing Ada Lovelace going
Her potential intelligence probably came genetically daughter poet first wife
Both privileged member aristocracy gifted well educated
The marriage broke shortly Ada born
Lady Byron studied literature science philosophy unusual woman mathematics determined Ada follow father footstep
Instead art literature Ada tutored mathematics science
Ada excelled study interest wide ranging
Ada became baroness married William King Baron King two three child
In became Countess Lovelace husband elevated Earl Lovelace
Her pedigree peerage alone would landed Lovelace history book accomplishment mathematics made pioneer computing woman science
Lovelace died cancer
More year later remember contribution science engineering celebration October

After country surrendered United States former Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo pretty rough go thing
A failed suicide attempt left stomach mangled tried shoot heart missed recover Tokyo jail awaited trial war crime
While imprisoned became butt prank left secret message drilled top set false teeth right tip tongue Remember Pearl Harbor
The message put dental prosthetics officer Navy named Jack Mallory
Mallory assigned Station Hospital Tokyo responsible nearby Sugamo Prison Tojo held
Just one month arriving Japan Mallory handed stupefying assignment The architect Japan war needed denture Mallory make
Jack Mallory roommate dentist name George Foster called Sugamo Prison examine Tojo whose teeth decaying crumbling gum
I knew I going meet evil man Mallory
It shock see
He humble meek little Tojo requested denture could speak upcoming trial
He knew execution foregone conclusion Mallory suggested get full set false teeth Tojo declined asked top needing long want waste anybody time
Word assignment got Mallory colleague hospital egged use opportunity pull legendary prank
He wanted inscribe Remember Pearl Harbor denture knew conspicuous message would caught easily
He decided use Morse code instead drilled sentence row false teeth series dot dash
Mallory Foster always referred prank much
I figured duty carry assignment Foster recalled
But mean I fun It anything done anger Mallory It many people chance get word The prank meant kept secret though news got someone dental service blabbed letter home story traveled fast even found way onto Texas radio broadcast
With news deed bouncing back around Tokyo Mallory confessed supervisor thing could get hand
That funny hell Mallory recalled told could get ass kicked His supervisor ordered men undo prank immediately
Late one evening February three month first inscribing Remember Pearl Harbor Morse code false Foster paid visit Tojo cell asked guard wake
They needed perform emergency work denture said Mallory swiftly discretely ground hidden message Tojo teeth
All report indicate Tojo never knew ever
The next morning supremely colonel called Mallory Foster ask prank
With evidence inside Tojo mouth ground sluiced away young dentist able soundly deny everything
Jack Mallory returned United States set dental practice California ran decade
Before left Tokyo however spent day sitting Hideki Tojo trial
As Mallory recalled former patient recognized inside courtroom smiled pointed teeth bowed toward thanks
Tojo able speak trial took responsibility Japan action war
He found guilty hanged December
Jack Mallory passed away age

Have heard Ada Lovelace yet
When one spent fifteen year I thinking Ada probably day certainly every week easy imagine everybody else heard
But fact though Ada better known u today short lifetime still many people heard
Indeed I sure people
But Ada really someone ought consider adding repertoire people past worth knowing
There sense externally life especially interesting despite unusual nature origin Lord Byron legitimate daughter
She born comparative poverty time Lord Byron wife Lady Byron formerly Annabella Milbanke permanently debt dowry promised Byron Annabella father materialize
After year living Byron Ada mother could stand debt infidelity erratic even often crazy behavior anymore fled early one morning taking infant Ada born December
Ada one month five day old Lady Byron left husband
Although talk couple reconciled fact Byron never saw Ada wife
He died eight year later exile Greece trying hard encourage support Greek assault Turks win Greek freedom
Ada brought rigorous education supplied mother within year Ada birth independently wealthy
Ada went get married rather ineffectual handsome kind man Lord Lovelace derives name Ada Lovelace nowadays called rather Ada Byron
She three child relatively good devoted mother
In several year ill health couple year often terrible pain died dreadfully painful death uterine cancer
A fairly typical life aristocratic woman life ended soon face contain much sense achievement
Except really superficial take Ada
The truth matter fascinatingly imaginative intellectually unusual woman
Her education largely mathematical partly mother anxious Ada would follow Lady Byron regarded Lord Byron excessively imaginative footstep Lady Byron encouraged tutor hired Ada use mathematics suppress Ada imagination
But vain Ada twelve thirteen year old made meticulous plan build large pair wing try fly
It perhaps well posterity Lady Byron got know plan forbade Ada taking fortuitous posterity life nineteenth century aviator often brought abrupt halt nasty accident
Undaunted Ada seventeen year old became good friend eccentric undoubtedly brilliant English mathematician inventor called Charles Babbage
He year senior met party London June
It known talked met ala clear Ada fascinated start Babbage attempt build calculating machine called Difference Engine cogwheel
The following year Babbage started work even ambitious type cogwheel calculator christened Analytical Engine
It made use punched card many feature modern computer
In fact neither Difference Engine Analytical Engine completed Babbage lifetime although successful modern project build Difference Engine using material level precision Babbage could achieved
The machine worked perfectly today two working model world thereby vindicating Babbage dream machine could built
However Analytical Engine built far may well never
Even Babbage plan detailed unquestionably show trying build digital computer
Ada became deeply interested Babbage work translated original French paper written Analytical Engine Italian scientist day French European language science whatever nationality writer
Perhaps fascinating thing Ada penned lengthy essay Babbage Analytical Engine appended translation
It actually much longer translation around twenty thousand word essentially constitutes short book one exciting document sparse prehistory computer
What I found interesting research Ada beyond dispute nowadays although twenty year male computer scientist avoided accepting Ada insight Analytical Engine even Babbage
Ada saw machine fact machine could used govern sort process including exceptionally music
In paper includes succinct description Analytical Engine would process music essentially exactly modern digital friend carry pocket briefcase u whenever want listen music
Babbage though never saw Analytical Engine anything machine making calculation
Ada vision really vision went far beyond Babbage could see
Ada called thinking mathematical scientific subject science seems meant science infused imagination
Of course today computer manufacturer smartphone manufacturer sell product million highly competitive marketplace bring imagination much service computer used promoted function offer user
But Ada breaking virgin ground writing Analytical Engine
Ada also realized Babbage could irascible first ever biography called The Irascible Genius grumpy indifferent agenda others put mildly diplomatic man
Ada offered help management aspect attempt put together project build Analytical Engine
But sadly Babbage obtuse possibly particular occasion arrogant realize great asset help could
He abruptly rejected offer help
All friendship strong enough survive rejection upset Ada felt afterwards
Ada amazing vision future computing
She also wrote many way seen world first computer program although depends actually mean computer program basically Ada algorithm computer program describes Notes Analytical Engine would able carry particular mathematical function
Ada indeed amazing
Yet aristocratic Victorian housewife whose achievement writing essay known today Ada Notes almost completely forgotten around
With one notable exception British computer pioneer Alan Turing aware work
The Babbage work rediscovered new spotlight put Ada work today seen one insightful visionary woman history science
What Ada referred fondly science made one woman nineteenth century time

Read company newsletter Featured Project Learn different version GNAT get started Ada Ada modern programming language designed large application embedded system particular reliability efficiency essential
It originally developed early version generally known Ada team led Jean Ichbiah France
The language revised enhanced upward compatible fashion early leadership Tucker Taft Intermetrics
The resulting language Ada first internationally standardized ISO Language
Under auspex ISO minor revision known Ada completed amendment standard
The recent version language standard Ada introduced full support programming including subprogram postconditions among feature
The name Ada acronym chosen honor Augusta Ada Lovelace mathematician sometimes regarded world first programmer work Charles Babbage
She also daughter poet Lord Byron
Ada seeing significant usage worldwide domain including commercial military aircraft avionics air traffic control railroad system medical device
With embodiment modern software engineering principle Ada excellent teaching language introductory advanced computer science course subject significant university research especially area technology
AdaCore long history close connection Ada programming language
Company member worked original Ada design review played key role Ada project well subsequent revision language standard continue deeply involved language maintenance standardization process
The initial GNAT compiler essential growth Ada delivered time language standardization thus guaranteeing user would quality implementation transitioning Ada Ada language
Ada
From one perspective classical language tied specific development methodology
It simple syntax structured control statement flexible data composition facility strong type checking traditional feature code modularization subprogram mechanism detecting responding exceptional condition exception handling
Unlike language based C syntax Java C Ada allows programmer simply explicitly specify range value permitted variable scalar type integer enumeration type
The attempted assignment value cause error
The ability specify range contraints make programmer intent explicit make easier detect major source coding user input error
The original Ada design introduced package construct feature support encapsulation information hiding modularization allows developer control namespace accessible within given compilation unit
Ada introduced concept child unit adding considerably flexibility easing design large system
Ada extended language modularization facility allowing mutual reference package specification thus making easier interface language Java
A key reusable component mechanism parameterizing module respect data type program entity example stack package arbitrary element type
Ada meet requirement facility known generic since parameterization done compile time performance penalized
Ada allowing partitioning system module corresponding abstract data type abstract object
Full OOP support provided since first seemed required domain Ada primary target second apparent need automatic garbage collection OO language would interfered predictable efficient performance
However large system often component GUIs constraint could effectively developed using OOP feature
In part reason Ada supply comprehensive support OOP tagged type facility class polymorphism inheritance dynamic binding
Ada require automatic garbage collection rather supply definitional feature allowing developer supply storage reclamation operation finalization
Ada provided additional OOP feature including interface traditional operation invocation notation
Ada methologically neutral impose distributed overhead OOP
If application need OOP OOP feature used penalty
Ada supply structured facility concurrency
The unit concurrency program entity known Tasks communicate implicitly via shared data explicitly via synchronous control mechanism known rendezvous
A shared data item defined abstractly protected object feature introduced Ada operation executed mutual exclusion invoked multiple task
Asynchronous task interaction also supported specifically timeouts task termination
Such asynchronous behavior deferred certain operation prevent possibility leaving shared data inconsistent state
Mechanisms designed help take advantage architecture added Ada
Both core language Systems Programming Annex Ada supply necessary feature allow programmer get close hardware
For example specify bit layout field record define alignment size place data specific machine address express specialized code sequence assembly language
You also write interrupt handler Ada using protected type facility
Ada tasking feature allow express common idiom periodic task task Annex provides several facility allow avoid unbounded priority inversion
A protected object locking policy defined us priority ceiling especially efficient implementation Ada mutexes required since protected operation allowed block
Ada defined task dispatching policy basically requires task run blocked preempted
Subsequent revision introduced several task dispatching policy well support multicore architecture
With emphasis sound software engineering principle Ada support development application including need certified safety standard security standard Common Criteria
For example strong typing mean data intended one purpose accessed via inappropriate operation error treating pointer integer vice versa prevented
And Ada array bound checking prevents buffer overrun vulnerability common C
However full language inappropriate application since generality flexibility may interfere traceability certification requirement
Ada address issue supplying compiler directive pragma Restrictions allows constrain language feature subset example excluding dynamic OOP facility
The evolution Ada seen continued increase support application
Ada standardized Ravenscar Profile collection concurrency feature powerful enough programming simple enough make certification practical
Ada introduced facility adding invariant program
These serve checking input static analysis tool allow formal verification combined traditional testing
Such hybrid verification formal proof performed using SPARK language technology practical way realize benefit formal method incrementally critical component application
In brief Ada internationally standardized language combining programming feature concurrency facility support reliability
An appropriate tool addressing real issue facing software developer today Ada used throughout number major industry design software protects business life

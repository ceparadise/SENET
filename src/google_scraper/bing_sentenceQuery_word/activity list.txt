Student learning depth student knowledge increase active learning method employed classroom
Active learning strategy discussed general computer science course work used theory computation course
Difficulties active learning technique dealing also presented
Active learning get student involved activity classroom rather passively listening lecture
This activity reading writing discussing solving problem responding question require factual answer
The idea get student thinking material
This important student passive decline concentration minute minute lecture act learning passive
As faculty learn actively
In preparing lecture note read compare read experience synthesize information coherent note develop example illustrate concept
This lead greater understanding material
Unfortunately use understanding lecture student depriving journey discovery
By carefully involving student path knowledge increase student depth understanding material increase student comfort material improve student confidence
In science value active learning already realized implemented laboratory computer science programming project
The idea present expand include activity classroom replace part lecture
If active learning successful used frequently
This perception active learning higher risk
There fear content taken put active learning preparation time higher active learning appropriate large class
Perhaps largest fear giving control classroom lecture let professor decide say student centered activity may raise question professor planning discus
These fear real surmountable
To cover content give student responsibility learning factual material apply classroom discussion
I student write course evaluation need read book class lecture would tell needed know chapter
If student believe hear lecture similar text material willing read text
For faculty class note year year developing active learning strategy take time pulling note filing cabinet
In field rapidly changing computer science note need done frequently enough great concern
Further develop idea active learning find applied across number different course
Active learning strategy allow control level risk
By selecting short highly structured activity level risk fairly low
Involving student asking series question current topic allows teacher control direction content discussion still make student active
Breaking student small group letting independently solve problem much higher risk prove highly rewarding
As mentioned strategy active learning equally valid many computer science course
This section describe generic technique active learning computer science
The next section show application technique theory computation course
As mentioned student attention begin decline minute lecture
Further lecture something catch attention causing u miss part next point
A strategy handle lecture minute take minute break
During break student discus note person next filling gap correcting misunderstanding
Alternatively activity lead discussion would pose question employ technique
In technique question posed student individually write answer within one two minute time limit
Each student pair person next discus answer possibly developing new one
The instructor start discussion next lecture topic asking pair share answer class
In computer science class could pose question like What happen I change input
What could happen I include conditional check
Why important reduce number operation sorting algorithm
Why four condition necessary deadlock occur If professor computer classroom question relate structure algorithm behavior answer tested real time
Even better student computer hand group get together try solution
In later case instructor must careful student think answer first activity degrade hacking session
Instead tracing execution algorithm lecture break student group trace algorithm
For example compare sorting algorithm break class group four student
Assign one student algorithm tracer one keep track variable value another record number performed last record change list
By providing team transparency marker team easily display answer rest class
By running implementation algorithm group result quickly compared actual answer In classroom projection unit connected computer system running demonstration software professor powerful tool student interact idea computer science
By dividing student group ask predict happen output based change input set also allows student formulate question trying understand idea
For example student trying understand nature recursive algorithm see effect input large amount software type developed number area computer science
This readily available internet
Role playing powerful tool computer science classroom
To student understand network protocol could class passing ball around discussion letting student talk ball
Students experience first hand operation Token Passing Protocols
Similar activity could used simulate flow information circuit student chip passing information back forth execution parallel algorithm group different part simultaneously recently used activity type illustrate concept object class introductory programming class
In class I used paper bag represent object private data inside bag
Students class given code fragment representing class method well main program used class
We executed code constructor function getting new bag object create bag object moving around room opened class method
This clearly illustrated student action class method relationship method private data
I teaching theory computation number year upper undergraduate level sophomore year
Our student taken theory computation first semester sophomore year completed one semester computer science overview course
They take hour C programming course concurrently theory computation
The purpose theory course introduce student finite state machine regular expression grammar Turing Machines limit computing
At sophomore level course practically oriented proof past three offering course I used three different teaching style
For Fall course taught typical lecture style presentation
Students regular homework assignment took three semester exam final Fall course different look
Students assigned group three static entire semester
For information using group work see
Class time broken two minute followed minute group problem solving exercise classroom
One group would present solution class
There regular homework assignment done group
These exercise homework taken directly problem text
Students still took three semester exam individually group also reworked exam weekend turned group solution
So student took exam twice alone Fall course became combination two previous offering
Because fear group working effectively enough learn material classroom became closer lecture hall
I keep active learning asking question lead student solving problem
However student longer group exercise classroom though continued work homework exam group outside class
When I decided implement active learning class I wanted way checking see benefit student
The active learning literature example said would positive effect I wanted test
There numerous study large student population show positive influence student grade active learning employed
Even though class small I wanted test see I would find similar I distribute copy final exam since cumulative entire semester I thought could mechanism test student done various technique
So three semester mentioned I used exact final exam
I also collected information grade point average GPA college level course work student completed starting course
There student transferred institution institution
They excluded study reliable grade point average information avoid difference grading scheme likely exam graded three year period exam duplicated regraded
Exams three class mixed together regrading help eliminate unconscious biasing result
Further I developed five point scale question used take difference point level different question
The general meaning point value given table
After excluding transfer student established GPA sample student involved study small Fall Fall Fall
The result ANOVA single factor analysis class GPA class exam score showed significant difference GPAs student three class significant difference exam score table
Students class Fall many Fall active learning technique used performed better final exam
In order ass strength effect variable correlation matrix calculated
Since exam score second year higher third class renumbered correlation variable Fall Fall Fall
The correlation GPA final exam score p
The correlation GPA class indicates independence GPA class assignment
The correlation class exam score p
Thus correlation class exam score confounded assignment student different GPAs different summary student sample three offering course significantly differ ability base entering GPA
This important expected result show student higher GPAs perform better exam
Since class similar GPA distribution difference student ability could skewed result
The important point however student course active learning better
Further addition significant group activity classroom Fall Fall seemed help much le noticeable amount
Based experience I appreciate need balance instructor presentation student activity
It seems lecture necessary discus thing instructor view critical difficult understand
It also important however activity get student active active learning technique risky faculty risk minimized choosing short well structured activity
As comfort level active learning increase riskier strategy tried
Though loss control scary first I found invigorated look forward challenge active reality today higher education United States student seem interested learning
By employing active learning strategy student learn content process well
This make better student later course better professional finishing degree
I would like thank Frank Dinan support effort active learning
I would also like thank Fred Dansereau help statistical analysis result

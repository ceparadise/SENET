Computer architecture specification detailing set software hardware technology standard interact form computer system platform
In short computer architecture refers computer system designed technology compatible
As context meaning word architecture computer architecture likened art determining need creating logical design standard based requirement
A good example computer architecture von Neumann architecture still used type computer today
This proposed mathematician John von Neumann
It describes design electronic computer CPU includes arithmetic logic unit control unit register memory data instruction interface external storage function
There three category computer architecture Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

In set rule method describe functionality organization implementation computer system
Some definition architecture define describing capability programming model computer particular implementation
In definition computer architecture involves design design
The first documented computer architecture correspondence describing
When building computer described two patent application future project machine instruction could stored storage used data
concept
Two early important example The term architecture computer literature traced work Lyle Johnson Mohammad Usman Khan member Machine Organization department IBM main research center
Johnson opportunity write proprietary research communication time known Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
To describe level detail discussing luxuriously embellished computer noted description format instruction type hardware parameter speed enhancement level system architecture term seemed useful machine Subsequently Brooks Stretch designer started Chapter book Planning Computer System Project Stretch ed
Buchholz writing Computer architecture like architecture art determining need user structure designing meet need effectively possible within economic technological constraint
Brooks went help develop called line computer architecture became noun defining user need know
Later computer user came use term many way
The earliest computer architecture designed paper directly built final hardware form
Later computer architecture prototype physically built form TTL prototype tweaked committing final hardware form
As new computer architecture typically built tested computer architecture inside FPGA committing final hardware form
The discipline computer architecture three main subcategories There type computer architecture
The following type used bigger company like Intel count computer architecture The purpose design computer maximizes performance keeping power consumption check cost low relative amount expected performance also reliable
For many aspect considered includes instruction set design functional organization logic design implementation
The implementation involves integrated circuit design packaging power cooling
Optimization design requires familiarity compiler operating system logic design packaging
An instruction set architecture ISA interface computer software hardware also viewed programmer view machine
Computers understand Java programming language used
A processor understands instruction encoded numerical fashion usually
Software tool translate high level language instruction processor understand
Besides instruction ISA defines item computer available
memory
Instructions locate available item register index name memory addressing mode
The ISA computer usually described small instruction manual describes instruction encoded
Also may define short vaguely mnemonic name instruction
The name recognized software development tool called
An assembler computer program translates form ISA form
also widely available usually software program isolate correct malfunction binary computer program
ISAs vary quality completeness
A good ISA compromise programmer convenience easy code understand size code much code required specific action cost computer interpret instruction complexity mean space needed disassemble instruction speed computer larger disassemblers come longer disassemble time
For example ISAs like ISA subtracts one value value zero value return higher value inexpensive fast however ISAs like convenient helpful looking size ISA
Memory organization defines instruction interact memory memory interacts
During design software emulator run program written proposed instruction set
Modern emulator measure size cost speed determine particular ISA meeting goal
Computer organization help optimize product
For example software engineer need know processing power processor
They may need optimize software order gain performance lowest price
This require quite detailed analysis computer organization
For example SD card designer might need arrange card data processed fastest possible way
Computer organization also help plan selection processor particular project
Multimedia project may need rapid data access virtual machine may need fast interrupt
Sometimes certain task need additional component well
For example computer capable running virtual machine need hardware memory different virtual computer kept separated
Computer organization feature also affect power consumption processor cost
Once instruction set designed practical machine must developed
This design process called
Implementation usually considered architectural design rather hardware
Implementation broken several step For entire implementation process organized differently often referred
The exact form computer system depends constraint goal
Computer architecture usually trade standard power versus performance cost memory capacity latency amount time take information one node travel source throughput
Sometimes consideration feature size weight reliability expandability also factor
The common scheme depth power analysis figure keep power consumption low maintaining adequate performance
Modern computer performance often described IPC instruction per
This measure efficiency architecture clock frequency
Since faster rate make faster computer useful measurement
Older computer IPC count low
Simple modern processor easily reach near processor may reach three five IPC executing several instruction per clock cycle
Counting machine language instruction would misleading varying amount work different ISAs
The instruction standard measurement count ISA actual machine language instruction unit measurement usually based speed computer architecture
Many people used measure computer speed clock rate usually MHz GHz
This refers cycle per second main clock CPU
However metric somewhat misleading machine higher clock rate may necessarily greater performance
As result manufacturer moved away clock speed measure performance
Other factor influence speed mix speed available memory type order instruction program
There two main type speed latency throughput
Latency time start process completion
Throughput amount work done per unit time
guaranteed maximum response time system electronic event like disk drive finish moving data
Performance affected wide range design choice example processor usually make latency worse make throughput better
Computers control machinery usually need low interrupt latency
These computer operate environment fail operation completed specified amount time
For example brake must begin braking within predictable short time brake pedal sensed else failure brake occur
take factor account measuring time computer take run series test program
Although benchmarking show strength choose computer
Often measured machine split different measure
For example one system might handle scientific application quickly another might render video game smoothly
Furthermore designer may target add special feature product hardware software permit specific benchmark execute quickly offer similar advantage general task
Power efficiency another important measurement modern computer
A higher power efficiency often traded lower speed higher cost
The typical measurement referring power consumption computer architecture million instruction per second per watt
Modern circuit le power required per transistor number transistor per chip grows
This transistor put new chip requires power supply requires new pathway built power
However number transistor per chip starting increase slower rate
Therefore power efficiency starting become important important fitting transistor single chip
Recent processor design shown emphasis put focus power efficiency rather cramming many transistor single chip possible
In world embedded computer power efficiency long important goal next throughput latency
Increases publicly released refresh rate grown slowly past year respect vast leap power consumption reduction miniaturization demand
This led new demand longer battery life reduction size due mobile technology produced greater rate
This change focus greater refresh rate power consumption miniaturization shown significant reduction power consumption much reported Intel release dropped power consumption benchmark watt watt
Comparing processing speed increase GHz GHz seen focus research development shifting away refresh rate moving towards consuming le power taking le space

What architecture
The word many meaning
Architecture art science process result idea reality
People often use word architecture design interchangeably naturally broadens definition architecture
If design career goal architect life
It seems easy answer explore debate many definition architecture design architect social scientist call built environment
Some people think architecture like know see
It seems everyone opinion architecture definition
From Latin word word use describes
The ancient Greek chief builder master technician craftsman artisan
So come first architect architecture
Depending context architecture refer building structure like tower monument building structure important large highly creative carefully designed object chair spoon tea kettle design large area city town park landscape art science designing building building structure object outdoor space building style method process plan organizing space elegant engineering planned design kind system systematic arrangement information idea flow information Web page
In artist Christo implemented idea art installation New York City called placed throughout great landscape architecture erected designed artistic team
Of course Gates art else would
wrote art critic Peter Schjeldahl time
Art used mean painting statue
Now mean practically anything unclassifiable otherwise
pragmatic review called Enough About Art Let Talk About That Price Tag
So design ca classified must art
But expensive create simply art
Depending perspective might use word describe number thing
Which item might called circus tent egg carton roller coaster computer program political campaign The list could go forever
The adjective describe anything related architecture building design
Examples abundant including architectural design architectural style architectural modeling architectural detail architectural engineering architectural software architectural historian architectural history architectural research architectural study architectural heritage architectural tradition architectural lighting architectural product Also word describe object strong shape beautiful architectural vase architectural sculpture architectural rock formation architectural drapery
Perhaps use word muddied water defining architecture
The land simplest form architecture wrote American architect implying built environment exclusively
If true bird bee builder natural habitat considered structure architecture
Architect journalist Roger Lewis b
writes society tend value structure transcends service functional performance mere building
Great architecture writes Lewis always represented responsible construction durable shelter
Artfulness form artistry building long dominant standard measuring extent human made artifact transformed profane sacred
Frank Lloyd Wright claim artistry beauty come human spirit
Mere building may know Wright wrote
And well say spirit thing essential life thing truth
To Wright thinking beaver dam beehive bird nest may beautiful lower form architecture great fact architecture simply higher type expression nature way human nature human being concerned
The spirit man enters making whole godlike reflection creator
Architecture art bridging humanity science say American architect Steven Holl b

We work line sculpture poetry music science coalesce Architecture
Since licensing architect professional defined
This stopped anyone everyone else opinion one architecture definition

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I looking appropriate term call proposal
I knew either platform architecture
But could simply clearly distinguish academic manner
So I searched web literature found definition architecture platform follows sound logical
However still clear difference
I guess researcher often use two term interchangeably marginal consideration differentiation
Looking definition I figured architecture likely specifies structural property system usually try describe structure system consisting component relationship
Using architecture developer produce system work according architecture
However platform trying specify structural behavioural attribute system describing subsystem relationship
Platform also provides abstract developer create new software system rely upon platform
Is interpretation accurate enough
One may argue platform prepared top architecture without architecture one may able propose platform
In idea else difference distinguishing line two term
This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
Architecture generally refers structure organization entire system
Platform generally refers something operating system library programming language programming environment build thing
Disclaimer The folowing answer opinion
It necceseraly true
Sorry bad english
When say architecture primarily mean computer architecture address bit memory define command processor
Examples macro definition window architecture Yes platform architecture marginally used interchangeably When say platform mean computer platfrom deal system software eg
operating system
Examples macro definition window platform So architecture lower level concept platform
On top architecture implement platform eg
POSIX
And top platform build application
By posting answer agree

In particular way organizing storing computer accessed modified
More precisely data structure collection data value relationship among function operation applied data
Data structure implement one particular ADT specify operation performed data structure operation
In comparison data structure concrete implementation space provided ADT
Different kind data structure suited different kind application highly specialized specific task
For example relational database commonly use index data retrieval implementation usually use look identifier
Data structure provide mean manage large amount data efficiently us large
Usually efficient data structure key designing efficient
Some formal design method emphasize data structure rather algorithm key organizing factor software design
Data structure used organize storage retrieval information stored
Data structure generally based ability computer fetch store data place memory specified bit string representing stored memory manipulated program
Thus data structure based computing address data item based storing address data item within structure
Many data structure use principle sometimes combined way
The implementation data structure usually requires writing set create manipulate instance structure
The efficiency data structure analyzed separately operation
This observation motivates theoretical concept data structure defined indirectly operation may performed mathematical property operation including space time cost
There numerous type data structure generally built upon simpler Most language Basic Combined Programming Language lack support data structure
On hand many assembly language special syntax support certain data structure record array
For example direct descendant BCPL language support record respectively addition vector array
Most programming language feature sort mechanism allows data structure implementation reused different program
Modern language usually come standard library implement common data structure
Examples
Modern language also generally support separation library module implementation
Some provide allow client hide implementation detail
typically use purpose
Many known data structure version allow multiple computing thread access single concrete instance data structure simultaneously

The concept linking separate piece code important since allowed library program built carry common first step toward increasingly emphasized notion software reuse
Assembly language found sufficiently inconvenient language closer natural language invented easier faster programming along came need compiler program translate language program machine code
As programming language became powerful abstract building efficient compiler create code term execution speed storage became interesting computer science problem
Increasing use computer early provided development consist software automatically handle input output execution job
The historical development operating system summarized topic

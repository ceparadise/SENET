In confused act mechanism combine simple build complicated one
Like usual result function passed argument next result last one result whole
Programmers frequently apply function result function almost programming language allow
In case composition function interesting function right used later
Such function always defined language make easier
The ability easily compose function encourages breaking apart maintainability
More generally big system might built composing whole program
Narrowly speaking function composition applies function operate finite amount data step sequentially processing handing next
Functions operate potentially infinite data known instead connected analogous function composition execute
For example suppose two
Composing mean first compute use compute
Here example The step combined give name intermediate result Despite difference length two implementation compute result
The second implementation requires one line code colloquially referred highly composed form
Readability hence maintainability one advantage highly composed form since require fewer line code minimizing program surface area
DeMarco Lister empirically verify inverse relationship surface area maintainability
On hand may possible overuse highly composed form
A nesting many function may opposite effect making code le maintainable
In functional composition even natural performed usually primary method program design
The example Which take whatever stack apply g f leave result stack
See corresponding mathematical notation
Now suppose combination calling f result g frequently useful want name foo use function right
In language define new function implemented composition
Example long form intermediate would work well
Example In language way create new function define program source mean function ca composed
In functional programming language function composition naturally expressed operator
In example given becomes using composition operator
read
The composition operator defined Haskell using The first line describes type
take pair function return function
Note Haskell require specification exact input output type f g relation f must accept g return
This make
operator
Variants especially together treatment function lend extremely well recursive definition compositional operator
like built function composition operator main difference spelled
Also like could define operator
In fact following Perl code used define implementation
In programming language write mechanism perform function composition
In way define composition group function using function use Python In define function take two function f g produce function In define Func take two Funcs f g produce Func Languages like let construct binary operator Notions composition including ubiquitous numerous strand research separately evolved
The following sampling kind research notion composition central
Whole program system treated function readily composed input output allowing easy composition successful become operating system
side effect violate therefore cleanly composable
However consider state world running code input output get clean function
Composition function corresponds running procedure one
The formalism us idea incorporate side effect functional language

Functions procedure summarise set programming instruction
Modules used group function procedure specific purpose
many part
These may include
Each part given name called
Every part must unique identifier
If programmer want create function procedure program part one must also given different identifier
Identifiers made unique two way Identifiers may case meaning throughout whole program meaning everywhere
Or identifier may case meaning within small part program may defined different meaning different place
Identifiers may also case meaning throughout single module file
This allows u use name different place refer different thing
These name actually different identifier even though casual reader might think
We safely divide programming project smaller component programmer writing one component may choose name local component without worrying name chosen programmer writing component

Functions procedure summarise set programming instruction
Modules used group function procedure specific purpose
Computer program consist thousand line code like textbook thousand word
In way textbook divided chapter program divided related functionality using
In textbook specific concept covered basis
Similarly computer program specific functionality divided named
Programs usually integrate block code module already created project
The program us implemented function procedure module
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
BBC Simon Lumb describes function used programming In computer program often section program want repeat
Chunks instruction given name called
Algorithms broken procedure function
This save time call function required instead type whole instruction set
Programming language set also known function procedure
If programmer make one
Functions differ procedure function return value unlike procedure
However passed procedure function
In program drawing shape program could ask user shape draw
The instruction drawing square could captured
The algorithm action could set task If computer program set instruction could given name sequence would executed calling

We seen one function already output message
To use function always write name followed parenthesis
The word basically mean input function
Then function action depending argument
When multiple argument function separate comma
For example give multiple argument print order space separating
We demonstrate example
A function may also give back value like output
For example function short give back largest argument must number
The function friend behaves similarly function return smallest argument
Functions combined create complicated expression
You limited using function Python
In lesson learn define new function
If call function enough argument input many argument get error
For example requires least one input It important carefully read error get back code work
Python usually give helpful feedback went wrong
However sometimes need look around little bit diagnose problem example
Python say syntax error mean ca understand trying This exercise using function

I assignment I write truth table possible unique Boolean function one input I understand exactly I
By teacher say function input must different output
I thought writing truth table NOT since one input I sure
This task simple enough already know exactly function construct truth table write every possible combination assignment variable function x f
If obvious might beneficial walk reasoning might also useful whenever want count enumerate possible function number function bigger function might relatable like example negation function relatable
First count many function
Given set A B function f A B
So since B concerned function f B B function
The next step make truth table
But first let look function A function f X Y subset Cartesian product X Y subject following condition every element X first component one one ordered pair subset
So must find set subject constraint
An example set function S B B since first component two ordered pair ie
value map two different value
Moreover mapping value ie
f undefined
Since dealing domain size two since one one ordered pair member domain set function considering form f either
So list possible enumeration two ordered boolean value put pair second component first component first component respectively Plugging get f x f x f x x f x x As sanity check confirm ended function expected
As truth table array x x x x x array Or B F prefer

also programming concept allows programmer define two function name scope
Each function unique signature header derived Please note Not signature option available programming language
Warning Function overloading often confused function overriding
In Function overloading function different signature created adding pool available function
In function overriding however function signature declared replacing old function context new function
Since function name case must preserve uniqueness signature changing something last three alienee
If function signature sufficiently different compiler distinguish function intended used occurrence
This process searching appropriate function called quite intensive one especially lot equally named function
Programming language supporting implicit type convention usually use promotion argument
type casting integer exact function match
The demotion argument rarely used
When two function match criterion function resolution process reported compiler
Adding information compiler editing source code using example type casting address doubt
The example code show function overloading used
As function practically thing make sense use function overloading
The first code block generate number specified parameter
The appropriate function call The second requires another parameter
Function return number equal lower

A used map arbitrary size data fixed size
The value returned hash function called simply
One use data structure called widely used computer software rapid data lookup
Hash function accelerate table database lookup detecting duplicated record large file
An example finding similar stretch DNA sequence
They also useful
A allows one easily verify input data map given hash value input data unknown deliberately difficult reconstruct equivalent alternative knowing stored hash value
This used assuring transmitted data building block provide
Hash function related often confused code cipher
Although concept overlap extent us requirement designed optimized differently
The Hash Keeper database maintained American National Drug Intelligence Center instance aptly described catalogue file fingerprint hash value
Hash function used quickly locate data record definition given
Specifically hash function used map search key list index give place hash table corresponding record stored
Hash table also used implement
Typically domain hash function set possible key larger range number different table index map several different key index
So slot hash table associated implicitly explicitly record rather single record
For reason slot hash table often called hash value also called
Thus hash function hint record location
Still table good hash function typically narrow search one two entry
People write complete hash table implementation choose specific hash independently choose collision resolution
Hash function also used build large data set stored slow medium
A cache generally simpler hashed search table since collision resolved discarding writing back older two colliding item
This also used file comparison
Hash function essential ingredient used test whether member
When storing record large unsorted file one may use hash function map record index table collect bucket number record hash value
Once table complete two duplicate record end bucket
The duplicate found scanning every bucket contains two member fetching record comparing
With table appropriate size method likely much faster alternative approach sorting file comparing consecutive pair
A hash value used uniquely identify secret information
This requires hash function mean hard find data generate hash value
These function categorized cryptographic hash function provably secure hash function
Functions second category secure also slow practical purpose
Collision resistance accomplished part generating large hash value
For example one widely used cryptographic hash function generates bit value
Hash function also used locate table record whose key similar identical given key pair record large file similar key
For purpose one need hash function map similar key hash value differ small integer say
If one build table record number using hash function similar record end bucket nearby bucket
Then one need check record bucket bucket range
This class includes algorithm used locate entry large collection
For application hash function must insensitive possible data capture transmission error trivial change timing volume change compression etc
The technique used find equal similar stretch large collection string document repository
In case input string broken many small piece hash function used detect potentially equal piece
The relatively fast work time average
It based use hashing compare string
This principle widely used many discipline solve many finding set point similar shape list shape similar
In application set input sort hashing function interpreted space grid
The table often array two index called similar name hash function return index
This special case hashing known
Geometric hashing also used usually name
Some standard application employ hash function include authentication message integrity using Hashed MAC message fingerprinting data corruption detection digital signature efficiency
Good hash function original sense term usually required satisfy certain property listed
The exact requirement dependent application
For example hash function well suited indexing data probably poor choice
A hash procedure must given input value must always generate hash value
In word must data hashed mathematical sense term
This requirement excludes hash function depend external variable parameter time day
It also excludes function depend memory address object hashed case address may change execution may happen system use certain method although sometimes rehashing item possible
The determinism context reuse function
For example add feature hash function make use randomized seed generated Python process start addition input hashed
The Python hash still valid hash function used within single run
But value persisted example written disk longer treated valid hash value since next run random value might differ
A good hash function map expected input evenly possible output range
That every hash value output range generated roughly
The reason last requirement cost method go sharply number input mapped hash
If hash value likely occur others larger fraction lookup operation search larger set colliding table entry
Note criterion requires value sense
A good randomizing function barring computational efficiency concern generally good choice hash function converse need true
Hash table often contain small subset valid input
For instance club membership list may contain hundred member name large set possible name
In case uniformity criterion hold almost typical subset entry may found table global set possible entry
In word typical set record hashed table slot probability bucket receiving many record vanishingly small
In particular le bucket one two record
In ideal bucket one record small number collision virtually inevitable even much larger see
When testing hash function uniformity distribution hash value evaluated
It often desirable output hash function fixed size see
If example output constrained integer value hash value used index array
Such hashing commonly used accelerate data search
On hand cryptographic hash function produce much larger hash value order ensure computational complexity inversion
For example one widely used cryptographic hash function produce value
Producing output variable length input accomplished breaking input data chunk specific size
Hash function used data search use arithmetic expression iteratively process chunk input character string produce hash value
In cryptographic hash function chunk processed last chunk padded necessary
In case size called much bigger size hash value
For example hash value bit block size bit
In many application range hash value may different run program may change along run instance hash table need expanded
In situation one need hash function take two input data number allowed hash value
A common solution compute fixed hash function large range say divide result use division
If power done
When approach used hash function must chosen result fairly uniform distribution value may occur application
Depending function remainder may uniform certain value

We allow table size power still perform remainder division operation computation sometimes costly
For example let significantly le
Consider PRNG function key uniform interval
A hash function uniform interval key
We replace division possibly faster right key
When hash function used store value hash table outlives run program hash table need expanded shrunk hash table referred dynamic hash table
A hash function relocate minimum number record table key hashed number allowed hash value probability close
spiral storage example dynamic hash function execute constant time relax property uniformity achieve minimal movement property
us dynamic hash function requires space proportional compute hash function becomes function previous key inserted
Several algorithm preserve uniformity property require time proportional compute value invented
A hash function minimal movement especially useful
In application input data may contain feature irrelevant comparison purpose
For example looking personal name may desirable ignore distinction upper lower case letter
For data one must use hash function compatible data criterion used two input considered equivalent must yield hash value
This accomplished normalizing input hashing letter
A hash function used search similar opposed equivalent data must possible two input differ little mapped equal nearly equal hash value
Note continuity usually considered fatal flaw checksum related concept
Continuity desirable hash function application hash table used
In cryptographic application hash function typically expected practically meaning realistic reconstruct input datum hash value alone without spending great amount computing time see also
For type hashing function choice function depends strongly nature input data intended application
If data hashed small enough one use data reinterpreted integer hashed value
The cost computing trivial hash function effectively zero
This hash function map input distinct hash value
The meaning small enough depends size type used hashed value
For example hash code integer
Thus integer object simply use value directly whereas integer use method
Other type data also use perfect hashing scheme
For example mapping one use binary encoding character interpreted integer index table give alternative form character A etc
If character stored bit extended table entry case character table would entry
The technique used map like u za country name table entry zip code like city name entry etc
Invalid data value country code xx zip code may left undefined table mapped appropriate null value
A hash function map valid input different hash said
With function one directly locate desired entry hash table without additional searching
A perfect hash function key said range consists integer usually
Besides providing lookup minimal perfect hash function also yield compact hash table without vacant slot
Minimal perfect hash function much harder find perfect one wider range
If input input may occur probability number etc
hash function need map roughly number input hash value
For instance suppose input integer range output must integer range much larger
Then hash function could remainder divided value scaled truncated integer many formula
These simple formula input value equally likely independent
For instance patron live geographic area telephone number likely begin digit
In case division formula depends mainly leading digit generate lot collision whereas remainder formula quite sensitive trailing digit may still yield fairly even distribution
When data value long personal name mail distribution usually uneven complicated dependency
For example text highly distribution characteristic language
For data prudent use hash function depends character depends character different way
In cryptographic hash function usually used
In general scheme hashing data break input sequence small unit etc
combine unit sequentially follows This schema also used many text checksum fingerprint algorithm
The state variable may unsigned integer case
The best choice complex issue depends nature data
If unit single bit could instance Here denotes significant bit operator denotes unsigned integer multiplication lost bitwise operation applied word suitable fixed word
In many case one design hash function yield many fewer collision good hash function
For example suppose input data file name mostly sequential number
For data function extract numeric part file name return would nearly optimal
Needless say function exceptionally good specific kind data may dismal performance data different distribution
In application one must compute hash function every given string fixed integer greater
The straightforward solution extract every substring compute separately requires number operation proportional
However proper choice one use technique rolling hash compute hash effort proportional
A scheme selects hashing function among family function way probability collision two distinct key number distinct hash value two key
Universal hashing ensures probabilistic sense hash function application behave well using random function distribution input data
It however collision perfect hashing may require operation hash function
See also unique permutation hashing
One adapt certain checksum fingerprinting algorithm use hash function
Some algorithm map arbitrarily long string data typical matter string one extract hash value
This method may produce sufficiently uniform distribution hash value long hash range size small compared range checksum fingerprint function
However checksum fare poorly may concern application
In particular popular checksum provides bit higher half result usable hashing
Moreover bit input deterministic effect bit output one tell without looking rest input bit output flip input bit flipped care must taken use bit computing hash checksum
Multiplicative hashing simple type hash function often used teacher introducing student hash table
Multiplicative hash function simple fast higher collision rate hash table sophisticated hash function
In many application hash table collision make system little slower otherwise harmless
In system often better use hash function based even simpler hash function tolerate collision rather use complex hash function avoids many collision take longer compute
Multiplicative hashing susceptible common mistake lead poor input bit affect output bit
Some even stronger uniformity guarantee checksum fingerprint thus provide good hashing function
In ordinary application advantage may small offset much higher cost
However method provide uniformly distributed hash even key chosen malicious agent
This feature may help protect service
Tables random number random integer provide nonlinear function used hash function purpose cryptography
The key hashed split part part used index nonlinear table
The table value added arithmetic XOR addition hash output value
Because table byte size fit cache modern microprocessor allows fast execution hashing algorithm
As table value average much longer bit one bit input affect nearly output bit
This algorithm proven fast high quality hashing purpose especially hashing key
Modern microprocessor allow much faster processing character string hashed processing one character time interpreting string array bit bit integer wide word integer value mean arithmetic operation

The remaining character string smaller word length CPU must handled differently

This approach proven speed hash code generation factor five modern microprocessor word size bit
Another approach convert string bit numeric value apply hash function
One method avoids problem string great similarity Aaaaaaaaaa Aaaaaaaaab use CRC string compute value
While possible two different string CRC likelihood small requires one check actual string found determine whether one exact match
CRCs different string Aaaaaaaaaa Aaaaaaaaab
Although CRC code used hash value cryptographically secure
LSH method performing probabilistic dimension reduction data
The basic idea hash input item similar item mapped bucket high probability number bucket much smaller universe possible input item
This different conventional hash function used cryptography case goal minimize probability collision every item

Then exactly minimum hash value union lie intersection
Therefore In word random variable one zero otherwise although high useful
The idea MinHash scheme reduce variance averaging together several variable constructed way
The term hash offer natural analogy meaning chop make mess something given hash function scramble input data derive output

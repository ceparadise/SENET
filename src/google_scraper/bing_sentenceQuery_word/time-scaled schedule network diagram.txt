A schedule network diagram essentially diagram used project management whenever scheduling
As reduced even simpler term saying Schedule Network Diagram fancy term used whenever someone talking project schedule
However diagram need drawn rather specific manner order understood project management
This manner show project management team position project long activity take beginning end
Now understand Schedule Network Diagram information include also know diagram need drawn specific manner
It need drawn form
However specific type bar chart want use
It must include schedule
As diagram uniform desirable everyone understand taking place

Schedule Network Analysis set data researched seek understand
generates project management schedule
It detailed report next step project
One important topic understand planning project activity creating diagram
Schedule network analysis diagram provide graphical view activity relate one another within
Sometimes matter well develop project management schedule something happen may dramatically change
Identification managing event chain would create network diagram
You want able see problem fix soon start
The schedule network analysis typically include element stage ongoing process may take place active period portion project start finish
In essence method used help manage money time efficently
A schedule network analysis always keep yon target goal

The preparation must include thorough understanding concept schedule network diagram
This must include subcomponents well
Here important definition familiar PMBOK Guide glossary A graphical representation logical among project schedule activity
You likely seen diagram generated Project Management software even drawn hand especially project fairly simple
What important Project Schedule Network Diagram depict scheduled activity dependency
In word underlying Project Schedule Network Diagram collection schedule activity dependency make project schedule network diagram
The schedule dependency may mandatory discretionary internal external nature
These dependency affect schedule activity go traverse Project Schedule Network Diagram
A way traversing diagram
More formally network path continuous series schedule activity connected logical relationship project schedule network The series scheduled activity connected logical flowing manner
You focus portion network
This fragment called subdivision project schedule network diagram usually representing subproject work package
Often used illustrate study potential proposed schedule condition change preferential schedule logic project For example organize host fundraising event activity would include creating invitee list sending invitation selecting caterer scouting venue etc
You depict diagram show logic dependency activity
A subnetwork may consider Another term master It basically project schedule network diagram activity duration graphically represented
The PMBOK Guide Glossary describes project schedule network diagram drawn way positioning length schedule activity represents duration
Essentially bar chart includes Schedule network logic

This example illustrates use TIMESCALE option draw network diagram
The Schedule data set produced PROC CPM previous example used
First PROC NETDRAW invoked TIMESCALE option without specification
By default procedure aligns node coincide early start time activity
The network span two page shown
The option add extra space around margin
Output TIMESCALE Option Default Alignment Next PROC NETDRAW invoked several option The option request activity placed according time
The FRAME option produce border around network diagram
The AUTOREF option draw reference line every tick mark
The option specify line style color reference line
The SHOWBREAK option request break time axis indicated break corresponding tick mark
Output Timescale Option

By default PROC NETDRAW us topological ordering activity network determine coordinate node
As project progress may want display activity arranged according time occurrence
Using option draw network time axis top node aligned according early start time default
You use option specify start finish time data set
In fact PROC NETDRAW enables align node according numeric variable data set
If TIMESCALE option specified without specification procedure chooses one following variable variable order
The first variable found used align node
The minimum maximum value variable used determine time axis
The format variable used determine default value option
The value option default value used determine format time axis
You override format based specifying desired format variable using FORMAT statement indicate standard SAS format special format option statement
list valid value corresponding type variable default format corresponding value
For value first column first value listed default value option corresponding type variable
Several option available PROC NETDRAW control spacing node scaling network diagram The option enables scale network diagram one tick mark associated one unit
Thus DAY column used represent one day activity start day placed column
By default procedure omits column tick mark contain node
The option enables print tick mark corresponding every day unit
Note project activity spread large period time LINEAR option lead network diagram wide
The option specifies maximum number empty column allowed two consecutive nonempty column
The LINEAR option equivalent specifying infinity default network diagram drawn
The option enables contract network diagram combining column
For example DAY column contains activity start within seven day note effect achieved setting WEEK

The algorithm described section modified slightly network diagram
The coordinate node determined value variable
The scaling option described used determine tick mark corresponding node
The coordinate determined
Once node placement completed arc routing algorithm described earlier
Since node placement network determined variable possible arc node may routed right left instead left right word may backward arc
Note also variable used determine coordinate node procedure also draw network contain cycle see second part
Several option available control appearance network diagram AUTOREF FRAME NOREPEATAXIS NOTIMEAXIS REFBREAK SHOWBREAK

investigation conducted provide stakeholder information product service test
Software testing also provide objective independent view software allow business appreciate understand risk software implementation
Test technique include process executing program application intent finding error defect verifying software product fit use
Software testing involves execution software component system component evaluate one property interest
In general property indicate extent component system test As number possible test even simple software component practically infinite software testing us strategy select test feasible available time resource
As result software testing typically exclusively attempt execute program application intent finding error defect
The job testing iterative process one bug fixed illuminate deeper bug even create new one
Software testing provide objective independent information quality software risk failure user sponsor
Software testing conducted soon executable software even partially complete exists
The often determines testing conducted
For example phased process testing occurs system requirement defined implemented testable program
In contrast requirement programming testing often done concurrently
Although testing determine correctness software assumption specific hypothesis see testing identify defect within software
Instead furnishes compare state behavior product mechanism someone might recognize problem
These oracle may include limited specification comparable product past version product inference intended expected purpose user customer expectation relevant standard applicable law criterion
A primary purpose testing detect software failure defect may discovered corrected
Testing establish product function properly condition function properly specific condition
The scope software testing often includes examination code well execution code various environment condition well examining aspect code supposed need
In current culture software development testing organization may separate development team
There various role testing team member
Information derived software testing may used correct process software developed
Every software product target audience
For example audience video game software completely different banking software
Therefore organization develops otherwise invests software product ass whether software product acceptable end user target audience purchaser stakeholder
Software testing aid process attempting make assessment
Not software defect caused coding error
One common source expensive defect requirement gap unrecognized requirement result error omission program designer
Requirement gap often
Software fault occur following process
A programmer make mistake result fault bug software
If defect executed certain situation system produce wrong result causing
Not defect necessarily result failure
For example defect never result failure
A defect turn failure environment changed
Examples change environment include software run new platform alteration interacting different software
A single defect may result wide range failure symptom
A fundamental problem software testing testing combination input precondition initial state feasible even simple product
This mean number software product large defect occur infrequently difficult find testing
More significantly dimension quality supposed versus supposed highly subjective something constitutes sufficient value one person may intolerable another
Software developer ca test everything use combinatorial test design identify minimum number test needed get coverage want
Combinatorial test design enables user get greater test coverage fewer test
Whether looking speed test depth use combinatorial test design method build structured variation test case
A study conducted report software bug cost economy billion annually
More third cost could avoided better software testing performed
software testing cost common China Philippines India preferred destination
Software testing done dedicated software tester
Until term software tester used generally later also seen separate profession
Regarding period different goal software testing different role established
Software testing also performed software tester
The separation testing initially introduced
Although attention breakage testing A successful test case one detects undiscovered error
illustrated desire software engineering community separate fundamental development activity debugging verification
There many approach available software testing
referred static testing whereas actually executing programmed code given set referred
Static testing often implicit proofreading plus programming editor check source code structure compiler check syntax data flow
Dynamic testing take place program run
Dynamic testing may begin program complete order test particular section code applied discrete module
Typical technique either using execution environment
Static testing involves whereas dynamic testing also involves
Together help improve
Among technique static analysis used ensure test case detect error introduced mutating source code
Software testing method traditionally divided testing
These two approach used describe point view test engineer take designing test case
testing also known clear box testing glass box testing transparent box testing structural testing seeing source code test internal structure working program opposed functionality exposed
In testing internal perspective system well programming skill used design test case
The tester chooses input exercise path code determine appropriate output
This analogous testing node circuit
ICT
While testing applied level software testing process usually done unit level
It test path within unit path unit integration subsystem test
Though method test design uncover many error problem might detect unimplemented part specification missing requirement
Techniques used testing include Code coverage tool evaluate completeness test suite created method including testing
This allows software team examine part system rarely tested ensures important tested
Code coverage reported percentage statement coverage ensures code path branch term executed least
This helpful ensuring correct functionality sufficient since code may process different input correctly incorrectly
testing treat software black box examining functionality without knowledge internal implementation without seeing source code
The tester aware software supposed
testing method include testing testing testing
testing aim test functionality software according applicable requirement
This level testing usually requires thorough provided tester simply verify given input output value behavior either expected value specified test case
Test case built around specification requirement application supposed
It us external description software including specification requirement design derive test case
These test though usually functional
testing may necessary assure correct functionality insufficient guard complex situation
One advantage black box technique programming knowledge required
Whatever bias programmer may tester likely different set may emphasize different area functionality
On hand testing said like walk dark labyrinth without flashlight
Because examine source code situation tester writes many test case check something could tested one test case leaf part program untested
This method test applied level software testing
It typically comprises testing higher level also dominate unit testing well
The aim visual testing provide developer ability examine happening point software failure presenting data way developer easily find information requires information expressed clearly
At core visual testing idea showing someone problem test failure rather describing greatly increase clarity understanding
Visual testing therefore requires recording entire test process capturing everything occurs test system video format
Output video supplemented tester input via webcam audio commentary microphone
Visual testing provides number advantage
The quality communication increased drastically tester show problem event leading developer opposed describing need replicate test failure cease exist many case
The developer evidence requires test failure instead focus cause fault fixed
Visual testing particularly environment deploy development software since agile method require greater communication tester developer collaboration within small team
important methodology checking software integrity require le preparation time implement important bug found quickly
In testing testing take place improvised impromptu way ability test tool visually record everything occurs system becomes important order document step taken uncover bug
Visual testing gathering recognition test used many individual involved development process
For customer becomes easy provide detailed bug report feedback program user visual testing record user action screen well voice image provide complete picture time software failure developer
testing American spelling testing involves knowledge internal data structure algorithm purpose designing test executing test user level
The tester required full access software source code
Manipulating input data formatting output qualify input output clearly outside black box calling system test
This distinction particularly important conducting two module code written two different developer interface exposed test
However test require modifying data repository database log file qualify user would normally able change data repository normal production operation
testing may also include determine instance boundary value error message
By knowing underlying concept software work tester make testing choice testing software outside
Typically tester permitted set isolated testing environment activity seeding
The tester observe state product tested performing certain action executing statement database executing query ensure expected change reflected
testing implement intelligent test scenario based limited information
This particularly apply data type handling
There generally four recognized level test unit testing integration testing component interface testing system testing
Tests frequently grouped added software development process level specificity test
The main level development process defined guide system testing distinguished test target without implying specific process model
Other test level classified testing objective
There two different level test perspective customer testing LLT testing HLT
LLT group test different level component software application product
HLT group test whole software application product
Unit testing refers test verify functionality specific section code usually function level
In environment usually class level minimal unit test include constructor destructors
These type test usually written developer work code style ensure specific function working expected
One function might multiple test catch branch code
Unit testing alone verify functionality piece software rather used ensure building block software work independently
Unit testing software development process involves synchronized application broad spectrum defect prevention detection strategy order reduce software development risk time cost
It performed software developer engineer construction phase software development lifecycle
Unit testing aim eliminate construction error code promoted additional testing strategy intended increase quality resulting software well efficiency overall development process
Depending organization expectation software development unit testing might include metric analysis peer code review analysis software testing practice
Integration testing type software testing seek verify interface component software design
Software component may integrated iterative way together big bang
Normally former considered better practice since allows interface issue located quickly fixed
Integration testing work expose defect interface interaction integrated component module
Progressively larger group tested software component corresponding element architectural design integrated tested software work system
The practice component interface testing used check handling data passed various unit subsystem component beyond full integration testing unit
The data passed considered message packet range data type checked data generated one unit tested validity passed another unit
One option interface testing keep separate log file data item passed often timestamp logged allow analysis thousand case data passed unit day week
Tests include checking handling extreme data value interface variable passed normal value
Unusual data value interface help explain unexpected performance next unit
Component interface testing variation focus data value beyond related action subsystem component
System testing test completely integrated system verify system meet requirement
For example system test might involve testing logon interface creating editing entry plus sending printing result followed summary processing deletion archiving entry logoff
Operational acceptance used conduct operational readiness product service system part
OAT common type software testing used mainly project
This type testing focus system supported become part production environment
Hence also known operational readiness testing ORT OR A testing
within OAT limited test required verify aspect system
In addition software testing ensure portability system well working expected also damage partially corrupt operating environment cause process within environment become inoperative
Different label way grouping testing may testing type technique
Most software system installation procedure needed used main purpose
Testing procedure achieve installed software system may used known installation testing
A common cause software failure real perceived lack operating system old new target environment differ greatly original application intended run required become must render
For example case lack occur programmer develop test software latest version target environment user may running
This result unintended consequence latest work may function earlier version target environment older hardware earlier version target environment capable using
Sometimes issue fixed proactively operating system functionality separate program
determines whether reasonable proceed testing
consists minimal attempt operate software designed determine whether basic problem prevent working
Such test used
Regression testing focus finding defect major code change occurred
Specifically seek uncover degraded lost feature including old bug come back
Such regression occur whenever software functionality previously working correctly stop working intended
Typically regression occur program change newly developed part software collides previously existing code
Common method regression testing include previous set test case checking whether previously fixed fault
The depth testing depends phase release process added feature
They either complete change added late release deemed risky shallow consisting positive test feature change early release deemed low risk
Regression testing typically largest test effort commercial software development due checking numerous detail prior software feature even new software developed using old test case test part new design ensure prior functionality still supported
Acceptance testing mean one two thing Alpha testing simulated actual operational testing potential independent test team developer site
Alpha testing often employed software form internal acceptance testing software go beta testing
Beta testing come alpha testing considered form external
Versions software known released limited audience outside programming team known beta tester
The software released group people testing ensure product fault
Beta version made available open public increase field maximal number future user deliver value earlier extended even indefinite period time
refers activity verify specific action function code
These usually found code requirement documentation although development methodology work use case user story
Functional test tend answer question user particular feature work
refers aspect software may related specific function user action behavior certain
Testing determine breaking point point extreme scalability performance lead unstable execution
requirement tend reflect quality product particularly context suitability perspective user
Continuous testing process executing part software delivery pipeline obtain immediate feedback business risk associated software release candidate
Continuous testing includes validation scope testing extends validating requirement user story assessing system requirement associated overarching business goal
Destructive testing attempt cause software fail
It verifies software function properly even receives invalid unexpected input thereby establishing input validation routine
form example failure testing
Various commercial testing tool linked page also numerous free software tool available perform destructive testing
Performance testing generally executed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
primarily concerned testing system continue operate specific load whether large quantity data large number
This generally referred software
The related load testing activity performed activity often referred
way test software function even certain component example file database increase radically size
way test reliability unexpected rare workload
often referred load endurance testing check see software continuously function well acceptable period
There little agreement specific goal performance testing
The term load testing performance testing volume testing often used interchangeably
system strict timing constraint
To test timing constraint met used
check user interface easy use understand
It concerned mainly use application
testing may include compliance standard essential software process confidential data prevent
The International Organization Standardization ISO defines type testing conducted evaluate degree test item associated data information protected unauthorised person system use read modify authorized person system denied access
The general ability software automatically tested without actual translation using
It verify application still work even translated new language adapted new culture different currency time zone
Actual translation human language must tested
Possible localization failure include Development Testing software development process involves synchronized application broad spectrum defect prevention detection strategy order reduce software development risk time cost
It performed software developer engineer construction phase software development lifecycle
Development Testing aim eliminate construction error code promoted testing strategy intended increase quality resulting software well efficiency overall development process
Depending organization expectation software development Development Testing might include data flow analysis metric analysis peer code review unit testing code coverage analysis traceability software testing practice
testing basically comparison two output generally one variable changed run test change one thing run test compare result
This useful situation useful program
With complex project multivariant testing done
In concurrent testing focus performance continuously running normal input normal operational condition opposed stress testing fuzz testing
Memory leak well basic fault easier find method
In software testing conformance testing verifies product performs according specified standard
Compilers instance extensively tested determine whether meet recognized standard language
A common practice software testing testing performed independent group tester functionality developed shipped customer
This practice often result testing phase used buffer compensate project delay thereby compromising time devoted testing
Another practice start software testing moment project start continuous process project finish
In contrast emerging software discipline movement adhere model
In process written first often extreme programming methodology
The test expected fail initially
As code written test pas incrementally larger portion test suite
The test suite continuously updated new failure condition corner case discovered integrated regression test developed
Unit test maintained along rest software source code generally integrated build process inherently interactive test relegated partially manual build acceptance process
The ultimate goal test process achieve software update published public frequently
This methodology increase testing effort done development reaching formal testing team
In development model test execution occurs requirement defined coding process completed
Although variation exist organization typical cycle testing
The sample common among organization employing model
The practice commonly found development model might clear explicit
Many programming group relying especially group use
There many framework write test software run test automatically every time code checked system
While automation reproduce everything human way think useful regression testing
However require testing script order truly useful
Program testing fault detection aided significantly testing tool
tool include feature Some feature may incorporated single composite tool IDE
Quality measure include topic completeness requirement capability compatibility
There number frequently used measure used assist determining state software adequacy testing
Based amount test case required construct complete test suite context
test suite applied implementation test collect enough information precisely determine whether system correct incorrect according specification hierarchy testing difficulty proposed
It includes following class It proved class strictly included next
For instance testing assume behavior implementation test denoted deterministic known finite set input output known number state belongs Class I subsequent class
However number state known belongs class Class II
If implementation test must deterministic machine failing specification single trace continuation number state unknown belongs class Class III
Testing temporal machine transition triggered input produced within interval belongs class Class IV whereas testing many system belongs Class V even belong Class I
The inclusion Class I require simplicity assumed computation model testing case involving implementation written programming language testing implementation defined machine depending continuous magnitude proved Class I
Other elaborated case testing framework must semantics temporal machine rational timeouts belong Class II
A software testing process produce several
The actual artifact produced factor SW Development Model used stakeholder organisational need
Several certification program exist support professional aspiration software tester quality assurance specialist
No certification offered actually requires applicant show ability test software
No certification based widely accepted body knowledge
This led declare testing field ready certification
Certification measure individual productivity skill practical knowledge guarantee competence professionalism tester
Some major include It commonly believed earlier defect found cheaper fix
The following table show cost fixing defect depending stage found
For example problem requirement found would cost time fix already found requirement review
With advent modern practice service cost maintenance may lessen time
The data table extrapolated scant
Laurent Bossavit say analysis The smaller project curve turn two team student sample size small extrapolating smaller project general totally indefensible
The GTE study explain data say came two project one large one small
The paper cited Bell Labs Safeguard project specifically disclaims collected data Boehm data point suggest
The IBM study Fagan paper contains claim seem contradict Boehm graph numerical result clearly correspond data point
Boehm even cite paper TRW data except writing Making Software cited original article
There exists large study conducted TRW right time Boehm cite paper contain sort data would support Boehm claim
Software testing used association The term verification validation commonly used interchangeably industry also common see two term defined contradictory definition
According IEEE Standard Glossary Software Engineering Terminology And according ISO standard The contradiction caused use concept requirement specified requirement different meaning
In case IEEE standard specified requirement mentioned definition validation set problem need want stakeholder software must solve satisfy
Such requirement documented Software Requirements Specification SRS
And product mentioned definition verification output artifact every phase software development process
These product fact specification Architectural Design Specification Detailed Design Specification etc
The SRS also specification verified least sense used subject
But ISO specified requirement set specification mentioned must verified
A specification previously explained product software development process phase receives another specification input
A specification verified successfully correctly implement input specification
All specification verified except SRS first one validated though
Examples The Design Specification must implement SRS Construction phase artifact must implement Design Specification
So word defined common term apparent contradiction disappears
Both SRS software must validated
The SRS validated statically consulting stakeholder
Nevertheless running partial implementation software prototype kind dynamic testing obtaining positive feedback increase certainty SRS correctly formulated
On hand software final running product artifact document including source code must validated dynamically stakeholder executing software try
Some might argue SRS input word stakeholder therefore SRS validation SRS verification
Thinking way advisable cause confusion
It better think verification process involving formal technical input document
Software testing may considered part SQA process
In SQA software process specialist auditor concerned software development process rather artefact documentation code system
They examine change software engineering process reduce number fault end delivered software defect rate
What constitutes acceptable defect rate depends nature software A flight simulator video game would much higher defect tolerance software actual airplane
Although close link SQA testing department often exist independently may SQA function company
Software testing activity investigate software test order provide information stakeholder
By contrast QA implementation policy procedure intended prevent defect reaching customer

My friend I struggling classify exactly integration test
Now way home I realised every time I try give real world example integration test turn acceptance test ie
something business person would say loud spec system delivering
I checked Ruby Rails documentation classification testing type completely thrown
Can give short academic description integration test real world example
At moment I like statement important call made Gojko Adzic You really need specify people talking test intend test
There lot people different view depending role
For tester general accepted testmethodology Netherlands
Tmap make following distinction
And specific kind test performed within mentioned test
Look overview The say Looking different source putting experience opinion I would start making distinction three category goal test My list start suggestion I really think important call Hope help Edit Just recently nice introduction placed YouTube integration test turn acceptance test Obviously
These two almost thing
But slightly different dimension test definition
Integration system whole
Acceptance system whole
The difference subtle definition test case
Integration test case test depth degree integration
Does work edge case corner case
Test case tend technical written designer coder
Acceptance test case exercise feature set
Not edge corner case
Test case tend written
I personally like think integration test every component system mock object
A real repository real database real UI
You test specific functionality system fully assembled like supposed deployed
In I admit little experience I understood word integration really create misunderstanding really difficult find something completely isolated system element need integration sure
Thus I got accustomed make following distinction In integration test definition external I meant system I change immediately way behave reason
It could library component system changed
shared project company dbms etc
For test I need set something similar real environment system work external system must initialized set certain state realistic data must registered db etc
Instead I acceptance testing I thing I working something different I working specification system ability collaborate external entity
This really narrower view compared KeesDijk described earlier however I suppose project I worked till small enough let level simplification
An verifies component complex system
software aircraft power plant working together designed
Let imagine talking aircraft software abstract difficult make difference
The integration test include verifying The namely system work despite subdivision component
In software component use case module function interface library etc
The verifies product fit purpose
They principle performed customer
Taking aircraft analogy include verifying The
In relationship contractual responsibility compliance requirement
But case also responsibility using organization ensure duty carried system prudently prevent unforeseen issue
like railway corporation discovered acceptance test shorten quais new wagon cm large joke
Integration acceptance test overlapping
They intend show system whole work
However whole could larger customer system may part larger organizational system technical system integrator Integration testing nothing checking connection correctness data flow two module
For Example When compose mail one module send valid user ID second module integration testing check whether sent mail sent item
One definition integration test For example There exists contract sort process external world minimally verifying contract goal integration test

verify contract
If moving toward space
Unit test able test logic within process boundary easily lack dependency external world
Whilst integration test definition cover hence I called definition I think much le

Strictly speaking yes definition would cover test
In philosophy form integration test hence name emphasise another aspect
In direction unit test considered integration test zero component

I new testing
I would like know Please explain example possible make helpful understand
Component testing testing specific module may done isolation rest system depending life cycle model selected particular application
Stub driver used competent testing
These consider component
Best example given Suppose testing one application module called X Y think module depends like Y depends X Z depends Y
Now developer developed Y module tester want test need use stub driver module X Z
Based example easy write test case
For writing test case component testing I prefer making check list component separate status comment column fill test result
You also prepare detailed spreadsheet explained jensi suthar I prefer checklist component testing may become exhausting manage detailed lengthy documentation
method testing component application done separately
Suppose application component
Testing component separately efficiently called component testing
understand better way
Suppose application consisting three module say module A module B module The developer developed module B wanted test
But order test module B completely functionality dependent module A module But module A module C developed yet
In case test module B completely replace module A module C stub driver required
Testing separate software component known component testing
considered Module Testing testing module component differently effectively
Suppose one project consists component testing component differently effectively known component testing
Component testing test test object separately testable isolated unit without integrating component
module program object class etc
Component Testing Example For two web page
In one web page many certain field like username address mobile
etc data entered
In second web page also certain field carry forward data first page
Testing functionality individual page called Component Testing
After component Testing always done Integration Testing
While proper black box testing white box testing tester first Component Testing done
Before component Testing always done developer
While proper Unit Testing Developers run function method Component effectively
Testing separate software component known component testing
Component testing mean testing single part
This program module single function etc
For example website page registration process
Now assume page data depend page data developed done code page tester test page called one component testing

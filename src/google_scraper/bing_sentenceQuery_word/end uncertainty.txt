Advanced energy technology Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle IGCC Carbon Capture Storage CCS potentially lead clean efficient use fossil fuel power nation
The development new energy technology however take long time technology need tested multiple scale progressing lab scale pilot scale demonstration scale widespread deployment
In addition developing new energy technology NETL research working reduce cost time technology development
Advanced capability significantly reduce time cost development deployment energy technology
In particular modeling simulation used increase confidence technology scaled example designing MWe gasifier based data generated MWth gasifier
This allows rapid technology reducing even avoiding costly testing
New design tested help simulation ensure reliable operation variety operating condition
However used confidence reliability prediction must established
Therefore NETL initiated work verification validation uncertainty quantification multiphase CFD model underpin simulation several advanced energy technology adapting method developed application stewardship nuclear stockpile
This involves exploring make model useful possible quantifying wrong stated National Academies report basic idea quantifying uncertainty prediction
Multiphase CFD model example ability predict performance fluidized bed reactor must validated data small unit
The validation study usually report ability model agree measured value qualitative term good agreement
Because various source uncertainty unavoidably get introduced time numerical solution computed even though multiphase CFD model based set deterministic mathematical equation ideal perfect agreement model experiment practically unachievable
NETL objective demonstrate comprehensive uncertainty quantification method adopted describing validity multiphase CFD model
A gasifier simulation example us set input parameter taken design geometry specification flow rate composition laboratory measurement chemical reaction rate predicts quantity interest carbon conversion pressure drop
A number challenge exist applying uncertainty quantification technique
In multiphase flow example many uncertain parameter exist
Another challenge may computational cost requiring compromise term grid resolution used
Since governing physic multiphase flow complex single phase flow simulation computational cost increase play key role determination adequate sampling technique number sample
Using framework established earlier researcher field NETL researcher apply following step describe validity model use difference observed predicted observed phenomenon identify characterize source uncertainty uncertainty due inherent variation quantity aleatory uncertainty due information missing part modeler experimenter epistemic understand propagation uncertainty using Carlo Latin hypercube orthogonal array etc

Related concept fundamental called unintelligible expression without straightforward description
It describes situation involving unknown
It applies prediction future event physical measurement already made unknown
Uncertainty arises environment well due
It arises number field including
Although term used various way among general public many specialist quantitative field defined uncertainty risk measurement Opinions carry type uncertainty
In economics distinguished risk uncertainty risk immeasurable impossible calculate referred Uncertainty must taken sense radically distinct familiar notion risk never properly separated
The essential fact mean case quantity susceptible measurement time something distinctly character crucial difference bearing phenomenon depending two really present operating
It appear measurable uncertainty proper shall use term far different unmeasurable one effect uncertainty
Other taxonomy uncertainty decision include broader sense uncertainty approached ethic perspective For example unknown whether rain tomorrow state uncertainty
If probability applied possible outcome using weather forecast even uncertainty quantified
Suppose quantified chance sunshine
If major costly outdoor event planned tomorrow risk since chance rain rain would undesirable
Furthermore business event would lost rain risk quantified chance losing
These situation made even realistic quantifying light rain heavy rain cost delay outright cancellation etc
Some may represent risk example expected opportunity loss EOL chance loss multiplied amount loss
That useful organizer event risk neutral people
Most would willing pay premium avoid loss
An insurance company example would compute EOL minimum insurance coverage add onto operating cost profit
Since many people willing buy insurance many reason clearly EOL alone perceived value avoiding risk
Quantitative us term uncertainty risk fairly consistent field
Some also create new term without substantially changing definition uncertainty risk
For example variation uncertainty sometimes used
But outside mathematical us term usage may vary widely
In uncertainty real matter perception threat etc
form uncertainty analyst unable clearly differentiate two different class average height
person
This form vagueness modelled variation
form uncertainty even possible outcome unclear meaning interpretation
The statement ambiguous interpretation depends whether word meant
Ambiguity typically arises situation multiple analyst observer different interpretation statement
Uncertainty may consequence lack knowledge obtainable fact
That may uncertainty whether new rocket design work uncertainty removed analysis experimentation
At subatomic level uncertainty may fundamental unavoidable property universe
In put limit much observer ever know position velocity particle
This may ignorance potentially obtainable fact fact found
There controversy physic whether uncertainty irreducible property nature hidden variable would describe state particle even exactly Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows
The commonly used procedure calculating measurement uncertainty described Guide Expression Uncertainty Measurement GUM published
A derived work example NIST Technical Note Guidelines Evaluating Expressing Uncertainty NIST Measurement Results publication Quantifying Uncertainty Analytical Measurement
The uncertainty result measurement generally consists several component
The component regarded may grouped two category according method used estimate numerical value By propagating component function relating component measurement result combined measurement uncertainty given square root resulting variance
The simplest form repeated observation
In uncertainty measurement explicitly stated given range value likely enclose true value
This may denoted graph following notation In last notation parenthesis concise notation notation
For example applying meter scientific engineering application could written convention meaning accurate one tenth meter one hundredth
The precision symmetric around last digit
In case half tenth half tenth mean
Thus mean mean also written respectively
But accuracy within two tenth uncertainty one tenth explicit
The number parenthesis numeral left part number part notation uncertainty
They apply
For instance stand stand
This concise notation used example stating
The middle notation used error symmetrical value example
This occur using logarithmic scale example
Uncertainty measurement determined repeating measurement arrive estimate standard deviation value
Then single value uncertainty equal standard deviation
However value averaged mean measurement value much smaller uncertainty equal mean standard deviation divided square root number measurement
This procedure neglect however
When uncertainty represents standard error measurement time true value measured quantity fall within stated uncertainty range
For example likely atomic mass value given true value lie outside stated range
If width interval doubled probably true value lie outside doubled interval width tripled probably lie outside
These value follow property apply measurement process produce normally distributed error
In case quoted easily converted one two sigma three sigma
In context uncertainty depends measurement instrument
The lower accuracy precision instrument larger measurement uncertainty
Notice precision often determined standard deviation repeated measure given value namely using method described ass measurement uncertainty
However method correct instrument accurate
When inaccurate uncertainty larger standard deviation repeated measure appears evident uncertainty depend instrumental precision
Uncertainty science science general may interpreted differently public sphere scientific community
This due part diversity public audience tendency scientist misunderstand lay audience therefore communicate idea clearly effectively
One example explained
Also public realm often many scientific voice giving input single topic
For example depending issue reported public sphere discrepancy outcome multiple scientific study due methodological difference could interpreted public lack consensus situation consensus fact exist
This interpretation may even intentionally promoted scientific uncertainty may managed reach certain goal
For example global warming contrarian activist took advice frame issue scientific uncertainty precursor conflict frame used journalist reporting issue
Indeterminacy loosely said apply situation parameter system interaction fully known whereas ignorance refers situation known known
These unknown indeterminacy ignorance exist science often transformed uncertainty reported public order make issue manageable since scientific indeterminacy ignorance difficult concept scientist convey without losing credibility
Conversely uncertainty often interpreted public ignorance
The transformation indeterminacy ignorance uncertainty may related public misinterpretation uncertainty ignorance
Journalists may inflate uncertainty making science seem uncertain really downplay uncertainty making science seem certain really
One way journalist inflate uncertainty describing new research contradicts past research without providing context change
Journalists may give scientist minority view equal weight scientist majority view without adequately describing explaining state issue
In vein journalist may give amount attention importance scientist
Journalists may downplay uncertainty eliminating scientist carefully chosen tentative wording losing caveat information skewed presented certain conclusive really
Also story single source without context previous research mean subject hand presented definitive certain reality
There often product process approach aid downplaying uncertainty
Finally notably investigation science framed journalist triumphant quest uncertainty erroneously framed reducible resolvable
Some medium routine organizational factor affect overstatement uncertainty medium routine organizational factor help inflate certainty issue
Because general public United States generally trust scientist science story covered without cue special interest organization religious group environmental organization political faction etc
often covered business related sense frame social progress frame
The nature frame downplay eliminate uncertainty economic scientific promise focused early issue cycle happened coverage plant biotechnology nanotechnology United States matter question seems definitive certain
Sometimes stockholder owner advertising pressure medium organization promote business aspect scientific issue therefore uncertainty claim may compromise business interest downplayed eliminated

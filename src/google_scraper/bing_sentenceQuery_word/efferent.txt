Before define efferent arteriole important first discus difference artery vein review difference exist
An high pressure blood vessel circulatory system carry blood organ away heart
Arteries deliver oxygen nutrient rich blood heart rest body
A responsible carrying blood back heart
Veins regulated nervous system meaning blood pressure like kind doctor measure varies disease age nothing vein
So point
Why artery bring blood heart organ like kidney liver
Why vein bring blood back heart
It delivery system course
Arteries vein responsible bringing organ tissue nutrient need blood function like oxygen
So really simple
Are really bringing blood organ essentially dumping bringing back everything good stripped blood given tissue kind like dumping water potted plant huge bucket letting water absorb soil pouring excess realized need water
While great way picture keep mind instead bucket human anatomy would like pointing strongest garden hose find potted plant adding even pressure applying thumb end hose
The dirt plant would everywhere hose pressure
Arteries vein exist eliminate problem blood flow artery slows reach target tissue pressure vein significantly slower bringing blood back heart
Think putting thumb end hose squirting hose fierce pressure gradually lifting thumb return hose pressure back normal
This exactly blood flow artery work except pressure decrease artery called something different
An branching artery significantly lower blood pressure portion artery deliver blood directly tissue
Now reviewed blood flow time define efferent arteriole review function blood flow process
An arteriole delivers blood away capillary kidney
The term used describe specific arteriole highly specific location body kidney
Blood enters capillary kidney known via nutrient exchange occurs
From blood pumped efferent arteriole efferent arteriole remove blood kidney

A great way remember order blood flow consider alphabet A come The afferent arteriole A E delivers blood kidney efferent arteriole E A take blood away kidney
The letter E also stand exception
The efferent arteriole special name exception covered They small diameter increase pressure taking blood away capillary yet still considered arteriole
These blood vessel part urinary tract human well organism kidney responsible creating maintaining urine output
Therefore consider efferent arteriole important regulating kidney function maintaining kidney homeostasis
Another important thing consider pressure difference across entire filtration system kidney
The efferent arteriole carry blood away glomerulus smaller afferent arteriole
Think back hose thumb using thumb generate force increase pressure essentially making hole water squirt smaller backing water would normally flow hose
The efferent arteriole smaller exact reason back flow increase pressure glomerulus
By glomerular capillary able filter nutrient blood efficiently
An artery branched bigger predominant artery
They deliver blood capillary network
Arterioles typically larger diameter artery slows blood flow decrease pressure allows gas nutrient exchange occur
In kidney take blood away network capillary kidney known glomerulus
Unlike normal arteriole efferent arteriole arteriole small diameter back flow increase pressure behind allowing glomerular capillary properly efficiently filter blood enters kidney

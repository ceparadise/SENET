Computers machine stuff information
They let view listen create edit information document image video sound spreadsheet database
They let play game simulated world really exist except information inside computer memory displayed screen
They let compute calculate numerical information let send receive information network
Fundamental computer represent information way inside computer memory well storing disk sending network
To make computer easier build keep reliable everything represented using two value
You may seen two value represented computer represented anything two state
For example memory low high voltage used store
On magnetic disk stored magnetism whether tiny spot disk magnetised north south
The idea stored transmitted digital world stored using two value might seem somewhat fantastic exercise give little experience using black white card represent number
In following interactive click last card right reveal one dot
Now click previous card two dot
Before clicking next one many dot predict
Carry clicking card moving left trying guess many dot
Use interactive online The challenge find way exactly dot showing answer spoiler
Now try making number dot
Is number ca represented
To test try counting
You may noticed card show twice many dot one right
This important pattern data representation computer
The number requires card white black white white black black white black white white white white white black white white black black black white
You found number represented card
Each number could communicated using two word black white
For example dot white black white white black
Or could decode black black white white white number
This basis data representation anything two different state represent anything digital device
When write stored computer paper normally use one state state
For example piece computer memory could following voltage We could allocate write sequence While notation used extensively may often hear data referred important remember computer store way
They using physical mechanism high low voltage north south polarity light dark material
The use two digit common best known computer jargon used
Since two digit system called binary
The short word binary digit made taking first two letter last letter digit two value
Every file save every picture make every download every digital recording every web page whole lot bit
These binary digit make digital technology
And nature digit unlock powerful world storing sharing wealth information entertainment
Computer scientist spend lot time reading bit knowing stored really important affect amount space data use amount time take send data friend data take space take longer send
quality stored
You may come across thing like colour encryption address ASCII
Understanding bit enables work much space required get colour secret code unique ID every device world text us character usual English alphabet
This chapter different method computer use code different kind information pattern bit affect cost quality computer even something feasible
To begin look Braille
Braille actually way computer represent data great introduction topic
When working material section good way draw braille paper without actually make raised dot draw rectangle small circle colour circle raised colour one raised
More year ago French boy invented system representing text using combination flat raised dot paper could read touch
The system became popular people visual impairment provided relatively fast reliable way read text without seeing
Louis Braille system early example binary representation data two symbol raised flat yet combination used represent reference book work literature
Each character braille represented cell dot
Each dot either raised raised
Different number letter made using different pattern raised raised dot
Let work many different pattern made using dot Braille character
If braille used dot would pattern
And dot would pattern You may noticed twice many pattern dot dot
It turn every time add extra dot give twice many pattern dot pattern dot pattern dot pattern
Can come explanation doubling number pattern occurs
The reason number pattern double extra dot say dot pattern dot use pattern dot flat raised
This give pattern
And one dot bring dot
This process repeated infinitely
So Braille dot make pattern
That enough letter alphabet symbol digit punctuation
The reason looking Braille chapter representation using bit
That contains different value raised raised contains sequence represent different pattern
The letter example could written mean raised dot mean raised dot assuming reading left right
This sometimes use show computer representing data
Braille also illustrates binary representation popular
It would possible three kind dot flat half raised raised
A skilled braille reader could distinguish three value per dot would need dot represent pattern
The trouble would need accurate device create dot people would need accurate sensing
If page squashed even slightly could leave information unreadable
Digital device almost always use two value binary similar reason computer disk memory made cheaper smaller need able distinguish two extreme value high low voltage rather distinction subtle difference voltage
Using ten digit like every day decimal counting system would obviously challenging
Why digital system hung using two digit
After could thing digit system
As happens people tried build computer hard
Recording digit involves accurate equipment reading voltage level magnetisation reflection lot easier check mainly one way
There discussion use binary Watch video online In section look computer represent number
To begin revise number system use every day work look binary
After look charactertistics number computer must deal negative number number decimal point
The number system human normally use base also known decimal
It worth revising quickly binary number use idea decimal number fewer digit
In decimal value digit number depends number
For example represents whereas represents
Each place value number worth time place value right
one ten hundred thousand ten thousand hundred thousand million
Also different place value
If able use one digit represent number largest number would
After need second digit go left giving next ten number
It digit one worth time much one right
You may encountered different way expressing number using expanded form
For example want write number expanded form might written A sophisticated way writing If learnt exponent could write Remember number power
x
The key idea notice All probably sound really obvious worth thinking consciously binary number property
As discussed earlier computer store information using bit possible state
This mean represent base number using digit way write number decimal
Instead must represent number using digit
Binary work similar way Decimal even though might initially seem way
Because digit mean digit time value one immediately right
The base decimal system sometimes called denary consistent name binary base system
The word denary also refers Roman denarius coin worth ten ass copper bronze coin
The term denary seems used mainly UK US Australia NZ term decimal common
The interactive illustrates binary number system represents number
Have play around see pattern see
Use interactive online Find representation using interactive

A binary number incremented starting right flipping consecutive bit come first bit half time
Counting finger binary mean count finger finger
There number video YouTube people counting binary finger
One twist wear white glove number finger respectively make easy work value certain finger raised
The interactive used exactly bit
In practice use many bit need like decimal
For example bit place value would largest value binary decimal
Representing bit would give
Write representation following
If possible representation put Impossible
The answer space added make answer easier read required An important concept binary number range value represented using given number bit
When bit binary number start get useful represent value enough store someone age day month
Groups bit useful name
Computer memory disk space usually divided byte bigger value stored using one byte
For example two byte bit enough store number
Four byte bit store number
You check number working place value bit
Every bit added double range number
In practice computer store number either bit
This full number byte byte bit make easier computer know number start stop
Candles birthday cake use base numbering system place worth one right
For example number
This cause problem get older ever seen cake candle aware serious fire hazard
Luckily possible use binary notation birthday candle candle either lit lit
For example binary notation need candle two lit
There
It lot smarter use binary notation candle birthday get older need many candle
Most time binary number stored electronically need worry making sense
But sometimes useful able write share number unique identifier assigned digital device MAC address colour specified HTML page
Writing long binary number tedious example suppose need copy number
A widely used shortcut break number group case write digit group represents giving
There one small problem group bit go digit go
The solution simple introduce symbol digit letter A So example binary number written concisely
The B represents binary decimal number E represents binary decimal
Because digit representation base known hexadecimal hex short
Converting binary hexadecimal simple hexadecimal common way writing large binary number
Here full table number hexadecimal digit equivalent For example largest binary number
This written FF hexadecimal
Both representation mean conventional decimal system check converting binary number decimal
Which notation use depend situation binary number represent actually stored confusing read write hexadecimal number good shorthand binary decimal number used trying understand meaning number normal math
All three widely used computer science
It important remember though computer represent number using binary
They represent number directly decimal hexadecimal
A common place number stored computer spreadsheet database
These entered either spreadsheet program database program program somebody else wrote additional hardware sensor collecting data temperature air pressure ground shaking
Some thing might think number telephone number actually stored number contain important character like dash space well leading would lost stored number number would come quite right
These stored discussed next section
On hand thing look like number January often stored using value converted format meaningful reader try typing two date Excel subtract one result useful number
In underlying representation number used
Program code used translate underlying representation meaningful date user interface
The difference two date Excel number day date many system stored amount time elapsed since fixed date January
You test typing date like January chance wo formatted normal date
Likewise date sufficiently future may behave strangely due limited number bit available store date
Numbers used store thing diverse date student mark price statistic scientific reading size dimension graphic
The following issue need considered storing number computer In practice need allocate fixed number bit number know big number
This often bit bit although set bit even bit needed
This computer way knowing number start end otherwise
Any system store number need make compromise number bit allocated store number range value stored
In system like Java C programming language database possible specify accurately number stored others fixed advance spreadsheet
Some able work arbitrarily large number increasing space used store necessary
integer Python programming language
However likely still working multiple bit
bit bit bit bit etc
Once number big fit bit computer would reallocate bit
In programming language check number get big overflow
For example number using two complement largest number add one without checking change happens number
This cause serious problem checked behind variant problem called involving number overflowing date Tuesday January
On tiny computer embedded inside car washing machine tiny sensor barely larger grain sand might need specify precisely big number need
While computer prefer work chunk bit could write program example earthquake sensor know first bit lattitude next bit longitude next bit depth last bit amount force
Even standard computer important think carefully number bit need
For example field database could either perhaps representing four base occur DNA sequence used bit number every one add database grows
If item database wasted bit one bit needed represent number example total bit around MB
If lot database really add human DNA billion base pair incredibly wasteful use bit one
And application Google Maps storing astronomical amount data wasting space option
It really useful know roughly many bit need represent certain value
Have think following scenario choose best number bit option given
You want ensure largest possible number fit within number bit also want ensure wasting space
The binary number representation looked far allows u represent positive number
In practice want able represent negative number well balance account go negative amount temperature fall zero
In normal representation base number represent negative number putting minus sign front number
But binary simple
We look two possible approach Adding simple sign bit much like decimal useful system called Two Complement
On computer minus sign number work well use text based one representing number ca arithmetic character allocating one extra bit called bit represent minus sign
Just like decimal number put negative indicator left number sign bit set mean number positive sign bit set number negative minus sign front
For example wanted represent number using bit along additional bit sign bit give total bit would represent
The first bit meaning number positive remaining bit give meaning number
If wanted make would
The first bit meaning number negative remaining bit represent meaning number
Using bit described one sign actual number would binary representation
The space necessary added make reading binary number easier Going way easy
If binary number know negative first digit
The number part next bit
This mean number
What would decimal value following assuming first bit sign bit
But That convert
And
Since strange two different representation number
This one reason use simple sign bit practice
Instead computer usually use sophisticated representation negative binary number called
There alternative representation called avoids two representation importantly make easier arithmetic negative number
Representing positive number method already learnt
Using leftmost bit zero bit usual binary representation number example would would
This thing get interesting
In order convert negative number two complement representation use following process
For example assume want convert Two Complement representation
We would use process follows
Therefore Two Complement representation
The rule adding one binary number pretty simple let figure
First binary number end
would number change replace last
Now end much would increase change
What ending

The method adding simple easy build computer hardware quickly
What would two complement representation following number
Follow process given section remember need anything special positive number
In order reverse process need know whether number looking positive negative
For positive number simply convert binary number back decimal
But negative number first need convert back normal binary number
So know number positive negative
It turn reason understand later section Two Complement number negative always start positive number always start
Have look back previous example double check
So number start use following process convert number back negative decimal number
So needed convert back decimal would following
Convert following Two Complement number decimal
While might initially seem bit allocated sign bit bit behaves like one
With bit still make possible pattern
If attempted use bit represent positive number negative number would quickly realise number mapped onto pattern bit
Obviously make impossible know number actually represented
In practice number within following range represented
many number represent allow positive number sign needed many number represent require positive negative number
You work range value stored using unsigned number
decimal signed two complement range lowest number decimal highest number decimal
This might seem bit weird work really well normal binary addition used use representation even adding negative number
Before adding negative binary number look adding positive number
It basically addition method used decimal number except rule way simpler two different digit might add
You probably learnt column addition
For example following column addition would used
When go add result higher put one column carry column
Binary addition work exactly way
If wanted add two positive binary number would follow similar process column addition
You need know
The first three might expect
Adding cause carry digit since binary translates carry column addition
The last one add binary express carry
For two example number addition work like Remember digit
So need carry next column total get column decimal
With negative number using sign bit like work
If wanted add would expect get answer
Which
One way could solve problem use column subtraction instead
But would require giving computer hardware circuit could
Luckily unnecessary addition negative number work automatically using Two Complement
For addition start converting number Two Complement form
Because positive number need changed
But negative number sign bit removed use Two Complement need invert digit add giving
Adding two number work like Any extra bit left beyond using case bit truncated
This leaf like expecting
We also use subtraction
If subtracting positive number positive number would need convert number subtracting negative number
Then add two number
This decimal number example
This property Two Complement useful
It mean positive number negative number handled computer circuit addition subtraction treated operation
The idea using complementary number change subtraction addition seen decimal
The complement decimal digit digit add example complement complement
The word complement come root complete completes nice round number
Subtracting adding complement ignoring extra digit left
The complement add giving
For larger number subtracting two number complement number add next power

Check adding produce almost result subtracting
Working complement binary way easier two digit work working decimal may help understand going
We looked two different way representing negative number computer
In practice simple sign bit rarely used two different representation zero requiring different computer circuit handle negative positive number addition subtraction
Two Complement widely used one representation zero allows positive number negative number treated way addition subtraction treated one operation
There system One Complement Two Complement far widely used practice
There several different way computer use bit store text
In section look common one look pro con representation
We saw earlier unique pattern made using dot Braille
A dot corresponds bit dot bit different possible value
Count many different character letter letter number symbol could type text editor using keyboard
Don forget count symbol share number key symbol side punctuation
The collective name letter letter number symbol
D h character
Importantly space also character
If counted correctly find character might found around
Because bit represent character need bit turn need least bit represent character give possible pattern
This exactly representation text
In previous section explained happens number dot increased remember dot Braille effectively bit
Can explain knew bit enough represent character bit must enough represent character
Each pattern ASCII usually stored bit one wasted bit rather bit
However bit pattern meaning still possible pattern
Where possible prefer deal full byte bit computer ASCII extra wasted bit
Here table show pattern bit ASCII us character
For example letter c table pattern front extra padding make bit
The letter pattern
You could write word using code give someone else able decode exactly
Computers represent piece text sequence pattern much like Braille
For example word computer would
This c
Have look ASCII table check right
The name ASCII stand American Standard Code Information Interchange particular way assigning bit pattern character keyboard
The ASCII system even includes character ringing bell useful getting attention old telegraph system deleting previous character kind early undo end transmission let receiver know message finished
These day character rarely used code still exist missing pattern table
Nowadays ASCII supplanted code called happens ASCII extra bit open huge range character bit
Have go following ASCII exercise Be sure go checking answer
These answer
Note text treated character ASCII may confusing text different number
You may encountered distinction spreadsheet
cell start inverted comma Excel treated text rather number
One place come phone number type spreadsheet number come text displayed
In fact phone number really number leading zero important contain character example extn

ASCII first used commercially despite big change computer since still basis English text stored computer
ASCII assigned different pattern bit character along control character delete backspace
English text easily represented using ASCII language Chinese thousand different character
Unsurprisingly pattern nearly enough represent language
Because ASCII useful practice longer used widely
In next section look Unicode representation
These solve problem unable represent character
There several code popular ASCII including
A widely used variant Baudot code Murray code named New Zealand born inventor
One Murray significant improvement introduce idea control character carriage return new line
The control key still exists modern keyboard
In practice need able represent English character
To solve problem use standard called
Unicode around different character many different language current historic
Each character unique number assigned making easy identify
Unicode representation character set
In order represent Unicode character bit Unicode used
The Unicode encoding scheme tell u number corresponds Unicode character represented pattern bit
The following interactive allow explore Unicode character set
Enter number box left see Unicode character corresponds enter character right see Unicode number could paste one foreign language web page see happens character
Use interactive online The widely used Unicode encoding scheme called may seen name email header describing text file
Some Unicode encoding scheme
mean character represented using number bit
mean character represented fewer bit others
It better ensure commonly used character represented fewer bit uncommonly used character
Of course might commonly used character English necessarily commonly used character Japanese
You may wondering need many encoding scheme Unicode
It turn better English language text better Asian language text
The remainder text representation section look Unicode encoding scheme understand use better others certain situation
Unicode encoding scheme
The representation character simply number converted bit binary number
Leading zero used enough bit like represent digit decimal number
bit nice round number computer often referred word bit confusing since use character represent English word
For example character would The character would And character would The following interactive allow convert Unicode character representation
The Unicode character number also displayed
The bit simply binary number form character number
Use interactive online ASCII actually took approach
Each ASCII character number representation character number converted bit binary number
ASCII also fixed length encoding scheme every character ASCII represented using bit
In practice rarely used see pretty wasteful space
variable length encoding scheme widely used
We look next
What largest number represented bit
In decimal binary
The largest number Unicode character assigned actually largest possible bit number
What number decimal
Most number made using bit Unicode character attached lot wasted space
There good reason shorter number could represent character minimum number bit would need given currently around Unicode character
The largest number represented using bit around billion
You might seen number largest unsigned integer bit computer easily represent programming language The decimal number largest character
You represent current character bit
The largest number represent bit enough
If go bit give larger
Therefore need bit
encoding scheme Unicode
Characters lower Unicode number require fewer bit representation higher Unicode number
representation contain either bit
Remembering bit byte
For example character would The character would And character would The following interactive allow convert Unicode character representation
The Unicode character number also displayed
Use interactive online So actually work
Use following process interactive convert character
Lookup Unicode number character
Convert Unicode number binary number using bit necessary
Look back section binary number remember convert number binary
Count many bit binary number choose correct pattern use based many bit
Step explain use pattern
Replace x pattern bit binary number converted
If x bit replace extra x
For example wanted find representation cat Chinese step would take would follows
Therefore representation using
Just like encoding scheme Unicode
Because far complex wo explain work
However following interactive allow represent text
Try putting text English text Japanese
Compare representation get
Use interactive online We looked ASCII
The following table summarises said far representation
In order compare evaluate need decide mean representation good
Two useful criterion We know represent character ASCII represent English
Therefore ASCII fails first criterion
But second criterion simple
The following interactive allow find length piece text using
Find sample English text Asian text forum translation site good place look see long various sample encoded three representation
Copy paste type text box
Enter text length calculation Encoding length Use interactive online As general rule better English text better Asian text

Check panel think
In school art class may mixed different colour paint dye together order make new colour
In painting common use red yellow blue three primary colour mixed produce lot colour
Mixing red blue give purple red yellow give orange
By mixing red yellow blue make many new colour
For printing printer commonly use three slightly different primary colour cyan magenta yellow CMY
All colour printed document made mixing primary colour
Both kind mixing called subtractive mixing start white canvas paper subtract colour
The interactive allows experiment CMY incase familiar like mixing colour
Use interactive online Computer screen related device also rely mixing three colour except need different set primary colour starting black screen adding colour
For additive colour computer colour red green blue RGB used
Each pixel screen typically made three tiny light one red one green one blue
By increasing decreasing amount light coming three different colour made
The following interactive allows play around RGB
Use interactive online See colour make interactive
Can make black white shade grey yellow orange purple
Having slider extreme produce black white value grey
black white
Yellow might expect made red green blue
There good reason mix three primary colour specify colour pixel
The human eye million light sensor one detect colour called cone
There three different kind cone detect red blue green light respectively
Colours perceived amount red blue green light
Computer screen pixel take advantage releasing amount red blue green light perceived desired colour eye
So see purple really red blue cone eye stimulated brain convert perceived colour
Scientists still working exactly perceive colour representation used computer seem good enough give impression looking real image
For information RGB display see information eye sensing three colour see Wikipedia
Because colour simply made amount primary colour red green blue three number used specify much primary colour needed make overall colour
The word short picture element
On computer screen printer image almost always displayed using grid pixel one set required colour
A pixel typically fraction millimeter across image made million pixel one megapixel million pixel ca usually see individual pixel
Photographs commonly several megapixels
It unusual computer screen million computer need represent colour one pixel
A commonly used scheme use number range
Those number tell computer fully turn primary colour light individual pixel
If red set mean red light completely
If red light set would mean light fully
With possible value three primary colour forget count
give x x possible colour human eye detect
Think back binary number section
What special number maximum colour value
We cover answer later section still sure
The following interactive allows zoom image see pixel used represent
Each pixel solid colour square computer need store colour pixel
If zoom far enough interactive show value pixel
You pick pixel put value slider come colour pixel
Use interactive online Another exercise see relationship bit pattern colour image
The next thing need look bit used represent colour high quality image
Firstly many bit need
Secondly decide value bit
This section work problem
With different possible value amount primary colour mean bit would needed represent number
The smallest number represented using bit
And largest number represented using bit
Because three primary colour need bit represent different possible value need represent colour
So many colour total bit
We know possible value colour take easiest way calculating This
Because bit required representation called
bit colour sometimes referred setting True Color accurate human eye see
On Apple system called Millions colour
A logical way use binary number represent amount red green blue pixel
In order convert amount primary colour needed bit binary number put binary number side side give bit
Because consistency important order computer make sense bit pattern normally adopt convention binary number red put first followed green finally blue
The reason put red first convention system assume used
If everybody agreed green first would green first
For example suppose colour red green blue would like represent bit
If put value interactive get colour
Start converting three number binary using bit
You get Putting value together give bit representation colour
There three number pattern bit rather actually three binary number computer concept space bit pattern anyway everything must
You could write space make easier read represent idea likely stored byte inside computer memory sequence high low voltage even writing arbitrary notation
Also leading trailing part kept without would representing shorter number
If different possible value primary colour final representation bit long
Black white image usually two colour typically shade grey represented bit
Remember shade grey made equal amount primary colour example red green blue
So monochromatic image simply use representation single binary number tell u value primary colour set
The computer ever convert number decimal work binary directly process take bit make right pixel appear typically done graphic card printer
We started decimal easier human understand
The main point knowing representation understand made accuracy colour ideally beyond human perception amount storage bit needed little possible
If already read section otherwise section might make sense
When writing HTML code often need specify colour text background
One way specify colour name example red blue purple gold
For purpose okay
However use name limit number colour represent shade might exactly one wanted
A better way specify bit colour directly
Because binary digit hard read colour HTML use quick way write bit example
The hash sign mean interpreted hexadecimal representation since hexadecimal digit corresponds bit digit represent bit colour information
This hex triplet format used HTML page specify colour thing like background page text colour link
It also used CSS SVG application
In bit colour example earlier bit pattern
This broken group bit
And group bit need represented digit
Which give
Understanding hexadecimal colour code derived also allows change slightly without refer back colour table colour exactly one want
Remember bit color code first bit specify amount red first digit hexadecimal code next bit specify amount green next digit hexadecimal code last bit specify amount blue last digit hexadecimal code
To increase amount one colour change appropriate hexadecimal letter
For example zero red green blue setting higher value middle two digit add green colour
You use HTML page experiment hexadecimal colour
Just enter colour space Use interactive online What use fewer bit represent colour
How much space saved compared impact image
The following interactive get try match specific colour using bit bit
It possible get perfect match using bit colour
But bit
Use interactive online The system used bit specify amount red possible value bit specify amount green possible value bit specify amount blue possible value
This give total bit hence name used make different bit pattern thus represent different colour
You may wondering blue represented fewer bit red green
This human eye least sensitive blue therefore least important colour representation
The representation us bit rather bit easiest computer work full byte
Using scheme represent pixel image take one third number bit required colour good showing smooth change colour subtle shade possible color pixel
This one big tradeoff data representation allocate le space fewer bit want higher quality
The number bit used represent colour pixel particular image sometimes referred colour depth bit depth
For example image display colour depth choice colour pixel
There
Drastically reducing bit depth image make look strange sometimes used special effect called posterisation ie
making look like poster printed colour
There subtle boundary low quality data representation colour compression method
In principle reducing image colour way compress poor approach proper compression method like JPEG much better job
The following interactive show happens image use smaller range colour including right zero bit
You choose image using menu upload one
In case change quality noticeable
In
In would actually care colour image
In situation colour actually necessary
fine two colour
Use interactive online Although provide simple interactive reducing number bit image could also use software like Gimp Photoshop save file different colour depth
You probably noticed colour look particularly bad face used seeing subtle skin tone
Even colour noticably worse face
In case image almost good image unless look really carefully
They also use space would colour
For image need downloaded device internet expensive worth thinking carefully
Have experiement following interactive see impact different number bit colour
Do think bit colour right bit blue green red got bit
Use interactive online One interesting thing think whether want bit colour
It turn human eye differentiate around million colour million provided bit colour already beyond eye distinguish
However image processed software enhances contrast may turn colour sufficient
Choosing representation simple
An image represented using bit colour would bit per pixel
In x pixel image reasonable size photo would contain pixel thus would use bit
This work around megabyte
If use colour instead use third memory would save nearly megabyte storage
Or image downloaded megabyte bandwidth saved
bit colour used much anymore although still helpful situation accessing computer desktop remotely slow internet connection image desktop instead sent using bit colour instead bit colour
Even though may cause desktop appear bit strange stop getting whatever needed get done done
Seeing desktop bit colour would helpful could get work done
In country mobile internet data expensive
Every megabyte saved cost saving
There also situation colour matter example diagram black white printed image
If space really issue crude method reducing range colour usually used instead compression method JPEG GIF PNG used
These make much clever compromise reduce space image take without making look bad including choosing better palette colour use rather using simple representation discussed
However compression method require lot processing image need decoded representation discussed chapter displayed
The idea present chapter commonly come designing system graphic interface working image RAW photograph typically goal choose best representation possible without wasting much space
Have look Compression Chapter find
Before reading section understanding low level language see section chapter
In similar fashion representing text number using binary represent entire actual program using binary
Since program sequence instruction need decide many bit used represent single instruction going interpret bit
Machine code instruction typically combination two piece operation operand
In machine code program li add considered operation load integer add two integer respectively
register operand represent place store value inside machine
literal operand allow instruction represent exact integer value
If using operating system might encode instruction instruction broken piece follows Our operation always determined bit first instruction
In example machine code mean li mean add
For li operation bit interpreted storage place allowing represent
Similarly bit add instruction represent
Can figure bit instruction represent
Using bit represent program instruction data form text number image allows entire computer program represented binary format
This allows program stored disk memory transferred internet easily data
The kind image representation covered basic one used digital system main point chapter understand digital representation work compromise needed number bit storage used quality
The colour representation discussed often referred raw bitmap bmp representation
For large image real system use compression method JPEG GIF PNG reduce space needed store image point image captured displayed inevitably represented using raw bit described chapter basic choice capturing displaying image affect quality cost device
Compression regarded form encoding covered later chapter
The representation number whole area study
The choice representation affect quickly arithmetic done number accurate result much memory disk space used storing data
Even integer issue like order large number broken across multiple byte
Floating point number generally follow common standard IEEE standard common one make easy design compatible hardware process
Spreadsheets usually store number using floating point format limit precision calculation typically bit used number

Computers often represent color RGB set number called triple red green blue component integer
For example color full red green small amount blue
Write algorithm take input RGB component color return message indicating largest component component
For example input color algorithm output
And input color algorithm output
One amazing aspect computer store many different type data
Of course computer store number
But unlike simple calculator also store text store color image audio video many type data
And store many different type also analyze transmit computer
This versatility one reason computer useful affect many area life
To understand computer computer science important know something computer deal different type data
Let return color
How color stored computer
The introductory problem state one way RGB triple
This possible way
RGB one many color system
For example sometimes color represented HSV triple hue saturation value
However RGB common color representation computer program
This lead deeper issue stored computer
And important anyway understand number different type data stored processed computer
This chapter deal related question
In particular look following Upon completing chapter able following How data representation related liberal education mathematics
As might guess strong connection
Computers store data term binary base number
So understand computer necessary understand binary
Moreover need understand binary basic also complication two complement notation discussed
Binary representation important computer represent data also much computer computing based
For example see chapter machine organization

That phrase often hear used describe many way computer affecting life
Another phrase might hear
What digital revolution mean
Nowadays many device digital
We digital watch digital phone digital radio digital TVs etc
However previously many device data represented continuously variable physical quantity Think example old watch second minute hour hand moved continuously although slowly minute hour hand
Compare many watch show digital representation time
This example highlight key difference analog digital device analog device rely continuous phenomenon digital device rely discrete one
As second example difference analog radio receives audio radio broadcast signal transmitted radio digital radio receives signal stream number
The digital revolution refers many digital device us effect
These device include computer also device system play major role life communication system
Because digital device usually store number using binary number system major theme chapter binary representation data
Binary fundamental computer computer science understand computer work computer scientist think need understand binary
The first part chapter therefore cover binary basic
The second part build first explains computer store different type data
Computing fundamentally information process
Each computation certain manipulation symbol done purely mechanically blindly
If represent information using symbol know process symbol interpret result access valuable new information
In section study information representation computing
The algorithm chapter discus way describe sequence operation
Computer scientist use algorithm specify computer
But algorithm useful need data computer need way represent data
conveyed content message interpreted perceived sens cause certain mental response
Information always encoded form transmission interpretation
We deal information time
For example receive information read book listen story watch movie dream dream
We give information write email draw picture act show give speech
Information abstract conveyed concrete medium
For instance conversation phone communicates information information represented sound wave electronic signal along way
Information medium carry information must
Therefore information processed communicated must process turn information data representation using symbol
People many way represent even simple number
For example number four represented IV
How computer represent number
Or text
Or audio file
The way computer represent work number different
Since early computer history standard binary number system
Computers like binary extremely easy
However binary easy human
While time people need concerned internal representation computer use sometimes
Suppose friend spending weekend cabin
The group travel two separate car agree first group arrive leave front light make easier later group
When car arrives cabin able tell light car arrived first
The light therefore encodes two possibility group already arrived group arrived yet
To convey information could use two light
For example could mean first group arrived yet first light second indicate first group arrived left get supply first second group arrived left go fishing group arrived left
Note key idea light allow different level light multiple color option two possibility
But second want represent two choice use light
This idea powerful one
There two two distinct choice state black white present absent large small rough smooth different way representing possibility
One reason idea powerful easier build camera CDs data lowest level two possible state either
In computer representation binary digit
A collection bit called
A bitstring bit long called
Bits byte important concept computer storage data transmission later explain along related terminology concept
But first look basic question computer represents number
considered father first person studied built mathematical model information communication information
He also made many significant contribution computing
His seminal paper A mathematical theory communication changed view information laying foundation information age
Shannon discovered fundamental unit information yes answer question one bit two distinct state represented two symbol
He also founded design theory digital proving proposition Boolean algebra used build logic machine capable carrying general computation manipulation two type symbol
another term closely related information abstract concept representation information
We use information representation data interchangeably
Information represented different level
It helpful separate information representation two category external representation internal representation
External representation used communication human computer
Everything see computer monitor screen whether text image motion picture representation certain information
Computers also represent information externally using sound medium touch pad blind read text
Internally modern computer represent information bit
We think bit digit two possible value
Since bit fundamental unit information sufficient represent information
It also simplest representation two symbol needed represent two distinct value
This make easy represent bit physically device capable two distinct state work
toggle switch
We see later modern computer processor made tiny switch called transistor
When bit put together sequence represent number
We familiar representing quantity number
Numbers concrete symbol representing abstract quantity
With ten finger human conveniently adopted base ten decimal numbering system requires ten different symbol
We know decimal representation use every day
For instance arabic numeral use
Each symbol represents power ten depending position symbol
So example number one hundred
We emphasize writing power digit So take know base apply base figure binary
But first recall bit binary digit byte bit
In file binary number talk one byte long
Computers actually use one byte represent number
For example number actually represented using bit byte bit byte
The bit different value represent single bit permit value bit give value bit give value bit give value general bit give value
However looking binary example usually use bit number make example manageable
This base ten system used numbering somewhat arbitrary
In fact commonly use base system represent quantity different nature base day week base minute hour hour day ounce pound
It hard imagine base two symbol simplest base system fewer two symbol represent change therefore information
When talk decimal deal mal come
In binary two digit nary
The digit binary
You never see etc
If something wrong
A bit always
Counting binary proceeds follows An old joke run There type people world
Those understand binary
The next thing think value possible one byte
Let write power two byte As example binary number Note bit either
So two possibility leftmost bit two next bit two bit two choice bit
Multiplying possibility together give possibility
In possibility represent integer bit bit
All base system work way rightmost digit represents quantity base raised zeroth power recall anything raised power result digit left represents quantity base time larger one represented digit immediately right
The binary number represents quantity decimal rightmost represents zero contribute nothing position finally leftmost one represents
When use different base system necessary indicate base subscript avoid confusion
For example write indicate number binary represents quantity decimal
The subscript mean binary tell reader represent thousand one decimal
This example also show u representation intrinsic meaning
The pattern symbol
represent different quantity depending way interpreted
There many way represent quantity remember read nine base decimal instance symbol 九 represents quantity Chinese
As quantity represented differently often change representation without changing quantity represents
As shown binary representation equivalent decimal representation representing exactly quantity
In studying computing often need convert decimal representation familiar binary representation used internally computer
Converting binary representation integer decimal representation process summing quantity binary digit represents yield result
One task need book computer scientist often need convert decimal number binary number
The last subsection showed convert binary decimal take power whose corresponding bit add power together
Suppose want decimal binary conversion
As example let convert decimal value binary
Here one technique relies successive division We take remainder get
Since usually work group bit fill eight bit add zero front
So end
In addition storing data computer also need operation addition data
How add number binary representation
Addition bit four simple rule shown four vertical column Now binary number consisting multiple bit use four rule plus carrying
Here example Here example carried bit listed explicitly carry
When kept column solution carried added next column left
We check binary operation converting number decimal binary decimal operation number different representation
If representation operation correct result consistent
Let look one time example addition problem solved
Converting decimal produce conversion verify accuracy converting give
Adding yield converted back binary indeed
But binary addition always work right Note bit result byte
Here sum decimal Note greater maximum hold number
This result condition called
Overflow issue computer go binary number however computer bit set aside result overflow mean program might run correctly
Once let start looking single bit Notice case often want get result borrow
So let apply problem base Here binary subtraction borrowing shown Most people find binary subtraction significantly harder binary addition
You might question binary representation last section
For example negative number
What number fractional part
Are difficult human work
These good question
In couple section look representation used computer science related binary
Computers good binary
Humans
Binary hard human write hard read hard understand
But want number system easier read still closely tied binary way preserve advantage binary
One possibility base
But using base greater immediately present problem
Specifically run digit ca use greater multiple digit within
So instead use letter A B C D E F
So digit using F instead decimal instead binary
We also reexamine value place
In hexadecimal place represents power
A hexadecimal number place place
For example D place place So hexadecimal number equal decimal
Note two digit hexadecimal number however represent amount information one byte binary
That largest hex number maximum bit binary
So easier u read write
When working number time representation used clear
For example represent number ten representation decimal number two representation binary number sixteen hexadecimal number
Often representation clear context
However use subscript clarify representation used example decimal versus binary versus hexadecimal
Hexadecimal number hexadecimal digit two already seen
For example consider us following power So decimal Hexadecimal appear often used place example sometimes represent memory address see future chapter color
Why useful case
Consider RGB color bit red green blue
Since bit requires hexadecimal digit color need hexadecimal digit rather bit
For example indicates color full red component green blue
Now additional type conversion problem Here couple example involving last two
Let convert binary number hexadecimal
To break two part
Now convert part decimal get
The hexadecimal digit
Instead recall C hexadecimal representation
So hexadecimal representation
Rather going binary decimal segment hexadecimal digit could go binary hexadecimal directly
Hexadecimal digit decimal binary equivalent first base hexadecimal base decimal base binary
Now let convert hexadecimal number binary
D hexadecimal representation binary
binary
Put two part together get
Again could skip intermediate conversion using hexadecimal binary column
A piece text viewed stream symbol sequence bit resulting stream bit text
Two common encoding scheme code
ASCII code use one byte bit represent symbol represent different symbol includes English alphabet lower upper case commonly used symbol
Unicode extends ASCII code represent much larger number symbol using multiple byte
Unicode represent symbol written language much
Images audio video type data
How computer represent type data fascinating complex
For example perceptual issue type sound human hear affect many number need store reliably represent music
size issue see type data result large file size standard issue might heard JPEG GIF image format issue
We wo able cover image audio video representation depth detail complicated get sophisticated
For example JPEG image rely advanced mathematical technique called discrete cosine transform
However worth examining key point image audio video file A perceived image result light beam physically coming eye triggering nerve send signal brain
In computing image simulated grid dot called picture element particular color
This work eye tell difference original image image resolution number dot used high enough
In fact computer screen us grid pixel display image text
The largest detailed photograph galaxy ever taken unveiled
The gigantic image capture million star core Milky Way
It created data gathered Visible Infrared Survey Telescope Astronomy VISTA European Southern Observatory Paranal Observatory Chile
If printed resolution newspaper would stretch foot long foot tall team behind said resolution pixel
While galaxy image obviously extreme example illustrates image even much smaller image take significant computer space
Here mundane example
Suppose image pixel wide pixel high
Each pixel stored color
How many byte take store image
This problem describes straightforward naive way store image row column store color location
The answer pixel multiplied multiplied bit per byte million byte
Note file size
If store number photograph image know image especially collection image take considerable storage space
You might also know image take
And probably heard image storage format JPEG GIF
Why image size ten hundred kilobyte rather megabyte
Most image stored direct format using compression technique
For example suppose night image entire top half image black RGB
Rather storing many time pixel upper half image efficient use shorthand
For example rather file thousand could plus number indicating many pixel starting image read line line top bottom color
This lead compressed image image contains information original image efficient representation
For example original image would taken efficient version take compression ratio
Complicated compression standard JPEG use variety technique compress image
The technique quite sophisticated
How much image compressed
It depends number factor
For many image compression ratio say possible depends image use
For example one factor complicated image
An uncomplicated image say extreme example every pixel black compressed large amount
Richer complicated image compressed le
However even complicated image usually compressed least somewhat
Another consideration faithful compressed image original
For example many user trade small discrepancy original image compressed image smaller file size long discrepancy easily noticeable
A compression scheme lose image information called scheme
One called
Lossy compression give better compression lossless loss fidelity
In addition encoding image includes metadata size image encoding standard date time created
It hard imagine video encoded series image frame synchronized audio track also encoded using bit
Suppose minute video x pixel bit per pixel frame video per second
You use encoding store bit pixel frame video
What total file size
And suppose kilobit per second download connection long take download file
This problem highlight challenge video file
Note answer file size question pixel minute frame per second approximately Gb Gb mean giga
This giga
With kilobit per second download rate take Kbps second
This hour longer many people would like wait
And time increase number pixel per frame larger full screen display video length longer download speed slower
So video file size issue
However take hour download ten minute video image file way decrease file size transmission time
For example standard MPEG make use image compression technique decrease storage size single frame also take advantage fact scene one frame usually quite similar scene next frame
There wealth information online various compression technique standard storage medium etc
It might seem first audio file take anywhere much space video
However think complicated audio music probably wo surprised audio file also large
Sound essentially vibration collection sound wave travelling air
Humans hear sound wave frequency cycle per second
To avoid certain undesirable artifact audio file need use sample rate twice highest frequency
So example CD music usually sampled Hz time per second
And want stereo effect need sample two channel
For sample want store amplitude using enough bit give faithful representation
CDs usually use bit per sample
So minute music take sample channel byte per minute
This mean minute song take hour music take MB roughly amount memory typical CD hold
Note however want download MB song connection take come second
This long time would desirable could shorter
So surprisingly compression scheme reduce considerably
For example MPEG audio compression standard compress minute song considerable reduction
In last section saw page text could take thousand byte store
Images file might take ten thousand hundred thousand even byte
Music file take million byte
Movie file take billion
There database consist trillion quadrillion byte data
Computer science special terminology notation large number byte
Here table memory amount power two approximate American English word
There still higher number smaller quantity type
Kilobytes megabyte size important enough discussing file size computer memory size know terminology abbreviation
One caution file size usually given term kilobyte megabyte etc
However quantity computer science usually given term involving bit
For example download speed often given term bit per second
Mbps abbreviation mega megabyte per second
Notice Mbps lower case MB megabyte capitalized
In context computer memory usual definition kilobyte megabyte etc
power two
For example kilobyte byte thousand
In situation however kilobyte defined exactly thousand byte
This obviously confusing
For purpose book difference usually matter
That problem approximation close enough
So example calculation find file take byte say approximately KB unless problem statement say otherwise
All representation limited multiple way
First number different thing represent limited number combination symbol use always limited physical space available
For instance represent decimal number writing piece paper size paper size font limit many digit put
Similarly computer number bit stored physically also limited
With three binary digit generate different namely conventionally represent respectively
Keep mind representation intrinsic meaning
So three bit possibly represent seven different thing
With n bit represent different thing bit either one zero total combination get limit amount information represent
Another type limit due nature representation
For example one third never represented precisely decimal format fractional part infinite number three decimal point
Similarly one third represented precisely binary format either
In word impossible represent one third sum finite list power two
However numbering system one third represented precisely one point represent power three

Learn text image sound converted binary processed computer image sound compressed create smaller file
All data inside computer transmitted series electrical signal either
Therefore order computer able process kind data including text image sound must converted form
If data converted binary series computer simply understand able process
When key keyboard pressed need converted binary number processed computer typed character appear screen
A code number represents character used convert text binary
One code use called
The ASCII code take character keyboard assigns binary number
For example Text character start number ASCII code cover special character including punctuation return key control character well number key capital letter lower case letter
ASCII code store character enough word English enough language
If want use accent European language larger alphabet Cyrillic Russian alphabet Chinese Mandarin character needed
Therefore another code called created
This meant computer could used people using different language

Binary number system us two mutually exclusive state represent information
A binary number made element called bit one two possible state
Generally represent numeral
We also talk true false
Electrically two state might represented high low voltage form switch turned
We build binary number way build number traditional base system
However instead column column column one column two column four column column illustrated
For example represent number base know place column column column
This expressed exponent table
Or word
To represent thing binary would following table
That equates
You may wondering simple number basis amazing thing computer
Believe
The processor computer complex ultimately limited set perform value addition multiplication etc
Essentially instruction assigned number entire program add multiply divide represented stream number
For example processor know operation addition could mean add store output somewhere
The reality course much complicated see nutshell computer
In day one could see eye one zero make program stream looking hole present card
Of course moved stored via polarity small magnetic particle rather quickly tape disk onto point today carry unimaginable amount data pocket
Translating number something useful human make computer useful
For example screen made million discrete small human eye distinguish combining make complete image
Generally pixel certain red green blue component make display color
Of course value represented number course represented binary
Thus image broken million individual dot dot represented three value representing red green blue value pixel
Thus given long string number formatted correctly video hardware computer convert number electrical signal turn individual pixel hence display image
As read build entire modern computing environment basic building block
As discussed essentially choose represent anything number converted binary operated computer
For example represent letter alphabet would need least enough different combination represent lower case letter upper case letter number punctuation plus extra
Adding mean need probably around different combination
If two bit represent four possible unique combination
If three bit represent different combination
In general bit represent unique combination
bit give u unique representation enough alphabet combination
We call group bit
Guess big C variable
One byte
Given byte represent value anyone could arbitrarily make mapping character number
For example video card manufacturer could decide represents value sent video card display capital screen
A printer manufacturer might decide obscure reason represented meaning complex conversion would required display print thing
To avoid happening ASCII invented
This code meaning available code
The range code divided two major part printable
Printable character thing like character upper lower case number punctuation
code control thing like make ring terminal bell special code represents nothing
unique character sufficient American English becomes restrictive one want represent character common language especially Asian language many thousand unique character
To alleviate modern system moving away ASCII use byte represent character giving room
ASCII code leaf one bit byte spare
This used implement simple form error checking
Consider computer using input hole represents hole represents
Any inadvertent covering hole cause incorrect value read causing undefined behaviour
Parity allows simple check bit byte ensure read correctly
We implement either parity using extra bit
In odd parity number bit information odd parity bit set otherwise set
Even parity opposite number even parity bit set
In way flipping one bit case parity error detected
XXX error correcting Numbers fit byte hopefully bank balance dollar need range fit one byte
Modern architecture least computer
This mean work byte time processing reading writing memory
We refer byte analogous language letter bit make word sentence except computing every word size
The size C variable bit
Modern architecture bit double size processor work byte
Computers deal lot byte make powerful
We need way talk large number byte natural way use International System Units SI prefix used scientific area
So example kilo refers unit kilogram gram
nice round number base binary particularly round number
However round number happens quite close base meaning value kilo opposed
Thus byte naturally became known
The next SI unit mega prefix continue upwards corresponding usual grouping three digit writing large number
As happens close SI base definition mega opposed
Increasing base unit power remains functionally close SI base value although increasing factor diverges slightly base SI meaning
Thus SI unit close enough become commonly used base value
SI unit compared base base It useful commit base factor memory aid quickly correlate relationship human size
For example quickly calculate bit computer address four gigabyte memory noting recombination
A value could similarly address exabyte might interested working big number
To get feel big number calculate long would take count incremented per second
Apart confusion related overloading SI unit binary base capacity often quoted term rather byte
Generally happens talking networking storage device may noticed ADSL connection described something like
The calculation simple multiply kilo divide get byte get kilobyte kilobyte per second
The SI standardisation body recognised dual us specified unique prefix binary usage
Under standard byte short byte shortened KiB
The prefix similar prefix Mebibyte MiB example
Tradition largely prevents use term may seem literature
The easiest way convert base use computer good
However often useful know conversion hand
The easiest method convert base
To convert repeatedly divide quotient base quotient zero making note remainder step
Then write remainder reverse starting bottom appending right time
An example illustrate since converting binary use base
Reading bottom appending right time give saw previous example
George Boole mathematician discovered whole area mathematics called
Whilst made discovery mid mathematics fundamental computer science
Boolean algebra wide ranging topic present bare minimum get started
Boolean operation simply take particular input produce particular output following rule
For example simplest boolean operation simply inverts value input operand
Other operand usually take two input produce single output
The fundamental Boolean operation used computer science easy remember listed
We represent simply show possible input output
The term simply reflects binary
Usually represented simply inverts value becomes becomes To remember operation work think one input true result true To remember operation work think one input input true result true Exclusive written special case output true one one input true
This operation surprisingly many interesting trick see lot kernel
Believe essentially everything computer come back operation
For example half adder type circuit made boolean operation add bit together called half adder handle carry bit
Put half adder together start build something add together long binary number
Add external memory computer
Electronically boolean operation implemented made
This might heard transistor count thing like Moore Law
The transistor gate thing add together
To create modern computer awful lot gate awful lot transistor
Some latest Itanium processor around million transistor
In C direct interface operation
The following table describes operator We use operation variable modify bit within variable
Before see example first must divert describe hexadecimal notation
Hexadecimal refers base number system
We use computer science one reason make easy human think binary number
Computers ever deal binary hexadecimal simply shortcut u human trying work computer
So base
Well natural choice base since used thinking base every day number system
But base work well binary represent different element binary need four bit
Four bit however give u sixteen possible combination
So either take tricky road trying convert base binary take easy road make base number system hexadecimal
Hexadecimal us standard base numeral add refer
start zero
Traditionally time see number prefixed denote hexadecimal number
As mentioned represent different pattern binary would need exactly four bit
Therefore hexadecimal numeral represents exactly four bit
You consider exercise learn following table heart
Of course reason continue pattern say assign G value value excellent trade vagary human memory number bit used computer occasionally also see base used example file permission UNIX
We simply represent larger number bit numeral
For example sixteen bit variable represented find binary simply take individual numeral convert per table join together end binary number
We use reverse convert binary back hexadecimal
We also use repeated division scheme change base number
For example find hexadecimal Hence hexadecimal
Whilst binary underlying language every computer entirely practical program computer high level language without knowing first thing
However low level code interested fundamental binary principle used repeatedly
In low level code often important keep structure variable space efficient possible
In case involve effectively packing two generally related variable one
Remember bit represents two state know variable say possible state represented bit
unique value
But smallest type declare C bit either waste four bit find way use left bit
We easily process
Remembering rule logical operation become clear value extracted
The process illustrated figure
We interested lower four bit set mask bit set
Since operation set bit bit bit mask set effectively hide bit interested
To get top blue four bit would invert mask
You note give result really want value
To get bit right position use operation
bit requires operation
However rather using mask use
You draw diagram similar figure work setting bit operation
Often program large number variable exist condition
For example state machine algorithm transition number different state may one time
Say different state could easily declare different variable one state
But many case better declare assign bit flag particular state
Flags special case masking bit represents particular boolean state
An bit variable hold different flag
See code example typical example using flag see variation basic code often

In formal naming definition type property interrelationship really exist particular
Thus basically
It draw philosophical discipline established antiquity
An ontology information science compartmentalizes variable needed set computation establishes relationship
The field create ontology limit complexity organize information
The ontology applied
The knowledge density knowledge graph average number issued given entity commonly measured
The term origin applied many different way
The word element come present participle verb
The core meaning within model describing world consists set type property relationship type
There also generally expectation feature model ontology closely resemble real world related object
What ontology common computer science philosophy representation entity idea event along property relation according system category
In field considerable work problem philosophy computer science debate whether ontology viable debate philosophy project AI
Differences two largely matter focus
Computer scientist concerned establishing fixed controlled vocabulary philosopher concerned first principle whether thing whether enduring object must ontologically primary process
Other field make ontological assumption sometimes explicitly elaborated explored
For instance also sometimes called hotly debated especially primary concern also subfields
Such concern intersect information science simulation model intended enable economic decision example determine risk much see
Some claim social science explicit ontology issue hard criterion like model physical science indeed lack widely accepted hard falsification criterion defines social soft science
Historically ontology arise branch known deal nature reality exists
This fundamental branch concerned analyzing various type mode existence often special attention relation
The traditional goal ontological inquiry particular divide world joint discover fundamental category kind world object naturally fall
During second half century philosopher extensively debated possible method approach building ontology without actually elaborate ontology
By contrast computer scientist building large robust ontology comparatively little debate built
Since researcher field AI recognized capturing knowledge key building large powerful AI system
AI researcher argued could create new ontology enable certain kind
In AI community began use term refer theory modeled world component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early widely cited Web page paper Toward Principles Design Ontologies Used Knowledge Sharing credited deliberate definition technical term
Gruber introduced term mean specification conceptualization An ontology description like formal specification program concept relationship formally exist agent community agent
This definition consistent usage ontology set concept definition general
And different sense word use philosophy
According Gruber Ontologies often equated taxonomic hierarchy class class definition subsumption relation ontology need limited form
Ontologies also limited definition traditional logic sense introduce terminology add knowledge world
To specify conceptualization one need state axiom constrain possible interpretation defined term
As refinement Gruber definition Feilmayr Wöß stated An ontology formal explicit specification shared conceptualization characterized high semantic expressiveness required increased complexity
Contemporary ontology share many structural similarity regardless language expressed
As mentioned ontology describe individual instance class concept attribute relation
In section component discussed turn
Common component ontology include Ontologies commonly encoded using
A domain ontology ontology represents concept belong part world
Particular meaning term applied domain provided domain ontology
For example word many different meaning
An ontology domain would model meaning word ontology domain would model meaning
Since domain ontology represent concept specific often eclectic way often incompatible
As system rely domain ontology expand often need merge domain ontology general representation
This present challenge ontology designer
Different ontology domain arise due different language different intended usage ontology different perception domain based cultural background education ideology etc
At present merging ontology developed common foundation ontology largely manual process therefore expensive
Domain ontology use foundation ontology provide set basic element specify meaning domain ontology element merged automatically
There study generalized technique merging ontology area research still largely theoretical
An foundation ontology model common object generally applicable across wide range domain ontology
It usually employ contains term associated object description used various relevant domain set
Standardized upper ontology available use include Unified Foundational Ontology UFO

They often express ontology one many
Some provide export ontology language however
Among relevant criterion choosing ontology editor degree editor abstract actual used visual navigation possibility within
Next come facility support etc
Another important feature ability import export foreign language
Ontologies developed specific purpose application
Ontology learning automatic creation ontology including extracting domain term natural language text
As building ontology manually extremely time consuming great motivation automate process
Information extraction text mining explored automatically link ontology document example context BioCreative challenge
An used encode ontology

The development ontology Web led emergence service providing list directory ontology search facility
Such directory called ontology library
The following library ontology

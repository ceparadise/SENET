This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function

You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

Discrete mathematics least I learned collection technique algorithm relevant sort thing often need programming lot highlight
taken lot computer science course year
The single useful without doubt discrete mathematics
course unintuitive content directly applicable work industry
Well perhaps introduction algorithm intro programming
simple really
It mean talking whole number accurately thing counted
So part discrete mathematics
The go
How
Well exist talking discrete mathematics
They simply ignored
This actually make math much easier
Say want add everything exists
In mathematics opposite discrete calculation would go like In discrete mathematics equivalent calculation would go like So see latter much simpler
You add number
Graphically would amount continuous sum area red line discrete sum area blue line
Another continuous function sine wave may look like discrete function square wave might look like I tell math behind last one lot simpler
In world computer information stored bit unit information take value either
like nature something take value well
Instead everything binary
Since bit building block everything happens computer software everything becomes discrete
For instance hard drive laptop using right store bit information
Not exactly number
You half bit
The study algorithm also firmly discrete world
An algorithm list instruction computer make computer program possible
When determining much time algorithm need run count number operation need perform
Notice word
Again discrete mathematics
Discrete mathematics foundation computer science
believe anyone tell differently
Still question
Ask

Solving problem core computer science
Programmers must first understand human solves problem understand translate algorithm something computer finally write specific syntax required computer get job done
It sometimes case machine solve problem completely different way human
Computer Programmers problem solver
In order solve problem computer must Know information data describing problem
Determine step information one representation another
A computer heart really dumb
It really know thing number character booleans list called array item
See Data Types
Everything else must approximated combination data type
A good programmer encode fact necessary represent problem variable See Variables
Further good way bad way encode information
Good way allow computer easily compute new information
An algorithm see Algorithm set specific step solve problem
Think way tell year old neice play favorite song piano assuming neice never played piano would tell piano sit bench open cover key press order press etc etc etc
The core good programmer able define step necessary accomplish goal
Unfortunately computer know restricted limited set possible step
For example computer add two number
But want find average two number beyond basic capability computer
To find average must Computer scientist like use fancy word Encapsulation show smart
This term thing human every day
It combined another fancy term Abstraction
Abstraction idea ignoring detail
For example forest really vastly complex ecosystem containing tree animal water path etc etc etc
But computer scientist normal person forest
For example professor need cup coffee asks single item Get cup coffee used encapsulation abstraction
The number step required actually get coffee enumerable
Including getting walking hall getting car driving coffee stand paying coffee etc etc etc
Further idea cup coffee abstract
Do bring mug coffee Styrofoam cup
Is caffeinated
Is freshly brewed concentrate
Does come Africa America
All information would quickly unable funciton remember detail
Thus abstract away detail remember important item
This brings u idea Complexity Hiding
Complexity hiding idea time detail matter
In computer program simple idea drawing square screen involves hundred thousand low level computer instruction
Again person could possible create interesting program every time wanted something correctly every one instruction
By ecapsulating meant draw square reusing operation make programming tractable
The idea behind encapsulation store information necessary particular idea set variable associated single object
We create function manipulate object regardless actual data
From point treat idea high level rather worry part data action function necessary represent object computer
Brute force technique solving problem relies computer speed fast repeat step solve problem
For example wanted know many time number go number could following Of course silly way computer human solve problem
The real way would When doubt often use brute force solve problem often save time least computer time think problem solve elegant manner

Phase In established
This phase start requirement document delivered requirement phase map requirement architecture
The defines component interface behavior
The deliverable design document architecture
The design document describes plan implement requirement
This phase represents phase
Details computer programming language environment machine package application architecture distributed architecture layering memory size platform algorithm data structure global type definition interface many engineering detail established
The design may include usage existing component
The design phase summarized Table page
The architectural team expand upon information established requirement document
Using typical atypical scenario provided requirement document performance accomplished well complexity implementation
Obviously action done many time need done correctly efficiently
A seldom used action need implemented correctly obvious level performance required
The requirement document must guide decision process
An example seldom used action must done high performance emergency shutdown nuclear reactor
Analyzing necessary complexity allows many thing remain simple turn eventually lead higher quality product
The architecture team also convert typical scenario test plan
In approach team given complete requirement document must also indicate implementation team
A critical implementation priority lead task done right
If fails product fails
If succeeds product might succeed
At least confidence level team producing successful product increase
This keep implementation team focused
Exactly information conveyed skill based experience science based fundamental foundation
The importance priority setting become evident theory chapter presented later

process defining module interface satisfy specified
Systems design could seen application
There overlap discipline
If broader topic blend perspective marketing design manufacturing single approach product development design act taking marketing information creating design product manufactured
Systems design therefore process defining developing satisfy specified user
Until system design crucial respected role industry
In hardware software resulted ability build system
The increasing importance software running generic platform enhanced discipline
method becoming widely used method computer system design
The become standard language analysis design
It widely used modeling software system increasingly used high designing system organization
The architectural design system emphasizes design describes system analysis
The logical design system pertains abstract representation data flow input output system
This often conducted via modelling using sometimes graphical model actual system
In context system design included
Logical design includes ER diagram
The physical design relates actual input output process system
This explained term data input system processed displayed
In physical design following requirement system decided
Put another way physical portion system design generally broken three User Interface Design concerned user add information system system present information back
Data Design concerned data represented stored within system
Finally Process Design concerned data move system validated secured transformed flow system
At end system design phase documentation describing three produced made available use next phase
Physical design context refer tangible physical design information system
To use analogy personal computer physical design involves input via keyboard processing within CPU output via monitor printer etc
It would concern actual layout tangible hardware PC would monitor CPU motherboard hard drive modem card USB slot etc
It involves detailed design user product database structure processor control processor
The personal specification developed proposed system
RAD methodology system designer produce prototype
The review prototype offer feedback suitability
This process repeated satisfied final system
JAD methodology evolved RAD system designer consults group consisting following party JAD involves number stage group collectively develops agreed pattern design implementation system

For purpose project design mean visual graphical design site well implementation detail underlie
Your design document describe finished site look like make work
There alternative view design prove helpful
This view design clear detailed complete could principle mail team abroad could implement website without consulting client
The idea leave nothing implicit unspoken understanding party
An important part design set image picture want page look like perhaps common element logo navbar
You create mockups favorite editor tool Photoshop Pixlr Illustrator Power Point etc
Once done save export web image format GIF JPEG PNG upload folder named folder shared team account
Here set mockup image
If received necessary image text client logo history organization feel free use dummy image text
Hopefully fill coding
For focus layout page size alignment font color border
You use image design document picture really worth word describing page layout
The final product design phase webpage contains structured essay combination text image mockup page
The document webpage contain component Note form JavaScript application using JavaScript process form data
Do get confused
You know writing JavaScript code
Here seen still see course
Please note item must constructed entirely copied external website Web though modify code class material
Once fulfill minimum requirement code allowed get code web source attribution incorporate certain advanced component
image gallery transition count part minimum requirement
Now know design document read following section get detail part document
Your design say create clear complete concise
Design includes organization navigation site
What page
How connected
What sequence step user need take common task
For example user often visit site find next game describe path follow get information
In case requirement user find looking quickly easily solution site organizational navigational scheme allows
Important process informed knowledge user behavioral pattern studied
An excellent description design choice contain reference pattern learned reading
Design also cover layout appearance page
To guide process go back reading lecture note layout strategy
Think bit target audience remember may certain disability thus design accessibility issue mind see reading
Also remember every user precisely size screen think page layout flexible still look okay variety size
Document decision make
Do afraid specific design wo allowed change mind later
You may change mind coding document document submit along code
See
Rather duplicating code element site appear multiple page handle repetitious item using shared file JavaScript code shared file using SSI
Repetitious element include thing like Depending project achieving modularity may large task
Therefore implementation modularity shared partner since assigning one partner may result uneven work load
In professional setting many people may involved implementing website designed
To avoid stepping one another implementation must planned determining order part built time
Some part may built early allow testing subsequent part depend
We also need deadline various part management need know far team behind schedule software project almost never time
Finally need determine build part everything get built nothing get assigned two people
In project even though team two issue arise
Ideally good plan allow two teammate work independently without meet constantly discus page
call page I link
like
Thus design document must also include
The plan must cover following Our intention plan helpful make sure
A good way organize information create table column file name file description one line description deadline assigned person item
The organizational scheme similar example point clearly concrete name file
Your document saved file named uploaded folder folder team account
Use subfolder store mockup file
Make sure image saved Web format GIF PNG JPEG Photoshop proprietary format size big
Be sure submitted web page
It surprisingly common student submit work missing broken image missing CSS like
You practiced skill homework far use
Use following URL check submission If mockups large width height use attribute make fit page make link clicked show image new page
See due date
The lateness policy may turn hour late penalty
Please make change document submission deadline
While need make change design plan go separate document submitted end coding phase
Thus keep track change document
Your document include component described section
Your mockups reflect text description page close possible coded page eventually look like
We look well mockups convey purpose goal website well whether appropriate intended audience
For example one target audience child well color font image general layout speak audience cheerful bright overcrowded etc
Your writing formal clear concise
You make sure error spelling grammar punctuation mechanic writing
These example drawn earlier semester course somewhat different may helpful
Here example project featured
Notice design document close final website change described code submitted

A unit measurement express amount business functionality product provides user
Function point used compute functional size measurement FSM software
The cost dollar hour single unit calculated past project
As several recognized standard public specification sizing software based Function Point
open membership computer industry standard consortium adopted Automated Function Point AFP specification led
It provides standard automating Function Point counting according guideline International Function Point User Group However current implementation standard limitation able distinguish External Output EO External Inquiries EQ box without upfront configuration
Function point defined Allan Albrecht
The software identified one categorized one five type output inquiry input internal file external interface
Once function identified categorized type assessed complexity assigned number function point
Each functional user requirement map business function data entry Input user query Inquiry
This distinction important tends make function measured function point map easily requirement also tends hide internal function
algorithm also require resource implement
There currently ISO recognized FSM Method includes algorithmic complexity sizing result
Recently different approach proposed deal perceived weakness implemented several commercial software product
The variation IFPUG method designed make weakness include The use function point favor line code seek address several additional issue Albrecht observed research Function Points highly correlated line code resulted questioning value measure objective measure namely counting line code available
In addition multiple attempt address perceived shortcoming measure augmenting counting regimen
Others offered solution circumvent challenge developing alternative method create proxy amount functionality delivered

Software Cost Duration Estimation important factor Software Development Organizations one major specialization area software engineering research
Project Planning phase start estimate cost effort date schedule duration resource
Different technique proposed calculate rough exact cost software initial stage software development
As I mentioned chapter three method metric metric Line Source code per programming month
According instead giving answer software measurement needed focus need software measurement
Function Point goal determine functionality calculating complexity application line code
The reason behind choose Function Point Analysis enhance experience knowledge exploring area
Software development organization usually us Line Code method mostly developer aware technique
But interesting thing seen Function Point give almost exact cost precisely determine scope boundary major component
Internal Logical File External Interface File External Input External Output External Queries
FPA give estimate independent technology going use developing application
According IFPUG Reference guide another interesting thing notable FPA conducted language independent Information Technology jargon
language understandable user system developer
The important contribution Function Point thesis give confidence I go research software engineering field term Software Cost Duration Estimation
International Function Point User Group IFPUG worked hard introduce Function Point Analysis technique decompose attribute functional level classify data type data function transactional function point
Before decomposing functionality application boundary identified
Application boundary scope application
Function point basically integer assigned function comparing complexity data type complexity matrix
Hence get unadjusted function point count multiplied constant factor resulting value added factor sum point
The final figure total function point count
Software Measurement divided three tier according audience software organization Project Management Middle Management Senior Management
Project Management mostly dealing function point effort defect schedule compliance
Middle Management focusing productivity cost monitoring efficiency performance whereas Senior Management responsible time market customer satisfaction cost saving
There various technique cost estimation question arises professional technical manager avoid software estimating technique
Among reason important one lack clear communication customer software professional manager
I would go deep detail function point analysis
If I would jump detail FPA whole chapter would include definition explanation
Where necessary I would explain meaning relevance FPA term respect context
I would use methodology function point next section
For reader newbie FPA technique well aware Function Point Analysis please read tutorial mentioned

Data Communication Performance etc please read Appendix G definition understand mean
For tutorial please consult
Evaluate Adjusted Function Point count Process According formula adjusted function point count Size Function Points Unadjusted FP count Value Adjustment Factor The value UFP The Value VAF Adjusted Function Point Count The final digit give clue estimate
Let u consider I would complete function point one month
month total month taken whole function point Adjusted Function Point Count Months Regarding cost If one function point cost xxx NOK multiply xxx total number function point

Final outcome xxx zzz NOK
It certainly depends software organization
Note xxx zzz imaginary value Analysis Conformance Research Question According IFPUG recommendation estimated time increase decrease
So final outcome
This estimate I made I going start thesis
My finding supposed I finish project month nearly true
It mean finding would give exact estimate pretty close actual time
Regarding cost function case mine I developing application make difference
But let u say typical software house going develop software actual price Cost Benefit
It mean zzz Benefit
After analyzing technique understanding technique good large project term software complexity analysis
Though project small nature purpose introduce technique would create new area research contribute thesis
Wherever necessary I tried make concept clear understand FPA technique

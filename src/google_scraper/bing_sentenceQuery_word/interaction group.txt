commonly referred research design use computer technology focused interface people computer
Researchers field HCI observe way human interact computer design technology let human interact computer novel way
As field research interaction situated intersection
The term popularized seminal book although author first used term first known use
The term connotes unlike tool limited us hammer useful driving nail much else computer many us take place dialog user computer
The notion dialog likens interaction interaction analogy crucial theoretical consideration field
Humans interact computer many way interface human computer crucial facilitating
Desktop application internet browser handheld computer computer kiosk make use prevalent GUI today
Voice user interface VUI used speech recognition synthesising system emerging Graphical user interface GUI allow human engage embodied character agent way achieved interface paradigm
The growth interaction field quality interaction different branching history
Instead designing regular interface different research branch different focus concept multimodality rather unimodality intelligent adaptive interface rather based one finally active rather passive interface
For instance recently sensor like video camera eye tracker used feed physiological information human back computer system
Such information used computer dynamically adapt content interface
Thus computer could develop responsiveness cognitive load human emotion
The ACM defines interaction discipline concerned design evaluation implementation interactive computing system human use study major phenomenon surrounding
An important facet HCI securing user satisfaction simply End User Computing Satisfaction
Because interaction study human machine communication draw supporting knowledge machine human side
On machine side technique development environment relevant
On human side discipline relevant
And course engineering design method relevant
Due multidisciplinary nature HCI people variety different background contribute success
HCI also sometimes termed HMI MMI CHI
Poorly designed lead many unexpected problem
A classic example nuclear meltdown accident investigation concluded design interface least partly responsible disaster
Similarly accident aviation resulted manufacturer decision use throttle quadrant layout even though new design proposed superior basic interaction pilot already ingrained standard layout thus conceptually good idea actually undesirable result
interaction study way human make make use computational artifact system infrastructure
In much research field seek interaction improving computer interface
How usability precisely understood relates social cultural value may desirable property computer interface increasingly debated
Much research field interaction take interest Visions researcher field seek achieve vary
When pursuing cognitivist perspective researcher HCI may seek align computer interface mental model human activity
When pursuing perspective researcher HCI may seek align computer interface existing social practice existing sociocultural value
Researchers HCI interested developing new design methodology experimenting new device prototyping new software hardware system exploring new interaction paradigm developing model theory interaction
HCI differs HCI focus user working specifically computer rather kind machine designed artifact
There also focus HCI implement computer software hardware mechanism support interaction
Thus broader term HCI could described human factor computer although expert try differentiate area
HCI also differs human factor le focus repetitive task procedure much le emphasis physical stress physical form user interface
Three area study substantial overlap HCI even focus inquiry shift
In study PIM human interaction computer placed larger informational context people may work many form information many whiteboards notebook sticky note refrigerator magnet order understand effect desired change world
In CSCW emphasis placed use computing system support collaborative work group people
The principle HIM extend scope CSCW organizational level implemented without use computer
When evaluating current designing new user interface important keep mind following experimental design principle Repeat iterative design process sensible interface created
A number diverse methodology outlining technique emerged since rise field
Most design methodology stem model user designer technical system interact
Early methodology example treated user cognitive process predictable quantifiable encouraged design practitioner look cognitive science result area memory attention designing user interface
Modern model tend focus constant feedback conversation user designer engineer push technical system wrapped around type experience user want rather wrapping around completed system
Displays artifact designed support perception relevant system variable facilitate processing information
Before display designed task display intended support must defined
navigating controlling decision making learning entertaining etc
A user operator must able process whatever information system generates display therefore information must displayed according principle manner support perception situation awareness understanding
Christopher Wickens et al
defined principle display design book
These principle human perception information processing utilized create effective display design
A reduction error reduction required training time increase efficiency increase user satisfaction many potential benefit achieved utilization principle
Certain principle may applicable different display situation
Some principle may seem conflicting simple solution say one principle important another
The principle may tailored specific design situation
Striking functional balance among principle critical effective design

A display legibility critical necessary designing usable display
If character object displayed discernible operator effectively make use

Do ask user determine level variable basis single sensory variable
colour size loudness
These sensory variable contain many possible level

Signals likely perceived interpreted accordance expected based user experience
If signal presented contrary user expectation physical evidence signal may need presented assure understood correctly

If signal presented likely understood correctly
This done presenting signal alternative physical form
colour shape voice print etc
redundancy imply repetition
A traffic light good example redundancy colour position redundant

Signals appear similar likely confused
The ratio similar feature different feature cause signal similar
For example similar
Unnecessarily similar feature removed dissimilar feature highlighted

A display look like variable represents
high temperature thermometer shown higher vertical level
If multiple element configured manner look like would represented environment

Moving element move pattern direction compatible user mental model actually move system
For example moving element altimeter move upward increasing altitude

When user attention diverted one location another access necessary information associated cost time effort
A display design minimize cost allowing frequently accessed source located nearest possible position
However adequate legibility sacrificed reduce cost

Divided attention two information source may necessary completion one task
These source must mentally integrated defined close mental proximity
Information access cost low achieved many way
proximity linkage common colour pattern shape etc
However close display proximity harmful causing much clutter

A user easily process information across different resource
For example visual auditory information presented simultaneously rather presenting visual auditory information

A user need retain important information solely working memory retrieve memory
A menu checklist another display aid user easing use memory
However use memory may sometimes benefit user eliminating need reference type knowledge world expert computer operator would rather use direct command memory refer manual
The use knowledge user head knowledge world must balanced effective design

Proactive action usually effective reactive action
A display attempt eliminate cognitive task replace simpler perceptual task reduce use user mental resource
This allow user focus current condition consider possible future condition
An example predictive aid road sign displaying distance certain destination

Old habit display easily transfer support processing new display designed consistently
A user memory trigger action expected appropriate
A design must accept fact utilize consistency among different display
The interface described point communication human user computer
The flow information human computer defined
The loop interaction several aspect including Topics HCI include study ordinary user could routinely tailor application need use power invent new application based understanding domain
With deeper knowledge knowledge domain user could increasingly important source new application expense generic system programmer system expertise low domain expertise
Computation passing beyond computer every object us found
Embedded system make environment alive little computation automated process computerized cooking appliance lighting plumbing fixture window blind automobile braking system greeting card
To extent development already taking place
The expected difference future addition networked communication allow many embedded computation coordinate user
embedded device many case different appropriate workstation
A common staple science fiction augmented reality refers notion layering relevant information vision world
Existing project show statistic user performing difficult task manufacturing
Future work might include augmenting social interaction providing additional information converse
In recent year explosion social science research focusing interaction unit analysis
Much research draw psychology social psychology sociology
For example one study found people expected computer man name cost machine woman name
Other research find individual perceive interaction computer positively human despite behaving way towards machine
In human computer interaction usually exists semantic gap human computer understanding towards mutual behavior
formal representation knowledge used address problem solving semantic ambiguity two party
Traditionally explained journal article discussing user modeling interaction computer use modeled dyad two connected narrow explicit communication channel terminal
Much work done make interaction computing system human reflective multidimensional nature everyday communication

interaction HCI area research practice emerged early initially specialty area computer science embracing engineering
HCI expanded rapidly steadily three decade attracting professional many discipline incorporating diverse concept approach
To considerable extent HCI aggregate collection field research practice informatics
However continuing synthesis disparate conception approach science practice HCI produced dramatic example different epistemology paradigm reconciled integrated vibrant productive intellectual project
Until late human interacted computer information technology professional dedicated hobbyist
This changed disruptively emergence personal computing later
Personal computing including personal software productivity application text editor spreadsheet interactive computer game personal computer platform operating system programming language hardware made everyone world potential computer user vividly highlighted deficiency computer respect wanted use computer tool
Personal computing rapidly pushed computer use general population starting later
However computer user often subjected arcane command system dialog
The challenge personal computing became manifest opportune time
The broad project cognitive science incorporated cognitive psychology linguistics cognitive anthropology philosophy mind formed end
Part programme cognitive science articulate systematic scientifically informed application known cognitive engineering
Thus point personal computing presented practical need HCI cognitive science presented people concept skill vision addressing need ambitious synthesis science engineering
HCI one first example cognitive engineering
The Model Human Processor early cognitive engineering model intended help developer apply principle cognitive psychology
This facilitated analogous development engineering design area adjacent HCI fact often overlapping HCI notably human factor engineering documentation development
Human factor developed empirical technique evaluating interaction domain aviation manufacturing moving address interactive system context human operator regularly exerted greater discretion
Documentation development moving beyond traditional role producing systematic technical description toward cognitive approach incorporating theory writing reading medium empirical user testing
Documents information needed usable also
Minimalist information emphasized supporting activity domain
Instead topic hierarchy structured practice emphasized succinct support action recognizing recovering error
Other historically fortuitous development contributed establishment HCI
Software engineering mired unmanageable software complexity software crisis starting focus nonfunctional requirement including maintainability empirical software development process relied heavily iterative prototyping empirical testing
Computer graphic information retrieval emerged rapidly came recognize interactive system key progressing beyond early achievement
All thread development computer science pointed conclusion The way forward computing entailed understanding better empowering user
These diverse force need opportunity converged around focusing huge burst human energy creating highly visible interdisciplinary project
The original abiding technical focus HCI concept
This concept originally articulated somewhat naively slogan easy learn easy use
The blunt simplicity conceptualization gave HCI edgy prominent identity computing
It served hold field together help influence computer science technology development broadly effectively
However inside HCI concept usability reconstructed almost continually become increasingly rich intriguingly problematic
Usability often subsumes quality like fun well collective efficacy aesthetic tension enhanced creativity flow support human development others
A dynamic view usability one programmatic objective continue develop ability reach toward improves
Usability emergent quality reflects grasp reach HCI
Contemporary user want system merely ease use
Although original academic home HCI computer science original focus personal productivity application mainly text editing spreadsheet field constantly diversified outgrown boundary
It quickly expanded encompass visualization information system collaborative system system development process many area design
HCI taught many address information technology including psychology design communication study cognitive science information science science technology study geographical science management information system industrial manufacturing system engineering
HCI research practice draw upon integrates perspective
A result growth HCI le singularly focused respect core concept method problem area assumption infrastructure application type user
Indeed longer make sense regard HCI specialty computer science HCI grown broader larger much diverse computer science
HCI expanded initial focus individual generic user behavior include social organizational computing accessibility elderly cognitively physically impaired people widest possible spectrum human experience activity
It expanded desktop office application include game learning education commerce health medical application emergency planning response system support collaboration community
It expanded early graphical user interface include myriad interaction technique device interaction tool support user interface specification host emerging ubiquitous handheld interaction
There unified concept HCI professional
In cognitive science side HCI sometimes contrasted software tool user interface side HCI
The landscape core HCI concept skill far differentiated complex
HCI academic program train many different type professional user experience designer interaction designer user interface designer application designer usability engineer user interface developer application developer technical information designer
And indeed many HCI quite diverse
For example ubiquitous computing aka ubicomp subarea HCI also superordinate area integrating several distinguishable subareas example mobile computing information system system community informatics distributed system handhelds wearable device ambient intelligence sensor network specialized view usability evaluation programming tool technique application infrastructure
The relationship ubiquitous computing HCI paradigmatic HCI name community community
Two visualization variety disciplinary knowledge skill involved contemporary design interaction Indeed principle HCI community community point definition codified example organization major HCI conference journal
The integrating element across HCI community continues close linkage critical analysis usability broadly understood development novel technology application
This defining identity commitment HCI community
It allowed HCI successfully cultivate respect diversity skill concept underlie innovative technology development regularly transcend disciplinary obstacle
In early HCI small focused specialty area
It cabal trying establish heretical view computing
Today HCI vast multifaceted community bound evolving concept usability integrating commitment value human activity experience primary driver technology
Given contemporary shape HCI important remember origin personal productivity interaction bound desktop word processing spreadsheet
Indeed one biggest design idea early messy desk metaphor popularized Apple Macintosh Files folder displayed icon could scattered around display surface
The messy desktop perfect incubator developing paradigm graphical user interface
Perhaps quite easy learn easy use claimed people everywhere soon double clicking dragging window icon around display losing track thing desktop interface physical desktop
It surely stark contrast immediately prior teletype metaphor Unix interaction accomplished typing command
The early Macintosh desktop metaphor Icons scattered desktop depict document function selected accessed System Disk example Even though definitely argued desktop metaphor superficial perhaps design paradigm captured imagination designer public
These new possibility many people pundit speculated might change office work
Indeed tsunami desktop design challenged sometimes threatened expertise work practice office worker
Today cultural background
Children learn concept skill routinely
As HCI developed moved beyond desktop three distinct sens
First desktop metaphor proved limited first seemed
It fine directly represent couple dozen digital object icon approach quickly lead clutter useful people thousand personal file folder
Through HCI professional everyone else realized search fundamental paradigm browsing finding thing user interface
Ironically though early World Wide Web page emerged dropped messy desktop metaphor part dropped graphical interaction entirely
And still seen breakthrough usability course direct contrast tool like ftp telnet
The design approach displaying directly interacting data object icon disappeared longer hegemonic design concept
The early popularity messy desktop personal information space scale
The second sense HCI moved beyond desktop growing influence Internet computing society
Starting email emerged one important HCI application ironically email made computer network communication channel people interacting computer interacting people computer
Tools application support collaborative activity include instant messaging wikis blog online forum social networking social bookmarking tagging service medium space collaborative workspace recommender collaborative filtering system wide variety online group community
New paradigm mechanism collective activity emerged including online auction reputation system soft sensor crowd sourcing
This area HCI often called social computing one rapidly developing
A huge expanding variety social network service part everyday computing experience many people
Online community Linux community GitHub employ social computing produce knowledge work
The third way HCI moved beyond desktop continual occasionally explosive diversification ecology computing device
Before desktop application consolidated new kind device context emerged notably laptop began appear early handhelds began appear
One frontier today ubiquitous computing The pervasive incorporation computing human habitat car home appliance furniture clothing forth
Desktop computing still important though desktop habitat transformed wide use laptop
To considerable extent desktop moved desktop
Computing moved desktop everywhere time
Computers phone car meeting room coffee shop
The focus HCI moved beyond desktop focus continue move
HCI technology area ineluctably driven frontier technology application possibility
The special value contribution HCI investigate develop harness new area possibility merely technology design mean enhancing human activity experience
The movement HCI desktop example pattern technology development replicated throughout HCI many level analysis
HCI address dynamic activity people engage experience artifact interactive tool environment mediate activity
HCI understanding critically evaluating interactive technology people use experience
But also interaction evolve people appropriate technology expectation concept skill develop articulate new need new interest new vision agenda interactive technology
Reciprocally HCI understanding contemporary human practice aspiration including activity embodied elaborated also perhaps limited current infrastructure tool
HCI understanding practice activity specifically requirement design possibility envisioning bringing new technology new tool environment
It exploring design space realizing new system device activity artifact cycle
Human activity implicitly articulate need preference design vision
Artifacts designed response inevitably merely respond
Through course adoption appropriation new design provide new possibility action interaction
Ultimately activity articulates human need preference design vision
Understanding HCI inscribed activity technological artifact useful
Most simply reminds u HCI like infrastructure HCI including concept method focal problem stirring success always flux
Moreover activity artifact shaped cascade contingent initiative across diverse collection actor reason expect HCI convergent predictable
This say progress HCI random arbitrary like world history like physic
One could see quite optimistically Individual collective initiative shape HCI law physic
Smalltalk programming language environment project Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
The work handful people became direct antecedent modern graphical user interface
A second implication cycle continual exploration new application application domain new design design paradigm new experience new activity remain highly prized HCI
We may sense know going today given apparent rate activity artifact effective probably le think
Moreover since effect constructing future trajectory finding cost misstep high
The activity artifact evidence strong hysteresis say effect past adjustment persist far future
For example many people struggle every day operating system core productivity application whose design evolutionary reaction misanalyses two decade ago
Of course impossible always right respect value criterion emerge coalesce future least mindful consequential misstep possible
The Drift Table interactive coffee table aerial view England Wales displayed porthole top placing moving object table cause aerial imagery scroll
This design intended provoke reaction challenge thinking domestic technology
The remedy consider many alternative every point progression
It vitally important lot work exploring possible experience activity example design experience probe prototype
If focus strongly affordances currently embodied technology easily uncritically accepting constraint limit contemporary HCI well future trajectory
Siri intelligent assistant Apple iPhone augmented reality glass Goggle Project Glass recent example technology vision turned everyday HCI experience
HCI fundamentally law nature
Rather manages innovation ensure human value human priority advanced diminished new technology
This created HCI led HCI desktop continue lead HCI new region human possibility
This usability concept never reduced fixed checklist
The contingent trajectory HCI project transforming human activity experience design nonetheless remained closely integrated application development theory social cognitive science
Even though extent technology human activity issue HCI continually domain served laboratory incubator theory
The origin HCI early case study cognitive engineering imprinting effect character endeavor
From start model theory framework developed used HCI pursued contribution science HCI enriched every theory appropriated
For example GOMS Goals Operations Methods Selection rule model earliest native theory HCI comprehensive cognitive model attempted elsewhere cognitive science engineering model human processor included simple aspect perception attention memory operation planning motor behavior single model
But GOMS also practical tool articulating dual criterion scientific contribution engineering design efficacy become culture theory application HCI
CogTool analyzes demonstration user task produce model cognitive process underlying task performance model predicts expert performance time task
The focus theory development application moved throughout history HCI focus activity artifact moved
á Thus early information psychological theory like GOMS employed model cognition behavior individual interacting keyboard simple display pointing device
This initial conception HCI theory broadened interaction became varied application became richer
For example perceptual theory marshaled explain object recognized graphical display mental model theory appropriated explain role concept like messy desktop metaphor shaping interaction active user theory developed explain user learn making sense interaction
In case however elaboration scientific advance base better tool design practice
This dialectic theory application continued HCI
It easy identify dozen major current theory grouped roughly three era theory view interaction information processing theory view interaction initiative agent pursuing project theory view interaction socially materially embedded rich context
To extent sequence theory understood convergence scientific opportunity application need Codifying using relatively austere model made clear richer view people interaction could articulated could contribute time personal device became portal interaction social physical world requiring richer theoretical framework analysis design
Through past three decade series theoretical paradigm emerged address expanding ambition HCI research design product development
Successive theory challenged enriched prior conception people interaction
All theory still relevant still use today HCI
The sequence theory era course somewhat idealized
People still work GOMS model indeed major model theory framework ever employed HCI still current use
Indeed continue develop context field develops
GOMS today niche model paradigm HCI recently applied research smart phone design interaction
The challenge integrating least better coordinating descriptive explanatory science goal prescriptive constructive design goal abiding HCI
There least three ongoing direction traditional application deeper basic theory development local sometimes domain dependent within particular design domain use design rationale mediating level description basic science design practice
One significant achievement HCI evolving model integration research practice
Initially model articulated reciprocal relation cognitive science cognitive engineering
Later ambitiously incorporated diverse science foundation notably social organizational psychology Activity Theory distributed cognition sociology ethnographic approach human activity including activity design technology development appropriation
Currently model incorporating design practice research across broad spectrum example theorizing user experience ecological sustainability
In development HCI provides blueprint mutual relation science practice unprecedented
Although HCI always talked design science pursuing guidance designer construed first boundary HCI research design separate contributing area professional expertise
Throughout however HCI directly assimilated eventually spawned series design community
At first merely ecumenical acceptance method technique laying beyond science engineering
But outreach impulse coincided substantial advance user interface technology shifted much potential proprietary value user interface graphical design much richer ontology user experience
Somewhat ironically designer welcomed HCI community time help remake design discipline
A large part transformation creation design discipline issue exist
For example user experience design interaction design imported HCI rather among first export HCI design world
Similarly analysis productive tension creativity rationale design required design field like HCI essential design internal logic systematically evaluated maintained yet time provoke new experience insight
á Design currently facet HCI rapid flux
It seems likely new design emerge HCI next decade
No one accuse HCI resting laurel
Conceptions underlying science informs informed world practice activity evolved continually HCI since inception
Throughout development HCI scientific epistemological revision deliberately embraced field measure succeeding intellectually practically
The result increasingly fragmented complex field continued succeed even
This example contradicts Kuhnian view intellectual project develop paradigm eventually overthrown
The continuing success HCI community moving forward thus profound implication informatics epistemology

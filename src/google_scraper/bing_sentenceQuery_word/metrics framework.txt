In providing generic functionality selectively changed additional code thus providing software
A software framework provides standard way build deploy application
A software framework universal reusable provides particular functionality part larger facilitate development product solution
Software framework may include support program compiler code library tool set bring together different enable development
Frameworks key distinguishing feature separate normal The designer software framework aim facilitate software development allowing designer programmer devote time meeting software requirement rather dealing standard detail providing working system thereby reducing overall development time
For example team using develop banking website focus writing code particular banking rather mechanic request handling
Frameworks often add size program phenomenon termed
Due driven application need competing complementary framework sometimes end product
Further due complexity APIs intended reduction overall development time may achieved due need spend additional time learning use framework criticism clearly valid special new framework first encountered development staff
If framework used subsequent job taskings time invested learning framework cost code familiar project staff many programmer keep copy useful boilerplate common need
However framework learned future project faster easier complete concept framework make solution set familiarity code production logically rise
There claim made size code eventually bundled output product relative efficiency conciseness
Using library solution necessarily pull extra unused extraneous asset unless software linker making tight small wholly controlled specified executable module
The issue continues industry experience shown effective framework turn evolve common code enterprise instead using generic framework developed third party general purpose
An example would user interface application package office suite grows common look feel attribute method disparate bundled application grow unified suite tighter smaller suite product share integral utility library user interface
This trend controversy brings important issue framework
Creating framework elegant versus one merely solves problem still art rather science
Software implies clarity conciseness little waste extra extraneous functionality much user defined
For framework generate code example elegance would imply creation code clean comprehensible reasonably knowledgeable programmer therefore readily modifiable versus one merely generates correct code
The elegance issue relatively software framework stood test time best framework able evolve gracefully underlying technology built advanced
Even evolved many package retain legacy capability bloating final software otherwise replaced method retained parallel newer method
Software framework typically contain considerable housekeeping utility code order help bootstrap user application generally focus specific problem domain According Pree software framework consist
define overall architecture software system say basic component relationship
These remain unchanged frozen instantiation application framework
represent part programmer using framework add code add functionality specific project
In environment framework consists
framework consists existing class
When developing concrete software system software framework developer utilize hot spot according specific need requirement system
Software framework rely Do call u call
This mean class example new subclass receive message predefined framework class
Developers usually handle implementing

Measuring software reliability one important concern software engineer decision maker since ca measure ca master
For engineer system reliability level used measure progress system testing comparing current software failure intensity desired one
For decision maker system reliability level Guarantee better exploitation user therefore better customer satisfaction
A literature review show lack study focusing reliability measurement process related software development life cycle SDLC
In paper intention propose thoroughly analysis software reliability measurement process
Since current software measurement trend focusing software metric propose new framework reliability measurement based software metric
This new framework required developer ass software reliability decision maker make appropriate quality improvement

Images either vector bitmap
Bitmap image made small part called pixel
Vector image made using coordinate geometry
Images compressed reduce file size
used reduce file size change various attribute image file
These attribute include You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
An explanation lossy lossless compression Compression
Lossless compression mean file size compressed picture quality remains get worse
Also file decompressed original quality
Lossy compression permanently remove data
There number type compressed image file
These include following
compression type
It often used graphic might changed another person image contains layer graphic need kept separate
It
often used digital camera image fairly small file size quality display
JPEG format offer higher compression rate PNG quality
compress image maximum making
GIF often used transparency needed graphic
GIF also used store simple animated image

Data compression reduces amount space needed store file
If halve size file store twice many file cost download file twice fast half cost paying download
Even though disk getting bigger high bandwidth becoming common nice get even value working smaller compressed file
For large data warehouse like kept Google Facebook halving amount space taken represent massive reduction space computing required consequently big saving power consumption cooling huge reduction impact environment
Common form compression currently use include JPEG used photo used audio MPEG used video including DVDs ZIP many kind data
For example JPEG method reduces photo tenth smaller original size mean camera store time many photo image web downloaded time faster
So catch
Well issue quality data example highly compressed JPEG image look sharp image compressed
Also take processing time compress decompress data
In case tradeoff worth always
Kb JPEG Kb JPEG Use interactive online In chapter look compression might done benefit cost associated using compressed data need considered deciding whether compress data
We start simple example Run Length Encoding give insight benefit issue around compression
Watch video online Run length encoding RLE technique widely used day great way get feel issue around using compression
Imagine following simple black white image
One simple way computer store image binary using format mean white mean black bit map mapped pixel onto value bit
Using method image would represented following way There image format us simple representation described
The format called portable bitmap format PBM
PBM file saved file extension contain simple header followed image data
The data file viewed opening text editor much like opening file image viewed opening drawing image viewing program support PBM file format well supported number image viewing editing program display
A pbm file diamond image used earlier would follows The first two line header
The first line specifies format file mean file contains ASCII zero one
The second line specifies width height image pixel
This allows computer know size dimension image even newline character separating row file missing
The rest data image like
If wanted could copy paste representation including header text file save file extension
If program computer able open PBM file could view image
You could even write program output file display image
Because digit represented using ASCII format efficient useful want read inside file
There variation format pack pixel bit instead character variation used grey scale colour image
More
The key question compression whether represent image using fewer bit still able reconstruct original image
It turn
There many way going section focussing method called
Imagine read bit someone copying might say thing like five zero instead zero zero zero zero zero
Is basic idea behind run length encoding RLE used save space storing digital image
In run length encoding replace row number say many consecutive pixel colour
For example first row image contains one white two black four white one black four white two black one white pixel
This could represented follows
For second row need say number white pixel say number black need explicitly say zero start row
You might ask need say number white pixel first case zero
The reason clear rule start computer would way knowing colour display image represented form
The third row contains five white five black five white
This coded That mean get following representation first three row
You work row would following system
The remaining row In video Computer Science Unplugged show Run length encoded image decoded using large pixel printer spray
Watch video online Just ensure reverse compression process go finding original representation zero one compressed image
What image
How many pixel original image
How many number used represent pixel
This image solution available activity cup saucer
The following interactive allows experiment Run Length Encoding
Use interactive online How much space saved using alternate representation measure
One simple way consider imagine typing representation could think original bit stored one character RLE code using character digit comma bit crude starting point
In original representation digit one zero required represent image
Count number comma digit space newlines ignore new representation
This number character required represent image new representation ensure right track first row given contain character
Assuming got new image representation correct counted correctly found character new image double check number differs
This mean new representation requires around many character represent calculated using
This significant reduction amount space required store image half size
The new representation form old one
In practice method extra trick used compress image original size
In real system original image us one bit every pixel store black white value one character used calculation
However run length number also stored much efficiently using bit pattern take little space represent number
The bit pattern used usually based technique called Huffman coding beyond want get
The main place black white scanned image used fax machine use approach compression
One reason work well scanned page number consecutive white pixel huge
In fact entire scanned line nothing white pixel
A typical fax page pixel across replacing bit one number big saving
The number take bit represent place scanned page consecutive pixel replaced number overall saving significant
In fact fax machine would take time longer send page use compression
Now know run length encoding work come compress black white image well uncompress image somebody else given
Start making picture one zero
Make sure rectangular row length
You either draw paper prepare computer using fixed width font otherwise become really frustrating confusing
In order make easier could start working want image grid paper math exercise book shading square represent black one leaving blank represent white one
Once done could write zero one image
Work compressed representation image using run length coding
run length separated comma form explained
Now give copy run length code original uncompressed representation friend classmate along explanation compressed
Ask try draw image grid paper
Once done check conversion original
Imagining friend computer shown image using system representation compressed one computer decompressed another long standard agreed
every line begin white pixel
It important compression algorithm follow standard file compressed one computer decompressed another example song often follow standard downloaded played variety device
As compressed representation image converted back original representation original representation compressed representation would give image read computer compression algorithm called
none data lost compressing image result compression could undone exactly
Not compression algorithm lossless though
In type file particular photo sound video willing sacrifice little bit quality
lose little data representing image allows u make file size lot smaller
For downloading large file movie essential ensure file size big infeasible download
These compression method called
If data lost impossible convert file back exactly original form lossy compression used person viewing movie listening music may mind lower quality file smaller
Later chapter investigate effect lossy compression algorithm image sound
Interestingly turn compression algorithm case compressed version file larger uncompressed version
Computer scientist even proven case meaning impossible anybody ever come lossless compression algorithm make possible file smaller
In case issue though good lossless compression algorithm tend give best compression common pattern data worst compression one highly unlikely occur
What image best compression
image size small percentage original come
This best case performance compression algorithm
What worst compression
Can find image actually compressed representation
Don forget comma version used
This worst case performance compression algorithm
The best case image entirely white one number used per line
The worst case every pixel alternating black white one number every pixel
In fact case size compressed file likely little larger original one number likely take one bit store
Real system represent data exactly discussed issue
In worst case alternating black white pixel run length encoding method result file larger original
As noted lossless compression method make least one file smaller must also file make larger mathematically possible method always make file smaller unless method lossy
As trivial example suppose someone claim compression method convert file file
How many different file
There
How many different file
There
Can see problem
We got possible file might want compress way represent
So identical representation ca decoded exactly
Over year several fraud based claim lossless compression method compress every file given
This true method lossy loses information lossless method must expand file
It would nice file could compressed without loss could compress huge file apply compression compressed file make smaller repeating one byte one bit
Unfortunately possible
Images take lot space time picture stored computer compressed avoid wasting much space
With lot image especially photograph need store image exactly originally contains way detail anyone see
This lead considerable saving space especially detail missing kind people trouble perceiving
This kind compression called lossy compression
There situation image need stored exactly original medical scan high quality photograph processing case lossless method used image compressed
using RAW format camera
In data representation section looked size image file reduced using fewer bit describe colour pixel
However image compression method JPEG take advantage pattern image reduce space needed represent without impacting image unnecessarily
The following three image show difference reducing bit depth using specialised image compression system
The left hand image original bit per pixel
The middle image compressed one third original size using JPEG lossy version original difference unlikely perceptible
The right hand one number colour reduced bit per pixel instead mean also stored third original size
Even though lost many bit information removed much impact look
This advantage JPEG remove information image much impact perceived quality
Furthermore JPEG choose tradeoff quality file size
Reducing number bit colour depth sufficiently crude really regard compression method low quality representation
Image compression method like JPEG GIF PNG designed take advantage pattern image get good reduction file size without losing quality necessary
For example following image show zoomed view pixel part detail around eye high quality image
Notice colour adjacent pixel often similar even part picture lot detail
For example pixel shown red box change gradually dark light
encoding would work situation
You could use variation specifies pixel colour say many following pixel colour although adjacent pixel nearly chance identical low would almost run identical colour
But way take advantage gradually changing colour
For pixel red box could generate approximate version colour specifying first last one getting computer calculate one assuming colour change gradually
Instead storing pixel value needed yet someone viewing probably might notice difference
This would ca reproduce original exactly would good enough lot purpose save lot space
The process guessing colour pixel two known example
A interpolation assumes value increase constant rate two given value example five pixel suppose first pixel blue colour value last one blue value linear interpolation would guess blue value one would save storing
In practice complex approach used guess pixel linear interpolation give idea going
The JPEG system widely used photo us sophisticated version idea
Instead taking run pixel work block pixel
And instead estimating value linear function us combination cosine wave
A cosine wave form trig function often used calculating side triangle
If plot cosine value degree get smooth curve going
Variations plot used approximate value pixel going one colour another
If add higher frequency cosine wave produce interesting shape
In theory pattern pixel created adding together different cosine wave
The following graph show value ranging degree
JPEGs based idea add together lot sine cosine wave create waveform want
Converting waveform block pixel sample music sum simple wave done using technique called widely used idea signal processing
You experiment adding sine wave together generate shape using
In spreadsheet yellow region first sheet allows choose sine wave add
Try setting sine wave frequency time fundamental frequency respectively fundamental lowest frequency
Now set amplitude equivalent volume level four respectively half previous one
This produce following four sine wave When four wave added together interfere produce shape sharper transition In fact continue pattern four sine wave shape would become square wave one suddenly go maximum value suddenly minimum
The one shown bumpy used sine wave describe
This exactly going JPEG compress black white image
The colour pixel go across image either black full intensity white JPEG approximate small number cosine wave basically property sine wave
This give overshoot see image JPEG image come bright dark patch surrounding sudden change colour like You experiment different combination sine wave get different shape
You may need four get good approximation shape want exactly tradeoff JPEG making
There suggestion parameter second sheet spreadsheet
Each block pixel JPEG image created adding together different amount pattern based cosine wave
The wave represented visually pattern white black pixel shown image
These particular wave known basis function block pixel created combining
The basis function top left average colour block
By adding increasing coefficient multiplied resultant block become darker
The basis function become complex towards bottom right therefore used le commonly
How often would image every pixel different color bottom right basis function
To investigate basis function combined form pattern block pixel try puzzle
Use interactive online So pixel block represented coefficient tell u much basis function use
But help u save space compress image
At moment still storing exactly amount data different way
The name JPEG short Joint Photographic Experts Group committee formed create standard digital photograph could captured displayed different brand device
Because file extension limited three character often seen extension
The cosine wave used JPEG image based Discrete Cosine Transform
The Discrete mean waveform digital opposite continuous value occur
In JPEG wave x value block coded value limited range number binary integer rather value
The advantage using DCT representation allows u separate low frequency change top left one high frequency change bottom right JPEG compression us advantage
The human eye usually notice high frequency change image often discarded without affecting visual quality image
The low frequency le varied basis function far important image
JPEG compression us process called quantisation set insignificant basis function coefficient zero
But decide insignificant
Quantisation requires quantisation table number
Each coefficient value divided corresponding value quantisation table rounded nearest integer
This mean many coefficient become zero multiplied back quantisation table remain zero
There optimal quantisation table every image many camera image processing company worked develop good quantisation table
As result many kept secret
Some company also developed software analyse image select appropriate quantisation table particular image
For example image text high frequency detail important quantisation table lower value bottom right detail kept
Of course also result image size remaining relatively large
Lossy compression compromise
The figure show image quantisation applied
Before Quantisation After Quantisation Notice image look similar even though second one many zero coefficient
The difference see barely visible image viewed original size
Try Use interactive online We still number even many zero save space storing zero
You notice zero bunched towards bottom right
This mean list coefficient starting top left corner end many zero row
Instead writing zero store fact zero using method encoding similar one discussed earlier chapter
And finally number left converted bit using Huffman coding common value take le space vice versa
All thing happen every time take photo save JPEG file happens every block pixel
When display image software need reverse process adding basis function together block hundereds thousand block image
An important issue arises JPEG represents image smoothly varying colour happens colour change suddenly
In case lot value need stored lot cosine wave added together make sudden change colour else edge image become fuzzy
You think cosine wave overshooting sudden change producing artifact like one following image edge messy
The original sharp edge zoomed view JPEG version show edge gradual darker pixel occur white space looking bit like shadow echo
For reason JPEG used photo natural image technique GIF PNG look another section work better artificial image like one
General purpose compression method need lossless ca assume user wo mind data changed
The widely used general purpose compression algorithm ZIP gzip rar based method called coding invented Jacob Ziv Abraham Lempel
We look text file example
The main idea coding sequence character often repeated file example sequence character image appears often chapter instead storing repeated occurrence replace reference last occurred
As long reference smaller phrase replaced save space
Typically system based approach used reduce text file little quarter original size almost good method known compressing text
The following interactive allows explore idea
The empty box replaced reference text occurring earlier
You click box see reference type referenced character decode text
What happens reference pointing another reference
As long decode first last information available need
View link online You also enter text clicking Text tab
You could paste text see many character replaced reference
The reference actually two number first say many character count back previous phrase start second say long referenced phrase
Each reference typically take space one two character system make saving long two character replaced
The option interactive allow require replaced length least two avoid replacing single character reference
Of course character count letter alphabet system also refer back white space word
In fact common sequence thing like full stop followed space
This approach also work well black white image since sequence like white pixel likely occurred
Here bit example earlier chapter paste interactive see many pointer needed represent
In fact essentially happens GIF PNG image pixel value compressed using algorithm work well lot consecutive pixel colour
But work poorly photograph pixel pattern unlikely repeated
The method described named compression Jacob Ziv Abraham Lempel two computer scientist invented
Unfortunately someone mixed order name wrote article called LZ compression instead ZL compression
So many people copied mistake Ziv Lempel method usually called LZ compression
One widely used method compressing music actually video compression standard called MPEG Moving Picture Experts Group
The name self explanatory mp stand moving picture version file used music
The full name standard come MPEG missing EG stand expert group consortium company researcher got together agree standard people could easily play video different brand equipment example could play DVD brand DVD player
The first version standard called three method storing sound track layer
One method layer became popular compressing music abbreviated
The standard used much video example DVDs TV mainly use remains important audio coding
The next MPEG version redundant became standard
offer higher quality video commonly used digital video file streaming medium disc broadcast TV
The AAC audio compression method used Apple among others also standard
On computer Part commonly used video often abbreviated
So stand layer stand part
Most audio compression method use similar approach method although offer better quality amount storage le storage quality
We wo go exactly work general idea break sound band different frequency represent band adding together value simple formula sum cosine wave precise
There also
Other audio compression system might come across include AAC ALAC Ogg Vorbis WMA
Each various advantage others compatible open others
The main question compressed audio small file made good quality human ear
There also question long take encode file might affect useful system
The tradeoff quality size audio file depend situation jogging listening music quality may matter much good reduce space available store
On hand someone listening recording home good sound system might mind large device store music long quality high
To evaluate audio compression choose variety recording high quality original typically CD using uncompressed WAV AIFF file
Choose different style music kind audio speech perhaps even create recording totally silent
Now convert recording different audio format
One system free download Apple iTunes used rip CDs variety format give choice setting quality size
A lot audio system able convert file plugins conversion
Compress recording using variety method making sure compressed file created high quality original
Make table showing long took process recording size compressed file evaluation quality sound compared original
Discuss tradeoff involved need much bigger file store good quality sound
Is limit small make file still sounding ok
Do method work better speech others
Does minute recording silence take space minute recording silence
Does minute recording music use space minute silence
The detail compression system work glossed chapter concerned file size speed method work
Most compression system variation idea covered although one fundamental method mentioned Huffman coding turn useful final stage method often one first topic mentioned textbook discussing compression brief
A closely related system Arithmetic coding
Also video compression omitted even though compressing video save space kind compression
Most video compression based MPEG standard Moving Pictures Experts Group
There information work
The method shown variation method
Many popular lossless compression method based although many variation one called LZW also used lot
Another compression method bzip based clever method called Transform
Questions like compression achieved addressed field

Defense Acquisitions Made Easy Schedule compression technique used project management shorten already developed schedule
This might done meet update delivery date new opportunity schedule delay
It done without changing scope program
There two technique commonly used schedule compression
These Crashing assigns resource activity decrease overall time complete
The cost benefit activity explored order make useful technique
The cost schedule must understood get best possible schedule compression
Fast Tracking process executing activity phase originally schedule sequential parallel
Activities overlapped started earlier proposed start activity require different resource maybe combined activity schedule
This process add risk schedule program must executed care
Make sure weight pro con crashing schedule
There always risk involved need understood
Updated

Time management always challenging project management
Through proper planning project manager avoid schedule overrun
Project Time Management involves Schedule overrun may affect Cost Quality increase risk project success
Few scenario may lead schedule overrun Project management team identify schedule overrun possible risk due overrun project status performance review
Having quality management plan reviewed early planning stage project get benefit cost reduction schedule overrun caused rework
Project manager use one schedule compression technique take corrective action bring schedule back track
It required schedule compression technique used encountering schedule overrun
Project manager use preventive measure anticipated schedule overrun
Let u review definition Mainly schedule compression reduce schedule without modifying project scope
Following technique widely used schedule compression Crashing Fast tracking Following may action Project manager crashing Getting resource project loan Paying extra fast shipment purchased material Asking team member work extra hour compensatory overtime Crashing always affordable choice may result increased risk cost
Following may action Project manager fast tracking identify phase overlap start execute next phase finish earlier one identify activity us different set resource execute parallel find activity give low risk low cost time executed prior completion earlier phase Fast tracking may result Rework extra fix Increased risk As far compression technique concerned manager take risk risk balance benefit may gained taking risk

Pingback Pingback We know critical path activity predecessor So possible critical path activity parallel

Hi Ashraful Thanks comment
Both schedule compression technique risk involved
We need cautious applying technique need complete impact information project like cost schedule risk
As told activity dependency part critical path need executed particular fashion still task relationship Start Start Finish Finish etc OR activity characteristic allows executing activity parallel risk reworking case previous activity issue uncovered lately starting next activity parallelly
One classic example starting testing activity software application completing application development
Though risk redoing test case development find issue late testing started worth taking risk case time market vital get competitive advantage

Hi Vaibhav Thanks valuable input
You understood exactly I intended
I meant Finishing project agreed delivery date even unexpected slip word back track
In situation project planning done fully upfront detailed level risk go unexplored fully
Some unavoidable situation like delayed receipt good even expected date unavailability resource etc
If project vital organization meeting project delivery date must project manager use tracking method point also
Schedule compression always requires balanced calculated risk
Initially planning stage plan prepared constraint imposed delivery date technique applied meet
When talking using technique bring back earlier schedule back track
Does mean earlier schedule prepaed carefully considering technique effectively going acheive applying
So rare chance bring schedule back track
Only way remains crashing late working complete backlog work
Learnings try find note reason earlier schedule slippage corrective action taken future project onwasrds project situation could planned managed expectation stakeholder

PMP Exam Preparation Study Materials Lessons Learned Contact Hours PMP FAQ etc
By There many reason may want compress schedule
The first reason project late running corner corner bring project back track
Another reason may intentionally want shorten duration project although project track
To bring project schedule use schedule compression technique fast tracking crashing
A delay project may happen due many reason Other time might happen although track want compress schedule So see many case want compress schedule
In project management use two technique
fast tracking crashing shorten schedule change scope required
These important technique project management must aware
Also important PMP exam point view
You may see question topic exam therefore understand technique well
Okay let get started
In fast tracking review find sequential activity performed parallel partially parallel
It important understand review activity critical path path activity float
There need shorten duration activity giving activity float
Moreover also need check path whose duration near critical path duration duration current critical path becomes shorter path longer critical path
If path duration equal critical path risky project manage two critical path
Once find activity fast tracked start working reduce schedule
The benefit fast tracking cost extra money however come increase risk performing many activity parallel originally planned sequence
Usually sequential activity sometime fast tracked
This mean previous activity completed start next activity
Here activity partially overlapped
Although increase risk level risk impact within acceptable limit
Fast tracking help reduce duration schedule limit continue fast track limit may increase risk cause possible rework
Let say constructing school building
Construction work almost completed next step start carpentry work electrical work
When review schedule see behind schedule therefore move faster complete project time
As construction work completed review carpentry electrical work see activity performed parallel
Once identified activity apply fast tracking
In given example start electrical work also call carpenter start carpentry work time
Crashing another schedule compression technique add extra resource project compress schedule
In crashing review critical path see activity completed adding extra resource
You try find activity reduced adding least amount cost
Once find activity apply crashing technique
While crashing keep tab path well also possible duration path could become equal duration critical path
When start schedule compression process initially get reduction duration le cost input however continue process cost increase fast rate smaller reduction time
A example crashing technique In schedule crashing whatever take shorten duration
However note apply technique activity
For example concrete work wait concrete dry start next activity
Let say constructing room wall school building
As per duration estimate take four day two mason complete task
Now reduce duration activity crashing
Hence complete activity ahead planned date add two mason task completed within two day
The following difference fast tracking crashing This depends situation requirement
For example client want complete project earlier ready pay additional cost go crashing
However project delayed due unforeseen condition bring project back schedule go fast tracking require extra money
There another case may pay penalty client delay
Here compare cost penalty cost crashing analysis show better go crashing go
You may also crashing project delayed company image stake
Generally speaking start compressing schedule start fast tracking process require additional cost
Once done fast tracking try crashing necessary
Fast tracking crashing two schedule compression technique help shorten duration project
Fast tracking involve cost increase risk
On hand crashing introduce much risk costly affair
With crashing also possible yield effective work output may get skilled resource even get take time settle
You bring bunch people together expect perform immediately
Therefore perform due diligence going crashing sometimes may increase cost significantly poor reduction schedule compression
Here blog post fast tracking crashing project scheduling compression technique end I hope enjoyed reading post

Hi I one question regarding crashing increase cost activity
I activity two guy working would take day complete work
The charge guy say per day
So day take
Now I add two resource four guy complete work day
Still cost
I used crashing technique schedule compression cost remained
Where cost Venkat It always possible job finished guy day add guy job finished day
Why
Because always decay efficiency performance bring guy activity complete task sooner
I mean guy finish job day guy may finish job either day day
It always true finish job day
It may also possible new guy may le skill guy old guy experience handling task selected
Moreover since bringing new guy hurry may pay higher guy already working project
Also assume heavy equipment
Since want finish job early renting two equipment open market cost lot
Same true consumables may end purchasing higher price
There also chance Point many possibility increase cost
It human resource others factor impacting venkat want comment example
One Woman give child birth produce one baby nine month woman jointly produce one baby one month
So depends nature work way work
By many day crash activity time
It depends many factor duration activity duration successor predecessor activity relationship activity resource available finally whether activity crashed
There universal answer question project manager take decision based many Hello All Can someone please share thought one
I want type entire question basically budget week behind schedule
After EAC assessment value require week complete project
What
crash b fast track option goldplate I know I picked crash I thought since budget constraint add resource money afford complete project sooner advantage lesser risk compared correct answer b fast track
But fast track introduce risk
Even budget first look fast tracking save money
If possible go crashing
Hi Fahad All blog post nice clear
Compare blog post I think forgot elaborate Risk Fastrack Rework Crashing example
Any way nice
Thanks Lax Hello Lax Soon I update blog Hi Venkat You need consider LAW Diminishing Returns The marginal productivity workforce decrease output increase diminishing return mean negative return example number worker exceeds available work
What Fahad explained thing reply
How crashing affect overall project goal strategy
Effectiveness crashing technique project management industry
Since crashing involves cost may affect cost baseline
Give example crashing management I understand mean
Hi Everything perfectly explained thanks time didnt add merit demerit better understand
Looking forward answer
Good suggestion Dorji
I noted advise soon I update blog post merit demerit fast tracking crashing
Fahad Usmani In Fast Tracking go sequenced planning paralleled planning schedule compression need extra money resource labor keep consideration limited amount resource labor involved sequenced activity let say least one activity resource go next activity finishing current activity activity parallel resource labor involved least activity More money resource labor required case perform activity time cause duplication resource order get activity done time order save time
Thanks First review activity find activity performed parallel partially parallel go
For example let say two activity sequence carpentry electrical work
These two activity performed different people different time
Now review activity find run two activity parallel
So called guy work parallel
In case neither spend money bring extra labor
Hope help
When schedule budget changed mean time scope changed reason may also bring change scope
If
If client want small change product scope scope go change control system
There many factor lead change scope
For example market condition occurrence unidentified risk client request
Every change need documented change require modification baseline go change control system
Crashing mean also giving overtime team work cost hour overtime equal hour duty I wanted explain crashing cost incremental money
Khalid Elagmy It depends company policy
Some company give time give normal day
In holiday may go time
What effectivenes crashing technique project schedule based construction
In crashing add resource increasing number labor help complete task earlier

Compression performed program us formula determine shrink size data
For instance algorithm may represent string bit smaller string using dictionary conversion formula may insert reference pointer string program already seen
Text compression simple removing unneeded inserting single repeat character indicate string repeated character substituting smaller bit string frequently occurring bit string
Data compression reduce text file significantly higher percentage original size
For data transmission compression performed data content entire transmission unit including data
When information sent received via internet larger file either singly others part file may transmitted ZIP compressed format
Data compression dramatically decrease amount storage file take
For example compression ratio megabyte file take MB space
As result compression administrator spend le money le time storage
Compression optimizes backup storage performance recently shown
Compression important method data reduction data continues grow exponentially
Virtually type file compressed important follow best practice choosing one compress
For example file may already come compressed compressing file would significant impact
Compressing data process
Lossless compression enables file original state without loss single bit data file uncompressed
Lossless compression typical approach executables well text spreadsheet file loss word number would change information
Lossy compression permanently eliminates bit data redundant unimportant imperceptible
Lossy compression useful graphic audio video image removal data bit little discernible effect representation content
Graphics lossy lossless
Graphic image file format typically designed compress information since file tend large
JPEG image file format support lossy image compression
Formats GIF PNG use lossless compression
Compression often compared two technique operate differently
Deduplication type compression look redundant chunk data across storage replaces duplicate chunk pointer original
Data compression algorithm reduce size bit string data stream far smaller scope generally remembers last megabyte le data
Taneja Group analyst Mike Matchett discussed benefit compression deduplication two differ
deduplication eliminates redundant file replaces pointing original file
deduplication identifies duplicate data subfile level
The system save unique instance block us algorithm process generates unique identifier store index
Deduplication typically look larger chunk duplicate data compression system deduplicate using fixed chunk
Deduplication effective environment high degree redundant data storage backup system
Data compression tends effective deduplication reducing size unique information image audio video database executable file
Many storage system support compression deduplication
Compression often used data accessed much process intensive slow system
Administrators though seamlessly integrate compression backup system
Backup redundant type workload process capture file frequently
An organization performs full backup often close data backup backup
There major benefit compressing data prior backup The main advantage compression reduction storage hardware data transmission time communication bandwidth resulting cost saving
A compressed file requires le storage capacity uncompressed file use compression lead significant decrease expense disk
A compressed file also requires le time transfer consumes le network bandwidth uncompressed file
The main disadvantage data compression performance impact resulting use resource compress data perform decompression
Many vendor designed system try minimize impact calculation associated compression
If compression run data written disk system may offload compression preserve system resource
For instance IBM us separate card handle compression enterprise storage system
If data compressed written disk compression may run background reduce performance impact
Although compression reduce response time still consumes memory processor cycle affect overall number storage system handle
Also data initially must written disk uncompressed form physical storage saving great inline compression
File system compression take fairly straightforward approach reducing storage footprint data transparently compressing file written
Many popular Linux file system including ZFS btrfs Microsoft NTFS compression option
The server compress chunk data file writes smaller fragment storage
involves relatively small latency expand fragment writing add substantial load server compression usually recommended data volatile
File system compression weaken performance deployed selectively file accessed frequently
Historically expensive hard drive early computer data compression software DiskDoubler SuperStor Pro popular helped establish mainstream file system compression
Storage administrator also apply technique using compression deduplication improved data reduction
Compression built wide range technology including storage system database operating system software application used business enterprise organization
Compressing data also common consumer device laptop PCs mobile phone
Many system device perform compression transparently give user option turn compression
It performed file piece data subsequent compression result little additional compression may even increase size file slight degree depending data compression algorithm
popular Windows program compress file package archive
Archive file format support compression include ZIP
The GZIP format see widespread use compressing individual file
Other vendor offer compression include Dell EMC XtremIO array Kaminario array RainStor data compression software
Data differencing general term comparing content two data object
In context compression involves repetitively searching target file find similar block replacing reference library object
This process repeat find additional duplicate object
Data differencing result many compressed file one element library representing duplicated object
In virtual desktop technique feature compression ratio much
The process often closely aligned deduplication look identical file object rather within content object
Data differencing sometimes referred deduplication

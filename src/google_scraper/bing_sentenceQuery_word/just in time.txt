What JIT compiler specifically opposed compiler
Can someone give succinct easy understand description
A JIT compiler run program started compiles code usually bytecode kind VM instruction fly called form usually faster typically host CPU native instruction set
A JIT access dynamic runtime information whereas standard compiler make better optimization like inlining function used frequently
This contrast traditional compiler compiles code machine language program first run
To paraphrase conventional compiler build whole program EXE file BEFORE first time run
For newer style program assembly generated pseudocode
Only AFTER execute program OS icon JIT compiler kick generate machine code processor whatever understand
In beginning compiler responsible turning language defined higher level assembler object code machine instruction would linked linker executable
At one point evolution language compiler would compile language would interpreted interpreter run program
This eliminated object code executables allowed language portable multiple operating system hardware platform
Pascal compiled one first Java C recent example
Eventually term replaced bytecode since byte long
A JIT compiler feature interpreter instead interpreting bytecode every time method invoked compile bytecode machine code instruction running machine invoke object code instead
Ideally efficiency running object code overcome inefficiency recompiling program every time run
time word say needed demand The source code completely converted machine code The source code converted assembly language like structure ex IL intermediate language C ByteCode java
The intermediate code converted machine language application need required code converted machine code
In JIT code converted machine code first part code necessary converted machine code method functionality called machine turned machine code reduces burden CPU
As machine code generated run time JIT compiler produce machine code optimised running machine CPU architecture
As mentioned Just add point discussion JVM maintains count many time function executed
If count exceeds predefined limit JIT compiles code machine language directly executed processor unlike normal case javac compile code bytecode java interpreter interprets bytecode line line convert machine code executes
Also next time function calculated compiled code executed unlike normal interpretation code interpreted line line
This make execution faster
JIT stand mean code get compiled needed runtime
This beneficial compiler generate code optimised particular machine
A static compiler like average C compiler compile code executable code developer machine
Hence compiler perform optimisation based assumption
It compile slowly optimisation slowing execution program user
After byte code architecture neutral generated Java compiler execution handled JVM Java
The byte code loaded JVM loader byte instruction interpreted
When need call method multiple time need interpret code many time may take time needed
So JIT compiler
When byte loaded JVM run time whole code compiled rather interpreted thus saving time
JIT compiler work run time binary output
It compiles java bytecodes machine instruction specific CPU
For example loop statement java code The loop code run time value
It necessary compile bytecode time instruction going execute time
In case necessary compile code value changed required number time
So Just In Time JIT Compiler keep track statement method said compiles piece byte code machine code better performance
Another similar example search pattern using Regular Expression list
JIT Compiler compile code machine code
It compiles code similar pattern run time
See read
I know old thread runtime optimization another important part JIT compilation seemed discussed
Basically JIT compiler monitor program run determine way improve execution
Then make change fly runtime
Google JIT optimization javaworld pretty You code compliled IL intermediate language
When run program computer understand code
It understands native code
So JIT compiler compiles IL native code fly
It method level
Jit stand time compiler jit program turn java byte code instruction sent directly processor
Using java time compiler really second compiler particular system platform complies bytecode particular system code code jit complier usually run quickly computer
The compiler come virtual machine used optionally
It compiles bytecode executable code immediately executed
A compiler take source code transforms machine specific byte code compile time
A JIT compiler take machine agnostic byte code generated compile time transforms machine specific byte code run time
The JIT compiler Java us allows single binary run multitude platform without modification
The following code example show JIT optimizes Java code
Code Before Optimization Code After Optimization Originally code contained two call method
After optimization two method call optimized single operation optimized code need perform method call acquire field value class B
byte code used time
The JIT compiler get stats optimizes byte code run faster adding inline method removal unused lock etc also creating bytecode specific machine
I quoting article I found handy
JIT refers execution engine JVM implementation one faster requires memory compiler
In scheme bytecodes method compiled native machine code first time method invoked
The native machine code method cached next time method invoked
JVM actually performs compilation step runtime performance reason
This mean Java clean separation
It first called static compilation Java source code bytecode
Then bytecode passed JVM execution
But executing bytecode slow JVM measure often bytecode run detects hotspot code run frequently performs dynamic compilation bytecode machinecode hotspot code hotspot profiler
So effectively today Java program run machinecode execution

NSF sponsored development new online professional development resource CS teacher
Imagine young young high school teacher asked teach computer science CS class first time
You may taken CS class college maybe even majored never taught class full student
Until year even CS class teach school
How prepare
How education system help prepare
unique background allows see problem training CS teacher number vantage point
I programmer College Education Michigan State University I faculty Yadav said
We developing online learning environment teacher I programming I started wondering benefit preservice teacher
When year later getting Education applied grant National Science Foundation NSF study teacher professional development along colleague Susanne Hambrusch Tim Korb James Lehman Purdue University almost circumstance come full circle
Having background CS getting doctorate Education allowed connect two area said
CS education perfect blend get interest educational research professional development plus little bug still love programming
Hambrusch CS professor worked Yadav last six year collaboration highlight importance interdisciplinary research
It changed I teach made explore new question learning happens CS Hambrusch said
Computer science education research important emerging research area tough challenge solve collaboration CS Education researcher key making lasting progress
For last two year Yadav colleague developing set new online professional development resource provide support new CS teacher experienced CS teacher teaching new course first time
Instead relying solely summer workshop prepare teacher program provides instruction teacher way expect get information day anytime anywhere via web
The project part effort aim build talent pool future computer scientist developing new high school curriculum computing getting curriculum high school taught teacher
NSF along many organization supporting CS effort recognizes United States thrive need cultivate diverse workforce equipped computational skill contribute economy
In recent year NSF invested million expand access broaden diversity student participating computer science course
But training teacher small feat
In fact likely done way professional development traditionally delivered scale need unique circumstance CS teacher
Teachers usually receive training given subject either student education program workshop summer setting
However CS teacher atypical often training computer scientist
Instead CS teacher math business technology background must transition CS
We believe order meet goal CS teacher really need target teacher also teacher Yadav said
Those teacher classroom CS background
So want teach CS course need develop content knowledge well knowledge teach content
To supplement teacher typical training Yadav team created collection material new CS teacher
These material include video written instruction slideshows link activity additional tool
Teachers encouraged become student using skill code project asking student
The material cover subject matter common misconception avoid
Yadav say many case teacher end adapting professional development material classroom use student assignment
We developing material teacher teacher also finding material used student well said
After creating hundred hour professional development content teacher team partnered leading organization develops STEM curriculum school pilot program
The first group CS teacher trained using professional development material last year
Among first cohort teacher Tim Velegol engineering department coordinator career technical education department chair Durham Public Schools North Carolina
As rookie CS teacher I needed resource I could get hand deliver meaningful instruction diverse group high school learner Velegol explained
Using tool like Scratch Python strengthened updated Velegol grasp core CS concept originally exposed year ago Fortran programming language
While lot information Internet Yadav group gave great idea help reinforce many fundamental programming puzzler require lot code force student think develop algorithm said
In addition learning material teacher able ask question Yadav team well interactive Q A platform Piazza
The researcher going data pilot group incorporating feedback preparing article synthesizing finding
They expanded program include new teacher gather impression also test efficacy professional development teacher student performance
At time conducting interview current CS teacher get sense common classroom challenge instructor face way found overcome
We collecting pilot data year collect teacher outcome well student outcome Yadav said
Are student interested computing
Do see role computing future career
Once data open anyone want access material
A computer science teacher work student
Students learn code collaboratively CS class

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

Its origin development Japan largely particularly Toyota
Alternative term JCF manufacturing used
choice manufacturing SCM
IBM manufacturing CFM manufacturing DFM term handed consultant John Constanza Institute Technology Colorado
Still another alternative mentioned Goddard said Toyota Production System often mistakenly referred System pointed one element TPS well JIT production
But wide use term throughout faded fast new term became established recent name JIT
As one testament commonality two term widely used synonym JIT lean manufacturing
The exact reason adoption JIT Japan unclear
Plenert offer four reason paraphrased
During Japan War II rebuilding industry
Japan lack cash made difficult industry finance large inventory production method common elsewhere

Japan lacked space build big factory loaded inventory

The Japanese island lacking natural resource build product

Japan high unemployment meant labor efficiency method obvious pathway industrial success
Thus Japanese leaned process
They built smaller factory material housed factory work currently done
In way inventory level kept low investment inventory minimum investment purchased natural resource quickly turned around additional material purchased
Plenart go explain Toyota key role developing lean JIT production methodology
News reached western shore two article One referred methodology Ohno system instrumental development within Toyota
The article Toyota author international journal provided additional detail
Finally publicity translated implementation beginning quickly multiplying throughout industry United States developed country
A seminal event conference Detroit Ford World Headquarters Repetitive Manufacturing Group RMG founded within American Production Inventory Control Society APICS seek advance manufacturing
The principle speaker Fujio Cho later president Toyota Motor explaining Toyota system stirred audience led RMG shifting gear thing like automation
At least audience stirring perceived clash new JIT regime MRP II computer system manufacturing planning control become prominent industry
Debates professional meeting JIT MRP II followed published article one titled The Rise Fall
Less confrontational Walt Goddard Kanban Versus MRP Is Best You

Four year later Goddard answered question book advocating JIT
Among best known MRP II advocate George Plossl authored two article questioning JIT kanban planning method japanning America
But Goddard Plossl later wrote JIT concept whose time come
implementation may found many article beyond
One article issue

emerged extensive JIT implementer name ZIPS zero inventory production system
At Omark mother plant work force received hour ZIPS training turned loose thing began happen
A first step arbitrarily eliminate week lead time thing ran smoother
asked try taking another week worth
After ZIPS spread throughout plant operation amoeba
The article also note Omark plant similarly engaged ZIPS beginning pilot project
For example one Omark smaller plant making drill bit drill inventory cut productivity increased scrap rework dropped lead time order finished product slashed three week three day
The
article state company using JIT extensively include Big Four Motorola
By book JIT able devote full chapter ZIPS Omark along two chapter JIT several plant single chapter John Deere North Carolina Apple Macintosh Toyota plant New United Motor Manufacturing joint venture Toyota General Motors
Two book emergent year international scope

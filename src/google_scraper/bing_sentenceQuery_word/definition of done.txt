Stanford researcher coined term called core mission AI field defined
If start definition program considered AI something would normally think intelligent human
How program issue able
That AI smart smart like u
It turn people different goal regard building AI system tend fall three camp based close machine building line people work
For goal build system think exactly way people
Others want get job done care computation anything human thought
And using human reasoning model inform inspire final target imitation
The work aimed genuinely simulating human reasoning tends called result used build system think also explain human think well
However yet see real model strong AI system actual simulation human cognition difficult problem solve
When time come researcher involved certainly pop champagne toast future call day
The work second camp aimed getting system work usually called might able build system behave like human result tell u nothing human think
One prime example system master chess player certainly play way human
Somewhere middle strong weak AI third camp system informed inspired human reasoning
This tends powerful work happening today
These system use human reasoning guide driven goal perfectly model
A good example
Watson build evidence answer find looking thousand piece text give level confidence conclusion
It combine ability recognize pattern text different ability weigh evidence matching pattern provides
Its development guided observation people able come conclusion without hard fast rule instead build collection evidence
Just like people Watson able notice pattern text provide little bit evidence add evidence get answer
Likewise Google work Deep Learning similar feel inspired actual structure brain
Informed behavior neuron Deep Learning system function learning layer representation task image speech recognition
Not exactly like brain inspired
The important takeaway order system considered AI work way
It need smart
There another distinction made difference AI system designed specific task often called system designed ability reason general referred
People sometimes get confused distinction consequently mistakenly interpret specific result specific area somehow scoping across intelligent behavior
based past behavior different system learn recognize image example also different system make decision based synthesis evidence
They may example narrow AI practice may generalizable address issue intelligent machine deal
For example I may want system brilliant figuring nearest gas station also perform medical diagnostics
The next step look idea play different capability expect see intelligent system interact emerging AI ecosystem today
That play together

Most type data mining targeted toward general knowledge group rather knowledge specific supermarket le concerned selling one item one person selling many item many pattern analysis also may used discern anomalous individual behaviour criminal activity
As computer storage capacity increased many company began store transactional data
The resulting record collection often called data warehouse large analyzed traditional statistical approach
Several computer science conference workshop held consider recent advance field artificial intelligence AI discovery genetic neural adapted knowledge discovery preferred term computer science community
The process led First International Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining held Montreal launch journal
This also period many early company formed product introduced
One earliest successful application data mining perhaps second marketing research detection
By studying consumer purchasing behaviour typical pattern usually becomes apparent purchase made outside pattern flagged later investigation deny transaction
However wide variety normal behaviour make challenging single distinction normal fraudulent behaviour work everyone time
Every individual likely make purchase differ type made relying normal single individual likely give many false alarm
One approach improving reliability first group individual similar purchasing pattern since group model le sensitive minor
For example frequent business traveler group likely pattern includes unprecedented purchase location member group might flagged transaction catalog purchase fit group profile
The complete process involves multiple step understanding goal project data available process change based final analysis
The three key computational step process model evaluation use model
This division clearest classification data
Model learning occurs one applied data group class attribute known order produce classifier learned data
The classifier tested independent evaluation set contains data known attribute
The extent model classification agree known class target attribute used determine expected accuracy model
If model sufficiently accurate used classify data target attribute unknown
There many type data mining typically divided kind information attribute known type knowledge sought model
Predictive modeling used goal estimate value particular target attribute exist sample training data value attribute known
An example classification take set data already divided predefined group search pattern data group
These discovered pattern used classify data right group target attribute unknown though attribute may known
For instance manufacturer could develop predictive model distinguishes part fail extreme heat extreme cold condition based manufacturing model may used determine appropriate application part
Another technique employed predictive modeling analysis used target attribute numeric value goal predict value new data
Descriptive modeling clustering also divide data group
With clustering however proper group known advance pattern discovered analyzing data used determine group
For example advertiser could analyze general population order classify potential customer different cluster develop separate advertising campaign targeted group
Fraud detection also make use clustering identify group individual similar purchasing pattern
Pattern mining concentrate identifying rule describe specific pattern within data
analysis identifies item typically occur together purchase transaction one first application data mining
For example supermarket used analysis identify item often purchased instance store featuring fish sale would also stock tartar sauce
Although testing association long often simple see small data set data mining enabled discovery le apparent association immense data set
Of interest discovery unexpected association may open new avenue marketing research
Another important use pattern mining discovery sequential pattern example sequence error warning precede equipment failure may used schedule preventative maintenance may provide insight design flaw
detection viewed flip side finding data instance unusual fit established pattern
Fraud detection example anomaly detection
Although fraud detection may viewed problem predictive modeling relative rarity fraudulent transaction speed criminal develop new type fraud mean predictive model likely low accuracy quickly become date

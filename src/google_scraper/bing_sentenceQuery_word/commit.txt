learn share knowledge build career
After reading I decided would good start experimenting GitHub
I thought What better way experiment introductory computer science homework
However practice open solution web I concerned student might plagiarize
I
Thus question come mind I consider practice Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise
Does putting homework code GitHub open copied
If create public repository yes
Private repository cost money private repository though pointed free student version Are people plagiarize familiar GitHub
Open source sharing
That kind point
Do store thing want keep private public place
Should I concerned
For general homework
Again put essay personal writing public repository
That would similar putting essay public blog
Would plagiarism detection software scan GitHub I know
Probably eventually
Git used without github
To really learn git need github bitbucket paid service
GitHub public set server work
Git great tracking revision
If ever used Google Docs Google Drive looked history feature probably familiar nice able revisit change old version work
Git formalizes allowing comment commits branch work multiple version experiment without worrying overwriting original work
I read Quora post thought I might add
The best thing improve skill rent server vendor like Rackspace Digital Ocean Linode name provider
These service run little though month typical
From learn configure Linux machine
You install git repository mail server web server whatever want low risk environment
Make mistake reset server virgin state
I recommend installing Ubuntu distro large community relative ease installing new software
One problem developer often dependent sysadmins task really part repertoire
It depends
If repository public anyone see fork
They may even send pull request
If repository private hand seen people allow
You need paid subscription create private repos
That
But IMO always suppose plagiarizer familiar everything
It homework
Why care
It like doctor thesis next patent material
I know software Wikipedia
I would surprised someone made Github
But usually software check whether copied something well known site author original content nothing worry
If people plagiarizing mean good
Last least might want read Creative Commons
Unless really want keep work top secret better use CC license lose night sleep people copying work

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

About site A journal thought thing life Collection article I published Presentations I delivered recently Software I written My link collection My picture collection featuring cute little chihuahua Pico Quick introduction internals people scared word like
In simplified form git object storage DAG object handful different type object
They stored compressed identified hash incidentally content file represent representation git
The simplest object bunch byte
This often file symlink pretty much anything else
The object point determines semantics
Directories represented object
They refer content file filename access mode etc stored subdirectory
When node point another node DAG node exist without
Nodes nothing point garbage collected rescued much like filesystem inodes filename pointing
A refers represents state file time commit
It also refers parent
More one parent mean commit merge parent mean initial commit interestingly one initial commit usually mean two separate project merged
The body object commit message
References head branch like note slapped node DAG
Where DAG get added existing node mutated moved around freely
They get stored history directly transferred repository
They act sort bookmark I working
add node DAG move note current branch new node
The ref special actually point another ref
It pointer currently active branch
Normal ref actually namespace often skip part
Remote reference note different color
The difference normal different namespace fact remote ref essentially controlled remote server
update
A node DAG note yet another color
A point includes optional message GPG signature
The fast way access tag lost recovered DAG
The node DAG moved repository repository stored effective form pack unused node garbage collected
But end repository always DAG
So armed knowledge store version history visualize thing like merges differ tool try manage history linear change per branch
This simplest repository
We remote repository one commit
Here ed remote received one new commit remote merged yet
The situation
As merge new commits local branch thing happened moving note changing file working directory respectively
One local later
We new local commit new remote commit
Clearly merge needed
Results
Because new local commits actual new node created DAG
Note two parent Here tree look commits branch another merge
See stitching pattern emerge
The DAG record exactly history action taken
The stitching pattern somewhat tedious read
If yet published branch clearly communicated others base work alternative
You branch instead merging commit replaced another commit different parent branch moved
Your old commit remain DAG garbage collected
Ignore know way screwed totally
If extra pointing old commit remain pointing keep old commit alive indefinitely
That fairly confusing though
Do rebase branch others created new commits top
It possible recover hard extra work needed frustrating
The situation garbage collecting ignoring unreachable commit creating new commit top branch
also know rebase multiple commits one command
That end brief intro people intimidated computer science

In system determines transaction integrity visible user system
For example user creating Purchase Order created header Purchase Order line header available carrying operation report Purchase Orders see
A lower isolation level increase ability many user access data time increase number concurrency effect dirty read lost update user might encounter
Conversely higher isolation level reduces type concurrency effect user may encounter requires system resource increase chance one transaction block another
Isolation typically defined database level property defines change made one operation become visible
On older system may implemented systemically example use temporary table
In system Transaction Processing TP manager required maintain isolation
In system multiple website attempting book last seat flight combination stored procedure transaction management required commit booking send confirmation customer
Isolation one Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability property
comprises underlying mechanism handle isolation guarantee related correctness
It heavily used database storage engine see guarantee correct execution concurrent transaction different mechanism correctness DBMS process
The mechanism typically constrain database data access operation timing certain order characterized schedule property
Constraining database access operation execution typically mean reduced performance rate execution thus concurrency control mechanism typically designed provide best performance possible constraint
Often possible without harming correctness serializability property compromised better performance
However recoverability compromised since typically result quick database integrity violation
common transaction concurrency control method DBMSs used provide serializability recoverability correctness
In order access database object transaction first need acquire object
Depending access operation type reading writing object lock type acquiring lock may blocked postponed another transaction holding lock object
Of four property Database Management System isolation property one often relaxed
When attempting maintain highest level isolation DBMS usually acquires data may result loss implement control
This requires adding logic function correctly
Most DBMSs offer number control degree locking occurs selecting data
For many database application majority database transaction constructed avoid requiring high isolation level
SERIALIZABLE level thus reducing locking overhead system
The programmer must carefully analyze database access code ensure relaxation isolation cause software bug difficult find
Conversely higher isolation level used possibility increased also requires careful analysis programming technique avoid
The isolation level defined standard listed follows
This isolation level
With DBMS implementation requires read write lock acquired selected data released end transaction
Also must acquired query us ranged clause especially avoid phenomenon
When using based concurrency control lock acquired however system detects among several concurrent transaction one allowed commit
See detail topic
From Second Informal Review Draft Database Language July In isolation level DBMS implementation keep read write lock acquired selected data end transaction
However managed occur
Write skew possible isolation level phenomenon two writes allowed column table two different writer previously read column updating resulting column data mix two transaction
In isolation level DBMS implementation keep write lock acquired selected data end transaction read lock released soon operation performed occur isolation level
As previous level managed
Putting simpler word read committed isolation level guarantee data read committed moment read
It simply restricts reader seeing intermediate uncommitted read
It make promise whatsoever transaction read find data data free change read
This isolation level
In level allowed one transaction may see change made transaction
Since isolation level stronger higher isolation level allows action forbidden lower one standard permit DBMS run transaction isolation level stronger requested Read committed transaction may actually performed Repeatable read isolation level
The different varies quite widely
Most database feature transaction allow user set isolation level
Some DBMS also require additional syntax performing SELECT statement acquire lock
acquire exclusive write lock accessed row
However definition criticized ambiguous accurately reflecting isolation provided many database There also criticism concerning ANSI SQL isolation definition encourages implementors bad thing The standard SQL refers three different Transaction read data Transaction might changed
In following example two transaction take place
In first Query performed
Then second transaction Query performed committed
Finally first transaction Query performed
The query use following data table A aka occurs transaction allowed read data row modified another running transaction yet committed
Dirty read work similarly however second transaction would need committed first query return different result
The thing may prevented READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level update appearing order result earlier update always appear result set later update
In example Transaction change row commit change
Transaction read uncommitted data
Now Transaction roll back change already read Transaction update different change database view data may wrong record Transaction
But case row exists id age
A occurs course transaction row retrieved twice value within row differ read
phenomenon may occur concurrency control method read lock acquired performing acquired lock affected row released soon SELECT operation performed
Under method may occur requirement transaction affected must roll back relaxed
In example Transaction commits successfully mean change row id become visible
However Transaction already seen different value row
At SERIALIZABLE REPEATABLE READ isolation level DBMS must return old value second SELECT
At READ COMMITTED READ UNCOMMITTED DBMS may return updated value read
There two basic strategy used prevent read
The first delay execution Transaction Transaction committed rolled back
This method used locking used produce serial
A serial schedule exhibit behaviour
In strategy used Transaction permitted commit first provides better concurrency
However Transaction commenced prior Transaction must continue operate past version database snapshot moment started
When Transaction eventually try commit DBMS check result committing Transaction would equivalent schedule
If Transaction proceed
If seen equivalent however Transaction must roll back serialization failure
Using concurrency control method REPEATABLE READ isolation mode row ID would locked thus blocking Query first transaction committed rolled back
In READ COMMITTED mode second time Query executed age would changed
Under multiversion concurrency control SERIALIZABLE isolation level SELECT query see snapshot database taken start Transaction
Therefore return data
However Transaction attempted UPDATE row well serialization failure would occur Transaction would forced roll back
At READ COMMITTED isolation level query see snapshot database taken start query
Therefore see different data updated row
No serialization failure possible mode promise serializability made Transaction retried
A occurs course transaction new row added another transaction record read
This occur acquired performing operation
The anomaly special case Transaction repeat ranged query operation Transaction creates
new row target table fulfill clause
Note Transaction executed query twice
If highest level isolation maintained set row returned time indeed mandated occur database operating SQL SERIALIZABLE isolation level
However lesser isolation level different set row may returned second time
In SERIALIZABLE isolation mode Query would result record age range locked thus Query would block first transaction committed
In REPEATABLE READ mode range would locked allowing record inserted second execution Query include new row result
Anomaly Serializable Serializable
That necessary sufficient Serializable schedule free three phenomenon type

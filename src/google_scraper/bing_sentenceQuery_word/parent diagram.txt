In widely used ADT implementing simulates hierarchical root value child parent node represented set linked
A tree data structure defined locally collection starting root node node data structure consisting value together list reference node child constraint reference duplicated none point root
Alternatively tree defined abstractly whole globally value assigned node
Both perspective useful tree analyzed mathematically whole actually represented data structure usually represented worked separately node rather set node edge node one may represent instance
For example looking tree whole one talk parent node given node general data structure given node contains list child contain reference parent A tree data structure made node vertex edge without cycle
The tree node called tree
A tree empty consists root node potentially many level additional node form hierarchy
There distinction tree abstract data type concrete data structure analogous distinction
As data type tree value child child tree value child tree interpreted value root node subtrees child root node
To allow finite tree one must either allow list child empty case tree required empty tree instead represented forest zero tree allow tree empty case list child fixed size especially binary desired
As data structure linked tree group node value list node child
There also requirement two downward reference point node
Nodes tree could reference reference parent node
Due use tree linked tree data structure tree often discussed implicitly assuming represented reference root node often actually implemented
For example rather empty tree one may null reference tree always reference tree may null
Recursively data type tree defined value data type possibly empty together list tree possibly empty list subtrees child symbolically A tree consists value list tree
More elegantly via tree one basic example tree defined term forest list tree tree consists value forest subtrees child Note definition term value appropriate assumes different tree connection simply list value
As data structure tree defined node root consists value data type possibly empty together list reference node list possibly empty reference possibly null symbolically A node consists value list reference node
This data structure defines directed graph tree one must add condition global structure topology namely one reference point given node node single parent node tree point root
In fact every node root must exactly one parent root must parent
Indeed given list node node list reference child one tell structure tree without analyzing global structure fact topologically tree defined
As abstract tree type value type defined using abstract forest type list tree function axiom In term tree defined constructor empty forest tree root node given value child
Viewed whole tree data structure generally value attached node
Concretely required together Often tree fixed properly bounded particularly always two child node possibly empty hence two child node hence binary tree
Allowing empty tree make definition simpler complicated rooted tree must hence empty tree allowed definition instead becomes empty tree rooted tree
On hand empty tree simplify defining fixed branching factor empty tree allowed binary tree tree every node exactly two child tree possibly empty complete set operation tree must include fork operation
A structure may contain value condition represent separate data structure could tree
Each node tree zero tree convention tree drawn growing downwards
A node child called child
A node one parent
An also known short node tree child node
Similarly also known node child node
The topmost node tree called
Depending definition tree may required root node case tree may allowed empty case necessarily root node
Being topmost node root node parent
It node algorithm tree begin since data structure one pas parent child
Note algorithm search begin root first visit leaf node access value leaf node visit root last first access child root access root last
All node reached following
In formal definition path also unique
In diagram root node conventionally drawn top
In tree root node special property
Every node tree seen root node subtree rooted node
The node length longest downward path leaf node
The height root height tree
The node length path root
This commonly needed manipulation various tree particular
The root node depth zero leaf node height zero tree single node hence root leaf depth height zero
Conventionally empty tree tree node allowed height
A tree tree consisting node descendant
Nodes thus correspond subtrees node corresponds subtree descendant subtree corresponding root node entire tree node root node subtree determines subtree corresponding node called analogy
Trees often drawn plane
Ordered tree represented essentially uniquely plane hence called follows one fix conventional order say counterclockwise arranges child node order first incoming parent edge first child edge etc
yield embedding tree plane unique
Conversely embedding determines ordering child node
If one place root top parent child place node given distance root term number edge level tree given horizontal line one obtains standard drawing tree
Given binary tree first child left left node second child right right node
There many different way represent tree common representation represent node record pointer child parent item relationship determined position array
Indeed binary tree implemented list list list value list head list value first term left child subtree tail list second subsequent term right child subtree
This modified allow value well Lisp head value first term value node head tail value second term left child tail tail list third subsequent term right child
In general node tree pointer parent information included expanding data structure also include pointer parent stored separately
Alternatively upward link included child node data
If edge child node thought reference tree special case digraph tree data structure generalized represent removing constraint node may one parent cycle allowed
Edges still abstractly considered pair node however term usually replaced different terminology example
Different exist digraph represented local data structure tree node value list child assuming list child list reference globally structure
In connected acyclic unless stated otherwise graph theory tree graph assumed undirected
There correspondence tree tree data structure
We take arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one make edge directed making point away root node producing assign order node
The result corresponds tree data structure
Picking different root different ordering produce different one
Given node tree child define ordered forest union subtrees given child equivalently taking subtree given node erasing root
Just subtrees natural recursion search forest natural search
Via forest defined list tree represented root node node tree consists value forest child Stepping item tree mean connection parent child called action tree
Often operation might performed pointer arrives particular node
A walk parent node traversed child called walk walk child traversed respective parent traversed called walk walk node left subtree node finally right subtree traversed called traversal
This last scenario referring exactly two subtrees left subtree right subtree assumes specifically
A walk effectively performs entirety tree node traversed level level root node visited first followed direct child node sibling followed grandchild node sibling node tree traversed

In based another object class using implementation
Inheritance language mechanism one object acquires property behaviour parent object
Inheritance allows programmer create class built upon existing class specify new implementation maintain behaviour realizing interface independently extend original software via public class interface
The relationship object class inheritance give rise
An inherited class called parent class super class
The term inheritance loosely used programming narrow use reserved programming one class another corresponding technique programming instead called one object another
Inheritance
In language inheritance subtyping agree whereas others differ general subtyping establishes relationship whereas inheritance reuses implementation establishes syntactic relationship necessarily semantic relationship inheritance ensure
To distinguish concept subtyping also known whereas inheritance defined known
Still inheritance commonly used mechanism establishing subtype relationship
Inheritance contrasted one object another object object one class contain object another class see
Composition implement relationship contrast relationship subtyping
Inheritance invented
There various type inheritance based paradigm specific language
Multiple Inheritance programming widely supposed difficult implement efficiently
For example summary book actually claimed adding Multiple inheritance impossible
Thus multiple inheritance seemed challenge
Since I considered multiple inheritance early found simple efficient implementation technique
I could resist challenge
I suspect case fashion affected sequence event
In JDK Java support multiple inheritance
A derived class multilevel inheritance declared follows This process extended number level
A derived class derivative class inherits one entity one class called
The semantics class inheritance vary language language commonly subclass automatically inherits superclass
The general form defining derived class Some language support construct also
For example define specification class also inherited heir
The superclass establishes common interface foundational functionality specialized subclass inherit modify supplement
The software inherited subclass considered subclass
A reference instance class may actually referring one subclass
The actual class object referenced impossible predict
A uniform interface used invoke member function object number different class
Subclass may replace superclass function entirely new function must share
In language class may declared adding certain class declaration
Examples include final keyword onwards sealed keyword
Such modifier added class declaration class keyword class identifier declaration
Such sealed class restrict particularly developer access precompiled
The sealed class subclass easily deduced reference pointer object class actually referencing instance class instance subclass exist instance superclass reference type violates type system

Because exact type object referenced known execution used instead also called requires one lookup depending whether supported programming language used
Just class may method declaration may contain method modifier prevent method overridden
replaced new function name type signature subclass
A method unoverridable simply accessible class class member function true though
A sealed method frozen feature overridden
If superclass method invocation superclass method
Some language require method specifically declared virtual
others method virtual

An invocation method always statically dispatched
address function call determined
Static dispatch faster dynamic dispatch allows optimisation
Inheritance used two class
Many permit class object replace implementation inherited
This process usually called
Overriding introduces complication version behavior instance inherited class one part class one parent base class
The answer varies programming language language provide ability indicate particular behavior overridden behave defined base class
For instance base method property overridden subclass marked virtual abstract override modifier
An alternative overriding inherited code
Implementation inheritance mechanism whereby subclass code base class
By default subclass retains operation base class subclass may operation replacing implementation
In following Python example subclass override method base class
The base class comprises operation compute sum two integer
The subclass functionality base class exception operation transforms number square replacing operation transforms number respectively
The subclass therefore compute sum two integer
In quarter class inheritance sole purpose code reuse fallen favor
The primary concern implementation inheritance provide assurance instance reusing class necessarily substituted instance inherited class
An alternative technique explicit requires programming effort avoids substitutability issue
In private inheritance used form without substitutability
Whereas public inheritance represents relationship delegation represents relationship private protected inheritance thought implemented term relationship
Another frequent use inheritance guarantee class maintain certain common interface implement method
The parent class combination implemented operation operation implemented child class
Often interface change supertype child implement behavior described instead parent class
Inheritance similar distinct
Subtyping enables given type substituted another type abstraction said establish relationship subtype existing abstraction either implicitly explicitly depending language support
The relationship expressed explicitly via inheritance language support inheritance subtyping mechanism
For example following code establishes explicit inheritance relationship class subclass subtype used wherever specified via reference pointer object
In programming language support inheritance relationship base class derived class relationship implementation mechanism code reuse compared relationship
Inheritance even programming language support inheritance subtyping mechanism necessarily entail
It entirely possible derive class whose object behave incorrectly used context parent class expected see
Compare
In OOP language notion code reuse subtyping coincide way declare subtype define new class inherits implementation another
Using inheritance extensively designing program imposes certain constraint
For example consider class contains person name date birth address phone number
We define subclass called contains person grade point average class taken another subclass called contains person employer salary
In defining inheritance hierarchy already defined certain restriction desirable The alternative inheritance
This technique support polymorphism code reuse separating behavior primary class hierarchy including specific behavior class required business domain class
This approach avoids static nature class hierarchy allowing behavior modification run time allows one class implement behavior instead restricted behavior ancestor class
Implementation inheritance controversial among programmer theoretician programming since least
Among author advocate interface inheritance instead favor
For example mentioned proposed overcome static nature inheritance class
As fundamental solution problem introduces distinct relationship combining property inheritance composition new concept
According main problem implementation inheritance introduces unnecessary form modification base class implementation cause inadvertent behavioral change subclass
Using interface avoids problem implementation shared API
Another way stating inheritance break
The problem surface clearly open system client code expected inherit class substituted system class algorithm
Reportedly Java inventor spoken implementation inheritance stating would include redesign Java
Language design decouple inheritance subtyping interface inheritance appeared early modern example programming language
Complex inheritance inheritance used within insufficiently mature design may lead
Another issue inheritance subclass must defined code mean program user add new subclass
Other design pattern allow program user define variation entity runtime

What Class Diagram available

Environment Diagrams visual tool keep track binding state computer program
In class use Python primary language diagram teach applied similar language
Every semester lot student ask teach environment diagram
The simple answer think environment diagram help student learn evaluation process computer program
However usually satisfactory explanation attempt address nuanced concern former current student
answer provided Albert necessarily reflect view rest teaching staff
Computer Science general writing code understanding thing work way
Environment diagram conceptual fit goal course
As practicallity I admit environment diagram learning tool
They scale well large program
Environment diagram provide way visualize state program
I found physical diagram look help student learn faster stare line code
There might two reason find difficult From logistical perspective teaching staff need way gauge well student learning
Having uniform system make easier u
I understand student run code head get correct output
Unfortunately test simply asking student write final output program likely student able guess answer
That defeat purppose exam see well student understand material well guess
Sorry
We try keep trick minimum
I agree sane programmer would write code confusing exam question
That said opinion successfully evaluate something complicated able handle anything see real world
Environment diagram designed keep track name binding
In word act sort bookkeeping device interpreter want know value bound variable called environment diagram help
As program grow complex function nonlocal state etc
environment diagram designed provide systematic way keep track otherwise unclear effect
A keep track binding
Every function call keep track set binding
every corresponding frame
The Global short starting frame
Global correspond specific function Every frame except Global
When function called corresponding frame immediately parent parent
When variable lookup ca find variable current frame look parent
Frames might also
These number used label frame parent
If frame never parent number
A distinct assigned
For example consider following simple assignment The variable value
Think variable box label value thing put inside box
This distinction becomes especially important come function
Consider following In case variable value
Remember Python function object like everything else distinct variable bound
In binding draw variable value
This arbitrary aesthetic design
A pointer represents value
We talk later
We using following code example section Always start drawing Global frame
This occurs code executed
executed
We draw one following occurs There simple process drawing binding There one small detail second step value put box otherwise draw arrow object
Here example primitive draw box draw arrow Let walk example
The first line variable assignment variable value
The second line little involved
There complex expression side must first
Notice following diagram bound The next line statement Here function function
That make sense type statement interpreter execute body function right away
define immediately calculate
Instead make
The variable value arrow pointing function object
Notice also say called separate entity even though right say distinct
So far dealt binding variable assignment statement
Now draw
An example function call
There five simple step
Label following Let try first function call example
looking function object see one formal parameter called
In step evaluated corresponding operand value
Now draw binding
The body say
There binding function call compute
Notice different one Global
The called
And
Once done function call exit frame current frame becomes Global
When looking variable always start looking current frame
If variable found look parent next
If variable still found look parent parent
If reach Global still ca find variable Python raise complains variable ca found
In procedural form Consider code For problem focus call many frame draw
What parent frame
The first three binding look like The last line say This function call procedure follows

one parameter bound operand

one parameter bound

one parameter bound
Now know compute original expression get Consider code Try drawing first following step illustrated
The first three binding look like Now hard part This function call
Notice operand function call
Should draw frame first
The procedure follows
The operand function call
parameter operand bind new frame
Your diagram look like
The first line bind
The return value

We saw step
single parameter called bind new frame In Python possible reassign function something else
Consider following code Before drawing diagram try predict last line evaluates
If got correct
Let see drawing diagram
The statement drawn follows The next line function reassignment Once follow rule binding
already written
picture function disappears erase diagram
The final line This function call follow corresponding procedure
parameter

Up draw parent frame number frame
That nested function definition yet
Consider following code The first binding defining look like drawn binding yet
That defined body execute body defining
The next line This variable assignment follow procedure binding
one paramter bound
The first thing statement follow rule binding

point function object return value point point

The next line This function call
one parameter bound
Recall call function draw new frame
Here example In example function
This example also demonstrates difference
The function finding follows The next line binding
This straightforward
The value function call
single paramter bound
And thus bound
Nothing new
The next line The procedure follows
The value function call
single paramter bound

Here line
This function NOT draw new frame
Also recall return value always

Since statement implicitly return
Notice bound difference

Venn diagram going nickname primary diagram set diagram logic diagram widely known
This kind diagram show possible logical relation finite collection different set
These diagram depict element point plane well set region inside closed curve
A Venn diagram consists multiple overlapping closed curve usually represented circle represents set
The point inside curve labeled S represent element set S point outside boundary represent element set S
In Venn diagram curve overlapped different way showing possible relation existing set
This kind diagram invented year paper work named On Diagrammatic Mechanical Representation Propositions Reasonings John Venn Philosophical Magazine Journal Science used teach elementary set theory well illustrate simple set relationship logic linguistics probability computer science
Venn never used term Venn diagram referred invention Eulerian Circles

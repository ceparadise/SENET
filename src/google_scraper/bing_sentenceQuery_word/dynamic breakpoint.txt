Dynamic programming algorithm often used
A dynamic programming algorithm examine previously solved subproblems combine solution give best solution given problem
In comparison treat solution sequence step pick locally optimal choice step
Using greedy algorithm guarantee optimal solution picking locally optimal choice may result bad global solution often faster calculate
Some greedy algorithm however proven lead optimal solution
For example finding minimum number coin given denomination needed make given amount dynamic programming algorithm would find optimal solution amount first finding optimal solution smaller amount using solution construct optimal solution larger amount
In contrast greedy algorithm might treat solution sequence coin starting given amount step subtracting largest possible coin denomination le current remaining amount
If coin denomination given amount greedy algorithm give solution optimal solution
In addition finding optimal solution problem dynamic programming also used counting number solution example counting number way certain amount change made given collection coin counting number optimal solution coin change problem described

A mathematical optimization problem often used teaching dynamic programming economist solved hand concern consumer life period must decide much consume much save period
Let consumption period assume consumption yield long consumer life
Assume consumer impatient future utility factor period
Let period
Assume initial capital given amount suppose period capital consumption determine next period capital positive constant
Assume capital negative
Then consumer decision problem written follows Written way problem look complicated involves solving choice variable
Note choice consumer initial capital taken given
The dynamic programming approach solve problem involves breaking apart sequence smaller decision
To define sequence represent value amount capital time
Note assumption utility capital death
The value quantity capital previous time calculated using
In problem Bellman equation This problem much simpler one wrote involves two decision variable
Intuitively instead choosing whole lifetime plan birth consumer take thing one step time
At time current capital given need choose current consumption saving
To actually solve problem work backwards
For simplicity current level capital denoted

Consider problem assigning value either zero one position matrix even row column contains exactly zero one
We ask many different assignment given
For example four possible solution There least three possible approach dynamic programming
Brute force consists checking assignment zero one counting balanced row column zero one
As possible assignment strategy practical except maybe
Backtracking problem consists choosing order matrix element recursively placing one zero checking every row column number element assigned plus number one zero least
While sophisticated brute force approach visit every solution making impractical larger six since number solution already shall see
Dynamic programming make possible count number solution without visiting

We consider board whose row contain zero one
The function applied map vector pair integer number admissible board solution
There one pair column two component indicate respectively number zero one yet placed column
We seek value argument one vector element
The process subproblem creation involves iterating every one possible assignment top row board going every column subtracting one appropriate element pair column depending whether assignment top row contained zero one position
If one result negative assignment invalid contribute set solution recursion stop
Otherwise assignment top row board recursively compute number solution remaining board adding number solution every admissible assignment top row returning sum memoized

Note equal minimum cost get three square since square reach plus
For instance Now let u define somewhat general term The first line equation make recursive property simpler dealing edge need one recursion

In following pseudocode size board return minimum number value It noted function computes actual path
We get path soon
This like example horribly slow since waste time recomputing shortest path

Let maximum number value distinguishable using try egg
Then
Let floor first egg dropped optimal strategy
If first egg broke distinguishable using try egg
If first egg break distinguishable using try egg
Therefore
Then problem equivalent finding minimum
To could compute order increasing would take time
Thus separately handle case algorithm would take time
But recurrence relation fact solved giving computed time using identity
Since binary search find giving algorithm
Matrix chain multiplication example demonstrates utility dynamic programming
For example engineering application often multiply chain matrix
It surprising find matrix large dimension example
Therefore task multiply matrix
As know basic linear algebra matrix multiplication commutative associative multiply two matrix time
So multiply chain matrix many different way example
There numerous way multiply chain matrix
They produce final result however take le time compute based particular matrix multiplied
If matrix A dimension matrix B dimension matrix dimension require scalar multiplication using simplistic matrix multiplication algorithm purpose illustration
For example let u multiply matrix A B Let u assume dimension respectively
Matrix size calculated two way shown Let u assume n p
So first way multiply chain require calculation
The second way require calculation
Obviously second way faster multiply matrix using arrangement parenthesis
Therefore conclusion order parenthesis matter task find optimal order parenthesis
At point several choice one design dynamic programming algorithm split problem overlapping problem calculate optimal arrangement parenthesis

For example multiplying chain turn mean optimal placement parenthesis matrix multiply matrix require scalar calculation
This algorithm produce table entry possible value j
The final solution entire chain n corresponding split n
Unraveling solution recursive starting top continuing reach base case

Therefore next step actually split chain
place parenthesis optimally belong
For purpose could use following algorithm Of course algorithm useful actual multiplication
This algorithm way see result look like
To actually multiply matrix using proper split need following algorithm The term originally used describe process solving problem one need find best decision one another

During execution C program I debugging I like Visual Studio automatically set breakpoints certain condition met
Is possible
Do I need special edition Enterprise edition
I using Visual Studio Community Edition
I notice I label Visual Studio breakpoints
I also notice breakpoints action I set
In Community edition action I take log output window
It would perfect action allowed breakpoints tag foobar
I also seeing I need conditional breakpoints
For example I see way say break breakpoint label already executed
If feature exists Enterprise edition perhaps answer time upgrade

I class list property seems lose element certain circumstance
I find happens
So I like set Visual Studio breakpoint pause program moment value change
A conditional breakpoint would work scenario since I idea removing breakpoint
To put another way I want program stop moment evaluates new number
Any idea
This possible C language due CLR limitation
The Visual Studio native code debugger support data breakpoints code exactly supported managed code
You could try break intercept method call collection suggested answer question
What swapping listen event
It implement interface enough overlap available method result syntax semantic compatibility
I assuming Visual Studio IDE
Set breakpoint right click select condition type choose Has Changed
Subclass List class override Count add breakpoint method create
EDIT As mentioned comment would require great deal effort since Add Remove method virtual complete rewrite method would needed
Also subclassing Collection would apparently better solution though I ca discern reason since virtual member Collection either comment
Find usage particular property add breakpoint line remove element list
Or may create IList implementation set breakpoint Remove method ca subclass List without changing client List virtual
This maybe question answer step Framework code debugging provided set Visual studio way
It could put breakpoint actual List implementation
You set data breakpoints visual studio going difficult managed code garbage collector may move object around
That said may still able pull

There confusion
Let clear
An array static data structure size set moment created ever change
If want array make whole new one copy content old one new one
This expensive operation cause object hold reference original array lose entirely
You also insert value easily beginning populated array
It bit like arriving late theatre trying sit aisle seat
If seat occupied insert another seat
Everyone would get move along seat create space
The opposite static data structure dynamic data structure
An example dynamic data structure linked list
Since linked list us object reference give illusion list item next easy add item end list even insert middle
There good example linked list
Trains go way explaining work miss crucial point item logically next list physically next memory
Now static another meaning talking array static data structure I want say array static data structure
Do say array static could ambiguous see
Remember difference class object
Student class create many object like
So Akhi Amanullah object type Student
As Ethan Fleming Jun Park
Normally give class attribute field variable get copy attribute
Hence student object mentioned name height subject etc
However declare variable method static one whole class one object created class
That mean static variable get new value instance class see new value
Indeed even instance use static variable
That class variable object variable
Static variable often used store information true object class never change like constant
They accessed using dot notation name class
Java value pi
Math class I instantiate using PI variable
That PI variable declared static
The problem student programmer static arises fact entry point program Java main method declared static
Of course least one method declared static otherwise would instantiate object could ever even run line code since instantiating object IS running line code stuck
So immediately start running program Java call static context
If try access variable run method declared static problem shown The error get method woof referenced static context
We tried call woof method without created Dog object
So I create Dog object right
You get exactly error method woof referenced static context
The problem specified dog woof method call
Here code work This work called longer static context
That mean calling method belongs object instead trying call method belongs whole class
Another strategy get round problem always separate class contains main method class model object program
Notice left static context immediately problem later
Finally lazy way getting round problem associated static declare EVERYTHING static
If find either lazy b using language
Looks fine

On AskUbuntu I seen command around look quite complicated lot symbol
To get better understanding command built I like know symbol stand
For example even complicated I understand well adding parameter certain effect main commmand
The meaning almost case found page really I looking
Please try answer define symbol specifically instead explaining example I gave
That could look like Thanks advance Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
See section called
I refer anytime I need learn something new shell scripting
I think find ABS Chapter easiest navigate purpose
All symbol seen far left page description immediately
Unfortunately go man page symbol may different meaning depending command reading
For instance first command meaning depend find command man find
The meaning quote argument sed dependent either sed bash quoted parameter potentially shell thing
The definitely bash pattern expansion thing
For second complicated command mostly echoing stuff find information bash man page
To answer comment redirection character used pipe stuff file greater lesser sign connect command output another input pipe
See nice tutorial redirection powerful design feature Unix shell toolset
one search file ending within directory ute streamline editor sed earches change
The one eludes show empty result executed
The best resource I found learning terminal command give detailed description used command available
It hard tell full meaning symbol pasting complex command
The echo particular
See man echo enables escape lateer escape
The majority symbol string manipulation
So imagine variable contains string foo But becomes complex variable also part string Now manipulate string well print part In case print Strip shortest match wildcard See Next hit sub shell x Bash process command sub shell return output command
x sub string continue Now test x See And I tell
In bash x going empty string
logical logical test empty string AND echo empty string echo x You would need give syntax appears echo piping output somewhere
Again test escaped beginning
So I explain much echo
The reason output enter echo command terminal snipit code default neither x defined output empty
For question symbol specific language might want try You search web character Google find

The function terminal confined display input data device significant local programmable data processing capability may called smart terminal
A terminal depends host computer processing power called dumb terminal
A personal computer run software replicates function terminal sometimes allowing concurrent use local program access distant system
The terminal first working programmable fully automatic digital computer keyboard row lamp show result
Early user terminal connected computer electromechanical TeleTYpewriter TTY ASR originally used
Later printing terminal developed
However printing terminal limited speed paper could printed interactive use paper record unnecessary
By early many user computer industry realized affordable video data entry terminal could supplant ubiquitous permit new us computer would interactive
The problem amount memory needed store information page text comparable memory low end use
Displaying information video speed also challenge necessary control logic took rack worth electronics
One company announced plan build video terminal attracted large backlog order folded engineering plan included fabricating ICs proved ambitious
Another approach involved use specialized developed retained information written without need refresh
The announced shipped making one earliest terminal
It solved memory space issue mentioned using digital using rather later common choice
Early video computer display sometimes nicknamed Glass TTYs glass Teletypes Visual Display Units VDUs used individual primitive chip yet quickly became extremely popular device many different type computer system several supplier gravitated set common standard Starting late early dozen manufacturer terminal including many incompatible command sequence although many used early starting point
The great variation control code maker gave rise software identified grouped terminal type system software would correctly display input form using appropriate control code In system file stty utility TERM environment variable would used Data General Business BASIC software example sequence code sent terminal try read cursor position line content using sequence different manufacturer control code sequence response would determine number Data General Dasher terminal ADM terminal TTY special feature would available program say set code use
The great majority terminal monochrome manufacturer variously offering green white amber sometimes blue screen phosphor
Amber claimed reduce eye strain
Terminals modest colour capability also available widely used example colour version popular Wyse offered shade character cell
An intelligent terminal processing usually implying microprocessor built terminal microprocessor real processing input main computer attached would respond quickly keystroke
The term intelligent context date Notable example include predecessor introduced
From introduction user programmer could notice significant advantage VDU technology improvement yet programmer used feature new terminal later terminal example dumb terminal allowed programmer continue use older software
Some dumb terminal able respond escape sequence without needing microprocessor used multiple many single factor classed terminal intelligent ability within interrupting main computer send block data time example user finished whole field form
Most terminal early Data General DEC despite introduction ANSI terminal essentially dumb terminal although later ADM TVI model primitive capability
The advance microprocessor lower memory cost made possible terminal handle editing operation inserting character within field may previously required full character computer possibly slow modem line
Around mid intelligent terminal costing le dumb terminal would year earlier could provide enough local editing data send completed form main computer
Providing even processing possibility workstation like could run blurring distinction terminal Personal Computer
Another motivation development simplify reduce electronics required terminal
That also made practicable load several personality single terminal Qume could emulate many popular terminal day sold organization wish make software change
Frequently emulated terminal type included The escape code standard produced uniformity extent significant difference remained example ANSI mode terminal followed ANSI standard yet difference might exist code character attribute available field within form foreign character facility handling printer connected back screen
Most terminal connected often green amber screen
Typically terminal communicate computer via via cable often using EIA serial interface
system communicated using IBM protocol many computer many visual display supplier competing computer manufacturer terminal expand system
In fact instruction design originally conceived processor
While early single color screen terminal
The PC contain character generation hardware video signal video formatting generated PC graphic mode CPU software
An IBM PC monitor whether green monochrome display display technically much similar analog TV set without tuner terminal
With suitable PC could however emulate terminal capacity could connected mainframe minicomputer
The could booted terminal emulator mode ROM
Eventually personal computer greatly reduced market demand conventional terminal
In especially thin client combined economical local processing power central shared computer facility retain advantage terminal personal computer Today PC client provide emulation common terminal DEC using standard could run using software software Linux
Since advent subsequent popularization genuine hardware terminal used interface computer today
Using modern operating system like derivative feature mostly independent hardware used
When using GUI like one display typically occupied collection window associated various application rather single stream text associated single process
In case one may use application within windowing environment
This arrangement permit interaction computer running example without need physical terminal device even allow running terminal emulator device
A often sometimes serial computer interface text entry display
Information presented
When device use video display called visual display unit VDU video display terminal VDT
The text terminal used operate computer
Modern computer keyboard display console
Some operating system provide several text terminal single computer
The fundamental type application running text terminal command user executes command press
This includes environment
In shell command small application
Another important application type
A text editor occupies full area display display one text document allows user edit document
The text editor many us replaced usually provides rich formatting feature text editor lack
The first word processor used text communicate structure document later word processor operate graphical environment provide simulation formatted output
Programs control local terminal let user interact remote server
On work similarly
In simplest form text terminal like file
Writing file display text reading file produce user enters
In operating system several correspond available text terminal
For operation special program use easily via library
For complex operation program use terminal specific system call
For application simplest way use terminal simply write read text string sequentially
The output text scrolled last several line typically visible
system typically input text key pressed application receives ready string text
In mode application need know much terminal
For many interactive application sufficient
One common enhancement assisted library also may give access command history
This helpful various interactive
Even advanced interactivity provided application
Those application completely control screen layout also respond immediately
This mode useful
In addition program control color brightness text screen decorate underline blinking special character

To achieve application must deal plain text string also allow move arbitrary position clear portion screen change color display special character also respond
The great problem many different terminal set
In order overcome special created together terminal description database
Dumb terminal interpret limited number control code etc
ability process special perform function clearing line clearing screen controlling position
In context dumb terminal sometimes dubbed essentially limited functionality mechanical
This type dumb terminal still supported modern system setting
terminal also ability process escape sequence particular
A graphical terminal display image well text
Graphical terminal divided terminal
A display directly draw line face control host computer system
The line continuously formed since speed electronics limited number concurrent line displayed one time limited
display historically important longer used
Practically modern graphic display descended picture scanning technique used visual element rectangular array
Since raster image perceptible human eye whole short time raster must refreshed many time per second give appearance persistent display
The electronic demand refreshing display memory meant graphic terminal developed much later text terminal initially cost much
Most terminal today graphical show image screen
The modern term graphical terminal
A thin client typically us protocol like Microsoft Windows
The bandwidth needed depends protocol used resolution
Modern graphic terminal allow display image color text varying size color type face
In early industry consortium attempted define standard would allow single CRT screen implement multiple window behave distinct terminal
Unfortunately like suffered run closed standard unable obtain even minimal information realistic way small company independent developer could join consortium
Possibly standard disappeared without trace
A piece software emulates text terminal
In past widespread use broadband internet access many computer would use serial access program communicate computer via serial device
When first released program called used communicate many computer including
Dec Terminal one first terminal program popular
The Windows emulate physical terminal support program logging textually remote computer Windows including Telnet program bundled version Windows often incorporate code process escape sequence
The terminal emulator system example qterminal emulate physical terminal including support escape sequence
xterm emulate hardware terminal
Terminals operate various mode relating send input typed user keyboard receiving system whatever may There distinction key
In terminal switch mode pressing key block mode thing pressing key
Whilst key cause input line sent host mode key rather cause terminal transmit content character row cursor currently positioned host prompt
Different computer require different degree mode support terminal used computer terminal
The provided Unix operating system accommodate terminal rarely requires terminal mode since operating system required provide terminal device driver operating system local echo terminal performs line editing function host end
Most usually especially host system support terminal system always mode
In contrast terminal connected system always required block mode

In also known classic example problem
The problem describes two process producer consumer share common used
The producer job generate data put buffer start
At time consumer consuming data removing buffer one piece time
The problem make sure producer wo try add data buffer full consumer wo try remove data empty buffer
The solution producer either go sleep discard data buffer full
The next time consumer remove item buffer notifies producer start fill buffer
In way consumer go sleep find buffer empty
The next time producer put data buffer wake sleeping consumer
The solution reached mean typically using
An inadequate solution could result process waiting awakened
The problem also generalized multiple producer consumer
To solve problem programmer might come solution shown
In solution two library routine used
When sleep called caller blocked another process wake using wakeup routine
The global variable hold number item buffer
The problem solution contains lead
Consider following scenario Since process sleep forever run deadlock
This solution therefore unsatisfactory
An alternative analysis programming language define semantics concurrent access shared variable case without use synchronization solution unsatisfactory reason without needing explicitly demonstrate race condition
solve problem lost wakeup call
In solution use two semaphore solve problem
number item already buffer available read number available space buffer item could written
incremented decremented new item put buffer
If producer try decrement value zero producer put sleep
The next time item consumed incremented producer wake
The consumer work analogously
The solution work fine one producer consumer
With multiple producer sharing memory space item buffer multiple consumer sharing memory space solution contains serious race condition could result two process reading writing slot time
To understand possible imagine procedure implemented
It could contain two action one determining next available slot writing
If procedure executed concurrently multiple producer following scenario possible To overcome problem need way make sure one producer executing time
In word need way execute
The solution multiple producer consumer shown
Notice order different semaphore incremented decremented essential changing order might result deadlock
It important note though mutex seems work semaphore value binary semaphore difference fact mutex ownership concept
Ownership mean mutex incremented back set process decremented set others task wait mutex available decrement effectively meaning resource available ensures mutual exclusivity avoids deadlock
Thus using mutexes improperly stall many process exclusive access required mutex used instead semaphore
The following show solution problem using
Since mutual exclusion implicit monitor extra effort necessary protect critical section
In word solution shown work number producer consumer without modification
It also noteworthy using monitor make race condition much le likely using semaphore
The problem particularly case single producer single consumer strongly relates implementing
The pattern provide highly efficient data communication without relying semaphore mutexes monitor
Use primitive give performance issue expensive implement
Channels FIFOs popular avoid need atomic synchronization
A basic example coded C shown

They may eat plant may eat animal
At bottom every food chain food web
These organism like plant algae make energy using sun
In food chain first step producer
These animal eat producer
They usually range size smallest insect leaf beetle largest land mammal elephant
Primary consumer get energy eating plant algae directly
Some large dull flat teeth help grind chew plant matter
Many also special bacteria living within intestine help break cellulose large sugar found cell wall plant
Insects numerous primary consumer Earth
They well adapted getting energy part plant eat
Some like grasshopper eat entire plant
Caterpillars hand eat leaf
There also certain beetle bore stem plant eat fiber make
There insect eat root
Some primary consumer called
These animal eat one kind plant plant product
For example giant panda Figure eats leaf shoot bamboo termite eat wood hummingbird eat nectar made within flower
Each animal getting energy need consuming producer part producer
Animals eat animal called

When come food choice predator fussy
They eat whatever meat find
Lions eat antelope zebra water buffalo Figure
Sharks eat squid fish seal
As long prey animal provide enough energy predator menu secondary consumer
Many secondary consumer teeth used ripping tearing flesh
These teeth sharp biting flat tearing
When predator make kill often us mouth attack
Its sharp canine puncture flesh prey bringing
It use tearing teeth tear meat body
Prey evolve adapt predator hunting strategy predator evolve adapt prey evasive adaptation
Examples include zebra camouflage leopard night vision
A great example secondary consumer coyote Figure
They often hunt pair eat rabbit bird ground squirrel deer even livestock farm
Being related dog sharp canine teeth used bite prey tear apart
Their range enlarged recent year due ability eat many different thing
In food web transfer energy stop secondary consumer
There often animal eat animal get energy
These called
A typical marine food chain could look like phytoplankton zooplankton small fish squid In example phytoplankton producer zooplankton primary consumer small fish secondary consumer squid eats small fish tertiary consumer
It getting energy eating secondary consumer small fish
There higher energy level food chain
Some organism fill quaternary even quinary energy level
In example given seal eat squid would make quaternary consumer
Food chain rarely five level energy transfer enough energy support organism far away producer
important part ecosystem
organism make energy sun like plant algae
eat producer herbivore like deer squirrel
eat primary consumer often carnivore like wolf cougar
Tertiary consumer quaternary consumer exist ecosystem usually go beyond quinary enough energy available keep passing along

If like lot people probably bought used car
So may thinking learn primary consumer
It obviously first person buy something like person I bought used car right
That may true regular world primary consumer slightly different meaning scientific world
Scientists needed way identify classify passing energy food consumption among living organism
In order fully understand concept need remember plant also living organism addition animal fungi bacteria
Every living organism classification consumer ranking
Let go back first person buying car minute
What happen person buy car
The car made produced right
The true living organism
In order organism consume food food must produced
The production food come
Photosynthetic plant go process order make food light therefore energy
After completing photosynthesis plant contain energy passed living organism plant eaten
The living organism eat producer considered similarly first person buy car primary consumer particular car
The primary consumer energy organism called eat
Secondary consumer organism whose main food source primary consumer
This similar second consumer car
Even secondary consumer energy pas consumed
These consumer feed mostly secondary consumer
As may guessed point tertiary consumer like person may buy used car
Now know primary consumer let look example
We established primary consumer living organism eats producer plant
This mean organism classified also called fall category primary consumer
This may include animal giraffe rabbit cow horse

organism eat plant animal also act primary consumer eat plant producer even though technically classified secondary consumer
This would include u human since able eat plant animal
Just think eating healthy helping broccoli
Other organism category include chicken raccoon bear fly

Family consumer science previously known United States home economics often abbreviated home ec HE
In various organization including adopted new term family consumer science reflect fact field cover aspect outside home life wellness
The field also known name including human science home science domestic economy
In addition home economics strong historic relationship field since number home economics program renamed program including
One first champion economics running home sister
Catherine Harriet leader century North America talking domestic science
They came religious family valued education especially woman
The propelled domestic science ahead land grant college sought educate farm wife running household husband educated agricultural method process

At designed Rumford Kitchen tiny kitchen served nutritious meal thousand fair goer along healthy dose nutrition education
She shunned invitation participate Women Building said none research woman work rather information
Late century Richards convened group contemporary discus essence domestic science element discipline would ultimately improve quality life many individual family
They met pristine Lake Placid New York invitation
Over course next year educator worked tirelessly elevate discipline become home economics legitimate profession
Richards wanted call science right living
science controllable environment also name choice home economics ultimately chosen official term
Richards founded American Home Economics Association called
In AHEA passage two crucial piece legislation allowed home economist establish formal niche research teaching within institution higher education
The Act Act provided funding expand demonstration work rural community develop teach home economics curriculum campus state college
This legislation contributed creation Office Home Economics grew early century
Home economics emerged turn twentieth century movement train woman efficient household manager
At moment American family began consume many good service produced
To guide woman transition professional home economics two major goal teach woman assume new role modern consumer communicate homemaker need manufacturer political leader
The development profession progressed origin educational movement identity source consumer expertise interwar period virtual disappearance
An additional goal field rationalize housework lend social status profession based theory housework could intellectually fulfilling woman engaged along emotional relational benefit
In century home economics class intended ready young woman duty home healthy environment
Classes first offered United States Canada Germany Great Britain followed Latin America Asia Africa
International organization associated involved starting home economics program around world
Through later University program granting master science household equipment

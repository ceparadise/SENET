Wherever considered root polynomial may exist larger field entry matrix instance may complex case matrix real entry
The possibility reinterpret entry matrix element larger field example view real matrix complex matrix whose entry happen real allows considering square matrix posse full set eigenvalue
Alternatively one consider matrix entry outset
More generally abstract algebra make great use matrix entry

No organization design method management perfect
And form suffer variety problem develop design
This particularly true company try new form
In article look one relatively new organization gained considerable popularity recent year significant pathology
Before discussing ill however let u look moment matrix management organization see sidebar widespread matrix industry today
The identifying feature matrix organization manager report two boss rather traditional single bos dual rather single chain command
Companies tend turn matrix form absolutely essential highly responsive two sector simultaneously market technology face uncertainty generate high information processing requirement must deal strong constraint financial human resource
Matrix structure help provide flexibility balanced decision making price complexity
Matrix organization matrix structure
It must reinforced matrix system dual control evaluation system leader operate comfortably lateral decision making culture negotiate open conflict balance power
In matrix organization dual command responsibility assigned functional department marketing production engineering forth product market department
The former oriented specialized resource latter focus output
Other matrix split department either product function
Every matrix contains three unique critical role top manager head balance dual chain command matrix boss functional product area share subordinate manager report two different matrix boss
Each role special requirement
Aerospace company first adopt matrix form company many industry chemical banking insurance packaged good electronics computer forth different field hospital government agency professional organization adapting different form matrix
The list company using form matrix becoming long impressive
Take example company annual sale billion employ people score diverse Electric
For decade despite diversity business GE used one basic structure throughout organization five functional manager reporting one general manager
Employing logic company must organize meet particular need business GE group division department found pyramid form cumbersome turned matrix fundamental alternative
In projecting organization next ten year GE management state Organization Planning Bulletin September We highlighted matrix organization
bandwagon want jump rather complex difficult sometimes frustrating form organization live
It also however bellwether thing come
But implemented well offer much best world
And u going learn utilize organization prepare manager increasingly deal high level complexity ambiguity situation get result people component direct Successful experience operating matrix constitutes better preparation individual run huge diversified institution like General many complex conflicting interest must product functional mode hallmark past twenty Other major corporation diverse activity Bechtel Citibank Dow Chemical Shell Oil Texas Instruments TRW mention also turned matrix
Based study matrix company believe matrix popularity simply passing fad us founded solid business reason persist
The matrix basic advantage familiar functional product structure facilitates rapid management response changing market technical requirement
Further help middle manager make decision general management perspective
Because matrix relatively new form however company adopted necessity learning trial error basis
The mistake well success pioneer informative company follow lead
Here present common problem occur company us matrix form
For sake easy reference diagnose pathology first discus prevention treatment
By using format however mean suggest simple treatment pathology cure
Many ailment discus arise conventional organization matrix seems somewhat vulnerable particular one
It wise therefore manager thinking adopting matrix familiar diagnosis prevention treatment nine particular pathology tendency toward anarchy power struggle severe groupitis collapse economic crunch excessive overhead sinking lower level uncontrolled layering navel gazing decision strangulation
manager firsthand familiarity matrix organization tend fear matrix lead anarchy
Are concern based real hazard
Actually today considerable number organization successfully using matrix form need treat anarchy general hazard matrix
However certain condition major misconception could lead company formless confusion resembles anarchy
Through firsthand experience know one organization using latent matrix form quite literally came apart seam rather mild economic recession
Following strategy company used high stock multiple acquire completely assimilate smaller company recreation equipment field
Within period six month company changed exciting success dramatic disaster
Its entire manufacturing distribution financial system went control leaving unfilled order closed factory distressed inventory huge debt wake
Of course many possible reason might happened one perfectly reasonable explanation organization design failed stress
What design
Essentially organization used functional structure
As acquired small company top management first encouraged owner general manager leave attached company three basic function sale production engineering counterpart parent organization
Within parent marketing department young aggressive product manager would assigned develop acquired product line comprehensive marketing plan included making sale forecast promotion plan pricing plan projected earnings forth
Once top management approved plan told selected product manager hustle around make plan come true
This latent matrix came
The product manager would find working across functional line try coordinate production schedule inventory cash flow distribution pattern without explicit formal agreement nature relationship functional manager
Because locked approved marketing plan sale slipped behind schedule response exhort people try harder rather cut back production run
But one two thing began crumble enough reserve system keep everything else going wrong
As product manager lost control power vacuum developed functional manager fell grabbing total control
The result mild recession triggered condition approaching anarchy
believe lesson experience loud clear
Organizations rely much informal latent matrix coordinate critical task
Relationships functional product manager explicit people approximate agreement various circumstance
Properly used matrix leave matter indefinite status definite structure free form organization
A useful anarchy index many people organization recognize one bos feel responsible major part work
In study five medical school notoriously anarchical one explicit matrix structure also one least number bossless people
worst happen company plunge anarchy true crisis management would best response
The crisis response really mystery
The CEO must pull key people critical information center
He must personally make important decision schedule crisis
Then undertake work reshaping organization withstand future shock minor recession
essence matrix dual command
For form survive need balance power locus seems shift constantly party always jockeying gain advantage
It enough simply create balance must also continual mechanism checking imbalance creep
In business organization operate balance power form constant tendency toward imbalance
As long group dimension organization try maximize advantage others continual balancing struggle dominant power
A power struggle matrix qualitatively different traditionally structured hierarchy latter clearly illegitimate
In matrix however power struggle inevitable boundary authority responsibility overlap prompting people maximize advantage
top manager find exceedingly difficult forestall power struggle
Equal strength part two party however prevent struggle reaching destructive height
Friendly competition encouraged combat severely punished
Managers matrix push advantage never intention eliminating share power always perspective encompasses position
best way ensure power struggle undermine matrix make manager power ax aware win power absolutely lose ultimately
These manager need see total victory one dimension end balance finish duality command destroys matrix
They must see sharing power underlying principle ensuing inevitable power struggle
Matrix manager recognize need worthy adversary counterpart match turn conflict constructive end
For successful outcome three thing necessary
First matrix manager always maintain institutional point view seeing struggle larger shared perspective
Second jointly agree remove matrix manager weakness whatever inability losing irretrievable ground
And third replace weak manager strongest available mean placing strong manager weakened part organization reversing power initiative
Another key element stopping power struggle get hand destroy balance top level superior duelling manager report
Because element matrix system depends strong individual one share authority delegated say board arbitrate subordinate
The top manager many vehicle amount time spends one side matrix pay differential velocity promotion direct order issued one dimension forth
What must however protect weak dimension organization necessarily weak manager charge dimension
confusion matrix behavior group decision making probably arises fact matrix often evolves new project business team suggest group decision process
Under many circumstance course perfectly sensible manager make decision group
But manager expect difficulty arise believe group decision making essence matrix behavior
We seen one matrix organization severe case This multiproduct electronics company product manager product team comprised specialist drawn rank every functional department assigned every product
So far good
But somehow idea matrix structure requires business decision hammered group meeting became prevalent organization
To make decision way considered illegitimate spirit matrix operation
Many decision made product involved detailed matter one two people regularly conversant
Yet team member constrained listen issue discussed decision made even expected participate discussion influence choice
Some individual seemed enjoy steady diet meeting chance practice generalist
However larger number people felt time wasted would preferred leaving decision informed people
The engineer particular complained time spending meeting robbing opportunity strengthen special competence identity
As well noting personal reaction senior manager reported general disappointment speed flexibility organizational response
whole idea matrix organization still unfamiliar many manager understandable confuse process group decision making
The key prevention education
Top manager need accompany strategic choice move toward matrix serious educational effort clarify participant matrix
case multiproducts electronics company problem came light researching matrix approach
Once senior people clearly diagnosed problem cured
Top management emphatically stated nothing sacred group decision sensible product team member involved time
Once line individual group matter drawn according information really relevant decision meeting became fewer smaller work proceeded economical responsive basis
The concept teamwork put perspective often necessary little possible
organization blossom period rapid growth prosperity sometimes cast away period economic decline
On reflection understand
In prosperous time company often expand business line market serve
The ensuing complexity may turn toward matrix management organization
However company follow normal business cycle period two five year experience another economic crunch enough time matrix concept spread throughout company
By time matrix occupies central place company conversation familiar part organization
Although may still problem matrix seems stay
When part economic cycle begin senior management company may become appreciably bothered conflict subordinate well apparent slowness respond situation
We need decisive action rallying cry
In authoritarian structure top management act quickly need consider spectrum opinion
Thinking time organizational toy tinkering top level manager take command almost quite forgotten way ram directive line
The matrix done management prevent kind collapse matrix employing general managerial excellence independent matrix long crunch arrives
Good planning example often forecast downturn economic cycle
Corporate structure matrix change standard change business cycle
When management planning poor however matrix readily available scapegoat
Companies experience severe economic crunch often make drastic change many direction trimming product line closing office making massive personnel budget cut tightening managerial control
The matrix often done period several reason represents great risk never really worked properly giving coup de grace disguise failure implementation quality decision making improved performance sufficiently counterbalance hard time
Measures management take prevent pathology lie within matrix much improvement basic managerial skill planning
A real estate construction company provides example company anticipate flexibly respond economic crunch demonstrates strength rather weakness matrix
The company developed structure well procedure especially well suited economic uncertainty business
These include set fully owned subsidiary equivalent functional department manufacturing company home base varied specialist needed execute phase major building project
The head subsidiary act chief salesman various service often head bidding team put together sophisticated proposal
As proposal project proceeds selected project manager drawn team anticipation securing contract
This ensures orderly transition project management phase
The project office given responsibility control cost schedule quality project top management team parent company review project regularly backup
The company used matrix advantage weathering major shift availability business market segment example school hospital level construction activity
It maintains cadre professional specialist project manager kept busy low cycle rapidly expands high subcontracting temporary service
one pathology requires preventive treatment know cure
When matrix collapse economic crunch unlikely resurrected
At best organization go back pendulum day alternating centralized management crunch period decentralized freedom prosperous time
Even top management try likely get negative response lower level manager
They said committed matrix first sign hard time nice word advantage matrix turned If company conditioned response hard time retrench attempt matrix first place
face matrix organization would seem double management cost dual chain command
This issue deserves thoughtful consideration
The limited amount research matrix overhead cost indicates initial phase overhead cost fact rise matrix matures extra cost disappear offset productivity gain
Our experience support finding
In large electronics company observed detail initial overhead increase necessarily occur matrix also inflate unnecessarily
In case company decided employ matrix design outset setting new operating division new plant site
This unique organizational experiment number positive attribute one problem overhead cost
In staffing new division top management filled every functional office every product manager slot one person
This resulted relatively small division top level manager well functional group product manager
Within month however top heavy division pared reasonable staffing level assigning individual two slot management got cost control
division problem caused top management assumption managerial slot requires incumbent
Overstaffing much le liable occur organization evolves gradually conventional design matrix manager perform functional product manager
While technique justified transition strategy also hazard
A safer route assign manager role side matrix two functional job two product management job
As final argument fear overhead cost consider organization would adopt matrix structure without longer run expectation given level output cost operation would lower organizational form
In way economy achieved
The potential economy come two general source fewer bad decision le featherbedding
First important matrix improve quality business decision help bring needed information emphasis bear critical decision timely fashion
The second source le featherbedding obvious potentially greater significance
How work
clearest example matrix potential reduce redundancy human resource way consulting organization employ
These firm usually set matrix functional specialist client account manager
The body consultant grouped fellow specialist available assignment project leadership account client manager
From accounting standpoint therefore consultant time directly billed client account working account engagement manager
Otherwise time charged budget function manager
The firm cost therefore department individual consultant
Of course time charged functional department background study research work time assignment mean thought wasted
But management budget time advance scrutinize variance budget
As one senior manager consulting firm put There place hide matrix This fact make demand middle level people consequently put pressure produce
For good people involved organization top manager need keep pressure becoming strong
Because perfectly possible get much well little pressure creative tension sought
may occur two reason
Either senior management understood able implement matrix concept well lower level manager matrix found appropriate place
For example company set matrix basic functional product group product manager never truly relinquish complete control matrix fails take hold corporate level
But say one two manager find idea useful within division
Their functional specialist project leader share power delegate design survive within subunit corporation
For example Dow Chemical attempt maintain balance top failed balance held within geographic area several year
When sinking occurs top management misunderstanding likely occur conjunction pathology particularly power struggle
For instance many senior executive consider adopting matrix idea one really become convinced worth danger top espouse philosophy method employ pitted able show work
corporate top management think dimension company must balance level aggregation keep matrix sinking
For example top manager ask business unit need balanced central functional department
If answer business unit operate product division traditional pyramid command others share functional service partial matrix
However sinking always bad prevented indicates appropriate design disintegrating
matrix management run smoothly must proper location
As often matrix sink may simply experiencing healthy adjustment ought thought settling rather sinking
Settling likely occur early stage matrix evolution lead manageable matrix unit
The question size great concern many manager ask effect That sound great company thousand employee work company employee
Its entire company size one Our experience indicates matrix management organization seems function better manager involved matrix relationship
But rule company
In company manager likely matrix company employee may need involved dual reporting line
With number people need coordinate regularly able communication network based personal relation
Whatever size unit matrix operates important thing management reasoned carefully analysis task design organization
Then settling occurs seen pathology suggests organization capacity evolve growth
matrix sink also cascade organization filter several level across several division
This layering process may may pathological
In fact may rational logical development matrix include briefly sometimes creates problem solves
In term metaphor used article layering pathology matrix begin metastasize
When occurs organization chart begin resemble blueprint complex electronic machine relationship become unnecessarily complex matrix form may become burden worth
best remedy uncontrolled layering careful task analysis reduced power struggle
We seen case one dimension matrix clearly losing power adapting beat em join em philosophy created matrix within dimension
A product unit example developed functional expertise distinct functional unit next level
The best defense good offense seemed
In two case international division two large company created matrix adding business manager overlay geographic format without reconciling manager ran domestic group
In case adequate conceptualization top manager would probably simplified organization design forestalled layering occurred power maneuver
Management treat unhealthy state best rebalancing matrix manager one dimension either threatened pushed hard toward power goal
Matrix design complex enough without addition power struggle
A matrix bound le complex easier manage one illogically organized
matrix foster considerable interdependence people task demand negotiating skill part member matrix manager sometimes tend get absorbed internal relation expense paying attention world outside organization particularly client
When happens organization spends energy ironing dispute serving customer
The outward focus disappears demand daily working life yet worked
The navel gazers lethargic rather involved heated fraternal affair
This inward preoccupation common early phase matrix new behavior learned matrix operating year
pathology develop matrix attention cure bound increase internal focus member prevention pathology certainly reduce likelihood one occurring
Awareness tendency also help
Since product dimension organization generally external focus resource dimension responsibility preventing excessive introspection equally distributed
The product dimension people help others keep perspective strong marketing orientation best preventative
manager matrix navel gazing first step treatment make manager aware effect
Are customer complaining lot least usual
Managers need confront internal conflict also recognize confrontation secondary maintaining effective external relationship
Navel gazing generally occurs matrix fully initiated yet debugged
People accept engrossed figuring make work
The second step treat inward focus symptom underlying issue institutionalize matrix relationship become familiar comfortable routine people work without becoming obsessed
Finally must always remembered form organization mean never become end
Can moving matrix lead strangulation decision process endless delay debate clearing everybody sight
Will decision matter well thought made late use
Will many people power water bold initiative veto outright
Such condition arise matrix
We mind three clearing escalation conflict unilateral calling slightly different preventive action treatment
one company know various functional specialist reported second bos product manager picked idea clear issue functional boss agreeing product decision
This meant every issue discussed least two meeting
During first meeting specialist product manager could review fact issue tabled second meeting specialist cleared matter functional process given de facto veto product decision
This impossible clearing procedure represented view failure delegation matrix
One need ask functional specialist could trusted act spot regard product decision way would consistent general guideline functional department
Either specialist poorly selected inexperienced badly informed superior lacking workable degree trust one another
Regardless problem prevention treatment need addressed directly without making scapegoat matrix
possible source decision strangulation matrix organization occurs manager frequently constantly refer decision dual chain command
Seeing one advantage conventional single chain command two disagreeing peer go shared bos resolution manager unfamiliar matrix worry problem almost
They look matrix realize nearest shared bos might CEO could five six echelon
They realize many problem pushed CEO resolution without creating ultimate information overload
So think inevitable disagreement lead tremendous pileup unresolved conflict
Certainly happen malfunctioning matrix
Whether happen depends primarily depth understanding exists required matrix behavior part manager dual structure
Let u envision following scene manager two boss get sharply conflicting instruction product functional boss
When try reconcile instruction without success quite properly asks session two boss resolve matter
The three people meet discussion bog resolution reached neither bos give way
The two boss appeal problem level respective superior two chain command
This critical step
If two superior properly understand matrix behavior first ascertain whether dispute reflects unresolved broader policy issue
If know proper step teach subordinate resolve problem solve
In short would let unresolved problem escalate would force back proper level solution insist solution found promptly
Often conflict resolved however managed must matrix work
Any course action would represent management failure comprehend essential nature design
third possible reason decision strangulation matrix system arise different style
Some manager feeling truly managing position make crisp unilateral decision
Identifying leadership decisive action become frustrated engage carefully reasoned debate wisdom want
Such manager likely feel frustrated even regard business problem whose resolution vitally affect function company experiencing critical dual pressure marketplace advancing technology
A matrix deliberately induces simultaneous decision making two perspective likely frustrate person even
If manager start feeling emasculated bilateral decision making certain unhappy matrix organization
In case strangulation eye beholder
Such people must work personal style look employment nonmatrix organization
We recommend every company adopt matrix form
But relevant become important part effective managerial process
Like new method may develop serious bug experience many company acquiring organization form help others realize benefit avoid pitfall
The matrix seems spread despite pathology necessary made desirable
It difficult complex human flexibility required arrive organizational flexibility
But reverse also true success given form legitimacy concept spread familiarity seems reduce resistance difficulty people experience using matrix
Managers beginning say It new different This familiarity sign acceptance change moderation design
For generation manager lived happy fiction dotted line indicating second reporting line necessary formal
The result always sort executive ménage à trois triangular arrangement manager one legitimate relationship reporting line one existed granted equal privilege dotted line
As executive develop greater confidence matrix form bring dotted line relationship closet grant legitimacy
Each time another organization turn matrix larger varied number predecessor charted way
The example wider applicability suggest matrix becoming le le experiment mature formulation organization design
As organization travel learning curve curve becomes easier one climb
Similarly manager gain experience operating matrix organization bound spread experience move inevitably organization
We believe future matrix organization become almost commonplace manager speak le difficulty pathology matrix advantage benefit

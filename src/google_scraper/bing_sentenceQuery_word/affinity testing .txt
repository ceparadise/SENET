The functional testing normally take test vereify specific function code also action kind testing normally found documentation code functional testing software normally take answer following question
user ables particular part codeing feature work
The Non functional testing normally take test software could related specific function user Non functional testing normally take answer following question example many user log possible hack software easly
The software testing take place association validation verification software
Verification The verification software testing mean know Software developed built example fulfill match user requirement specification software
Validation The validation software mean built right software customer want built
There issoftware testing approach taken perform software testing
The Box approach The box approach manly divide two part Black box testing white box testing The black box testing treat software black box mean testing take without knowing knowledge internal implementation Black box testing approach testing model based testing specification based testing
testing The specification testing use test functionalty software system according software tester input data able see output test type testing normally requires test case provided tester tester verify data given input output testing either expected
The specification testing important necessary would good certain risk
The white box testing another method test white box testing method done tester internal access data structure programe code implement type white box testing API Testing The API stand application programming interface API testing test application using public private API
Code Coverage Tsting This testing purpose test code example The software tester take test programming code execute testing software
Fault Ijection Testing This testing purpose improve code coverage
Static testing In static testing testing took white box testing static testing
There testing level Unit Testing The unit test take test functionality particular section programe testing normally takeing functional level example In Object Oriented language testing taken class level unit test object oriented include destructor test normally written tester work coding make sure every specific part codeing working testing could many test taken one fuction unit testing test functionalty software work unit testing also called component testing
Integration testing The integration testing type software testing verify interface component software design
The component software could integrated repertation process together integration software testing test find defect interface interaction integrated component
The large number software tester group test element design system test software work perfectly
System Testing The system testing test complete system make sure software fulfill requirement
System Integration Testing The system integration testing third party external member want intergate system able system define system requirement
Alpha Testing The alpha testing done end user customer independent mean actual user going use software test software developer alpha testing normally done software go sale handing shelf testing software go beta testing Beta Testing The beta testing take alpha beta testing mean software release limited people outside developer check functionalty purpose testing testing take find bug beta version software release open public get feedback maximum number people
Security Testing The security testing important software process personal detail customer data security important prevent system hacker
There commonly used cycle sample commonly used organisation using waterfall development model

Electron affinity reflects ability accept
It change occurs electron added gaseous atom
greater electron affinity
The reaction occurs atom take electron may represented X e X energy Another way define electron affinity amount energy needed remove electron singly charged negative ion X X e Electron affinity one trend predicted using organization element periodic table
Nonmetals typically higher electron affinity value metal
Chlorine strongly attracts electron
Mercury element atom weakly attract electron
Electron affinity difficult predict molecule electronic structure complicated
Keep mind electron affinity value apply gaseous atom molecule electron energy level liquid solid altered interaction atom molecule
Even electron affinity practical application
It used measure chemical hardness measure charged readily polarized Lewis acid base
It also used predict electronic chemical potential
The primary use electron affinity value determine whether atom molecule act electron acceptor electron donor whether pair reactant participate reaction
Electron affinity often reported unit kilojoule per mole
Sometimes value given term magnitude relative
If value electron affinity negative mean energy required attach electron
Negative value seen nitrogen atom also capture second electron
For negative value electron capture endothermic process attach The equation applies positive value
In situation change Δ negative value indicates exothermic process
Electron capture gas atom except noble gas release energy exothermic
One way remember capturing electron negative Δ remember energy let go released
The electron affinity ΔH H g e H g ΔH electron affinity hydrogen

Have ever affinity someone find effort effective getting friend
Affinity efficacy thing
Affinity relatively passive process
You may like someone
How effective like someone order get friend
Not
And succeed becoming friend effective relationship may may potent powerful
Affinity efficacy potency term also applicable believe drug
Let see
Drugs work binding specific receptor activating causing downstream effect
avidly drug bind receptor chemical force cause substance bind receptor
Affinity like drug desire connect open receptor
It refers much attraction drug receptor like magnet metal
Some drug higher affinity others lower affinity binding site
Let say drug low affinity receptor bound said receptor
Then sudden another drug come along much higher affinity receptor
The second drug displace lower affinity drug bind receptor want much
This may remind holiday shopping scene parent highest affinity newest child toy push others way grab last toy store
Now affinity efficacy
case refers drug ability activate receptor bound
When drug bind receptor assuming effectively turn receptor activate
Activation receptor initiate domino effect reaction eventually cause intended result drug slowing heart rate
Some drug high affinity high efficacy
This mean bind receptor great desire activate receptor job really well
That like saying carpenter hold high affinity drill effective using build home
Get FREE access day create account
But drug high affinity low efficacy
That like carpenter holding drill affinity knowing world
The drug affinity receptor bind mainly determines another special property drug compound known potency
amount drug necessary produce desired effect
Potency powerful strong drug
Let say take cough suppressant sick
If need take mg cough suppressant A stop cough well mg cough suppressant B cough suppressant A twice potent B since need half much get equivalent desired effect
But warned
If two drug exert similar effect potent one always drug want take
That take thing account drug side effect cost even duration action
Say drug A potent drug taken every hour suppress cough effectively le potent drug B drug B taken every hour would want bother drug A first place
All else equal probably
A drug refers chemical force cause substance bind receptor
It tell u attracted drug receptor
refers drug ability effectively activate receptor bound
Efficacy tell u good drug producing desired effect
Lastly amount drug necessary produce desired effect
Potency point drug

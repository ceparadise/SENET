This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

study theory experimentation engineering form basic design use computer
It scientific practical approach application systematic study feasibility structure expression mechanization methodical underlie acquisition representation processing storage communication access information
An alternate succinct definition computer science study automating algorithmic process scale
A specializes theory computation design computational system
Its field divided variety theoretical
Some field explores fundamental property intractable problem highly abstract field emphasize visual application
Other field still focus challenge implementing computation
For example considers various approach description computation study investigates various aspect use
considers challenge making computer computation useful usable human
The earliest foundation would become computer science predate invention modern
Machines calculating fixed numerical task existed since antiquity aiding computation multiplication division
Further performing computation existed since antiquity even development sophisticated computing equipment
designed constructed first working
In demonstrated digital mechanical calculator called
He may considered first computer scientist information theorist among reason documenting binary number system
In launched industry released simplified first calculating machine strong enough reliable enough used daily office environment
started design first eventually gave idea first
He started developing machine le two year sketched many salient feature modern computer
A crucial step adoption punched card system derived making infinitely programmable
In translation French article Analytical Engine wrote one many note included algorithm compute considered first computer program
Around invented used process statistical information eventually company became part
In one hundred year Babbage impossible dream convinced IBM making kind punched card equipment also calculator business develop giant programmable calculator based Babbage Analytical Engine used card central computing unit
When machine finished hailed Babbage dream come true
During new powerful machine developed term came refer machine rather human predecessor
As became clear computer could used mathematical calculation field computer science broadened study general
Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information
informazione automatica Italian information mathematics often used
French German Italian Dutch Spanish Portuguese mean informatics
Similar word also adopted UK
In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch
As discipline computer science span range topic theoretical study algorithm limit computation practical issue implementing computing system hardware software

It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field

You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

In related field shortened statement
In connective likened standard equal combined reverse hence name
The result truth either one connected statement requires truth
either statement true false
It controversial whether connective thus defined properly rendered English meaning
There nothing stop one may read connective although may lead confusion
In writing phrase commonly used debatable propriety alternative P Q include compare
Many author regard iff unsuitable formal writing others use freely
In logical symbol used instead phrase see discussion notation
The follows Note equivalent produced opposite produced
The corresponding logical symbol sometimes iff
These usually treated equivalent
However text particularly rather make distinction first used symbol logic formula used reasoning logic formula
In notation prefix symbol
Another term
In one statement form P iff Q proving P Q Q P
Proving pair statement sometimes lead natural proof since obvious condition one would infer biconditional directly
An alternative prove P Q inferred directly either iff P iff Q follows P Q shown true false
Usage abbreviation iff first appeared print book Its invention often credited wrote I invented I could never believe I really first inventor
It somewhat unclear iff meant pronounced
In current practice single iff almost always read four word
However preface Kelley suggests read differently In case mathematical content requires demand something le I use Halmos
The author one discrete mathematics textbook suggest Should need pronounce iff really people hear difference implying iff could pronounced
Sufficiency converse necessity
That say given
would sufficient condition would necessary condition
Also given true negation operator

This mean relationship established expressed following equivalent way As example take state fruit question apple Madison eat fruit question
The following four equivalent way expressing relationship So see restated form If Madison eat fruit question apple taking conjunction find stated If fruit question apple Madison eat Madison eat fruit apple
A proper subset B
A number A B number B A
C subset proper subset B
A number B C number C show logical relationship among event property forth
P Q P Q mean P either proper improper Q
P Q Q P mean Q proper improper subset P Q Q P mean set P Q identical
Iff used outside field logic wherever logic applied especially discussion
It meaning abbreviation indicating one statement
This example
However noted rather often used statement definition
The element element used mean

I statement I trying prove I close I think I missing couple key concept regular language
Let A ww w
Show language L L reducible A
Where I far Language A complement A
Both A complement A decidable
So mean I prove one direction statement fairly easily If L reducible A since A decidable statement also L decidable
The direction giving problem
This I gleaned far If L L regular language
Is relation regular language respect reduction I missing
Or I making different logic jump part proof
There general theorem say A decidable language B decidable language trivial sense B
Roughly speaking say decidable language reducible meaning coarse metric distinguish decidable languges
In problem suppose define mapping f defined f x case aa L L case
This total computable function since definition use computable decider program determine x membership easy verify L iff f x A need show A
As Yuval noted need result regular language answer question
First every decidable language regular
For example A decidable regular
Here hint question anything either regular language language
While certainly need A decidable direction need really simple property A
Try think A true L decidable L reduced A

I read question
I stuck difference
Please help
Thanks Let assume A B two statement
Then say A B mean A ever true B true
That B necessary A true
To say A B mean A true B true B true A true
That A necessary sufficient Succinctly A B logic statement A B
A iff B statement A B B A I find million dollar inside locker I know combination
But mean I find million dollar I know combination
After might half million
If A B true unless A true B false written A B
A B true unless A true B false equivalent A B
A B true unless A false B true converse written B A A iff B also written A B true A B truth value
It represents A B A B written A B A real number positive greater zero
A real number rational finite decimal expansion
A real number general however need rational
A B saying B necessary A saying A could happened without B mean thing also need happen A true
Therefore A B true B A B true guarantee A happened
There could also requirement A true
ex You eligible president least year old
let p You eligible president You least year old Here case p case p In word necessary p true mean one single requirement As far difference go I guess specific question mean
p q mean p q AND p p q equates q p q p I hopefully well explained p q equates p q q p p q saying p q So
One statement unidirectional bidirectional
A iff B statement B A B A B A notB notA B A A B How I understood
In case sentence give u information name rectangle fulfilling condition
It say rectangle square
There may many rectangle equal side square well example definition square could square rectangle equal side circle radius larger cm
So sentence I know name particular rectangle I know square general I know one case
using
In sentence know necessary square rectangle equal side
However say rectangle equal side square
The might rectangle equal side could name circle
So I know one case
mean rectangle equal side called square also square rectangle equal side
There condition
No figure square rectangle equal side nothing square
If I say object apple fruit Fruit Apple mean something fruit order apple apple
If something fruit also orange banana
However said object apple fruit Fruit Apple would mean something fruit order apple main difference would also apple orange banana
If fruit apple apple fruit
In second example also added Fruit Apple mean something fruit apple
Another way writing A B A B B
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

In computer organization class I given series problem
One I stuck currently Assume X consists bit Y consists bit
Write logic function true X Y X Y thought unsigned binary number
b X Y X Y thought signed complement number
c X Y
Use hierarchical approach extended larger number bit
Show extend comparison X Y number implement three comparison
For I understand make case true
I even aware simple method writing truth table listing logic function make case true however approach would make table row tall
I stuck bit write logic
The real confusion actually come TA class
He gave example using number
I believe using case X Y still
His solution XOR XOR Is full answer case number part
I understand solution I feel
For example XOR check significant bit equal give reason move onto next portion function mean x smaller function need become true I see possible outcome example solution
I heard back professor TA yet anyone posted solution yet I thinking long hard
It bit rush TA went solution maybe I wrote partial solution
So going idea I came If see anything wrong solution let know

Sometimes I read sentence At first I thought mispelling I realized I encounter many different post

using google help lot sometimes
As Zhen Lin already mentioned iff shorthand
Also french literature one find ssi mean si et seulement si
Using example statement
This way combining form statement converse vice versa statement true statement statement Combining give statement

Partial order theory widely employed computer science particularly logic formal method programming language static analysis
But partial order theory intertwined field like topology zoo definition concept attached area
Not commonly used computer science
In article I summarized fragment partial order theory commonly used computer science particular home fragment static analysis
Topics covered include preorders equivalence relation total order partial order semilattices lattice bounded lattice complete lattice monotonicity fixed point Kleene fixed point theorem
At end find natural liftings partial order lattice across power set Cartesian product sequence function space
Where applicable formal definition transliterated Haskell
If interested partial order theory static analysis check appendix It comprehensive
The header Haskell code file And ghc extension used A binary relation set X iff relation reflexive transitive
A binary relation R x R x x
A binary relation R R b b R c implies R c
An preorder also symmetric
A binary relation R R b implies b R
An equivalence relation divide set S equivalence class
The element x x The set equivalence class X relation set
Every preorder induces natural equivalence relation A preorder antisymmetric
A set X equipped partial order often described pair X
A binary relation R R b b R implies b
In Haskell define partial order type class A binary relation total transitive antisymmetric
A binary relation R two value b R b b R
Totality implies reflexivity mean every total order also partial order
A poset two element b greatest lower bound denoted b
The greatest lower bound b largest element still le
In lattice greatest lower bound must unique
The greatest lower bound b also called b
The following property A poset two element b least upper bound denoted b
The least upper bound b smallest element still greater
In lattice least upper bound must unique
The least upper bound b also called b
The following property If poset meet semilattice join semilattice poset also
In Haskell lattice partial order meet join defined A lattice L exists maximum element top minimum element bottom set L
For element x lattice must case In Haskell type class bounded lattice defines top bottom A lattice L every possibly infinite subset S L least upper bound sup S greatest lower bound inf S
Every complete lattice L bounded lattice Given posets X Y function f X Y x x implies f x f x
To define continuous function first need define function application across set
Given function f X Y S X f x x S
Alternately f f
In text function application notationally distinguished ordinary function application
Given lattice X Y function f X Y S X implies f sup S sup
function also monotonic
Given function f X X x f x f x
With respect monotonic function f X X complete lattice X divide set X region It useful distinguish least greatest fixed point The following property hold region I recommend proving property short exercise
Given monotonic function f L L lattice L starting point x L set K x The notation mean iterated function composition If x Asc f ascending order chain K x since x x x Asc f
In Haskell infinite list represents Kleene chain starting bottom On lattice Kleene fixed point theorem say Moreover lattice finite height exists natural n lfp f
This fact lead simple algorithm computing fixed point
The function look first element sequence repeat neighbor So least fixed point function look stable point Kleene sequence There several natural liftings posets lattice across foundational discrete data structure flat set power set Cartesian product sum sequence function
Given set S pointed poset contains bottom And pointed poset contains top If S poset order extended pointing lattice In Haskell Given set S lift S L x iff In Haskell Given collection posets naturally lift partial order poset If posets lattice resulting poset lattice default
To make lattice must pointed
Given lattice natural Cartesian product lattice In Haskell Given poset L natural sequence poset As sum sequence must pointed become lattice
That sequence greater lesser sequence sequence different length always incomparable
In Haskell Given set S subset S form lattice inclusion P S
Given partial order X define preordered set P X Why partial order
Consider set natural number natural total order
Under regime yet violates antisymmetry
Of course possible lift preorder partial order equivalence class
Alternatively set canonicalized equivalence class represented single distinguished member
If preorder also partial order possible lift partial order equivalence class preorder
Given preordered set X natural partial order equivalence class poset b iff b b Given lattice Y set X natural lattice lattice X Y In Haskell This post scratch surface order theory leaf even application computer science
The two biggest omission reserved future post ordinal Scott domain theory
The ordinal extend natural number transfinite arithmetic provide powerful structure
That structure powerful mechanism reasoning program termination
Scott domain theory give meaningful interpretation infinitely recursive domain equation arise denotational semantics
If like learn Haskell I recommend And using Haskell I recommend

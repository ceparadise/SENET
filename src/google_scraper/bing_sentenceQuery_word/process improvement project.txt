A process series step decision involved way work completed
We may realize process everywhere every aspect leisure work
A example process might include A lot
Let give example overused standard process definition describe process fails project
At ESPN basic process submitting background check new hire
The process described The process seems straightforward little room error
However hiding underneath basic definition key piece information illuminate problem process improvement solution
Timing interdependency key understanding real process behavior
In background check process described submitter submitted background check Tuesday PM
That mean pending background check could sit queue day submitted
Three similar delay background check process could add unnecessary day delay
yet remains unseen basic definition describe
The basic definition process include framework describe process occurs
Normally pun intended average used describe processing time activity study
Averages work well describe business process containing variability time process direction utilizing people without interruption
In word
Why average mask process behavior
It would like trying explain dynamic family single photograph
You get information picture clue happened immediately click shutter
Variable time cause loss throughput system balanced precisely
That mean perspective entity waiting occur various point process
Sometimes waiting processing
Benjamin Franklin stated principle concisely said Lost time never found If variability time direction ignored real capability system hidden
Understanding effect variability background check process mentioned gave rise new solution mitigated extreme variability
seeing effect
Without framework capturing using information ignored almost everyone
The framework open eye process improvement expert make effective decision
If word describe something see
If see manage A process consists four major element The expanded definition process describes behavior current system
Using information linked model characteristic system changed key metric investing dime
Would like see element expanded process definition tied together model
Hello I disagree article
I think confusion process procedure method used execute process
A process describes input output expected deliverable end transformation
The procedure describes use entry order produce expected outcome
The timing problem mentioned solved good description procedure
Ernesto thank comment
You correct flowchart describes input output expected deliverable
A process model provides added information may yet acquainted
A process model add dimension time process
The dimension time allows understanding thing happen
A working process model open new level understanding process currently operates may operate change
Once operation process understood great procedure written
To help see may missing I would love provide personal demonstration process model using ProcessModel
Let know interested
I must agree Jose Massaro
All four element characteristic system must changed key metric tested investing project
A new definition What Process
I agree four element
Steps decision Variability processing time flow Timing interdependence Assignment resource

Even best intention even sought business process improvement project fail
Here five reason happens advice CIOs want avoid failure
By Many CIOs found looking opportunity elevate department business enabler business multiplier status right privilege therein
These right privilege often include increased respect business partner even IT budget fully escape axe better understanding potential impact cut
Many effort take form business process improvement initiative designed improve efficiency existing work could mean work take either le time le money
In many organization CIOs IT department well positioned take lead effort
Unfortunately even best intention even sought business process improvement project fail
Here I outline five reason effort often fail provide advice CIOs want avoid failure see project succeed
Regardless organizational size attempting initiate significant process improvement effort without clear direct publicized support top likely result either total failure initiative eventual outcome everything could
Lack support top perceived staff initiative important deserving full time effort required ensure success
Business process improvement project difficult reinforcement top effort necessary appreciated critical team success
Mitigation Get clear public support overall initiative starting work
Get support word
Ensure leadership team truly ready wo simply back going get tough
I organization culture made process improvement effort extremely difficult
In short pretty much task individual employee empowered simply opt refuse take part
Given process improvement effort potential sometimes uncover individual weakness group challenge surprise may angst improvement effort undertaken
In one organization I stunned discover kind item people could simply refuse seemingly without repercussion
In environment process improvement effort extraordinarily challenging required much dedication time project leadership team I seen effort
In another example substantial process improvement effort VP promised access certain member team period month verbal promise significant objective would put people effort complete
As may guessed promise hold team pulled many different direction resulting failure since one would budge due date initiative
Mitigation In environment take slow measured approach initiative make certain leadership squarely board proceeding
Ensure importance project trickle throughout organization
Consider tying award kind compensation outcome ensure reasonable participation
Further get commitment writing along fallback date automatic certain condition team member fall ill promise kept
In case organizational culture blame failure effort shortcoming member team
However organization sound may team member either hostile le engaged overall effort
Because team theoretically comprised stake process discussed everyone need fully involved order get best result
Mitigation Find behind hostility
If organization start process improvement effort hope people downsized result expect lot cooperation individual whose job may stake
Further decided undertake BPI project correct personnel situation rather dealing personnel situation directly expect failure
If want see failure truly look like attempt reengineer process without ensuring stake process represented effort
Perhaps important task selecting team work project
All stakeholder start finish need represented
Even person small part large process insight experience individual part process must understood order improve
Mitigation Easy
Be inclusive even inclusive fault
Although CIOs may well suited lead process improvement effort outcome may technology
Bear mind IT play role company process effort IT
What important leveraging technology asset way optimize company effort
If process discussion slanted point look like IT taking process end one two scenario Failure IT saddled responsibility everything happens organization
Neither desirable
Mitigation CIOs need wear business hat leading process improvement effort

Health Catalyst stand highest overall score healthcare BI market Posted
Few people influence science practical application process management
His impact automotive industry legendary many industry tried varying degree success implement principle well
For year I followed admired tried bring quality improvement process healthcare
I strongly believe healthcare much gain successfully implementing key Deming principle
Let share five principle I believe make biggest difference
When Deming others developed approach modern quality improvement basically developing way modern organization deal complex challenge confronting
The approach developed improvement remarkably simple yet extraordinarily powerful
It centered fact quality improvement really process management
These quality improvement concept technique used transform almost every major industry world dramatic result
The last holdout last passion resistance primarily healthcare higher education government
Now happening healthcare
I believe higher education imminent anyone guess whether government ever succumb force
Now know healthcare complex fundamentally different industry
Healthcare simply consists thousand interlinked process result complex system
If focus process care one time fundamentally change game deal challenge facing healthcare
Now may seem like tall order tell u probably percent process get u percent impact
So challenge every organization identify percent roll sleeve begin important work addressing challenge
Deming clearly understood importance data
Meaningful
This particularly true quality control healthcare
You basically dead water try work healthcare provider good data
I think everybody recognizes
Deming said In God others must bring I love quote reflects reality
I physician career tell pretty much thing quite polite
They basically say Dr
Haughom John get lost
Bring data
And decide believe So data critical going meaningful impact healthcare
An important application clarification Deming principle put forward good friend
Managing care mean managing process care
It mean managing physician nurse
What James said true
One big mistake made managed care movement naively thinking managing care meant telling physician nurse
The reality need process understand care delivery process best equipped figure improve process care time
And reason I strongly believe change fact ultimately empowering clinician try get involved
If clinician going manage care need data
They need right data delivered right format right time right place
And data must delivered right clinician involved operating improving given process care
If quality improvement going work going realize mean must engage clinician
To use Deming term clinician healthcare smart They frontline worker understand process care
And I said earlier slide fortunate healthcare workforce dominated clinician extraordinarily committed intelligent highly educated
But live pristine time
I received email fellow physician leader leading national delivery system
I going withhold name delivery system I tell ask knowledgeable people list top delivery system country almost everyone would put organization list
Despite physician wrote lamenting difficult get peer physician see new future
And email succinctly described problem saying physician historically encumbered And I love succinctness description basically saying clinging past demoralized see new future
And short phrase excellent physician leader pretty much encapsulated problem point u towards solution
A clearly demonstrates majority physician fact willing change
McKinsey US physician found percent said willing change reasonable course argument could made change necessary
So reconcile
I believe need help clinician figure give past helping see new future help understand role creating sustaining new future
In fact I believe one make strong case future empowering clinician type successfully inform engage inspire
Applying key Deming principle healthcare process improvement help every healthcare organization show workforce change necessary need understand participate meaningful change success ultimately look like

Contents The developed scratch solve difficult social problem especially problem
The provides problem solver fill blank framework make work much focused efficient
The process summarized diagram SIP incorporates
Each subproblem analyzed using Social Force Diagram plus feedback loop simulation model necessary
solving problem area unfamiliar
How separate wheat chaff
How find apply
If ca determine matter study ca solve problem
SIP guiding framework
It asks three strategic question
What critical
What subproblem

What resolving root cause
Everything else follows question
Each find matter question build question
When answered three question done analysis
You found matter
After converging solution push high leverage point relatively easy
Next give brief introduction SIP
For full description process example applied collection sample solution element produced process see
The top framework matrix look like First one big problem defined Problem Definition
Then one big problem decomposed three subproblems present difficult social problem Presently human system strongly resisting changing unsustainable sustainable behavior
Presently human system improperly coupled environment
The feedback loop necessary sustainable environmental impact simply
The model government use run incapable solving sustainability problem
It drifted far needed broken
trying simultaneously solve three subproblems time without realizing
That one reason environmental movement unable solve sustainability problem
Environmentalists blind need treat How overcome change resistance separate problem solve first
Once change resistance overcome system want sustainable
It eagerly adopt proper coupling solution like carbon tax strict pollution law sustainable product life cycle design
Each subproblem go step analysis solution convergence implementation shown
Lets compare four main step SIP four main step problem solving process used environmentalist today
Identify problem
Find proper practice
Tell people truth
If fails inspire exhort bargain
Problem Definition
Solution Convergence
Implementation In step Classic Activism practice required live sustainably like renewable energy le pollution supporting Kyoto Protocol climate change
Not Classic Activism fail use proper decomposition
This huge flaw second reason world unable solve sustainability problem
Without deep analysis possibly solve difficult problem
The heart analysis step SIP
This powerful tool allows u implement Our Fundamental Principle The way solve difficult problem resolve root cause
In order necessary add These listed
Note substeps use modeling find root cause high leverage point resolving root cause
The analysis step difficult crucial spend time
If root cause high leverage point reasonably correct step relatively easy
But analysis wrong amount brilliant hard work step solve problem

Find immediate cause subproblem symptom term system dominant

Find intermediate cause low leverage point superficial symptomatic solution

Find intermediate cause

Find dominant resolve root cause

Find make loop go dominant
Once grasp SIP work see contains minimum step required solve problem
All three subproblems required
Root cause must found subproblem
So must high leverage point
Then analysis complete solution convergence implementation step follow
This raise question many step SIP environmental movement performed
The answer shown As SIP see problem solver completed step
Both admirably done
But super sleuth world since
Where result rest process one something like
I searched year nowhere found
Instead find artifact Classic Activism like done please let
Still Jay Forrester Club Rome Dennis Donella Meadows Jorgen Randers rest person Limits Growth team pulled precocious miracle
They spotted problem noticed wrestled form allowed complete first two step
Over seven year period developed SIP applied sustainability problem
The result shown For discussion table please see
For detailed description SIP please see
For full description see chapter
We describing SIP work
After try one recent paper one
Every difficult problem requires type process solve
If solve problem problem solving process valuable asset
It even important people without stellar process even stellar people solve truly difficult problem
This fact escaped attention science business
Here prominent process depend five step process form foundation science
natural process identified Charles Darwin
For see
process tracking understanding flow money business
Without business would unable calculate profitability decision
Profits could calculated mean dividend could paid
complex process determining makeup molecule DNA
This process become core genetic engineering offer map want go
quality improvement process
According General Electric one successful company implementing Six Sigma estimated benefit order billion first five year implementation
first perfected Henry Ford production Model T automobile
The new process allowed production world first affordable car one could widely purchased middle class
Are concerned rise populust authoritarian like
Have noticed democracy unable solve important problem like war poverty
If film series
One intermediate cause weakened
Powerful root cause force working weaken loop
These average minute
They give quick introduction Dueling Loops model explains tremendous change resistance solving sustainability problem
The article site since written December
More people contacted u easy read paper related Dueling Loops video anything else site
Do every wonder sustainability problem impossibly hard solve
It phenomenon change resistance
Why root cause several potential solution presented
The astonishing short read page site never heard
The memo written breaking problem smaller easier solve problem
Exactly done determines strength analysis
You see powerful technique used analysis missing mainstream environmentalism tried
This explains different outcome expected
The key technique
The analysis performed seven year period
The result summarized top shown Click table full table high level discussion analysis result
Popular approach solving sustainability problem see obvious black arrow
This lead using push resolve
Popular solution superficial fail see fundamental layer complete causal chain run
intuitively seems popular solution like renewable energy strong regulation solve sustainability problem
But ca resolve root cause
In analytical approach penetrates fundamental layer find well hidden Further analysis find developed create solves problem
For see glossary
First analysis divided sustainability problem Then subproblem individually analyzed
For overview see
This different ancient Romans
Subproblems like several order magnitude easier solve longer trying vain solve simultaneously without realizing
This strategy changed million problem insolvable solvable work
For example u impossible
But paper decomposing problem nine case time adding result change problem insolvable solvable
tendency system resist change even surprisingly large amount force applied
system resisting change none subproblems solvable
Therefore subproblem must solved first
Until solved effort solve three subproblems largely wasted effort
The successful change resistance appears Too many voter politician deceived thinking sustainability low priority need solved
The resolving root cause We need inoculate people deceptive false meme people infected falsehood hard change mind see truth
occurs two social life form working together harmony
In sustainability problem cooperating smoothly people
Instead many corporation dominating political decision making advantage shown strenuous opposition solving environmental sustainability problem
The appears The goal corporate life form maximization profit goal human life form optimization quality life living descendent
These two goal achieved system
One side win side lose
Guess side losing
The resolving root cause follows easily
If root cause corporation wrong goal high leverage point occurs problem evolves solution model keep
The model away needed keep problem solved
The solution model solving important problem like sustainability recurring war recurring recession excessive economic inequality institutional poverty drifted far unable solve problem
The appears Various step decision making process working properly resulting inability proactively solve many difficult problem
This indicates low decision making process maturity
The resolving root cause In subproblem economic system improperly coupled environment
Environmental impact economic system growth exceeded capacity environment recycle impact
This subproblem world see The analysis show false assumption however
The change resistance subproblem must solved first
The appears like air breath
This mean presently way manage common property efficiently enough sustainably
The resolving root cause order radically lower transaction cost
There must reason popular solution working
Given principle reason popular solution working year million people trying This fundamental insight
Using result analysis input Each resolve specific root cause thus solves one four subproblems shown Click table high level discussion solution element The solution see differ radically popular solution The right subproblems found earlier analysis step decomposed one big Gordian Knot problem
Everything change root cause resolution approach
Once analysis build model problem find root cause high leverage point solution developed push leverage point
Because solution aimed resolving specific known root cause ca miss
It like shooting target ten foot away
The bullseye root cause
That Root Cause Analysis fantastically powerful
Nine Sample Solution Elements The high leverage point overcoming change resistance We somehow fooled easily deceptive politician
This easy
Overcoming change resistance crux problem take nine solution element solve subproblem
The first key
In subproblem analysis found two social life form large corporation people conflicting goal
The high leverage point Since one causing problem right mean reengineer modern corporation right goal
Corporations never designed comprehensive manner serve people
They evolved
What today called It serf
What need instead This life form designed serve people rather
Its new role trusted servant whose goal providing good service needed optimize quality life people sustainable manner
Solution element drifted far decision making model government use decide
incapable solving sustainability problem
The high leverage point Like Corporation process never designed
It evolved
thus quite want
The solution work like Imagine would like politician rated quality decision
They would start competing see could improve quality life common good
That would lead pleasant world ever seen
Solution element Presently economic system improperly coupled environment
The high leverage point radically reduce cost managing sustainability problem
This done Each steward would goal sustainably managing portion sustainability problem
Like way corporation charge good service steward would charge ecosystem service use
The income go solving problem
Corporations gave u Industrial Revolution
That revolution incomplete steward give u Solution element This summarizes past ten year research
Twelve sample solution element analysis behind presented

This establishes process begin end well process input output
Additionally must accountability process process owner assigned responsible overseeing process improvement measure
Boundaries important ensure work done improve process fall within boundary outside process would result extraneous work impact process
The CAX Cable Project consists two process comprise overall manufacturing process cable stranding cable jacketing
Cable stranding consists stranding internal metallic cable element protective Kevlar fiber order improve cable tensile strength
Cable jacketing consists jacketing stranded core extruded polyethylene cover order protect internal cable structure environmental effect ensure transmission data signal
As part process improvement plan stranding jacketing process boundary established Stranding Jacketing Process configuration illustrated graphical depiction project process
By presenting process configuration manner project team ability visualize process helpful facilitating analysis identifying area process weak determining way process may improved throughout project
It important note like project documentation change made process configuration must updated
BTS Tech modeled initial CAX Cable manufacturing process existing process currently use cable product family
The process improvement plan project provides BTS Tech opportunity analyze improve cable manufacturing process CAX Cable ultimately may result process improvement BTS Tech cable product
The project team utilize stranding jacketing process configuration conjunction process metric conduct process analysis determine potential area improvement implement improvement measure
To team follow process planned initial cable run order verify process boundary gather metric
As team identifies potential process area improvement adjustment made modified process run validate process gather additional metric comparison
Stranding Process Configuration Jacketing Process Configuration Metrics extremely important part process improvement project quality
A metric measure measure allow project team ass various performance parameter given process
These measure allow team continuously monitor measure track process performance order determine efficiency effectiveness process
The team must ensure metric based project customer requirement ensure project quality
The metric must also based comprises acceptable measurement well control limit within acceptable measurement may fall
Process metric control limit used conjunction process configuration guide process improvement effort CAX Cable project
Since stranding jacketing process CAX Cable based process cable family metric acceptable value control limit known
However part CAX Cable process improvement plan project team iteratively analyze process configuration metric measured value order implement cycle continuous improvement
The existing metric value control limit based customer requirement cost performance
Stranding Jacketing Measurements metric taken every iteration stranding jacketing trial CAX Cable
These measurement plotted control chart order ensure process parameter fall within acceptable range
As process validated new product value normalize project team use metric process configuration determine area within process improvement made
As adjustment process made team continue track metric order validate improvement process update change project documentation
In order effectively improve process project team need thorough understanding process currently well want end project
While process may fall within acceptable control limit building quality management project plan requires continuous improvement throughout project duration
To drive cycle continuous improvement project team need establish target specific metric
These target specific measurable achievable
The CAX Cable project team developed target improved performance metric stranding jacketing process
These metric based existing BTS Tech metric cable product family
However project provides opportunity improve process may potentially result significant saving cost time CAX Cable well BTS Tech cable product
The chart provide CAX Cable stranding jacketing process metric current value target value
Stranding Jacketing Based current capacity BTS Tech cable product targeted stranding jacketing waste reduction result material saving annually
The stranding jacketing process time target allow operation group increase throughput achieve significant increase scheduling flexibility allow BTS Tech better meet customer requirement

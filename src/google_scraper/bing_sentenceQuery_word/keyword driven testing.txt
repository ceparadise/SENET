testing type functional automation testing framework also known testing action word based testing
In testing use table format usually spreadsheet define keywords action word function would like execute
It best suited novice tester
Enables writing test abstract manner using approach
Keyword driven testing allows automation started earlier SDLC even stable build delivered testing
There high degree reusability
Initial investment developing keywords related functionality might take longer
It might act restriction technically abled tester

Test Automation Frameworks available

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I problem fully understanding purpose keyword driven framework compared framework
What circumstance would make framework appropriate automated test suite framework
Difference It nothing data driven test performing functionality multiple input value using parametarization help data table data source called Data Driven Test
While automating testing application time may required test functionality multiple time different set input data
Thus case let test data embedded test script
Hence advised retain test data external data base outside test script
Data Driven Testing Framework help user segregate test script logic test data
It let user store test data external database
The external database etc
The data conventionally stored pair
Thus key used access populate data within test script
Ex Let u consider Functionality
First foremost step create external file store test data
Let u consider excel sheet instance
The Keyword driven testing framework extension Data driven Testing Framework sense segregate test data script also keep certain set code belonging test script external data file
These set code known Keywords hence framework named
Key word action need performed application
The keywords test data stored tabular like structure thus also popularly regarded Table driven Framework
Take notice keywords test data entity independent automation tool used
Ex For example keywords like defined within code
I think Shailendra hit nail head
The main goal keyword driven test greater test coverage reuse maintanability defining functionality step
And main goal data driven test greater test coverage multiplying scenario
It really depends feature structured scenario much different data scenario different combination repeatable step
The two mutually exclusive practice framework tend focus one extreme
testing technique separate much programming work actual test step test step developed earlier often maintained minor update even application testing need change significantly
The testing methodology divide test creation two stage Planning Stage Implementation Stage Driven testing framework test input output value read data file datapools ODBC source csv file Excel file DAO object ADO object loaded variable captured manually coded script
In framework variable used input value output verification value
Navigation program reading data file logging test status information coded test script
The keyword driven automation framework initially hardest data driven approach implement
After trying fully insulate test many failing automation tool well change application
To accomplish essentially writing enhancement many component function already provided automation tool error correction prevention enhanced synchronization
Fortunately heavy initial investment mostly deal
Once place keyword driven automation arguably easiest data driven framework maintain perpetuate providing greatest potential success

There different model software development
Testing major phase developing software
It important use test plan carry different type test
Programming part development process
If making program testing really regular activity within development cycle
If leave testing end lot code difficult work find problem
You always plan test early often
method developing computer program involves continually repeating process build test change build test change etc
The programmer start building something work make minimum amount change required make pas test
Then piece code rewritten meet acceptable standard
Refactoring section code may include Refactoring code two main advantage Commenting used explain function different section code
This make easier read
This section code comment added make readable If programmer leave helpful comment code make easier others understand purpose section code performs

Multiple release limited resource time pressure team mixed skillsets
And task create flexible maintainable automated test every team member understand work
The solution get test automation tool support testing
The testing approach separate test automation implementation test case design
A keyword defined action test case
Once keyword set need programming knowledge easily design maintain automated test
There two way creating test Ranorex You use recording code module Ranorex Studio basis testing
Simply split automation module give clearly understandable name
For example define set action start system test module name StartSUT
You find detailed information
These module function keywords
Once keywords defined drag drop keywords needed test directly module browser test suite
Start creating keywords directly Ranorex test suite module library
You use keywords multiple Ranorex project referencing back library
You two different way This approach completely separate keyword implementation test case design keyword usage
If want learn organizing test automation project please read blog post
You make test even flexible using variable
Variables enable automatically retrieve external data saved Excel CVS sheet test password login action
You find detailed information implement type testing user guide section
We bet familiar good old
So use something already know well automated test
When using action table Ranorex Recorder create test workspace
Technically experienced team member provide keywords user code collection
You find detailed information create user code collection user guide section
All keywords defined user code collection within test automation solution available user code library displayed alphabetical order
Simply click Add New Action menu select method library
Once defined test workflow set argument
You also use testing within recording module simply making keyword parameter variable explained user guide section
If using Ranorex version Ranorex still want use action table approach use little trick Inheritance
The keywords provided code module
You find detailed information
A recording module inherited code module automatically derives functionality parent module
This also true parameter read topic user guide section
This achieved inheritance recording module file Now simply add user code action action table Add New Action User Code choose predefined keyword
Once defined set argument
You also use testing within recording module simply making keyword parameter variable explained user guide section
test automation fantastic way create flexible test case
It enables team different technical background work test automation project together keeping test clearly structured easily maintainable

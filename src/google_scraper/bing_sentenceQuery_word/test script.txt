A set instruction performed test system function expected
There various mean executing test script
These last two type also done manual testing
advantageous number reason test may executed continuously without need human intervention easily repeatable often faster
Automated test useful situation test executed several time example part
Automated test disadvantageous poorly written leading incorrect testing broken test carried
Disadvantages automated testing automated test like piece software poorly written simply break playback
They also examine programmed examine
Since system designed human interaction mind good practice human test system point
A trained manual tester notice system test misbehaving without prompted directed automated test examine programmed examine
When used regression testing manual tester find new bug ensuring old bug reappear automated test ensure latter
Mixed testing automated manual testing often used automating need tested often easily checked machine using manual testing
One consider automating given test script
cost build maintain script cost le would take simply execute manually
Where cost measured term time money also opportunity cost freeing people work

This document defines Testing achieve testing objective
The Test Strategy normally derived Business Requirement Specification document
Some company include inside Test Plan fine usually case small project
However larger project one Test Strategy document different number Test Plans phase level testing
Components Test Strategy document Scope Objectives Business issue Roles responsibility Communication status reporting Test deliverability Industry standard follow Test automation tool Testing measurement metrices Risks mitigation Defect reporting tracking Change configuration management Training plan A scenario story describes hypothetical situation
In testing check program cope hypothetical situation
The ideal scenario test credible motivating easy evaluate complex
Scenarios usually different test case test case single step scenario cover number step
Test suite scenario used concert complete system test
A Scenario functionality tested
It also called Test Condition Test Possibility
In software engineering test case set condition variable tester determine requirement upon application partially fully satisfied
It may take many test case determine requirement fully satisfied
In order fully test requirement application met must least one test case requirement unless requirement sub requirement
In situation sub requirement must least one test case
A test case also defined sequence step test correct behavior application
A sequence step consisting action performed system test
These step sometimes called test procedure test script
These action often associated set data preloaded input test
The combination action taken data provided system test lead test condition
This condition tends produce result test compare expected result ass quality given test condition
The action performed serially parallel combination consecution
Test Script set instruction written using language performed system test verify system performs expected
Test script used automated testing
Sometimes set instruction written human language used manual testing also called Test Script better term would Test Case
Test Scenario mean What tested test case mean How tested
Test case It consist test case name Precondition step input condition expected result
Test Scenario Test scenario consists detailed test procedure
We also say test scenario many test case associated
Before executing test scenario need think test case scenario
Test Script A Test Script set instruction written using programming language performed system test verify system performs expected
Test script term used referring automated testing
When creating test script using automation tool create script
outline testing approach everything else surround
It different test plan sense Test strategy sub set test plan
It hard core test document extent generic static
There also argument level test strategy plan I really see discerning difference
Example Test plan give information going test time
For example Module going tested
If tester Y replaces X reason test plan updated
On contrary test strategy going detail like module tested test team member
In case matter testing generic change team member updated keeping static
This one line pointer tester create initial transitional step test design phase

A support program written special task could alternatively executed human operator
Scripting language often interpreted rather
Primitives usually elementary task call language allows combined complex program
Environments automated scripting include within usage OS well numerous game
A scripting language viewed particular environment case scripting application also known
Scripting language also sometimes referred operate high level abstraction particularly job control language mainframe
The term scripting language also used loosely refer term script often used small program thousand line code language language language
Some language originally developed use within particular environment later developed portable language
Conversely many language dialect used scripting language
This article discus scripting language narrow sense language specific environment
The spectrum scripting language range small highly used scripting
Standard example scripting language specific environment include web browser application
language designed widely used extension language
language also commonly used extension language ECMAScript still primarily scripting language web browser also used language
The dialect editor Visual Basic Applications dialect example scripting language dialect language
Some game system notably franchise Railroad simulator extensively extended functionality scripting extension
In game like variety actual game played player script written user
Typically scripting language intended fast learn write either short source code file interactively REPL language shell
This generally implies relatively simple typically script code written scripting language executed start finish script explicit
For example uncommon characterise scripting language lengthy syntax rule class exist file directly possible execute Java interactively source file contain definition must invoked externally
This piece code intended print Hello World nothing class
In contrast allows definition function single file avoid function altogether use style even use interactively
This one line python code print Hello World statement like required
A scripting language usually source code
By contrast software environment script written typically written distributed form
Scripting language may designed use end user may internal use developer write portion program scripting language
Scripting language typically use form spare user detail internal variable type data storage
Scripts often created modified person executing also often distributed large portion game written scripting language
Early instead using
IBM JCL archetype language used control batch processing
The first interactive developed enable remote operation first system used controlled running computer program within computer program shell
language generally credited inventing ability embed command script interpreted insert character string script
call
wrote early processor command script called RUNCOM around MIT wrote scripting language IBM
He originally called processor COMMAND later named
Multics included offshoot CTSS RUNCOM also called RUNCOM
eventually replaced
Languages specifically designed scripting language could embedded application
Other language VBA provided strong integration automation facility underlying system
Embedding scripting language instead developing new language application also obvious benefit relieving application developer need code language translator scratch allowing user apply skill learned elsewhere
Some software incorporates several different scripting language
Modern typically provide language writing extension browser several standard embedded language controlling browser including dialect
Scripting often contrasted
In view scripting particularly connecting language specialized purpose
Pipelines shell scripting archetypal example glue language initially developed fill role
considered use glue language interfacing
But substantial amount logic written script better characterized simply another software component glue
Glue language especially useful writing maintaining Glue language example language exposed operating system application component serve glue language
These include Hummingbird Basic QuickScript
Other tool like also considered glue language language implemented engine VBScript JScript VBA default Windows engine including implementation Rexx Perl Tcl Python XSLT Ruby Modern Pascal Delphi C
A majority application access use operating system component via function
Other device like programmable calculator may also glue language operating system PDAs Windows CE may available native macro tool glue application together addition implementation common glue Windows NT Unix shell Rexx Modern Pascal PHP Perl
Depending upon OS version WSH default script engine VBScript JScript available
Programmable calculator programmed glue language three way
For example factory default programmed command script language
Inclusion scripting glue language series calculator could seen successor
The primary programming language graphing calculator often Basic variant sometimes Lisp derivative uncommonly C derivative many case glue together calculator graph list matrix etc
implementation comprehensive Basic version may closer variant listed glue language article attempt implement Perl Rexx various operating system shell TI HP graphing calculator also mentioned
C TI HP machine used conjunction tool convert C Perl Rexx AWK well shell script Perl Modern Pascal VBScript Perl make possible write program glue language eventual implementation compiled program calculator
A major class scripting language grown automation relates starting controlling behavior system program
In sense one might think shell descendant IBM JCL used exactly purpose
Many language interpreter double
Others offer use command build script
With advent graphical user interface specialized kind scripting language emerged controlling computer
These language interact graphic window menu button human user would
They simulating action user
These language typically used automate user action
Such language also called control simulated key press mouse click well tapping pressing screen
These language could principle used control GUI application practice use limited use need support application
There exception limitation
Some GUI scripting language based recognizing graphical object display screen
These GUI scripting language depend support operating system application
Application specific language split many different category
standalone based app language executable internal application specific language postscript xml gscript widely distributed script respectively implemented Adobe MS Google among others include idiomatic scripting language tailored need application user
Likewise many system use custom scripting language express programmed action game environment
Languages sort designed single application may superficially resemble specific language
modeled C custom feature distinguish
fully formed capable dialect contains many special feature make useful extending editing function Emacs
An scripting language viewed specialized single application
A number language designed purpose replacing scripting language embeddable application program
The application programmer working C another system language includes hook scripting language control application
These language may technically equivalent extension language application embeds common language user get advantage able transfer skill application application
A generic alternative simply provide library often C library language use control application without modifying language specific domain
JavaScript began primarily still language scripting inside however standardization language made popular embeddable language
In particular implementation embedded several environment
Other application embedding ECMAScript implementation include product scripting file
created extension language come used frequently language role similar
On hand originally created job control language widely used extension language well language
Perl language Oraperl dialect consisting binary compiled
This however since replaced library Perl Module
Other complex application may incorporate expose embedded programming language allow user control give functionality available user interface matter sophisticated
For example authoring tool embed scripting language us fill role
Some type application need faster feature addition cycle
also use embedded language
During development allows prototype feature faster tweak freely without need user intimate knowledge inner working application rebuild tweak take significant amount time
The scripting language used purpose range common famous one

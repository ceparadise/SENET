systematic process using empirical data refine program improve student learning
Assessment data obtained directly examining student work ass achievement learning outcome based data one make inference learning
Assessment often used interchangeably test limited test
Assessment focus individual learner learning community class workshop organized group learner course academic program institution educational system whole also known
The word came use educational context Second World War
As continuous process assessment establishes measurable clear student learning outcome learning provisioning sufficient amount learning opportunity achieve outcome implementing systematic way gathering analyzing interpreting evidence determine well student learning match expectation using collected information inform improvement student learning
The final purpose assessment practice education depends practitioner researcher assumption belief nature human mind origin knowledge process learning
The term generally used refer activity teacher use help student learn gauge student progress
Assessment divided sake convenience using following categorization Assessment often divided initial formative summative category purpose considering different objective assessment practice
Jay McTighe Ken proposed seven practice effective learning
One showing criterion evaluation test
Another importance know skill level student giving instruction
Giving lot feedback encouraging practice
Educational researcher Robert Stake explains difference formative summative assessment following analogy When cook taste soup formative
When guest taste soup summative
Summative formative assessment often referred learning context respectively
Assessment learning generally summative nature intended measure learning outcome report outcome student parent administrator
Assessment learning generally occurs conclusion class course semester academic year
Assessment learning generally formative nature used teacher consider approach teaching next step individual learner class
A common form formative assessment
Diagnostic assessment measure student current knowledge skill purpose identifying suitable program learning
form diagnostic assessment involves student assessing
asks assessed consider hypothetical future situation
similar summative assessment focus achievement
It often aligned movement
Though ideally significantly different traditional multiple choice test commonly associated use response standard question scored human scorer scale meeting falling exceeding performance standard rather ranked curve
A task identified student asked create produce something often setting involve application knowledge skill
Proficiency demonstrated providing extended response
Performance format differentiated product performance
The performance may result product painting portfolio paper exhibition may consist performance speech athletic skill musical recital reading
Assessment either summative formative often categorized either objective subjective
Objective assessment form questioning single correct answer
Subjective assessment form questioning may one correct answer one way expressing correct answer
There various type objective subjective question
Objective question type include answer matching question
Subjective question include question essay
Objective assessment well suited increasingly popular computerized format
Some argued distinction objective subjective assessment neither useful accurate reality thing objective assessment
In fact assessment created inherent bias built decision relevant subject matter content well cultural class ethnic gender bias
Test result compared established criterion performance student previous performance Assessment either
Formal assessment usually implies written document test quiz paper
A formal assessment given numerical score grade based student performance whereas informal assessment contribute student final grade
An informal assessment usually occurs casual manner may include observation inventory checklist rating scale performance portfolio assessment participation peer discussion
Internal assessment set marked school
teacher
Students get mark feedback regarding assessment
External assessment set governing body marked personnel
Some external assessment give much limited feedback marking
However test Australia NAPLAN criterion addressed student given detailed feedback order teacher address compare student learning achievement also plan future
In general assessment considered high level
Approaches reliability validity vary however
relates consistency assessment
A reliable assessment one consistently achieves result similar cohort student
Various factor affect ambiguous question many option within question paper vague marking instruction poorly trained marker
Traditionally reliability assessment based following The reliability measurement x also defined quantitatively reliability observed test score x variability true candidate innate performance measured test score respectively
range completely unreliable completely reliable
assessment one measure intended measure
For example would valid ass driving skill written test alone
A valid way assessing driving skill would combination test help determine driver know written test driving knowledge driver able performance assessment actual driving
Teachers frequently complain examination properly ass upon examination based effectively questioning validity exam
Validity assessment generally gauged examination evidence following category A good assessment validity reliability plus quality attribute noted specific context purpose
In practice assessment rarely totally valid totally reliable
A ruler marked wrongly always give wrong measurement
It reliable valid
Asking random individual tell time without looking clock watch sometimes used example assessment valid reliable
The answer vary individual average answer probably close actual time
In many field medical research educational testing psychology often reliability validity
A history test written high validity many essay question
It good measure mastery subject difficult score completely accurately
A history test written high reliability entirely multiple choice
It good measuring knowledge history easily scored great precision
We may generalize
The reliable estimate purport measure le certain actually measuring aspect attainment
It well distinguish validity predictive validity
The former used widely education predicts score student would get similar test different question
The latter used widely workplace predicts performance
Thus test knowledge driving rule appropriate predictively valid test would ass whether potential driver could follow rule
In field particular published three set standard evaluation
The Personnel Evaluation Standards published edition published published
Each publication present elaborates set standard use variety educational setting
The standard provide guideline designing implementing assessing improving identified form evaluation
Each standard placed one four fundamental category promote educational evaluation proper useful feasible accurate
In set standard validity reliability consideration covered accuracy topic
For example student accuracy standard help ensure student evaluation provide sound accurate credible information student learning performance
The following table summarizes main behind almost theoretical research work instructional practice education one course practice assessment
These different framework given rise interesting debate among scholar
epistemology Concerns best apply assessment practice across public school system largely focused question use testing standardized test often used gauge student progress teacher quality statewide educational success
For researcher practitioner question whether test administered general consensus administered useful way test offer useful information student progress curriculum implementation well offering formative us learner
The real issue whether testing practice currently implemented provide service educator student
In mandate standardized testing nationwide
These test align state curriculum link teacher student district state accountability result test
Proponents NCLB argue offer tangible method gauging educational success holding teacher school accountable failing score closing across class ethnicity
Opponents standardized testing dispute claim arguing holding educator accountable test result lead practice
Additionally many argue focus standardized testing encourages teacher equip student narrow set skill enhance test performance without actually fostering deeper understanding subject matter key principle within knowledge domain
The assessment caused controversy use used deny diploma student attended high school four year demonstrate learned required material writing exam
Opponents say student put four year denied high school diploma merely repeatedly failing test even knowing required material
test blamed causing sickness student teacher teacher choosing narrow curriculum towards teacher belief tested
In exercise designed make child comfortable testing newspaper published picture feed fear
The published image purportedly response student asked draw picture thought state assessment
Other critic Washington State University question use test item far beyond standard cognitive level student age
Compared portfolio assessment simple test much le expensive le prone disagreement scorer scored quickly enough returned end school year
student take test condition often use test reason
Orlich criticizes use expensive holistically graded test rather inexpensive bubble test measure quality system individual large number student
Other prominent critic testing include
The use banned state educational decision rank student best worst criticized bias minority
Most education official support individual student score depends solely whether answered question correctly regardless whether neighbor better worse making decision
It widely noted emergence technology mindset learning increasingly collaborative knowledge increasingly distributed across many member learning community
Traditional assessment practice however focus large part individual fail account learning context
As researcher field assessment consider cultural shift arise emergence need find new method applying assessment learner
democratic education school perform offer assessment evaluation transcript recommendation asserting rate people school judge comparing student standard set violation student
Students decide measure progress learner process real lifelong learning proper educational assessment century adduce
According Sudbury school policy cause harm student move life outside school
However admit make process difficult hardship part student learning make way set standard meet goal
The policy help create atmosphere free competition among student battle adult approval encourages positive cooperative environment amongst student body
The final stage Sudbury education student choose take graduation thesis
Each student writes topic prepared adulthood entering community large
This thesis submitted Assembly review
The final stage thesis process oral defense given student open floor question challenge comment Assembly member
At end Assembly vote secret ballot whether award diploma
A major concern use educational assessment overall validity accuracy fairness come assessing English language learner ELL
The majority assessment within United States normative standard based culture adequately represent ELL population
Consequently would many case inaccurate inappropriate draw conclusion ELL student normative score
Research show majority school appropriately modify assessment order accommodate student unique cultural background
This resulted ELL student special education causing disproportionately represented special education program
Although may see inappropriate placement special education supportive helpful research shown inappropriately placed student actually regressed progress
It often necessary utilize service translator order administer assessment ELL student native language however several issue translating assessment item
One issue translation frequently suggest correct expected response changing difficulty assessment item
Additionally translation assessment item sometimes distort original meaning item
Finally many translator qualified properly trained work ELL student assessment situation
All factor compromise validity fairness assessment making result reliable
Nonverbal assessment shown le discriminatory ELL student however still present cultural bias within assessment item
When considering ELL student special education assessment team integrate interpret information collected order ensure non biased conclusion
The decision based multidimensional source data including teacher parent interview well classroom observation
Decisions take student unique cultural linguistic experiential background consideration strictly based assessment result

In condition must always true execution section code operation
Postconditions sometimes tested using within code
Often postconditions simply included documentation affected section code
For example The result always integer greater equal
So program calculates factorial input number would postconditions result calculation integer greater equal
Another example program calculates input number might postconditions result number equal input
In software design approach postconditions along class component software construction method
The postcondition routine declaration property guaranteed upon completion routine execution
As relates routine contract postcondition offer assurance potential caller case routine called state hold property declared postcondition assured
The following example written set value class attribute based argument
The postcondition follows keyword
In example postcondition guarantee case precondition hold represents valid hour day execution class attribute value
The tag describes postcondition clause serf identify case runtime postcondition violation
In presence routine inherited descendant class subclass contract precondition postconditions force
This mean implementation redefinition inherited routine also written comply inherited contract
Postconditions modified redefined routine may strengthened
That redefined routine may increase benefit provides client may decrease benefit

I problem understanding precondition strengthening sound rule Hoare logic
The rule P Q C C I really understand precondition consequence go reverse direction implication work modus ponens
I understand weakening work follows modus ponens rule I able understand precondition strengthening
The triple state Q hold executing C condition X hold
Now suppose P Q
We prove
Indeed suppose P hold
Since P Q also Q hold
Hence execute C X hold
Altogether see valid
An example also helpful
If know certainly know

I learning program one thing I ca quite get head around precondition postconditions
Is statement calling function considered precondition separate efficient way language
I also struggling find example precondition I could understand current knowledge programming anyone could prove simple one I would really appreciate language fine This computer science question programming question would appropriate I answer anyway
Consider program find first index needle haystack
The haystack might contain many needle want stop first one
If haystack contain needle index equal size haystack valid index haystack
A assertion state program typically say program computed something useful point postcondition
For example program write postconditions asserting computed result want Note mean
The first postcondition asserts either number item haystack index needle
The second postcondition asserts needle appear haystack anywhere earlier index
Therefore program found first needle found needle
Thus postconditions true program wanted
A assertion state program combined program subsequent action used prove postconditions
We add precondition example program Note mean
The precondition tell u haystack element including element index needle
You use prove precondition true every time program reach
The loop end condition false mean first postcondition true
The first postcondition contrapositive loop condition
The fact loop precondition true mean second postcondition also true

Consider code Precondition Postcondition Looking code basically searching key starting end array
What I trying find loop invariant using Weakest Precondition prove
However I unsure weakest precondition think weakest precondition precondition nothing nothing seems true calling function maybe except
So I weakest precondition assuming wp I get loop invariant
I ca see derive loop invariant
Aside I think loop invariant I use weakest precondition come loop invariant
Any idea I wrong
I familiar elementary hoare logic account must mimicked booleans
So let rewrite program
In fact becomes easier understand
Where define N Notice instead since decrement next statement might
So loop guard ensures decrement still well defined
In particular look case loop decrease defined afterwards test fails loop terminates
Now postcondition speaks return value essentially let simplify obtain R N key Now postcondition ought follow negation loop guard loop invariant let take invariant P N found key always N found true iff key loop post condition seen
For ease reference let guard denoted B B found We still actually proved P invaraint ie vary change occur loop body initally true
need show
N found key P found key Initialisation seen follows wp assignment tell u wp Q v e e Q e v applying twice mean need following So precondition array condition mentioned
For invariance part need show Sweet
So program annotation We shown partial correctness complete correctness must prove termination
In particular need find bound function bf initially positive decreased loop body want bf constant Since loop body always P B namely let take bound bf Now since B bf bf initially positive
One might tempted try bound fails since loop decrease mean increase
It remains check decreasing Alright
That pretty fun
One final note write say Python another language support parallel assignment make program even succinct
Enjoy

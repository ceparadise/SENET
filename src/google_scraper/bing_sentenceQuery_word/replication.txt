involves sharing information ensure consistency redundant resource component improve reliability accessibility
One speaks A computational task typically
executed separate device could executed repeatedly single device
Replication space time often linked scheduling algorithm The access replicated entity typically uniform access single entity
The replication external user
Also failure scenario replica hidden much possible
The latter refers data replication respect aspect
Computer scientist talk active passive replication system replicate data service If time one master replica designated process request talking scheme scheme predominant
On side replica process request distributes new state scheme called database field
In scheme form must used
differs task replication since distributes load different computation across machine allows single computation dropped case failure
Load balancing however sometimes us data replication especially replication internally distribute data among machine
differs replication save copy data unchanged long period time
Replicas hand undergo frequent update quickly lose historical state
Replication one oldest important topic overall area
Whether one replicates data computation objective group process handle incoming event
If replicate data process passive operate maintain stored data reply read request apply update
When replicate computation usual goal provide
For example replicated service might used control telephone switch objective ensuring even primary controller fails backup take function
But underlying need case ensuring replica see event equivalent order stay consistent state hence replica respond query
A number widely cited model exist data replication property performance replication used many usually relationship original copy
The master log update ripple slave
The slave output message stating received update successfully thus allowing sending potentially successfully applied subsequent update
update submitted database node ripple server often desired introduces substantially increased cost complexity may make impractical situation
The common challenge exists replication transactional conflict prevention resolution
Most synchronous eager replication solution conflict prevention asynchronous solution conflict resolution
For instance record changed two node simultaneously eager replication system would detect conflict confirming commit abort one transaction
A system would allow transaction commit run conflict resolution resynchronization
The resolution conflict may based timestamp transaction hierarchy origin node much complex logic decides consistently node
Database replication becomes difficult scale
Usually scale go two dimension horizontal vertical horizontal data replica vertical data replica located away distance
Problems raised horizontal alleviated access protocol
Vertical cause fewer problem internet reliability performance improving
When data replicated database server information remains consistent throughout database system user tell even know server DBMS using system said exhibit replication transparency
Active storage replication usually implemented distributing update several physical
This way supported replicated without modification file system code work level block device driver layer
It implemented either hardware software
The basic method typical locally connected disk
The storage industry narrow definition local operation
A extendable across disk located physically distant location database replication model usually applied
The purpose replication prevent damage failure may occur one location case event occur improve ability recover
For replication latency key factor determines either far apart site type replication employed
The main characteristic replication write operation handled To address limit imposed latency technique applied link
Many use replication ensure fault tolerance avoid single point failure
See list
replication replicating file logical level rather replicating storage block level
There many different way performing
Unlike replication solution almost exclusively rely software
With use specifically intercept call filesystem function activity captured immediately occurs
This utilises type technology real time active virus checker employ
At level logical file operation captured like file open write delete etc
The kernel driver transmits command another process generally network different machine mimic operation source machine
Like storage replication replication allows synchronous asynchronous mode
In synchronous mode write operation source machine held allowed occur destination machine acknowledged successful replication
Synchronous mode le common file replication product although solution exist
File level replication solution yield benefit
Firstly data captured file level make informed decision whether replicate based location file type file
Hence unlike storage replication whole volume need replicated file replication product ability exclude temporary file part filesystem hold business value
This substantially reduce amount data sent source machine well decrease storage burden destination machine
A benefit decreasing bandwidth data transmitted granular replication
If application writes byte byte transmitted complete disk block generally byte
On negative side software solution requires implementation maintenance operating system level us machine processing power CPU
Similarly database many ability activity
The journal sent another machine either periodically real time streaming
On replica side journal used play back file system modification
One notable implementation DPM performs periodical update offer replication
This process comparing source destination filesystems ensuring destination match source
The key benefit solution generally free inexpensive
The downside process synchronizing quite consequently process generally run infrequently
One notable implementation
Another example using replication appears system may happen many node system share page memory usually mean node separate copy replica page
Many classical approach replication based model one device process unilateral control one process device
For example primary might perform computation streaming log update backup standby process take primary fails
This approach common one replicating database despite risk portion log lost failure backup might state identical one primary transaction could lost
A weakness scheme setting process could active one actually performing operation
We gaining spending twice much money get property
For reason starting period around distributed system research community began explore alternative method replicating data
An outgrowth work emergence scheme group replica could cooperate process backup others handling share workload
towering figure within database community analyzed replication scheme transactional model ultimately published widely cited paper skeptical approach
In nutshell argued unless data split natural way database treated disjoint concurrency control conflict result seriously degraded performance group replica probably slow function
Indeed suggests common approach likely result degradation scale
His solution partition data viable situation data actually natural partitioning key
The situation always bleak
For example period model proposed emerged widely adopted standard used Isis Toolkit Horus Transis Ensemble Totem Phoenix Quicksilver system basis CORBA computing standard model also used IBM Websphere replicate business logic Microsoft Windows Server technology
Virtual synchrony permit approach group process cooperate parallelize aspect request processing
The scheme used form data feasible provides linear speedup size group
A number modern product support similar scheme
For example support virtual synchrony model used implement replication scheme would also possible use Quicksilver manner
permit active replication every node network exact copy hence every node network active one time scheme optimized use

Replication primary significant aspect cell division
At end replication genetic material mother cell duplicate daughter cell receives copy
Cellular organelle also undergo replication
Replication ensures transfer genetic material mother daughter cell
A part replication process known replication fork
The process involves many enzyme includes collective referred CMG untangles separate DNA two strand
The replication fork resembles zipper CMG appearing like zipper slider individual strand appearing like two row teeth open zipper
Each individual strand becomes template daughter copy
The act integrating new integral strand suit template executed two different polymerase enzyme harmony complementary DNA chain
This result new DNA molecule

The process creating managing duplicate version
Replication copy database also synchronizes set change made one replica reflected others
The beauty replication enables many user work local copy database database updated working single centralized database
For database application user geographically widely distributed replication often efficient method database access
The system one first make replication central component design one main reason success

In summary many conclusion experiment done variety field found hold water followed subsequent experiment
There number famous example particularly field show rate replication finding le expected rate
The reason proposed crisis wide ranging typical center preference novel finding science pressure investigator especially new one publish perish
My favorite reason place blame entire crisis
I think develop better understanding crisis need step back look across differend field study
There one key question asking My reading literature would suggest reason attributed replication crisis common scientist every field
novel finding publishing etc
So would heterogeneity
As Lorena Barba recently tremendous confusion use word best sort
Here I use word This act repeating entire study independently original investigator without use original data generally using method
A study reproducible take original data used analyze data reproduce numerical finding study
This may initially sound like trivial task experience shown always easy achieve seemly minimal standard
For precise definition I mean term take look
One key distinction replication reproducibility replication need trust original finding
In fact may attempting replicate study trust finding original study
A recent example includes creation stem cell ordinary cell finding extraodinary led several laboratory quickly try replicate study
Ultimately original study ultimately retracted
What field astronomy epidemiology common
You might think nothing
Those two department often even campus university
However least one common element thing study generally reluctant controlled human being
As result astronomer epidemiologist rely heavily one tool
Much written observational study late I spare literature search saying bottom line trusted particularly observational study
But method dealing thing trust It called replication
Epidemiologists actually codified understanding believe causal claim see typically claim replicated numerous study variety setting
My understanding astronomer similar mentality single study result anyone believe something new universe
Rather finding need replicated using different approach instrument etc
The key point astronomy epidemiology expectation low respect individual study

Investigators culture distrusting individual finding replicated numerous time
In area research idea ambient air pollution cause health problem difficult believe decade started seeing association appear numerous study conducted around world
It hard imagine single study proving connection matter well conducted
I already described primary mode investigation astronomy epidemiology course method field
One large category method includes
Controlled experiment come variety form whether laboratory experiment cell randomized clinical trial human involve intentional manipulation factor investigator order observe manipulation affect outcome
In clinical medicine social science controlled experiment considered gold standard evidence
literature summary generally weight publication controlled experiment highly approach like observational study
The aspect I want look whether field strong basic theoretical foundation
The idea field like say physic strong set basic theory whose prediction consistently validated time
Other field like medicine lack even rudimentary theory used make basic prediction
Granted distinction field without basic theory bit arbitrary part I think fair say different field study fall spectrum term much basic theory rely
Given theoretical nature different field primary mode investigation develop following crude table I inserted representative field study
My primary contention The replication crisis science concentrated area tradition controlled experimentation relatively little basic theory underpinning field
Further general I believe anything wrong people tirelessly working upper right box
At least I think anything wrong compared good people working three box
In case anyone wondering state clinical science relative say particle physic respect basic theory I point web site
This essentially government agency budget million dedicated
This state basic theory clinical medicine
The people working upper right box uphill battle least two reason The confluence two factor lead much greater disappointment finding field replicate
This lead believe
Further reliance controlled experiements certain field lulled u believing place tremendous weight small number study
Ultimately someone asks Why cured cancer yet answer Because hard
It important remember colleague Rafa Irizarry finding many field upper right box especially clinical medicine tremendous positive impact life work
Rafa say argue rate discovery higher biomedical research physic
But achieve higher true positive rate biomedical research tolerate higher false positive rate
It certainly possible reduce rate false way would experiment
But want
Would benefit u society

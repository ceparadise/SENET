For complex operation program use terminal specific system call
For application simplest way use terminal simply write read text string sequentially
The output text scrolled last several line typically visible
system typically input text key pressed application receives ready string text
In mode application need know much terminal
For many interactive application sufficient
One common enhancement assisted library also may give access command history
This helpful various interactive
Even advanced interactivity provided application
Those application completely control screen layout also respond immediately
This mode useful
In addition program control color brightness text screen decorate underline blinking special character

To achieve application must deal plain text string also allow move arbitrary position clear portion screen change color display special character also respond
The great problem many different terminal set
In order overcome special created together terminal description database
Dumb terminal interpret limited number control code etc
ability process special perform function clearing line clearing screen controlling position
In context dumb terminal sometimes dubbed essentially limited functionality mechanical
This type dumb terminal still supported modern system setting

A display directly draw line face control host computer system
The line continuously formed since speed electronics limited number concurrent line displayed one time limited
display historically important longer used
Practically modern graphic display descended picture scanning technique used visual element rectangular array
Since raster image perceptible human eye whole short time raster must refreshed many time per second give appearance persistent display
The electronic demand refreshing display memory meant graphic terminal developed much later text terminal initially cost much
Most terminal today graphical show image screen
The modern term graphical terminal
A thin client typically us protocol like Microsoft Windows
The bandwidth needed depends protocol used resolution
Modern graphic terminal allow display image color text varying size color type face
In early industry consortium attempted define standard would allow single CRT screen implement multiple window behave distinct terminal
Unfortunately like suffered run closed standard unable obtain even minimal information realistic way small company independent developer could join consortium
Possibly standard disappeared without trace
A piece software emulates text terminal
In past widespread use broadband internet access many computer would use serial access program communicate computer via serial device
When first released program called used communicate many computer including
Dec Terminal one first terminal program popular
The Windows emulate physical terminal support program logging textually remote computer Windows including Telnet program bundled version Windows often incorporate code process escape sequence

The program run first instruction rung last rung
It take time processor PLC evaluate rung update image table status output
Scan time millisecond may encountered small program fast processor older processor large program much longer scan time order m may encountered
Excessively long scan time may mean response PLC changing input process condition slow useful
As PLCs became advanced method developed change sequence ladder execution subroutine implemented
This simplified programming could used save scan time process example part program used setting machine could segregated part required operate higher speed
module may used scan time PLC long allow predictable performance

These communication link also often used device keypad workstation
Formerly manufacturer offered dedicated communication module function processor network connection
PLC program typically written special application personal computer downloaded cable network PLC
The program stored PLC either volatile
Often single PLC programmed replace thousand
Under standard PLCs programmed using programming language
The commonly used programming language Ladder diagram LD also known Ladder logic
It us logic make program like electrical control diagram
A graphical programming notation called available certain programmable controller
A model emulated electromechanical control panel device contact coil relay PLCs replaced
This model remains common today
IEC currently defines five programming language programmable control system FBD LD ST similar IL similar SFC
These technique emphasize logical organization operation
While fundamental concept PLC programming common manufacturer difference addressing memory organization instruction set mean PLC program never perfectly interchangeable different maker
Even within product line single manufacturer different model may directly compatible
This programming example show control system
A ladder diagram method drawing control circuit PLCs
The ladder diagram resembles schematic diagram system built electromechanical relay
As example say facility need store water tank
The water drawn tank another system needed example system must manage water level tank controlling valve refill tank

Shown In ladder diagram contact symbol represent state bit processor memory corresponds state physical input system
If discrete input energized memory bit normally open contact controlled bit pas logic true signal next element ladder
Therefore contact PLC program read look physical switch contact case must opposite open order return TRUE closed physical switch
Internal status bit corresponding state discrete output also available program
In example physical state float switch contact must considered choosing normally open normally closed symbol ladder diagram
The PLC two discrete input Low Level High Level
Both float switch normally closed open contact water level tank physical location switch
When water level switch float switch physical contact closed true logic value passed Fill Valve output
Water begin fill tank
The internal Fill Valve contact latch circuit even Low Level contact open water pass lower switch fill valve remains
Since High Level also normally closed water continues flow water level remains two switch level
Once water level rise enough High Level switch opened PLC shut inlet stop water overflowing example latching logic
The output sealed high level condition break circuit
After fill valve remains level drop low Low Level switch activated process repeat
A complete program may contain thousand rung evaluated sequence
Typically PLC processor alternately scan input update output evaluate ladder logic input change program scan effective next update
A complete program scan may take millisecond much faster change controlled process
Programmable controller vary capability rung ladder diagram
Some allow single output bit
There typically limit number series contact line number branch used
Each element rung evaluated sequentially
If element change state evaluation rung fault generated although sometimes technique useful
Some implementation forced evaluation displayed allow reverse flow logic signal rung affect output
Prior discovery June security PLCs received little attention
PLCs generally contain operating system exploit system exist much desktop computer operating system
PLCs also attacked gaining control computer communicate
In order properly understand operation PLC necessary spend considerable time testing PLC program
PLC system inherently expensive often costly
In addition PLC programmed incorrectly result lost productivity dangerous condition
PLC simulation software save time design automated control application also increase level safety associated equipment since various scenario tried tested system activated
Some special process need work permanently minimum unwanted time
Therefore necessary design system capable handling process faulty module
In case increase system availability event hardware component failure redundant CPU module functionality added hardware configuration preventing total partial process shutdown due hardware failure
PLCs well adapted range task
These typically industrial process manufacturing cost developing maintaining automation system high relative total cost automation change system would expected operational life
PLCs contain input output device compatible industrial pilot device control little electrical design required design problem center expressing desired sequence operation
PLC application typically highly customized system cost packaged PLC low compared cost specific controller design
On hand case good customized control system economical
This due lower cost component optimally chosen instead generic solution engineering charge spread thousand million unit
For high volume simple fixed automation task different technique used
For example cheap consumer would controlled electromechanical costing dollar production quantity
A design would appropriate hundred thousand unit produced development cost design power supply hardware necessary testing certification spread many sale would need alter control
Automotive application example million unit built year alter programming controller
However specialty vehicle transit bus economically use PLCs instead control volume low development cost would uneconomical
Very complex process control used chemical industry may require algorithm performance beyond capability even PLCs
Very precision control may also require customized solution example aircraft flight control
using fully proprietary hardware may chosen demanding control application high development maintenance cost supported
Soft PLCs running computer interface industrial hardware executing program within version commercial operating system adapted process control need
Programmable controller widely used motion positioning torque control
Some manufacturer produce motion control unit integrated PLC involving machine used instruct machine movement
PLCs may include logic feedback analog control loop
A PID loop could used control temperature manufacturing process example
Historically PLCs usually configured analog control loop process required hundred thousand loop DCS would instead used
As PLCs become powerful boundary DCS PLC application blurred
PLCs similar functionality
An RTU however usually support control algorithm control loop
As hardware rapidly becomes powerful cheaper RTUs PLCs DCSs increasingly beginning overlap responsibility many vendor sell RTUs feature vice versa
The industry standardized functional block language creating program run RTUs PLCs although nearly vendor also offer proprietary alternative associated development environment
In recent year safety PLCs started become popular either standalone model functionality hardware added existing controller architecture Guardlogix etc
These differ conventional PLC type suitable use application PLCs traditionally supplemented
For example safety PLC might used control access robot cell perhaps manage shutdown response emergency stop conveyor production line
Such PLCs typically restricted regular instruction set augmented instruction designed interface emergency stop light screen forth
The flexibility system offer resulted rapid growth demand controller
Discrete signal behave binary switch yielding simply On Off signal True False respectively
Push button example device providing discrete signal
Discrete signal sent using either specific range designated another
For example PLC might use V DC value V DC representing value representing intermediate value undefined
Initially PLCs discrete
Analog signal like volume control range value zero
These typically interpreted integer value count PLC various range accuracy depending device number bit available store data
As PLCs typically use signed binary processor integer value limited
Pressure temperature flow weight often represented analog signal
Analog signal use magnitude proportional value process signal
For example analog V input would integer value le sensitive electrical noise
welder electric motor start voltage input
PLCs forefront manufacturing automation
An engineer working manufacturing environment least encounter PLCs use regular basis
Electrical engineering student basic knowledge PLCs widespread use industrial application

Hi This report prepared test engineer test case failed associated one test TIR may describe many test step failure test step must associated single test case
The content TIR developed first tester developer assigned correct failure
The tester describes failure sufficient detail enable reproduction failure developer
The developer assigned correct failure us information reproduce identify root cause failure
When software corrected desk checked developer TIR updated reflect change associated fix

There three basic type event Computer security information technology personnel must handle emergency event according computer security incident response plan
An incident event attributable human root cause
This distinction particularly important event product malicious intent harm
An important note incident event many event incident
A system application failure due age defect may emergency event random flaw failure incident
The security manages response process responsible assembling team
The coordinator ensure team includes individual necessary properly ass incident make decision regarding proper course action
The incident team meet regularly review status report authorize specific remedy
The team utilize physical virtual meeting place
The investigation seek determine circumstance incident
Every incident warrant require investigation
However investigation resource like forensic tool dirty network quarantine network consultation law enforcement may useful effective rapid resolution emergency incident
An incident detected sensor network analyst user reporting something unusual PC
In event malicious network traffic computer virus Incident Response Manager stop traffic taking computer network
Run virus scan remove virus wipe computer clean reimage machine
Use tool understand malicious traffic occurred first place
Once incident completely understood make plan decrease future risk

In addition providing access Internet ISPs may also provide package account personal home page
ISPs host Web site business also build Web site
ISPs connected network access point public network facility Internet backbone
The rise commercial Internet service application helped fuel rapid commercialization Internet
This phenomenon result several factor well
One important factor introduction PC workstation early development turn fueled unprecedented progress attendant rapid decline computer price
Another factor took increasing importance emergence local area network LANs link personal computer
But force work
Following restructuring took advantage various new option digital backbone service known
In
Corporation National Research received approval conduct experiment linking commercial service MCI Mail Internet
This application first Internet connection commercial provider also part research
Approval quickly followed allow provider access Internet began first explosion traffic
In federal legislation allowed NSF open NSFNET backbone commercial user
Prior time use backbone subject acceptable use policy established administered NSF commercial use limited application served research community
NSF recognized commercially supplied network service available would ultimately far le expensive continued funding network service
Also made widely available new type known browser ran type interface simplified access retrieval display file Internet
Mosaic incorporated set access display standard originally developed European Organization Nuclear Research new Internet application called WWW
In originally called Mosaic Communications Corporation formed develop Navigator software commercial use
Shortly thereafter software giant became interested supporting Internet application personal computer developed Web browser based initially Mosaic program
These new commercial capability accelerated growth Internet early already growing rate percent per year
By late approximately ISPs around world half located United States
However ISPs provided local service relied access regional national ISPs wider connectivity
Consolidation began end decade many small provider merging acquired larger ISPs
Among larger provider group America Online started information service Internet connectivity made transition late become leading provider Internet service million subscriber branch Australia Europe South America Asia
Meanwhile many new ISPs entered business large national market China India Indonesia quickly eclipsed subscriber base traditional commercial ISP
Internet customer continued shift broadband service faster Internet connection
The broadband service offered company cost little service part United States
As result shift Internet provider AOL watched base service subscriber decline nearly million million million
In effort reposition AOL longer sought premier provider service instead tried become free Internet portal like
AOL offered customer two approach could still pay Internet access AOL could pay Internet access another company still access many AOL feature free
With proliferation Internet site broadcast video large file ISPs pushed right offer differently priced tier service online content software provider basis Internet use
Proponents net neutrality believe among thing network provider required treat broadband consumer equally instead charging consumer higher price using bandwidth capacity
Opponents net neutrality question whether cable telephone company could afford invest advanced security transmission service could charge premium
In general big Internet provider content software support net neutrality ISPs
Legislation required settle dispute

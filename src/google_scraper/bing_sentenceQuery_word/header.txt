In computing term header refer number different thing
Some common us include document header webpage header file header
Many program allow add header page
The header small area top document footer located bottom
Document header often used display document title company name top page
By header content page edit header one page update page well
If break document section specify different header section
Word processor provide different way adding editing header content
Several program allow select display header footer content
Once visible type new content inside section
Most version Microsoft Word allow simply header area activate header add edit text
If want change height header open Document Formatting window modify margin
The header webpage typically includes company organization logo well main navigation bar
This section resides top webpage often part therefore across page within website section website
even includes tag developer use specify header section webpage
A webpage header confused section HTML includes page title link referenced file
A file header small amount beginning
File header vary generally define content file list specific file attribute
For example file header image file may include image format color profile application created file
An audio file may include song name tagging format compression information
You view file header dragging file text editor reading first line
While file may contain lot garbled character header information often still readable

I tried get grasp mean I looked wiki definition vague
So question
Is length data bus address bus
Word size refers number bit processed computer CPU one go day typically bit bit
Data bus size instruction size address size usually multiple word size
Just confuse matter backwards compatibility Microsoft Windows API defines WORD bit DWORD bit QWORD bit regardless processor
One answer much used
Way back computer could full word memory would bit depending particular machine
One would carefully structure program design around word size target machine
But computer access individual byte access string data dozen byte long one relatively seamless operation
Much significant technical word size memory bus width determines many byte transferred CPU memory one memory cycle
So word size somewhat meaningless another answer suggests company like Microsoft often define arbitrary manner real relationship anything
Word size mean
bit data processed microprocessor unit
Just add description
It obvious CPU main processor computer
So get data process
Ans RAM Random Access Memory store temporary data processed
So CPU load data RAM via bus one limitation amount data load time
How many bit
far I know
Those bit word size computer
So basically amount data loaded processed CPU represents called word size
word size mean fixed size length bit within processor architecture By posting answer agree

I student Computer Science I hearing word overhead lot come program sort
What mean exactly
It resource required set operation
It might seem unrelated necessary
It like need go somewhere might need car
But would lot overhead get car drive street might want walk
However overhead would worth going across country
In computer science sometimes use car go street better way worth time learn walk
The meaning word differ lot context
In general resource often memory CPU time used contribute directly intended result required technology method used
Examples Wikipedia In computer science generally considered combination excess indirect computation time memory bandwidth resource required attain particular goal
It special case engineering overhead
You tired cant work
You eat food
The energy spent looking food getting actually eating consumes energy overhead
Overhead something wasted order accomplish task
The goal make overhead small
In computer science let say want print number thats task
But storing number setting display print calling routine print accessing number variable overhead
Overhead typically reffers amount extra resource memory processor time etc
different programming algorithm take
For example overhead inserting balanced Binary Tree could much larger insert simple Linked List insert take longer use processing power balance Tree result longer percieved operation time user
For programmer overhead refers system resource consumed code running giving platform given set input data
Usually term used context comparing different implementation possible implementation
For example might say particular approach might incur considerable CPU overhead another might incur memory overhead yet another might weighted network overhead entail external dependency example
Let give specific example Compute average arithmetic mean set number
The obvious approach loop input keeping running total count
When last number encountered signaled end file EOF sentinel value GUI buttom whatever simply divide total number input done
This approach incurs almost overhead term CPU memory resource
It trivial task
Another possible approach slurp input list
iterate list calculate sum divide number valid item list
By comparison approach might incur arbitrary amount memory overhead
In particular bad implementation might perform sum operation using recursion without
Now addition memory overhead list also introducing stack overhead different sort memory often limited resource form memory
Yet another arguably absurd approach would post input SQL table RDBMS
Then simply calling SQL SUM function column table
This shift local memory overhead server incurs network overhead external dependency execution
Note remote server may may particular memory overhead associated task might shove value immediately storage example
Hypothetically might consider implementation sort cluster possibly make averaging trillion value feasible
In case necessary encoding distribution value mapping node result reduction would count overhead
We also talk overhead incurred factor beyond programmer code
For example compilation code bit processor might entail greater overhead one would see old architecture
This might involve larger memory overhead alignment issue CPU overhead CPU forced adjust bit ordering used instruction etc
Note disk space taken code library etc
usually referred overhead rather called footprint
Also base memory program consumes without regard data set processing called footprint well
You could use dictionary
The definition
But save time Overhead work required productive work
For instance algorithm run useful work requires memory work
This memory allocation take time directly related work done therefore overhead
You check
But mainly action resource used
Like familiar value type reference type
Reference type memory overhead require memory value type
A concrete example overhead difference local procedure call remote procedure call
For example classic RPC many remote framework like EJB function method call look coder whether local memory call distributed network call
For example Is normal method remote method
From see ca tell
But imagine difference execution time two call dramatic
So core implementation cost overhead involved quite different
Think overhead time required manage thread coordinate among
It burden thread enough task
In case overhead cost come saved time using threading code take time sequential one

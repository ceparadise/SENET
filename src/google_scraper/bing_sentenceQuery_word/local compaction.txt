My operating system textbook say compaction process rearranges disk block free disk block form contiguous chunk free disk space
But I always thought defragmentation
Are two term
Or I missing something
In modern disk operating system file subdivided block may stored arbitrary location disk
Files read quickly physical disk block stored consecutively I think every OS created since without difficulty create file larger single largest consecutive free area disk provided total size free area sufficient hold file
Such file end different piece stored different part disk thus accessing often fast entire file stored consecutively
Conceptually ideal disk arrangement would content every file stored consecutively file stored unused block consecutive range
Such arrangement would compacted defragmented
In general though amount effort arrange everything perfectly seldom worthwhile obvious exception disk written never modified would typically case

Defragmenting disk move block make file consecutive sequence block disk necessarily attempt eliminate free area file
Compacting disk consolidate free area moving data later part disk unused location earlier part may cause fragmentation existing file
Generally software performs defragmentation try avoid creating many scattered free area software performs compaction try avoid causing needle fragmentation depending upon software trying
maximize efficiency existing file versus preparing large contiguous area space preparation large operation need run smoothly software may focus one kind operation expense
mean moving memory area eliminate hole caused terminated five process A B C D E allocated memory
After sometime process B D terminated
Now memory layout
After applying compaction instead two memory unit one memory unit
mean storing complete file smallest number contiguous region
That try store file one complete unit size contiguous memory available
Suppose process A fragment process B fragment
Now suppose memory layout defragmentation
Defragmentation also contribute compaction

In form automatic
The attempt reclaim memory occupied longer use
Garbage collection invented around simplify manual memory management
Garbage collection often portrayed opposite requires programmer specify object deallocate return memory system
However many system use combination approach including technique
Like memory management technique garbage collection may take significant proportion total processing time program result significant influence performance
With good implementation enough memory depending application garbage collection faster manual memory management opposite also true often case past GC algorithm
Resources memory database device descriptor typically handled garbage collection
Methods used manage resource particularly may suffice manage memory well leaving need GC
Some GC system allow resource associated region memory collected cause resource reclaimed called
Finalization may introduce complication limiting usability intolerable latency disuse reclaim especially limited resource lack control performs work reclaiming
The basic principle garbage collection find data object program accessed future reclaim resource used object
Many require garbage collection either part example effectively practical implementation example formal language like said
Other language designed use manual memory management implementation available example
Some language like allow garbage collection application using separate collected manually managed object others like allow user manually delete object also entirely disable garbage collection speed required
While integrating garbage collection language enables much wider choice method GC system exist including require recompilation
GC sometimes distinguished
The garbage collector almost always closely integrated
Garbage collection free programmer manually dealing memory deallocation
As result certain category eliminated substantially reduced Some bug addressed garbage collection security implication
Typically garbage collection certain disadvantage including consuming additional resource performance impact possible stall program execution incompatibility manual resource management
Garbage collection consumes computing resource deciding memory free even though programmer may already known information
The penalty convenience annotating object lifetime manually source code lead decreased uneven performance
A paper came conclusion GC need five time memory compensate overhead perform fast explicit memory management
Interaction memory hierarchy effect make overhead intolerable circumstance hard predict detect routine testing
The impact performance also given Apple reason adopting garbage collection despite desired feature
The moment garbage actually collected unpredictable resulting stall pause memory scattered throughout session
Unpredictable stall unacceptable interactive program
Incremental concurrent garbage collector address problem varying
The modern GC implementation try minimize blocking stall much work possible background
separate thread example marking unreachable garbage instance application process continues run
In spite advancement example still difficult maintain large heap million object resident object get promoted older generation without incurring noticeable delay sometimes second
GC incompatible based management resource
As result need explicit manual resource management resource becomes transitive composition
That GC system resource object requires manual resource management object used part another object composed object also become object requires manual resource management
common type garbage collection much garbage collection often refers tracing garbage collection rather method
The overall strategy consists determining object garbage collected tracing object chain reference certain root object considering rest garbage collecting
However large number algorithm used implementation widely varying complexity performance characteristic
Reference counting garbage collection object count number reference
Garbage identified reference count zero
An object reference count incremented reference created decremented reference destroyed
When count reach zero object memory reclaimed
As manual memory management unlike tracing garbage collection reference counting guarantee object destroyed soon last reference destroyed usually access memory either CPU cache object freed directly pointed thus tends significant negative side effect CPU cache virtual memory operation
There number disadvantage reference counting generally solved mitigated sophisticated algorithm used convert thus reducing amount work needed done garbage collector
This done using analysis determine whether object allocated within function accessible outside
escape function thread
In case object may allocated directly thread stack released function return reducing potential garbage collection overhead
Generally speaking likely garbage collection standard feature
In language built garbage collection added library C
Most garbage collection built
especially notable first first language introduce garbage collection
Other dynamic language version use reference counting also tend use GC
language usually provide integrated garbage collection
Notable exception
Historically language intended beginner often used garbage collection data type string list burden programmer manual memory management
On early microcomputer limited memory slow processor BASIC garbage collection could often cause apparently random inexplicable pause midst program operation
Some BASIC interpreter Apple II family repeatedly scanned string descriptor string highest address order compact toward high memory resulting performance could introduce pause execution program
A replacement garbage collector Applesoft BASIC published January page identified group string every pas heap cut collection time dramatically
released provided windowing garbage collector BASIC reduced collection fraction second
While traditionally garbage collection release introduced garbage collection using developed runtime collector
However release garbage collection deprecated favor ARC introduced
Furthermore since May Apple even forbids usage garbage collection new OS X application
For garbage collection never introduced due problem application responsivity performance instead iOS us ARC
Garbage collection rarely used system perceived need tight control use limited resource
However garbage collector compatible limited environment developed
The Microsoft embedded software platform like larger cousin include garbage collection
form allowing memory reused reclaimed based invariant known compilation
This form garbage collection studied saw greater usage introduction ARC Apple ecosystem iOS OS X
Incremental concurrent garbage collector developed algorithm algorithm
In Baker algorithm allocation done either half single region memory
When becomes half full garbage collection performed move live object half remaining object implicitly deallocated
The running program check object reference correct half move across background task finding object
scheme based empirical observation object die young
In generational garbage collection two allocation region generation kept kept separate based object age
New object created young generation regularly collected generation full object still referenced older region copied next oldest generation
Occasionally full scan performed
Some include hardware support garbage collection
Most implementation garbage collector
Such garbage collector meet constraint used operating system

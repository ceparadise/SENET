MITRE system engineer SEs working government program develop actionable risk mitigation strategy monitoring metric monitor implementation risk mitigation plan ensure successful project program completion collaborate government team conducting risk review across project program analyze metric determine ongoing risk status identify serious risk elevate sponsor customer
Risk mitigation planning implementation progress monitoring depicted Figure
As part iterative process risk tracking tool used record result risk prioritization analysis step provides input risk mitigation step risk impact assessment step
The risk mitigation step involves development mitigation plan designed manage eliminate reduce risk acceptable level
Once plan implemented continually monitored ass efficacy intent revising needed
General guideline applying risk mitigation handling option shown Figure
These option based assessed combination probability occurrence severity consequence identified risk
These guideline appropriate many project program
Risk mitigation handling option include Each option requires developing plan implemented monitored effectiveness
More information handling option discussed best practice lesson learned
From system engineering perspective common method risk reduction mitigation identified program risk include following listed order increasing seriousness risk When determining method risk mitigation MITRE SE help customer ass performance schedule cost impact one mitigation strategy another
For something like parallel development mitigation MITRE SEs could help government determine whether cost could double time might extended much double cost parallel effort also added cost additional program office user engagement
For conducting rapid prototyping changing operational requirement MITRE SEs use knowledge creating prototype using prototyping experimenting see SE Guide article topic projecting cost time conduct prototype help mitigate particular risk requirement
Implementing engineering review special oversight testing may require change contractual agreement
MITRE system engineer help government ass schedule cost helping determine basis estimate additional contractor effort providing reality check estimate
MITRE CASA Center Acquisition Systems Analysis CCG Center Connected Government Investment Management practice department experience knowledge base many development activity across wide spectrum method help realistic assessment mitigation alternative

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I report risk fill field mitigation
What risk mitigation normally mean reducing impact
In risk mitigation look project looking risk probability impact
After create scenario case risk happens
For example construction East Asia
The risk monsoon season start earlier definitely start risk start earlier expect A B order keep project going keep employee safe
Another example IT
There risk user going cancel subscription service change certain feature
As mitigation launch test see risk real moreover make possible turn feature back case number user decrease expect
You put document ask expert review insight
Unfortunately lot time concept risk mitigation risk response conflated
There several category risk response mitigation one
Specifically Using strict definition mitigation proactively reduce either probability impact threat
After perform mitigation may end zero probability threat occur residual risk remaining acceptable
A contingency plan place threat occurs certain trigger point occurs
So reactive
Here becomes complex
We tendency treat threat discrete fact threat typically chain threat
In word threat occurs becomes risk factor threat occur
Therefore contingency reactive plan first threat really mitigation plan next set threat
For example start car assume accept level risk spontaneous tire failure
You mitigate rotating tire set frequency maintaining proper pressure inspecting etc
However still residual threat
If threat occurs spare tire contingency plan
However threat changing tire next highway threat getting hit stranded night winter lonely deserted road
And continues
So I would recommend getting bogged strict definition
Risk management resilience
It looking entire chain linked event breaking chain able continue ca break breaking another link line
Call mitigation contingency recovery plan B avoidance whatever
EXCEPT studying PMP
Then learn strict definition

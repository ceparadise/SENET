A system organizing day social religious commercial administrative purpose
This done giving name period typically
A designation single specific day within system
A calendar also physical record often paper system
A calendar also mean list planned event partly fully chronological list document calendar will
Periods calendar year month usually though necessarily synchronised cycle
The common type calendar lunar calendar occasionally add one remain synchronised long term
The term taken term first day month Roman calendar related verb call referring calling new moon first seen
Latin meant account book register account settled debt collected calends month
The Latin term adopted century spelling early modern
The course Sun Moon evident form commonly used society worldwide time unit
Nevertheless Roman calendar contained ancient remnant solar year
The first recorded calendar date dependent development calendar
A large number calendar system based found Ancient Near East date
Amongst calendar system calendar system Persian Empire turn gave rise well
A great number developed also influenced calendar outside immediate sphere Greek influence giving rise various well ancient
Calendars antiquity depending introduction align solar lunar year
This mostly based observation may early attempt model pattern intercalation algorithmically evidenced fragmentary
The reformed BC
The Julian calendar longer dependent observation new moon simply followed algorithm introducing leap day every four year
This created dissociation calendar
The based prohibition intercalation Islamic tradition dated sermon held AH Julian date March
This resulted lunar calendar shift relative season solar year
The first calendar reform early modern era introduced based observation shift Julian calendar solar year
There number modern proposal reform calendar recently
Such idea mooted time time failed gain traction loss continuity massive upheaval implementation religious objection
A full calendar system different calendar date every day
Thus week cycle full calendar system neither system name day within year without system identifying year
The simplest calendar system count time period reference date
This applies
Virtually possible variation using different reference date particular one le distant past make number smaller
Computations system matter addition subtraction
Other calendar one multiple larger unit time
Calendars contain one level cycle Calendars two level cycle Cycles synchronized periodic phenomenon Very commonly calendar includes one type cycle cyclic element
Most calendar incorporate complex cycle
For example vast majority track year month week day
The week practically universal though use varies
It run uninterrupted millennium
Solar calendar assign
A day may consist period following period may period successive event two sunset
The length interval two successive event may allowed vary slightly year may averaged
Other type calendar may also use solar day
Not calendar use solar year unit
A lunar calendar one day numbered within cycle
Because length even fraction length purely lunar calendar quickly drift season vary much near equator
It however stay constant respect phenomenon notably
An example
Alexander Marshack controversial reading believed mark bone baton BC represented lunar calendar
Other marked bone may also represent lunar calendar
Similarly Michael Rappenglueck belief mark cave painting represent lunar calendar
A lunar calendar compensates adding extra month needed realign month season
An example Hebrew calendar us
Nearly calendar system group consecutive day month also year
In approximates Earth tropical year time take complete cycle traditionally used facilitate planning activity
In approximates cycle moon phase
Consecutive day may grouped period week
Because number day whole number solar calendar must different number day different year
This may handled example adding extra day
The applies month lunar calendar also number month year lunisolar calendar
This generally known
Even calendar solar lunar year divided entirely month never vary length
Cultures may define unit time week purpose scheduling regular activity easily coincide month year
Many culture use different baseline calendar starting year
For example year based reign current emperor Year
An based ongoing observation example religious Islamic calendar old religious Jewish calendar time
Such calendar also referred calendar
The advantage calendar perfectly perpetually accurate
The disadvantage working particular date would occur difficult
An one based strict set rule example current Jewish calendar
Such calendar also referred calendar
The advantage calendar ease calculating particular date occurs
The disadvantage imperfect accuracy
Furthermore even calendar accurate accuracy diminishes slowly time owing change Earth rotation
This limit lifetime accurate arithmetic calendar thousand year
After rule would need modified observation made since invention calendar
Calendars may either complete incomplete
Complete calendar provide way naming consecutive day incomplete calendar
The early way designating day winter month lump together winter example incomplete calendar Gregorian calendar example complete calendar
The primary practical use calendar identify day informed agree future event record event happened
Days may significant agricultural civil religious social reason
For example calendar provides way determine start planting harvesting day day mark beginning end business accounting period day legal significance day tax due contract expires
Also calendar may identifying day provide useful information day season
Calendars also used help people manage personal schedule time activity particularly individual numerous work school family commitment
People frequently use multiple system may keep calendar help prevent overcommitting time
Calendars also used part complete system date time day together specify moment
In modern world timekeeper show time date weekday
The international standard used almost everywhere world civil purpose
It purely solar calendar cycle leap day cycle designed keep duration year aligned
Each Gregorian year either day leap day inserted February amounting average Gregorian year day compared solar year day
It introduced refinement use throughout European Middle Ages amounting correction length year
During Early Modern period however nation century became widely adopted worldwide sake convenience international trade
The last European country adopt reform Greece
The used Gregorian calendar inherited medieval convention established associated Julian calendar
The year number variously given AD CE indeed
The important use calendar keeping track observation religious feast day
While Gregorian calendar historically motivated relation calculation worldwide secular use standard
Alongside use Gregorian calendar secular matter remain number calendar use religious purpose
including use
The Hijri calendar consisting lunar month year day
It used date event Muslim country concurrently Gregorian calendar used Muslims everywhere determine proper day celebrate Islamic holy day festival
Its epoch corresponding AD With annual drift day seasonal relation repeated approximately Islamic year
Various remain use Indian subcontinent including used Northern India calendar state
The traditional lunisolar calendar also based older version Hindu calendar
Most Hindu calendar inherited system first enunciated Lagadha standardized subsequently reformed astronomer AD century century
The used worldwide religious cultural affair also influence civil matter Israel used business dealing dating
worldwide use
The calendar widely used religious social purpose
The used part
The Ethiopic calendar principal calendar used also use area
In neighboring alongside Gregorian Islamic calendar
In used month day adopted western standard although year still based traditional
A fiscal calendar generally mean accounting year government business
It used budgeting keeping account taxation
It set month may start date year
The US government fiscal year start October end September
The government India fiscal year start April end March
Small traditional business India start fiscal year festival end day next year Diwali festival
In accounting particularly accounting software fiscal calendar fix month specific number week facilitate comparison month month year year
January always exactly week Sunday Saturday February week March week etc
Note calendar normally need add week every year might added December might depending organization us date
There exists international standard way
The ISO week start Monday end Sunday
Week always week contains January Gregorian calendar
The term applies given scheme timekeeping also specific record device displaying scheme example form pocket calendar desktop calendar etc

In syntactic unit express action carried
A program written language formed sequence one statement
A statement may internal component
Many imperative language
make distinction statement definition statement containing executable code definition instantiating expression evaluates value
A distinction also made simple compound statement latter may contain statement component
The following major generic kind statement pseudocoded
These pseudocoded statement immediate corresponding syntax typical imperative language like Pascal C Fortran etc
The appearance statement shape look program
Programming language characterized type statement use
family
Many statement introduced like
Often statement reserved used name
Imperative language typically use special syntax statement look quite different function call
Common method describe syntax statement
Semantically many statement differ call handling
Usually actual subroutine parameter evaluated subroutine called
This contrast many statement parameter evaluated several time
condition
loop body loop
Technically statement parameter parameter
parameter evaluated needed see also
When parameter available statement like behaviour implemented subroutine see
For language without parameter semantic description usually beyond capability language
Therefore standard document often refer semantic description natural language
In language statement contrast statement return result executed solely expression always return result often side effect
Among imperative programming language one statement return result
In language mix imperative style family distinction expression statement made even expression executed sequential context solely side effect whose return value used considered
In statement everything expression
This distinction frequently observed wording statement expression
This found function found language Python found applied statement applied expression
Most language fixed set statement defined language experiment allow programmer define new statement

I searching web looking definition declarative imperative programming would shed light
However language used resource I found daunting instance
Does one real world example could show might bring perspective subject perhaps C
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
A great C example declarative imperative programming LINQ
With programming tell compiler want happen step step
For example let start collection choose odd number With imperative programming step decide want Here saying With programming hand write code describes want necessarily get declare desired result Here saying Give u everything odd Step collection
Check item odd add result collection
In many case code mixture design always
Declarative programming say want imperative language say get want
A simple example Python The first example declarative specify implementation detail building list
To tie C example generally using LINQ result declarative style saying obtain want saying want
You could say SQL
One benefit declarative programming allows compiler make decision might result better code might make hand
Running SQL example query like SQL compiler optimize query know indexed field maybe indexed case iterate entire data set anyway
Or maybe SQL engine know perfect time utilize core speedy parallel search
programmer concerned condition write code handle special case way
Declarative v
Imperative A fundamental style computer programming
There four main paradigm imperative declarative functional considered subset declarative paradigm
programming paradigm express logic computation What without describing control flow How
Some example declarative domain specific language DSLs include CSS regular expression subset SQL SELECT query example Many markup language HTML MXML XAML XSLT often declarative
The declarative programming try blur distinction program set instruction program assertion desired answer
programming paradigm describes computation term statement change program state
The declarative program dually viewed programming command mathematical assertion
Functional programming programming paradigm treat computation evaluation mathematical function avoids state mutable data
It emphasizes application function contrast imperative programming style emphasizes change state
In pure functional language Haskell function without side effect state change represented function transform state
The following example imperative programming loop number find even number
Both example yield result one neither better worse
The first example requires code code testable imperative approach give full control implementation detail
In second example code arguably readable however LINQ give control happens behind scene
You must trust LINQ provide requested result
I add another example rarely pop programming discussion User Interface
In C build UI using various technology
On imperative end could use DirectX OpenGL imperatively draw button checkboxes etc really triangle triangle
It say draw user interface
At declarative end WPF
You basically write XML yeah yeah XAML technically framework work
You say user interface look like
It system figure
Anyway another thing think
Just one language declarative imperative mean certain feature
Also one benefit declarative programming purpose usually easily understood reading code whereas imperative give finer control execution
The gist Declarative want done Imperative want done Imperative programming requires developer define step step code executed
To give direction imperative fashion say Street turn left onto Main drive two block turn right onto Maple stop third house The declarative version might sound something like One say something say need done
The declarative style two advantage imperative style Calvert C Kulkarni D
Essential LINQ
Addison Wesley

All answer online post mention following What told u
For part program declarative part must hide implementation detail code
In fact reason functional programming functional library declarative abstracted away loop list creation hiding implementation detail likely imperative code loop behind scene
In program always imperative declarative code aim hide code behind abstraction part program use
Finally although functional programming LINQ make program declarative always make even declarative providing abstraction
For example I liked explanation Cambridge course example In computer science declarative programming programming paradigm express logic computation without describing control flow
From nutshell declarative language simpler lack complexity control flow loop statement etc
A good comparison model
You declarative file imperative code file
I often find I I need declarative half script lot people follow done
Imperative programming telling computer explicitly like specifying order C Declarative tell computer really
Datalog Prolog first language come mind regard
Basically everything declarative
You ca really guarantee order
C much imperative programming language certain C feature declarative like Linq The thing could written imperatively example wikipedia Linq Stealing Two example Imperatively Declaratively Imperatively Declaratively Note imperative example involve creating new variable mutating returning new value make something happen whereas declarative example execute given input return new value based initial input want happen
The difference mostly overall level abstraction
With declarative point far away individual step program lot latitude regarding get result
You could look every piece instruction falling somewhere continuum Declarative Real World Example Imperative Real World Example Just add another example term mobile app development
In iOS Android Interface Builders define UI apps
The UI drawn using Builders declarative nature drag drop component
The actual draeing happens underneath performed framework system
But also draw whole component code imperative nature
Also new language like Angular JS focussing designing UIs declaratively may see lot language offering support
Like JAVA doesnot good declarative way draw native desktop apps JAVA swing JAVA FX near future might
A programming language requires programming discipline Java COBOL FORTRAN Perl JavaScript
Programmers writing language must develop proper order action order solve problem based knowledge data processing programming
A computer language require writing traditional programming logic Users concentrate defining input output rather program step required procedural programming language Java
Declarative programming example CSS HTML XML XSLT RegX
declarative program data universal imperative
plus specifying data hardcoded checked format simpler le specifying variant imperative algorithm directly
complex specification cant written directly DSL form
best freq used DSLs data structure set table
dependency
havent dependency freedom modify ease support
compare example module class module happy class fragile base class problem good declarativeness DSL follows immediately benefit data structure table set
another plus change implementation declarative language vm DSL abstract well designed
make parallel implementation example
port o etc
good specifed modular isolating interface protocol give freedom easyness support
minus guess right
generic parameterized DSL imperative implementation may slower memory hungry specific one
case
case rare forget let slow
frequient always extend case
somewhere slowing case sure
Frameworks DSL imperative
halfway solution combine deficiences benefit
safe AND fast look haskell halfway strong simple ML flexible metaprog Prolog monster
look Prolog Haskell
simple flexibility Haskell From understanding term root philosophy declarative imperative kind knowledge
Declarative knowledge assertion truth statement fact like math axiom
It tell something
Imperative procedural knowledge tell step step arrive something
That definition algorithm essentially
If would compare computer programming language English language
Declarative sentence state something
A boring example declarative way displaying whether two number equal Java Imperative sentence English hand give command make sort request
Imperative programming list command
Here imperative way displaying whether two number equal accepting user input Java Essentially declarative knowledge certain element form layer abstraction element
Declarative programming
I wonder one mentioned Attribute class declarative programming tool C
The popular answer page talked LINQ declarative programming tool
According Wikipedia Common declarative language include database query language SQL XQuery regular expression logic programming functional programming configuration management system
So LINQ functional syntax definitely declarative method Attribute class C configuration tool declarative

In us change program
In much way express command imperative program consists perform
Imperative programming focus describing program operates
The term often used contrast focus program accomplish without specifying program achieve result
type imperative programming program built one procedure also termed function
The term often used synonym use procedure dramatic effect imperative program appear constructed
programming change localized procedure restricted explicit argument return procedure form
From onwards structured programming general promoted technique improve overall quality imperative program
The concept behind attempt extend approach
Procedural programming could considered step towards declarative programming
A programmer often tell simply looking name argument return type procedure related comment particular procedure supposed without necessarily looking detail achieves result
At time complete program still imperative since statement executed order execution large extent
The hardware implementation almost computer imperative
Nearly computer hardware designed execute native computer written imperative style
From perspective program state defined content memory statement instruction native machine language computer
imperative language use complex statement still follow paradigm
process also familiar concept similar style imperative programming step instruction physical world hold state
Since basic idea imperative programming conceptually familiar directly embodied hardware computer language imperative style
imperative paradigm perform operation information located memory store result memory later use
imperative language addition permit complex may consist combination evaluation assignment resulting value memory
Looping statement allow sequence statement executed multiple time
Loops either execute statement contain predefined number time execute repeatedly condition change
statement allow sequence statement executed condition met
Otherwise statement skipped execution sequence continues statement following
Unconditional branching statement allow execution sequence transferred another part program
These include jump called many language subprogram procedure call usually return next statement call
Early development introduction enabled construction program group statement declaration could treated one statement
This alongside introduction enabled complex structure expressed hierarchical decomposition simpler procedural structure
Many imperative programming language
The earliest imperative language machine language original computer
In language instruction simple made hardware implementation easier hindered creation complex program
FORTRAN developed IBM starting first major programming language remove obstacle presented machine code creation complex program
FORTRAN allowed named variable complex expression subprogram many feature common imperative language
The next two decade saw development many major imperative programming language
In late developed order allow mathematical algorithm easily expressed even served target language computer
carried imperative paradigm logical extreme statement relying purely command even extent making IF ELSE command independent connected intrinsic variable named TEST
attempt make programming syntax look like English
In developed created working
Wirth went design

At point undoubtedly heard imperative programming v declarative programming
You might even searched term actually mean
Sadly probably encountered definition similar You know imperative programming like something declarative programming like That definition make perfect sense actually know difference imperative declarative asked question first place
It like trying answer What came first chicken egg except everyone seems think chicken even like egg confused
Combine frustration bastardization actual word declarative basically mean sudden imposter syndrome tap dancing confidence realize even like programming much
Don worry though friend
I know monad hopefully post help realize declarative easy reason The hard part topic observed It one thing intuition seem I talked many developer seems help combination metaphor actual code example
So buckle cause I preach
Let go back initial definition I made fun Imperative programming like How something declarative programming like What There actually SOME good information hidden
Let first see merit definition taking context programming look real life example
You decide spending much time arguing JavaScript Fatigue Reactive Functional Programming husband deserves nice date
You decide go Red Lobster since listening lot Beyonce lately

You arrive Red Lobster approach front desk I see table located Gone Fishin sign empty
My husband I going walk sit
Table two please
The imperative approach concerned HOW actually going get seat
You need list step able show HOW going get declarative approach concerned WHAT want table two
brain More metaphor
I going ask question
I want think imperative response declarative response
I
How I get house An imperative response Go north exit parking lot take left
Get south get Bangerter Highway exit
Take right exit like going Ikea
Go straight take right first light
Continue next light take next left
My house
A declarative response My address West Immutable Alley Draper Utah Regardless I get house really matter car I drive
Am I going drive stick shift car automatic car
Enough metaphor
Before dive code important realize many declarative approach sort imperative abstraction layer
Look example The declarative response Red Lobster employee assuming Red Lobster employee know imperative step get u table
Knowing address assumes sort GPS know imperative step get house
An automatic car sort abstraction layer shifting gear
That realization really made click I repeat Many declarative approach sort underlying imperative abstraction
If sentence make sense great
Now going attempt take leap metaphorical happy land real world code land
To make leap graceful let look programming language inherently declarative versus imperative nature
Imperative C Java Declarative SQL HTML Can Be Mix JavaScript C Python Think typical SQL HTML example By glancing example clear understanding going
They declarative
They concerned WHAT want done rather HOW want done
You describing trying achieve without instructing
The implementation selecting user live Mexico abstracted
You concerned web browser parsing displaying screen
Your WHAT website
So far good
Let dive practical JavaScript example
I want pretend technical interview I interviewer
Open console answer following question
Write function called take array number return new array doubling every item array
Write function called take array return result adding every item array
Using jQuery vanilla JavaScript add event handler element id
When clicked toggle add remove class well change text depending current state element
Let look common approach problem happen also imperative approach


By examining three imperative example common able better identify actually make imperative
The obvious commonality describing something
In example either explicitly iterating array explicitly laying step implement functionality want
This one might obvious used thinking even specifically way
In example mutating piece state If unfamiliar term state basically information something held memory sound lot like variable
In first two example create variable called result continually modify
In third example variable still state living DOM modify state DOM
This one bit subjective code readable
I glance code understand going
My brain need step code interpreter would also taking account context code life another negativity mutable data
All right enough code
Let take look declarative example
The goal fix problem
So example need describe happening mutate state readable glance



Much better Notice first two example leveraging JavaScript built method
This go back talking article declarative solution abstraction imperative implementation
In every example describing WHAT want happen rather HOW know HOW map reduce implemented also care
We mutating state
All mutation abstracted inside
It also readable get used course
Now
Well I cheated little bit using note three imperative mistake still fixed
The real beauty React create declarative user interface
By looking Btn component I able easily understand UI going look like
Another benefit instead state living DOM life React component
Another benefit declarative code program
This mean code concerned ultimate goal rather step take accomplish goal code used different program work fine
Look three example
We consume function component program want
They program agnostic
This hard imperative code often time definition imperative code relies context current state
One thing I go far functional programming subset declarative programming
If already I highly recommend getting familiar functional programming technique JavaScript
Start work way
Odds lower hanging fruit improve codebase making functional
Here definition I found internet may may helpful
Declarative programming act programming language conform mental model developer rather operational model machine
Declarative Programming programming declaration
declarative sentence
The declarative property exist one possible set statement express specific modular imperative property dual semantics inconsistent composition expressed variation set statement
Declarative language contrast imperative language procedural language specify explicit sequence step follow
In computer science declarative programming programming paradigm express logic computation without describing control flow

Directives take one several form everyday speech writing
A common us include Imperative sentence confused kind sentence
The trick look sentence constructed
Unlike declarative sentence subject verb clearly articulated imperative sentence readily identifiable subject written
The subject actually implied meaning verb refers directly back subject
In word speaker author assumes subject attention
John chore
Do chore
An imperative sentence typically begin end
However also end question mark instance
The difference question also called imperative sentence subject whether implied

Please open door would
At basic imperative sentence binary say must either positive negative
Positive imperative use affirmative verb addressing subject negative opposite
Keep hand steering wheel driving
Do operate lawn mower without wearing safety goggles
Adding word beginning sentence word please called sentence polite conversational

What following sentence common
All example
Imperative sentence request suggestion advice command
Imperative sentence often appear missing subject use verb begin sentence
In fact subject person listening audience
In word imperative sentence directed subject sentence
Our opening example sentence written positive format meaning verb affirmative
The encourages action directs something happen
The following sentence still imperative sentence instead indicating something happen desired
A negative could shortened simple statement Imagine instance conversation Person A I want give strawberry
Person B Do
I allergic
What pair imperative sentence common
Both use added end
These still imperative sentence end little extra emphasis form question
You likely hear conversation
Tag question added imperative sentence typical
Interrogative sentence ask question format request suggestion command imperative
Let look following interrogative versus imperative Get FREE access day create account
In addition tag question imperative sentence may involve formatting quirk
Consider following example This sentence add word even though meaning would understood without You could also modify negative This sentence famous quote attributed Patrick Henry us exclamation point express powerful emotion
The use way describing something speaker subject together
In word This still even though speaker including request
This version add word usually implied imperative sentence
This add imperative sentence sound forceful directed case
involve request suggestion advice command format frequently express subject
The subject typically listener audience receiving request
Imperative sentence either depending verb used
Formatting imperative sentence vary time
In case word included
Sometimes pin end sentence
Some sentence include additional verb others may even add exclamative element express passion said

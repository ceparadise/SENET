As extreme example several current machine run simple arithmetic kernel operand rated peak speed mean spending time idle waiting cache miss satisfied
The STREAM benchmark specifically designed work datasets much larger available cache given system result presumably indicative performance large vector style application
If want word I written paper STREAM A somewhat broader look issue see paper
STREAM also useful component model scaling homogeneous throughput workload like SPEC CPU rate benchmark
Examples model based STREAM measurement pretty good job estimating scaling included several
If possible compile code obsolete precompiled binary might work
Most old even run unlikely give good performance use old instruction set unlikely obey current STREAM array small given cache size current processor
There number version STREAM code code FORTRAN The recent version named shocking
I use STREAM uppercase name benchmark I prefer use uppercase file name I type often I left lowercase
In FORTRAN corresponding compilation either First need figure run code parallel
There several choice OpenMP pthreads MPI
Second need data cacheable
You add cache used processor going use
So uniprocessor machine cache like older PentiumIII example array need least element
This smaller standard test size element appropriate system MB cache
There relatively little difference performance different size size array becomes significantly larger cache size since difference typically associated TLB reach comparability I require result even small cache machine use million element whenever possible
This requires MB workable even MB machine
If size requirement problem interested submitting result system meet criterion discus issue
For automatically parallelized run example cpu MB cache problem size must increased least
This require lot memory
GB
If get much bigger need compile addressing
For system using extension instruction set need use pointer offset using compiler flag
Once N exceeds bit slightly billion need sure use integer
This automatically handled system I yet upgraded Fortran version ensure handle large case correctly
STREAM become useful important benchmark lot result available
Please help u keep rapidly changing market

In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within one process executing sharing resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share executable code value variable given time
Systems single processor generally implement multithreading CPU switch different
This generally happens often rapidly enough user perceive thread task running parallel
On system multiple thread execute every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously processor core separate software thread also executed concurrently separate hardware thread
Threads made early appearance MVT context called task
The term thread attributed
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Furthermore program threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort time slicing
Threads differ traditional operating system Systems said thread process operating system great difference except cost switch architecture notably result TLB flush
In one time
The opposite multithreading
While suggested term misleading term widely accepted within community
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context one process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied one process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread either cooperatively
On widely used approach finer grained control execution time via
However preemptive scheduling may context switch thread moment unanticipated programmer therefore causing
In contrast relies thread relinquish control execution thus ensuring thread
This create problem cooperatively multitasked thread waiting thread yielding control execution intensive computation
Until early desktop computer one CPU support although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
In added support processor name introduced processor introduced processor
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
Scheduling done kernel level user level multitasking done preemptively cooperatively
This yield variety related concept
At kernel level contains one share process resource memory file handle process unit resource thread unit scheduling execution
Kernel scheduling typically uniformly done preemptively le commonly cooperatively
At user level process schedule multiple thread execution
If share data Erlang usually analogously called process share data usually called particularly preemptively scheduled
Cooperatively scheduled user thread known different process may schedule user thread differently
User thread may executed kernel thread various way
The term variously refers user thread kernel mechanism scheduling user thread onto kernel thread
A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling creating destroying switching process relatively expensive
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory code data socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way see
Creating destroying process relatively expensive resource must acquired released
Processes typically preemptively multitasked process switching relatively expensive beyond basic cost due issue cache flushing
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including thus relatively cheap create destroy
Thread switching also relatively cheap requires context switch saving restoring register stack pointer change virtual memory thus leaving TLB valid
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor SMP system contend memory bus especially locking fine
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map one scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage used
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual processor
This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation support threading provide access native threading APIs operating system
Some usually programming language language expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
Several programming language language extension also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer fully MPI
Some language designed sequential parallelism instead especially using GPUs without requiring concurrency thread
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby Python support threading concurrency parallel execution thread due GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter simultaneously interpreting application code two thread effectively limit parallelism multiple core system
This limit performance mostly thread require processor much one
Other implementation interpreted programming language using Thread extension avoid GIL limit using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation Pthreads set library call
OS vendor free implement interface desired application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface multithreading like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
Multithreading library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free multithreading function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage set number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed array thread run parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel use GPU architecture


decade two ago wire heading home quaint way chat family friend could speak person
The basic idea changed much since Alexander Graham Bell others pioneered telephone technology
But century people started see telephone line different way connection piping music downloads YouTube video news well telephone home hour day
way playing file download central part information revolution
What exactly work
Let take closer look
If picture worth thousand word moving picture worth million
But cram information telephone
The trouble couple basic technology behind home phone ordinarily carry information quickly enough bring thing like home
If ever watched chugging along sending receiving printed document grindingly slow speed know slow telephone line carrying anything voice job ever designed
In day people Internet connection make connection Internet Service Provider using enable essentially normal telephone call slow speed major limitation could done online
If wanted listen music track typically megabyte size could spend half hour waiting entire file download onto hard drive open play back
Video file likely megabyte would take several hour download way generally available Net
In day impossible listen music movie file size without long tedious wait
The problem essentially matter speed Internet connection quickly download information set limit quickly transfer file
In early day Web Rob Glaser Real company originally called Progressive Networks pioneered streaming medium solution problem
The basic idea simple
Suppose want watch large video file
You install program computer play file downloads
So downloads maybe first second file store immediately start play
As medium player start playing first part file also downloading next second ready come bit
The medium player never actually store little bit entire file played part file deletes make way next bit
If medium player download file fast watching listening see interruption delay downloading reason occasional pause player downloads buffer next bit file
Before go need know Internet work
computerized information move efficiently across Internet broken little bit known
Each packet independently addressed travel separately different packet travel different route
Imagine wanting send really heavy textbook friend another country
Instead sending entire book tear separate page put one envelope separate stamp address mail envelope one another
Your friend may receive slightly different time wrong order easily reassemble book
Why would mail book odd way
It turn Internet work best way everything broken small chunk
We whole article explains detail
When download file traditional way effectively asking another computer sends file many different people send zillion packet one another wait arrive anything
With streaming start use packet soon enough arrived
That essential difference
You think streaming playing downloading fact two thing different sort way Most Internet radio station use genuine streaming downloading playing simultaneously program like RealPlayer Apple QuickTime Microsoft Windows Media Player three rival type streaming
With broadband connection enjoy audio quality far quality get downloaded file though discus article never quite good get
As Internet connection become faster people broadband become possible watch video TV program way though unless stream high definition really fast broadband line quality still far short get watching TV DVD
one reason online movie story still sometimes use downloads instead streaming
Not website stream video work streaming
Some including YouTube actually use alternative approach called streaming like cross conventional downloading streaming
A large chunk sometimes file watching downloads web browser internal working memory buffer browser play simultaneously
Unlike truly streamed video always skip forward generally wait file download point want see
Another key difference file remains browser cache even finished watching
You tell website working progressive downloading video window show two separate indicator progress bar like one one show much file downloaded show much played
Typically progressive downloading us Macromedia Flash file SWF FLV extension served conventional web server played Flash plugin installed browser
It popular often quicker easier implement genuine streaming
The artwork taken Rob Glaser original patent show streaming medium originally designed work
The figure left show sound packaged sent digital data computer purple box bottom one right show computer receives unpacks turn data back sound
Let look two step transmission reception bit depth
Live recorded sound red box made continuously varying sound wave
So transmitting end first step convert wave digital data using converter green
If source sound digital begin miss step
Next digital data compressed orange percent original patent quote figure transmitted quickly
The compressed digital data stored light blue progressively transmitted server dark blue Internet yellow PC purple
Of course reason lot program ca compressed stored indefinitely library streamed whenever people want listen watch forget Real Player originally designed could stream thing like live radio show transmitted studio
It also worth noting original version Real Player shown designed able send audio across grindingly slow dialup Internet connection slow Kbps modern streaming send video connection hundred time faster work essentially way
Inside PC similar process run reverse turn digital data receive back sound
Packets data received phone line Internet yellow stored buffer small bit DRAM memory blue
The buffer designed full data possible empty audio transmitted fast enough risk audio playback interrupted see annoying Buffering message
The data buffer decoded decompressed orange passed wave driver sound card light gray generates stream audio still digital format
A converter turn stream analog signal power loudspeaker hopefully recreating faithful version original sound red
Garbage garbage go old saying computer business
So data transmitting server get corrupted wo hear poor quality audio loudspeaker
The sending receiving data use ensure data received data transmitted
Streaming music video seem advanced compared kind technology people year ago still relatively primitive
The audio video information download compressed dramatically substantially reduced quality make smaller file downloads reasonable amount time
Most streaming video still quite small pixelated full obvious square block play something like YouTube
That even today best broadband connection fast enough download huge amount information fullscreen TV picture
In year time broadband connection many time faster possible stream video Net
Then age really arrived

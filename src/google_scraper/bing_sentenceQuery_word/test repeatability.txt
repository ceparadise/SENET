From build note seems trouble set Postgres environment
Code run dependently another system unfortunately hard get built
I glad eventually got
But code release realistic research publication
Thus also published virtual machine everything built
A verification author code compiles run print expected output interesting convincing test scientific reproducibility
A better test reproducibility publication result would independently implement measure algorithm system described
This would unlikely replicate bug systematic measurement error increasing meaningfulness positive reproducibility result
Negative result would also likely provide technical insight foster scientific discussion
Note publishing code also rather thankless task
Likely outcome include Nobody look wasted time

If conducting important experiment want measurement tool accurate precise
Accuracy refers close individual measurement known standard
For example use balance mass object know gram accurate balance read gram close
Precision close two measurement one another
A precise balance give similar reading used mass object several time
Repeatability like precision number reflects similarity closeness several measurement object made tool
Repeatability defined standard deviation individual measurement
Suppose want determine repeatability balance measurement object
You use balance mass object five time get following measurement gram The first step calculating repeatability find average mean measurement
To add measurement together divide sum number measurement
Find difference average individual measurement square difference
Add squared difference together divide sum one le number measurement
Finally find square root previous answer
square root The repeatability measurement
This mean using particular balance expect majority measurement object within gram actual mass

In general scientist perform experiment several time order confirm finding
These finding may show variation
In context experiment repeatability measure variation measurement taken single instrument person condition reproducibility measure whether entire study experiment reproduced entirety
Within scientific write ups reproducibility repeatability often reported standard deviation
The article discus scientist researcher establish repeatability reproducibility detail
Repeatability practice introduced scientist Bland Altman
For repeatability established following condition must place location measurement procedure observer measuring instrument used condition repetition short period time
What known repeatability coefficient measurement precision denotes absolute difference pair repeated test result
Reproducibility hand refers degree agreement result experiment conducted different individual different location different instrument
Put simply measure ability replicate finding others
Through extensive research controlled test program able determine reproducibility
The article discus challenge related reproducibility detail
We also use repeatability reliability measure difference lack correlation

taken single person item condition short period time
A reliability cause
Such variability caused example
A measurement may said variation smaller acceptance criterion
variability practically used example condition
In situation often predetermined critical difference difference monitored value smaller critical difference possibility variability sole cause difference may considered addition example change disease treatment
According following condition need fulfilled establishment repeatability Repeatability method developed Bland Altman
If separate administration test high
higher good reliability
The repeatability coefficient precision measure represents value two repeated test result may expected lie probability
The repeatability condition part
An attribute agreement analysis designed simultaneously evaluate impact repeatability accuracy
It allows analyst examine response multiple reviewer look several scenario multiple time
It produce statistic evaluate ability appraiser agree repeatability known master correct value overall accuracy characteristic
Because test administered twice every test parallel difference score test score retest due solely measurement error
This sort argument quite probably true many physical measurement
However argument often inappropriate psychological measurement often impossible consider second administration test parallel measure first
The second administration psychological test might yield systematically different score first administration due following reason

ability get research result using raw data computer program provided researcher
A related concept replicability meaning ability independently achieve similar conclusion difference sampling research procedure data analysis method may exist
Reproducibility replicability together among main principle
The value obtained distinct experimental trial said obtained according reproducible experimental description procedure
The basic idea seen dictum scientific knowledge word used Greek connotation wholly isolated occurrence
Thus knowledge science necessarily involves formation general concept invocation corresponding symbol language cf
Turner
conception knowledge individual considered unscientific due lack field time could appeal statistical averaging individual
A particular experimentally obtained value said reproducible high degree agreement observation conducted specimen different location different experimental value found high
However science well reproduced result one confirmed using many experimental setup possible many line evidence possible
The first stress importance reproducibility science Irish chemist England century
Boyle designed generate study time controversial concept
Indeed distinguished philosopher denied possibility vacuum existence

book describe debate Boyle Hobbes ostensibly nature vacuum fundamentally argument useful knowledge gained
Boyle pioneer maintained foundation knowledge constituted experimentally produced fact made believable scientific community reproducibility
By repeating experiment Boyle argued certainty fact emerge
The air pump century complicated expensive apparatus build also led one first documented dispute reproducibility particular scientific phenomenon
In Dutch scientist built air pump first one outside direct management Boyle assistant time
Huygens reported effect termed anomalous suspension water appeared levitate glass jar inside air pump fact suspended air bubble Boyle Hooke could replicate phenomenon pump
As Shapin Schaffer describe became clear unless phenomenon could produced England one two pump available one England would accept claim Huygens made competence working pump
Huygens finally invited England personal guidance Hooke able replicate anomalous suspension water
Following Huygens elected Foreign Member
However Shapin Schaffer also note accomplishment replication dependent contingent act judgment
One write formula saying replication achieved
The noted briefly famous book single occurrence significance science
The wrote book set foundation modern scientific practice may say phenomenon experimentally demonstrable know conduct experiment rarely fail give u statistically significant result
Such assertion express common modern science reproducibility necessary condition although necessarily establishing scientific fact practice establishing scientific authority field knowledge
However noted Shapin Schaffer dogma quantitatively statistical significance instance therefore explicitly established many time must fact replicated considered reproducible
Reproducibility one component precision measurement test method
The component degree agreement test measurement replicate specimen observer laboratory
Both repeatability reproducibility usually reported
A reproducibility limit value difference two test result obtained reproducibility condition may expected occur probability approximately
Reproducibility determined controlled interlaboratory test program
Although often confused important distinction replicates independent repetition experiment
Replicates performed within experiment
They provide independent evidence reproducibility
Rather serve internal check experiment shown part experimental result within scientific publication
It independent repetition experiment serf underpin reproducibility The term refers idea ultimate product paper along laboratory notebook full computational environment used produce result paper code data etc
used reproduce result create new work based research
Psychology seen renewal internal concern irreproducible result
Researchers showed study author publication American Psychology Association APA empirical article respond data period
In follow study published found contacted author paper APA journal share data upon request
In paper suggested researcher publish data along work dataset released alongside demonstration suggested article published may sufficient whole analysis context disclosed
In Psychology became first discipline conduct publish open registered empirical study reproducibility called
researcher around world collaborated replicate empirical study three top Psychology journal
Fewer half attempted replication successful
There initiative improve reporting hence reproducibility medical literature many year began initiative part wider initiative
This group recently turned attention better reporting might reduce waste research especially biomedical research
Reproducible research key new discovery
A Phase I discovery followed Phase II reproduction drug develops towards commercial production
In recent decade Phase II success fallen
A study found medical study inconsistent completely reproducible
In study Begley Ellis published reviewed decade research
That study found medical research paper focused cancer research irreproducible
The irreproducible study number feature common including study performed investigator blinded experimental versus control arm failure repeat experiment lack positive negative control failure show data inappropriate use statistical test use reagent appropriately validated
writes While currently unilateral emphasis discovery much emphasis replication discovery
The study reproduced journal confirmed majority cancer researcher surveyed unable reproduce result
In conducted survey researcher took brief online questionnaire reproducibility research
According survey researcher tried failed reproduce another scientist experiment half failed reproduce experiment
Although surveyed agree significant reproducibility le think failure reproduce published result mean result probably wrong say still trust published literature
became famous correctly identifying bacterial agent also claimed could culture agent laboratory
Nobody else able produce latter result
In March chemist Stanley Pons Martin Fleischmann reported production excess heat could explained nuclear process
The report astounding given simplicity equipment essentially cell containing rapidly absorbed produced electrolysis
The news medium reported experiment widely item many newspaper around world see
Over next several month others tried replicate experiment unsuccessful
claimed early used high frequency current light lamp mile km away
In built demonstrate mean send receive power without connecting wire
The facility never fully operational completed due economic problem attempt reproduce first result ever carried
Other example contrary evidence refuted original claim The reproducibility requirement applied individual sample phenomenon partially totally nature
However still applies probabilistic description phenomenon error tolerance given probability theory

Page Data obtained taking measurement lead explanation material different property
During experiment factor could affect outcome need controlled
Many people may idea material different property opinion useful supported data
To justify explanation need data support
This data may obtained taking measurement
The table show length sample one type rubber stretched break The measurement depends quality measuring apparatus skill scientist taking measurement
If apparatus faulty scientist make mistake measurement may inaccurate
For data variation within value must small
There always variation set measurement whatever measured
There may small difference composition rubber way measuring apparatus used
In set data measurement slightly different others
The result repeatable meaning time measurement taken approximately value
We say set data reliable

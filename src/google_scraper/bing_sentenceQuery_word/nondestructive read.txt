The field Nondestructive Testing NDT broad interdisciplinary field play critical role assuring structural component system perform function reliable cost effective fashion
NDT technician engineer define implement test locate characterize material condition flaw might otherwise cause plane crash reactor fail train derail pipeline burst variety le visible equally troubling event
These test performed manner affect future usefulness object material
In word NDT allows part material inspected measured without damaging
Because allows inspection without interfering product final use NDT provides excellent balance quality control
Generally speaking NDT applies industrial inspection
The technology used NDT similar used medical industry nonliving object subject inspection
Nondestructive evaluation NDE term often used interchangeably NDT
However technically NDE used describe measurement quantitative nature
For example NDE method would locate defect would also used measure something defect size shape orientation
NDE may used determine material property fracture toughness formability physical characteristic
The basic NDT method visual examination
Visual examiner follow procedure range simply looking part see surface imperfection visible using computer controlled camera system automatically recognize measure feature component
RT involves using penetrating material product look defect examine internal hidden feature
An generator radioactive isotope used source radiation
Radiation directed part onto film detector
The resulting shadowgraph show internal feature soundness part
Material thickness density change indicated lighter darker area film detector
The darker area radiograph represent internal void component
This NDT method accomplished inducing magnetic field ferromagnetic material dusting surface iron particle either dry suspended liquid
Surface flaw disrupt flow magnetic field within part force field leak surface
Iron particle attracted concentrated site magnetic flux leakage
This produce visible indication defect surface material
The image demonstrate component inspection using dry magnetic particle
In ultrasonic testing sound wave transmitted material detect imperfection locate change material property
The commonly used ultrasonic testing technique pulse echo whereby sound introduced test object reflection echo internal imperfection part geometrical surface returned receiver
Below example shear wave weld inspection
Notice indication extending upper limit screen
This indication produced sound reflected defect within weld
With testing method test object coated solution contains visible fluorescent dye
Excess solution removed surface object left surface breaking defect
A developer applied draw penetrant defect
With fluorescent dye ultraviolet light used make bleedout fluoresce brightly thus allowing imperfection readily seen
With visible dye vivid color contrast penetrant developer make bleedout easy see
The red indication image represent defect component
There number electromagnetic testing method focus eddy current testing
In eddy current testing electrical current eddy current generated conductive material changing magnetic field
The strength eddy current measured
Material defect cause interruption flow eddy current alert inspector presence defect change material
Eddy current also affected electrical conductivity magnetic permeability material make possible sort material based property
The technician image inspecting aircraft wing defect
Several technique used detect locate leak pressure containment part pressure vessel structure
Leaks detected using electronic listening device pressure gauge measurement liquid gas penetrant technique simple test
When solid material stressed imperfection within material emit short burst acoustic energy called emission
As ultrasonic testing acoustic emission detected special receiver
Emission source evaluated study intensity arrival time collect information location source energy

Do use computer
I think question use rather many computer use
The computer phone reading computer use work school computer car computer go making favorite movie favorite website computer used hospital medical research
Computers part everyday life
We expect student graduate high school know read write staple good education
Reading writing skill use every day foundational skill
By foundational skill I mean skill enable lot thing done
You learn read become professional reader professional writer use reading writing every day
In true coding
We use computer technology every day need use problem solving logical process learn learn coding
Coding let creator technological world first stepping stone make website app company
Rewind hundred year
Literacy privilege reserved invention printing press later Industrial Revolution made paper book affordable helped increase literacy
Literacy still skill open many door lack access made opportunity unavailable people
The parallel coding education today uncanny
A major problem computer science education today Access several component including access technology access resource access instruction support
The new technological revolution made computer internet affordable help increase technological literacy
Affordable increased access paper book paved way reading writing literacy today affordable increased access computer internet paving way revolution coding literacy
If look high school offer computer science class find top school
And reason top school computer science rushing create course seeing future
Take look
There strong correlation educational opportunity quality life
Taking away educational access technique used stifle development country
Coding literacy next frontier
We see greater development opportunity country embrace coding literacy
There many reason political leader celebrity move computer science education
State state seeing unheard bipartisan support change legislation around computer science education
Here main reason
Advocating computer science education foundational skill mean everyone professional programmer
In vein advocating reading writing literacy mean need professional mean need know read write whether responding email working client
Take look industry find revolutionized computer
Computers enabling communication research advance simply possible without
I hear astounding application technology daily
There software whatever might writing lot software using software future

The list go across every industry imagine
One critical skill learn learn code
Debugging step step process go discover fix problem code
It requires creating hypothesis testing hypothesis using logical thinking fix something broken
This skill go date useful ever
Learning coding learning debugging move thinking This broken How I fix Debugging programming demystify technology reason thing built might build
With computer ability create software build project apply interest
The barrier entry low
Computer science definition skill theoretical applied
No longer question How I use student walk classroom building game app website envisioned
The question rather How I build Coding help reinvigorate subject school teacher finding creative way use coding additional medium teach math science art
Students run biology chemistry simulation apply algebra concept
While programming skill promotes encourages logical thinking also encourages creativity
The analogy blank canvas apropos blank code editor command create build share art
You manipulate sound image create new interactive experience
The future written code
It
If look current state thing trend see computer science growing importance
There soon job computer science related field United States filled since educating student enough
You add computer science highest paid college degree appealing skillset get great job even without degree
Contrast status school computer science education
The latest stats US high school taught AP Computer Science class difference student taking AP Computer Science AP US History
In state student access class
You heard first
Or first hearing another source prediction
When I talk future education online education I like say
There much great material online help teach anything
But student going
This mean want student get computer science education high school make shift thinking require
The legislation moving
And Arkansas required state requiring
If inspired learn head sign learn
If teacher student contact u hello help bring class school
We offer curriculum course well great teacher tool
You follow twitter
Jeremy Keeshin CodeHS program teaching coding beginner focus working high school
You get started today sign school
By clapping le signal u story really stand

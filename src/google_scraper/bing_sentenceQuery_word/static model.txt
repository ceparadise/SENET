There confusion
Let clear
An array static data structure size set moment created ever change
If want array make whole new one copy content old one new one
This expensive operation cause object hold reference original array lose entirely
You also insert value easily beginning populated array
It bit like arriving late theatre trying sit aisle seat
If seat occupied insert another seat
Everyone would get move along seat create space
The opposite static data structure dynamic data structure
An example dynamic data structure linked list
Since linked list us object reference give illusion list item next easy add item end list even insert middle
There good example linked list
Trains go way explaining work miss crucial point item logically next list physically next memory
Now static another meaning talking array static data structure I want say array static data structure
Do say array static could ambiguous see
Remember difference class object
Student class create many object like
So Akhi Amanullah object type Student
As Ethan Fleming Jun Park
Normally give class attribute field variable get copy attribute
Hence student object mentioned name height subject etc
However declare variable method static one whole class one object created class
That mean static variable get new value instance class see new value
Indeed even instance use static variable
That class variable object variable
Static variable often used store information true object class never change like constant
They accessed using dot notation name class
Java value pi
Math class I instantiate using PI variable
That PI variable declared static
The problem student programmer static arises fact entry point program Java main method declared static
Of course least one method declared static otherwise would instantiate object could ever even run line code since instantiating object IS running line code stuck
So immediately start running program Java call static context
If try access variable run method declared static problem shown The error get method woof referenced static context
We tried call woof method without created Dog object
So I create Dog object right
You get exactly error method woof referenced static context
The problem specified dog woof method call
Here code work This work called longer static context
That mean calling method belongs object instead trying call method belongs whole class
Another strategy get round problem always separate class contains main method class model object program
Notice left static context immediately problem later
Finally lazy way getting round problem associated static declare EVERYTHING static
If find either lazy b using language
Looks fine

All I know term vocabulary dynamic mean runtime
But Dynamic Static
According dictionary dynamic something keep changing Happen runtime equal Something keep changing
I see point people using dynamic mean Happen runtime
Dynamic linking program dynamically linked number shared library modify library main program provided change interface
So yes library might keep changing
An example upgrade Linux typically get new version many system library

A description using concept
The process developing mathematical model termed
Mathematical model used discipline well
analyst use mathematical model extensively
A model may help explain system study effect different component make prediction behaviour
Mathematical model take many form including
These type model overlap given model involving variety abstract structure
In general mathematical model may include
In many case quality scientific field depends well mathematical model developed theoretical side agree result repeatable experiment
Lack agreement theoretical mathematical model experimental measurement often lead important advance better theory developed
In traditional mathematical model contains four major element
These Mathematical model usually composed relationship
Relationships described algebraic operator function differential operator etc
Variables abstraction system interest
Several classification criterion used mathematical model according structure Mathematical model great importance natural science particularly
Physical almost invariably expressed using mathematical model
Throughout history accurate mathematical model developed
accurately describe many everyday phenomenon certain limit must used even apply situation need refinement
It possible obtain le accurate model appropriate limit example relativistic mechanic reduces Newtonian mechanic speed much le
Quantum mechanic reduces classical physic quantum number high
For example tennis ball insignificantly small classical physic good approximation use case
It common use idealized model physic simplify thing
Massless rope point particle among many simplified model used physic
The law physic represented simple equation Newton law
These law basis making mathematical model real situation
Many real situation complex thus modeled approximate computer model computationally feasible compute made basic law approximate model made basic law
For example molecule modeled model approximate solution Schrödinger equation
In physic model often made mathematical method
Different mathematical model use different geometry necessarily accurate description geometry universe
much used classical physic example theory use Euclidean
Since simple model used
Often engineer analyze system controlled optimized use mathematical model
In analysis engineer build descriptive model system hypothesis system could work try estimate unforeseeable event could affect system
Similarly control system engineer try different control approach
A mathematical model usually describes system variable set equation establish relationship variable
Variables may many type number value example
The variable represent property system example measured system output often form counter event occurrence
The actual model set function describe relation different variable
In mathematical model may used maximize certain output
The system consideration require certain input
The system relating input output depends variable variable
Decision variable sometimes known independent variable
Exogenous variable sometimes known
The variable independent state variable dependent decision input random exogenous variable
Furthermore output variable dependent state system represented state variable
system user represented output variable state variable
The depend perspective model user
Depending context objective function also known measure interest user
Although limit number objective function constraint model using optimizing model becomes involved computationally number increase
For example often apply using
Complicated mathematical model many variable may consolidated use one symbol represents several variable
Mathematical modeling problem often classified model according much information system available
A model system priori information available
A model also called glass box clear box system necessary information available
Practically system somewhere model concept useful intuitive guide deciding approach take
Usually preferable use much priori information possible make model accurate
Therefore model usually considered easier used information correctly model behave correctly
Often priori information come form knowing type function relating different variable
For example make model medicine work human system know usually amount medicine blood function
But still left several unknown parameter rapidly medicine amount decay initial amount medicine blood
This example therefore completely model
These parameter estimated mean one use model
In model one try estimate functional form relation variable numerical parameter function
Using priori information could end example set function probably could describe system adequately
If priori information would try use function general possible cover different model
An often used approach model usually make assumption incoming data
Alternatively NARMAX Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model eXogenous input algorithm developed part used select model term determine model structure estimate unknown parameter presence correlated nonlinear noise
The advantage NARMAX model compared neural network NARMAX produce model written related underlying process whereas neural network produce approximation opaque
Sometimes useful incorporate subjective information mathematical model
This done based based convenience mathematical form
provides theoretical framework incorporating subjectivity rigorous analysis specify subjective update distribution based empirical data
An example approach would necessary situation experimenter bend coin slightly toss recording whether come head given task predicting probability next flip come head
After bending coin true probability coin come head unknown experimenter would need make decision perhaps looking shape coin prior distribution use
Incorporation subjective information might important get accurate estimate probability
In general model complexity involves simplicity accuracy model
principle particularly relevant modeling essential idea among model roughly equal predictive power simplest one desirable
While added complexity usually improves realism model make model difficult understand analyze also pose computational problem including
argues science progress explanation tend become complex offer radical simplification
For example modeling flight aircraft could embed mechanical part aircraft model would thus acquire almost model system
However computational cost adding huge amount detail would effectively inhibit usage model
Additionally uncertainty would increase due overly complex system separate part induces amount variance model
It therefore usually appropriate make approximation reduce model sensible size
Engineers often accept approximation order get robust simple model
For example approximated model real world
Still Newton model quite sufficient situation long particle speed well study
Any model pure contains used fit model system intended describe
If modeling done optimization parameter called optimization model hyperparameters called often us
In conventional modeling explicitly given mathematical function parameter often determined
A crucial part modeling process evaluation whether given mathematical model describes system accurately
This question difficult answer involves several different type evaluation
Usually easiest part model evaluation checking whether model fit experimental measurement empirical data
In model parameter common approach test fit split data two disjoint subset training data verification data
The training data used estimate model parameter
An accurate model closely match verification data even though data used set model parameter
This practice referred statistic
Defining measure distance observed predicted data useful tool assessing model fit
In statistic decision theory play similar role
While rather straightforward test appropriateness parameter difficult test validity general mathematical form model
In general mathematical tool developed test fit model involving
Tools sometimes used evaluate well data fit known distribution come general model make minimal assumption model mathematical form
Assessing scope model determining situation model applicable le straightforward
If model constructed based set data one must determine system situation known data typical set data
The question whether model describes well property system data point called question event data point outside observed data called
As example typical limitation scope model evaluating Newtonian note Newton made measurement without advanced equipment could measure property particle travelling speed close speed light
Likewise measure movement molecule small particle macro particle
It surprising model extrapolate well domain even though model quite sufficient ordinary life physic
Many type modeling implicitly involve claim
This usually always true model involving differential equation
As purpose modeling increase understanding world validity model rest fit empirical observation also ability extrapolate situation data beyond originally described model
One think differentiation qualitative quantitative prediction
One also argue model worthless unless provides insight go beyond already known direct investigation phenomenon studied
An example criticism argument mathematical model offer insight go beyond conclusion basic principle ecology
Σ δ The state represents even number input far signifies odd number
A input change state automaton
When input end state show whether input contained even number
If input contain even number finish state accepting state input string accepted
The language recognized given denotes number possibly zero symbol

Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville shown
It perform trillion calculation per second
That ability help run computer model complex dynamic system Earth changing climate
Computers use math data computer instruction create representation event
They also predict happening could happen complex situation climate system spread rumor throughout town
And computer spit result without people wait year take big risk
The scientist build computer model start important feature whatever event hope represent
Those feature may weight football someone kick
Or might degree cloud cover typical region seasonal climate
Features change vary known
Next computer modeler identify rule control feature relationship
The researcher express rule math
The math built model rather simple mostly addition subtraction multiplication logarithm note Jon Lizaso
He work Technical University Madrid Spain
Logarithms express number power number help simplify calculation working big number
Even still much work one person
We talking probably thousand equation explains
mathematical expression use number relate two thing equal
But usually look complicated x z Solving even equation might take whole day rate one equation every second
And single mistake might throw answer way
More difficult math might bump time needed solve equation average minute
At rate solving equation could take nearly three week took time eat sleep
And one mistake might throw everything
In contrast common laptop computer perform billion operation per second
And one second Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory Tennessee trillion calculation
How much trillion
That many second would come million year
A computer model also need algorithm data
set instruction
They tell computer make decision calculation
Data fact statistic something
With calculation computer model make prediction specific situation
For instance might show simulate result particular football player kick
Computer model also deal dynamic situation changing variable
For example likely rain Friday
A weather model would run calculation changing factor one one various combination
After would compare finding run
After adjusting likely factor would issue prediction
The model would also rerun calculation Friday got closer
To measure model reliability scientist might computer run calculation thousand even million time
Researchers also could compare model prediction answer already know
If prediction closely match answer good sign
If researcher must work find missed
It could include enough variable relied much wrong one
Computer modeling deal
Scientists always learning experiment event real world
Researchers use knowledge improve computer model
The better computer model useful become
A group rule procedure solving problem series step
Algorithms used mathematics computer program figuring solution
The weather condition prevailing area general long period
An electronic device process information based rule stored device
A program run computer creates model simulation feature phenomenon event
A set instruction computer us perform analysis computation
The writing instruction known Facts statistic collected together analysis necessarily organized way give meaning
For digital information type stored computer data typically number stored binary code portrayed string zero one
In mathematics statement two quantity equal
In geometry equation often used determine shape curve surface
The power exponent one base number must multiplied produce another number
For instance base system must multiplied produce
So logarithm base system
In base logarithm would would
computing To try imitate condition function appearance something

mathematics A letter used mathematical expression may take one different value
experiment A factor changed especially one allowed change scientific experiment
For instance measuring much insecticide might take kill fly researcher might change dose age insect exposed
Both dose age would variable experiment

Computer science often difficult define
This probably due unfortunate use word computer name
As perhaps aware computer science simply study computer
Although computer play important supporting role tool discipline
Computer science study problem solution come process
Given problem computer scientist goal develop list instruction solving instance problem might arise
Algorithms finite process followed solve problem
Algorithms solution
Computer science thought study algorithm
However must careful include fact problem may solution
Although proving statement beyond scope text fact problem solved important study computer science
We fully define computer science including type problem stating computer science study solution problem well study problem solution
It also common include word describing problem solution
We say problem computable algorithm exists solving
An alternative definition computer science say computer science study problem computable study existence nonexistence algorithm
In case note word computer come
Solutions considered independent machine
Computer science pertains process also study
Abstraction allows u view problem solution way separate logical physical perspective
The basic idea familiar u common example
Consider automobile may driven school work today
As driver user car certain interaction take place order utilize car intended purpose
You get insert key start car shift brake accelerate steer order drive
From abstraction point view say seeing logical perspective automobile
You using function provided car designer purpose transporting one location another
These function sometimes also referred
On hand mechanic must repair automobile take different point view
She know drive must know detail necessary carry function take granted
She need understand engine work transmission shift gear temperature controlled
This known physical perspective detail take place The thing happens use computer
Most people use computer write document send receive email surf web play music store image play game without knowledge detail take place allow type application work
They view computer logical user perspective
Computer scientist programmer technology support staff system administrator take different view computer
They must know detail operating system work network protocol configured code various script control function
They must able control detail user simply assumes
The common point example user abstraction sometimes also called client need know detail long user aware way interface work
This interface way user communicate underlying complexity implementation
As another example abstraction consider Python module
Once import module perform computation This example
We necessarily know square root calculated know function called use
If perform import correctly assume function provide u correct result
We know someone implemented solution square root problem need know use
This sometimes referred black box view process
We simply describe interface name function needed parameter returned

Models central importance many scientific context
The centrality model billiard ball model gas Bohr model atom MIT bag model nucleon model polymer Lorenz model atmosphere model interaction double helix model DNA evolutionary model social science general equilibrium model market respective domain case point
Scientists spend great deal time building testing comparing revising model much journal space dedicated introducing applying interpreting valuable tool
In short model one principal instrument modern science
Philosophers acknowledging importance model increasing attention probing assorted role model play scientific practice
The result incredible proliferation philosophical literature
Probing model phenomenological model computational model developmental model explanatory model impoverished model testing model idealized model theoretical model scale model heuristic model caricature model didactic model fantasy model toy model imaginary model mathematical model substitute model iconic model formal model analogue model instrumental model notion used categorize model
While first glance abundance overwhelming quickly brought control recognizing notion pertain different problem arise connection model
For example model raise question semantics representational function model perform
ontology kind thing model
epistemology learn model
course general philosophy science model relate theory
implication model based approach science debate scientific realism reductionism explanation law nature
Models perform two fundamentally different representational function
On one hand model representation selected part world target system
Depending nature target model either model phenomenon model data
On hand model represent theory sense interprets law axiom theory
These two notion mutually exclusive scientific model representation sens time
Many scientific model represent phenomenon phenomenon used umbrella term covering relatively stable general feature world interesting scientific point view
Empiricists like van Fraassen allow observables qualify realist like Bogen Woodward impose restriction
The billiard ball model gas Bohr model atom double helix model DNA scale model bridge model open economy Lorenz model atmosphere example model kind
A first step towards discussion issue scientific representation realize thing problem scientific representation
Rather different related problem
It yet clear specific set question theory representation come term whatever list question one might put agenda theory scientific representation two problem occupy center stage discussion Frigg
The first problem explain virtue model representation something else
To appreciate thrust question anticipate position regard ontology model discus next section
It common construe model entity rather description
This approach consequence
If understand model description question would reduced problem language relates reality would problem already discussed philosophy language
However understand model entity faced new question object word sentence scientifically represent phenomenon
Somewhat surprisingly recently question attracted much attention twentieth century philosophy science despite fact corresponding problem philosophy mind aesthetic discussed extensively decade substantial body literature dealing question mean mental state represent certain state affair question configuration flat mark canvas depict something beyond canvas puzzled aesthetician long time
However recent publication address closely related problem Contessa Elgin Frigg Knuuttila Morrison Giere Suárez Suárez Solé Toon van Fraassen others dismiss Callender Cohen Teller
The second problem concerned representational style
It commonplace one represent subject matter different way
This pluralism seem prerogative fine art representation used science one kind either
Weizsäcker liquid drop model represents nucleus atom manner different shell model scale model wing air plane represents wing way different mathematical model shape
What representational style science
Although question explicitly addressed literature semantic view theory answer seem emerge understanding model
One version semantic view one build mathematical notion model see Sec
posit model target isomorphic van Fraassen Suppes partially isomorphic Da Costa French
Formal requirement weaker discussed Mundy Swoyer
Another version semantic view drop formal requirement favor similarity Giere Teller
This approach enjoys advantage isomorphism view le restrictive also account case inexact simplifying model
However Giere point account remains empty long relevant respect degree similarity specified
The specification respect degree depends problem hand larger scientific context made basis purely philosophical consideration Teller
Further notion understood addressing issue representational style introduced literature model
Among scale model idealized model analogical model phenomenological model play important role
These category mutually exclusive instance scale model would also qualify idealized model clear exactly draw line idealized analogue model

Some model basically enlarged copy target system Black
Typical example wooden car model bridge
The leading intuition scale model naturalistic replica truthful mirror image target reason scale model sometimes also referred true model Achinstein Ch

However thing perfectly faithful scale model faithfulness always restricted respect
The wooden model car instance provides faithful portrayal car shape material
Scale model seem special case broader category representation Peirce dubbed icon representation stand something else closely resemble Peirce Vol

This raise question criterion model satisfy order qualify icon
Although seem strong intuition answer question particular case theory iconicity model formulated yet

An idealization deliberate simplification something complicated objective making tractable
Frictionless plane point mass infinite velocity isolated system omniscient agent market perfect equilibrium example
Philosophical debate idealization focused two general kind idealization Aristotelian Galilean idealization
Aristotelian idealization amount stripping away imagination property concrete object believe relevant problem hand
This allows u focus limited set property isolation
An example classical mechanic model planetary system describing planet object shape mass disregarding property
Other label kind idealization include abstraction Cartwright Ch
negligibility assumption Musgrave method isolation Mäki
Galilean idealization one involve deliberate distortion
Physicists build model consisting point mass moving frictionless plane economist assume agent omniscient biologist study isolated population
It characteristic Galileo approach science use simplification sort whenever situation complicated tackle
For reason common refer sort idealization Galilean idealization McMullin another common label distorted model
Galilean idealization beset riddle
What model involving distortion kind tell u reality
How test accuracy
In reply question Laymon put forward theory understands idealization ideal limit imagine series experimental refinement actual situation approach postulated limit require closer property system come ideal limit closer behavior come behavior ideal limit monotonicity
But condition need always hold clear understand situation ideal limit exists
We least principle produce series table top ever slippery possibly produce series system Planck constant approach zero
This raise question whether one always make idealized model realistic
We come back issue section
Galilean Aristotelian idealization mutually exclusive
On contrary often come together
Consider mechanical model planetary system model take account narrow set property distorts instance describing planet ideal sphere mass distribution
Models involve substantial Galilean well Aristotelian idealization sometimes referred caricature Gibbard Varian
Caricature model isolate small number salient characteristic system distort extreme case
A classical example Ackerlof model car market explains difference price new used car solely term asymmetric information thereby disregarding factor may influence price car
However controversial whether highly idealized model still regarded informative representation target system discussion caricature model particular economics see Reiss
At point would like mention notion seems closely related idealization namely approximation
Although term sometimes used interchangeably seems clear difference two
Approximations introduced mathematical context
One mathematical item approximation another one close relevant sense
What item may vary
Sometimes want approximate one curve another one
This happens expand function power series keep first two three term
In situation approximate equation another one letting control parameter tend towards zero Redhead
The salient point issue physical interpretation need arise
Unlike Galilean idealization involves distortion real system approximation purely formal matter
This course imply interesting relation approximation idealization
For instance approximation justified pointing mathematical pendant acceptable idealization
neglect dissipative term equation make idealizing assumption system frictionless

Standard example analogical model include hydraulic model economic system billiard ball model gas computer model mind liquid drop model nucleus
At basic level two thing analogous certain relevant similarity
Hesse distinguishes different type analogy according kind similarity relation two object enter
A simple type analogy one based shared property
There analogy earth moon based fact large solid opaque spherical body receiving heat light sun revolving around ax gravitating towards body
But sameness property necessary condition
An analogy two object also based relevant similarity property
In liberal sense say analogy sound light echo similar reflection loudness brightness pitch color detectability ear detectability eye
Analogies also based sameness resemblance relation part two system rather monadic property
It sense politician assert relation father child analogous relation state citizen
The analogy mentioned far Hesse call material analogy
We obtain formal notion analogy abstract concrete feature system posse focus formal
What analogue model share target set feature pattern abstract relationship
structure structure understood formal sense
This notion analogy closely related Hesse call formal analogy
Two item related formal analogy interpretation formal calculus
For instance formal analogy swinging pendulum oscillating electric circuit described mathematical equation
A distinction due Hesse one positive negative neutral analogy
The positive analogy two item consists property relation share gas molecule billiard ball mass negative analogy one share billiard ball colored gas molecule
The neutral analogy comprises property known yet whether belong positive negative analogy
Neutral analogy play important role scientific research give rise question suggest new hypothesis
In vein various author emphasized heuristic role analogy play theory construction creative thought Hesse Holyoak Thagard Kroes Psillos essay collected Hellman

Phenomenological model defined different though related way
A traditional definition take model represent observable property target refrain postulating hidden mechanism like
Another approach due McMullin defines phenomenological model model independent theory
This however seems strong
Many phenomenological model failing derivable theory incorporate principle law associated theory
The liquid drop model atomic nucleus instance portrays nucleus liquid drop describes several property surface tension charge among others originating different theory hydrodynamics electrodynamics respectively
Certain aspect usually complete used determine static dynamical property nucleus

Each notion still somewhat vague suffers internal problem much work need done tighten
But pressing issue question different notion relate
Are analogy fundamentally different idealization occupy different area continuous scale
How icon differ idealization analogy
At present know answer question
What need systematic account different way model relate reality way compare
Another kind representational model model data Suppes
A model data corrected rectified regimented many instance idealized version data gain immediate observation raw data
Characteristically one first eliminates error
remove point record due faulty observation present data neat way instance drawing smooth curve set point
These two step commonly referred data reduction curve fitting
When investigate trajectory certain planet instance first eliminate point fallacious observation record fit smooth curve remaining one
Models data play crucial role confirming theory model data often messy complex raw data compare theoretical prediction
The construction data model extremely complicated
It requires sophisticated statistical technique raise serious methodological well philosophical question
How decide point record need removed
And given clean set data curve fit
The first question dealt mainly within context philosophy experiment see instance Galison Staley
At heart latter question lie curve fitting problem data indicate form fitted curve take
Traditional discussion theory choice suggest issue settled background theory consideration simplicity prior probability combination
Forster Sober point formulation curve fitting problem slight overstatement theorem statistic due Akaike show given certain assumption data underwrite though determine inference concerning curve shape assume fitted curve chosen strike balance simplicity goodness fit way maximizes predictive accuracy
Further discussion data model found Chin Brewer Harris Laymon Mayo
In modern logic model structure make sentence theory true theory taken usually deductively closed set sentence formal language see Bell Machover Hodges detail
The structure model sense theory represents
As simple example consider Euclidean geometry consists
two point joined straight line theorem derived axiom
Any structure statement true model Euclidean geometry
A structure composite entity consisting set individual called domain universe ii indexed set
ordered list operation may empty iii indexed set relation
It important note nothing object matter definition mere dummy
Similarly operation function specified purely extensionally relation defined class function taking argument defined class
If sentence theory true symbol interpreted referring either object relation function structure model theory
Many model science carry logic idea interpretation abstract calculus
This particularly pertinent physic general Newton equation heart theory
These law applied particular
choosing special force function making assumption mass distribution pendulum etc
The resulting model interpretation realization general law
There variety thing commonly referred model physical object fictional object structure description equation combination
However category neither mutually exclusive jointly exhaustive
Where one draw line say fictional object structure may well depend one metaphysical conviction model may fall yet another class thing
What model course interesting question right briefly indicated last section also important implication semantics see epistemology
Some model straightforward physical object
These commonly referred material model
The class material model comprises anything physical entity serf scientific representation something else
Among member class find stock example like wooden model bridge plane ship Watson Crick metal model DNA Schaffner Phillips hydraulic model economy Morgan Boumans
More cutting edge case material model model organism organism used life science organism Ankeny Ankeny Leonelli Leonelli
Material model give rise ontological difficulty quibble connection object metaphysicians deal
nature property identity object part whole
Many model material model
The Bohr model atom frictionless pendulum isolated population instance scientist mind rather laboratory physically realized experimented upon perform representational function
It seems natural view fictional entity
This position traced back German Vaihinger emphasized importance fiction scientific reasoning
Giere recently advocated view model abstract entity
It entirely clear Giere mean abstract entity discussion mechanical model seems suggest us term designate fictional entity
This view square well scientific practice scientist often talk model object well philosophical view see manipulation model essential part process scientific investigation Morgan
It natural assume one manipulate something exists
Furthermore model often property explicitly attribute construct interesting vehicle research
A view regard model object easily explain without ado introduce model use identifying description object exhaustively characterized description
Research simply amount finding object thus identified
The drawback suggestion fictional entity notoriously beset ontological riddle
This led many philosopher argue thing fictional entity apparent ontological commitment must renounced
The influential deflationary account go back Quine
Building Russell discussion definite description Quine argues illusion refer fictional entity talk
Instead dispose alleged object turning term refer predicate analyse sentence like Pegasus exist nothing pegasizes
By eliminating troublesome term eschew ontological commitment seem carry
This resulted lack interest fictional entity particular among philosopher science
In programmatic essay Fine draw attention neglect submits Quinean skepticism notwithstanding fiction play important role scientific reasoning
However Fine offer systematic account fiction put use science
The issue understand fiction science subject matter recent debate philosophy modeling
Barberousse Ludwig Contessa Frigg Leng Toon develop view see model fiction kind
Giere denies earlier work understood way argues viewing model fiction
Magnani Pincock Teller second Giere argue model regarded fiction
Weisberg argues middle position see model playing heuristic role denies form part scientific model
An influential point view take model structure
This position traced back Suppes slight variant held proponent semantic view theory
Needless say difference different version semantic view van Fraassen instance emphasizes model structure survey different position found Suppe Ch

However account model structure one sort another Da Costa French
As model kind often closely tied mathematized science sometimes also referred mathematical model
For discussion model biology see Lloyd
This view model criticized different ground
One pervasive criticism many type model play important role science structure accommodated within structuralist view model neither account model constructed work context investigation Cartwright Downes Morrison
Another charge held approach possible explain structure represent target system form part physical world without making assumption go beyond approach afford Frigg
A position scientist display scientific paper textbook present model le stylized description relevant target system Achinstein Black
This view subject explicit criticism
However criticism marshaled syntactic view theory equally threaten linguistic understanding model
First commonplace describe thing different way
But identify model description new description yield new model seems counterintuitive
One translate description language formal natural one would say one hereby obtains different model
Second model different property description
On one hand say model solar system consists sphere orbiting around big mass population model isolated environment seem make sense say description
On hand description property model
A description written English consist word printed red ink
None make sense said model
The descriptivist face challenge either make case argument mistaken show get around difficulty
Another group thing habitually referred model particular economics equation also termed mathematical model
The model stock market model open economy case point
The problem suggestion equation syntactic item face objection similar one put forward description
First one describe situation using different result obtain different equation seem obtain different model
Second model property different equation
An oscillator equation describing motion
Equally equation may inhomogeneous system describes
The proposal discussed far tacitly assumed model belongs one particular class object
But assumption necessary
It might case model mixture element belonging different ontological category
In vein Morgan suggests model involve structural well narrative element story call
Models vehicle learning world
Significant part scientific investigation carried model rather reality studying model discover feature ascertain fact system model stand brief model allow surrogative reasoning Swoyer
For instance study nature hydrogen atom dynamic population behavior polymer studying respective model
This cognitive function model widely acknowledged literature even suggest model give rise new style reasoning model based reasoning Magnani Nersessian Magnani Nersessian Thagard
This leaf u question learning model possible
Hughes provides general framework discussing question
According DDI account learning take place three stage denotation demonstration interpretation
We begin establishing representation relation denotation model target
Then investigate feature model order demonstrate certain theoretical claim internal constitution mechanism
learn model demonstration
Finally finding converted claim target system Hughes refers step interpretation
It latter two notion stake
Learning model happens two place construction manipulation model Morgan
There fixed rule recipe model building activity figuring fit together affords opportunity learn model
Once model built learn property looking use manipulate model order elicit secret
Depending kind model dealing building manipulating model amount different activity demanding different methodology
Material model seem unproblematic used common experimental context
put model car wind tunnel measure air resistance
Hence far learning model concerned material model give raise question go beyond question experimentation generally
Not fictional model
What constraint construction fictional model manipulate
The natural response seems answer question performing thought experiment
Different author
Brown Gendler Norton Reiss Sorensen explored line argument reached different often conflicting conclusion thought experiment performed status outcome detail see entry thought experiment
An important class model mathematical nature
In case possible derive result solve equation analytically
But quite often case
It point invention computer great impact allows u solve equation otherwise intractable making computer simulation

What simulation
Simulations characteristically used connection dynamic model
model involve time
The aim simulation solve equation motion model designed represent target system
So one say simulation imitates usually real process another process Hartmann Humphreys
It claimed computer simulation constitute genuinely new methodology science even new scientific paradigm moreover also raise new host philosophical issue Humphreys Rohrlich Winsberg various contribution Sismondo Gissis
Hence claim simulation call question philosophical understanding many aspect science
However enthusiasm shared universally argue simulation far demanding new philosophy science raise new philosophical problem Frigg Reiss
Whether one see computer simulation raising fundamentally new philosophical issue doubt practical significance
When standard method fail computer simulation often way learn something dynamical model help u extend Humphreys
An important question arises context justification simulation result trust output computer simulation
An influential strand attempt come grip question exploit similarity traditional experiment computer simulation raise vexing question relation computer simulation experiment Barberousse Franceschelli Imbert Morgan Morrison Parker Winsberg
This question trustworthiness broken equation model represent target system accurately enough purpose hand b computer provide accurate enough solution equation
Practicioners refer respectively problem validation problem verification
In practice often face version Duhem problem one evaluate net outcome simulation possible address two issue one one
This led scientist develop various method test whether outcome simulation target discussion see Winsberg
Computer simulation also heuristically important
They may suggest new theory model hypothesis example based systematic exploration model parameter space Hartmann
But computer simulation also bear methodological peril
They may provide misleading result due discrete nature calculation carried digital computer allow exploration part full parameter space subspace may reveal certain important feature model
The severity problem somehow mitigated increasing power modern computer
But availability computational power also may adverse effect
It may encourage scientist swiftly come increasingly complex conceptually premature model involving poorly understood assumption mechanism many additional adjustable parameter discussion related problem context individual actor model social science see Schnell
This may lead increase empirical may welcome come example forecasting necessarily better understanding underlying mechanism
As result use computer simulation may change weight assign various goal science
Finally availability computer power may seduce scientist making calculation degree trustworthiness one would expect
This happens instance computer used propagate probability distribution forward time taken decision relevant probability even though turn upon closer examination see Frigg

So important carried away mean new powerful computer offer thereby place sight actual goal research
Once knowledge model knowledge translated knowledge target system
It point representational function model becomes important
Models instruct u nature reality assume least model aspect counterpart world
But learning tied representation different kind representation analogy idealization etc
also different kind learning
If instance model take realistic depiction transfer knowledge model target accomplished different manner deal analogue model involves idealizing assumption
What different way learning
Although numerous case study made certain specific model work seem general account transfer knowledge model target achieved possible exception theory analogical reasoning see reference
This difficult question one deserves attention gotten far
One perplexing question connection model relate theory
The separation model theory hazy one jargon many scientist often difficult impossible draw line
So question distinction model theory relate one another
In common parlance term model theory sometimes used express attitude towards particular piece science
The phrase model indicates hypothesis stake asserted tentatively even known false something awarded label theory acquired degree general acceptance
However way drawing line model theory use systematic understanding model
The syntactic view theory integral part logical positivist picture science construes theory set sentence axiomatized system first order logic
Within approach term model used wider narrower sense
In wider sense model system semantic rule interpret abstract calculus study model amount scrutinizing semantics scientific language
In narrower sense model alternative interpretation certain calculus Braithwaite Campbell Nagel Spector
If instance take mathematics used kinetic theory gas reinterpret term calculus way make refer billiard ball billiard ball model kinetic theory gas
Proponents syntactic view believe model irrelevant science
Models hold superfluous addition best pedagogical aesthetical psychological value Carnap Hempel see also
The semantic view theory see
van Fraassen Giere Suppe Suppes revers standpoint declares dispense formal calculus altogether view theory family model
Although different version semantic view assume different notion model see agree model central unit scientific theorizing
One perspicuous criticism semantic view mislocates place model scientific edifice
Models relatively independent theory rather constitutive use Morrison slogan autonomous agent
This independence two aspect construction functioning Morgan Morrison
A look model constructed actual science show neither derived entirely data theory
Theories provide u algorithm construction model vending machine one insert problem model pop Cartwright Ch

Model building art mechanical procedure
The London model superconductivity affords u good example relationship
The model principal equation theoretical justification sense could derived electromagnetic fundamental theory motivated solely basis phenomenological consideration Cartwright et al

Or put another way model constructed bottom top therefore enjoys great deal independence theory
The second aspect independence model perform function could perform part strongly dependent theory

A theory may incompletely specified sense imposes certain general constraint remains silent detail concrete situation provided model Redhead
A special case situation qualitative theory known model introduces quantitative measure Apostel
example theory underdetermined way axiomatic quantum field theory imposes certain general constraint quantum field provide account particular field
While Redhead others seem think case sort somehow special Cartwright argued rule rather exception
On view fundamental theory classical mechanic quantum mechanic represent anything describe real world situation
Laws theory schema need concretized filled detail specific situation task accomplished model

Theories may complicated handle
In case simplified model may employed allows solution Apostel Redhead
Quantum chromodynamics instance easily used study hadron structure nucleus although fundamental theory problem
To get around difficulty physicist construct tractable phenomenological model
MIT bag model effectively describes relevant degree freedom system consideration Hartmann
The advantage model yield result theory remain silent
Their drawback often clear understand relationship theory model two strictly speaking contradictory
A extreme case use model theory available
We encounter situation domain particularly rampant biology economics overarching theory often
The model scientist construct tackle situation sometimes referred substitute model Groenewold

The notion model substitute theory closely related notion developmental model
This term coined Leplin pointed useful model development early quantum theory used umbrella notion covering case model sort preliminary exercise theory
A closely related notion one probing model also study model toy model
These model perform representational function expected instruct u anything beyond model
The purpose model test new theoretical tool used later build representational model
In field theory instance φ studied extensively represents anything real serf several heuristic function
The simplicity φ allows physicist get feeling quantum field theory like extract general feature simple model share complicated one
One try complicated technique renormalization simple setting possible get acquainted case symmetry used later Hartmann
This true physic
As Wimsatt point false model genetics perform many useful function among following false model help answer question realistic model provide arena answering question property complex model factor phenomenon would otherwise seen serve limiting case general model two false model may define extreme continuum case real case supposed lie lead identification relevant variable estimation value
The debate scientific model important repercussion debate philosophy science
The reason traditionally debate scientific realism reductionism explanation law nature couched term theory theory acknowledged carrier scientific knowledge
So question whether discussion matter change shift focus theory model
Up comprehensive account issue developed model leave trace discussion topic
It claimed practice model building favor antirealism realism
Antirealists point truth main goal scientific modeling
Cartwright instance present several case study illustrating good model often false supposedly true theory might help much come understanding say working laser
Realists deny falsity model render realist approach science impossible pointing good model thought literally true usually least approximately true
Laymon argues prediction model typically become better relax idealization
model take support realism see also McMullin Nowak Brzezinski Nowak
Apart usual complaint elusiveness notion approximate truth antirealists taken issue reply two related reason
First Cartwright point reason assume one always improve model adding correction
Second seems outlined procedure accordance scientific practice
It unusual scientist invest work repeatedly existing model
Rather shift completely different modeling framework adjustment made get involved Hartmann
The various model atomic nucleus case point
Once realized shell effect important understand various phenomenon collective liquid drop model put aside shell model developed account finding
A difficulty idealization controlled
It example clear way one could Model eventually arrive quantum chromodynamics supposedly correct underlying theory
A antirealist argument incompatible model argument take starting point observation scientist often successfully use several incompatible model target system predictive purpose Morrison
These model seemingly contradict ascribe different property target system
In nuclear physic instance liquid drop model explores analogy atomic nucleus charged fluid drop shell model describes nuclear property term property proton neutron constituent atomic nucleus
This practice appears cause problem scientific realism
Realists typically hold close connection predictive success theory least approximately true
But several theory system predictively successful theory mutually inconsistent true even approximately
Realists react argument various way
First challenge claim model question indeed predictively successful
If model good predictor argument blocked
Second defend version perspectival realism Giere Rueger according model reveals one aspect phenomenon question taken together full fuller account emerges
Third realist deny problem first place scientific model always idealized one way another therefore strictly speaking false wrong vehicle make point realism
The problem mentioned last section raise question different model related
Evidently multiple model target system generally stand deductive relation often contradict
Given model seem indispensable practice science simple picture organization science along line model reduction Oppenheim Putnam pyramid picture seem plausible
Some suggested Cartwright Hacking picture science according systematic relation hold different model
Some model tied together represent target system imply enter relationship deductive otherwise
We confronted patchwork model hold specific domain applicability see also paper collected Falkenburg Muschik
Some argue picture least partially incorrect various interesting relation hold different model theory
These relation range controlled approximation singular limit relation Batterman structural relation Gähde rather loose relation called story Hartmann see also Bokulich
These suggestion made basis case study instance effective quantum field theory see Hartmann remains seen whether general account relation given whether deeper justification provided instance Bayesian framework first step towards Bayesian understanding reduction found

It widely held science aim discovering law nature
Philosophers turn faced challenge explicating law nature
According two currently dominant account best system approach universal approach law nature understood universal scope meaning apply everything world
This take law seem square view see model center scientific theorizing
What role general law play science model represent happening world model law related
One possible response argue law nature govern entity process model rather world
Fundamental law approach state fact world hold true entity process model
Different variant view advocated Cartwright Giere van Fraassen
Surprisingly realist law seem responded challenge remains open question whether realistic understanding law approach science made compatible
Laws nature play important role many account explanation prominently model unification approach
Unfortunately account inherit problem beset relationship model law
This leaf u two option
Either one argue law dispensed explanation idea employed van Fraassen pragmatic theory explanation approach causal explanation Woodward
According latter model tool find causal relation hold certain fact process relation explanatory job
Or one shift explanatory burden model
A positive suggestion along line simulacrum account explanation suggests explain phenomenon constructing model fit phenomenon basic framework grand theory Ch

On account model explanation seek
This square well basic scientific intuition leaf u question notion explanation work see also Elgin Sober
Bokulich pursues similar line reasoning see explanatory power model closely related fictional nature
Models play important role science
But despite fact generated considerable interest among philosopher remain significant lacuna understanding model work

Difference Between Things Terms Objects Posted Any system described using mathematical model contains mathematical symbol concept
Mathematical modeling name process undertaken develop model particular system
It life science also social science make heavy use mathematical model
In fact art subject like economics mathematical model used extensively
There many type mathematical model hard fast rule quite bit overlapping different model
One way classify mathematical model place static modelling dynamic modelling
In article shall highlight difference two type mathematical modelling
What difference static modelling dynamic modelling
The notable difference static dynamic model system dynamic model refers runtime model system static model model system runtime
Another difference lie use differential equation dynamic model conspicuous absence static model
Dynamic model keep changing reference time whereas static model equilibrium steady state
Static model structural behavioral dynamic model representation behavior static component system
Static modelling includes class diagram object diagram help depicting static constituent system
Dynamic modelling hand consists sequence operation state change activity interaction memory
Static modelling rigid dynamic modelling time independent view system
It changed real time referred static modelling
Dynamic modelling flexible change time show object wwith many possibility might arise time

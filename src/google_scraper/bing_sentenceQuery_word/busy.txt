operation refers actively sampling status synchronous activity
Polling often used term also referred
Polling process computer controlling device wait check readiness state often hardware
For example connected via computer wait printer received next character
These process minute reading
Î¤his sometimes used synonymously polling
In situation operation required computer nothing check status device ready point device accessed
In word computer wait device ready
Polling also refers situation device repeatedly checked readiness computer return different task
Although wasteful cycle busy waiting generally efficient alternative polling
In simple system even perfectly appropriate action possible access often traditionally consequence simple hardware
Polling often intimately involved
For example polling parallel printer port check whether ready another character involves examining little one
That bit represents time reading whether single wire printer cable low high voltage
The instruction read byte directly transfer voltage state eight real world wire eight circuit make one byte CPU register
Polling disadvantage many device check time required poll exceed time available service device
Polling described following step add pic A time element monitored
The optimal polling cycle vary according several factor including desired speed response overhead processor time bandwidth polling
In polling device process query element list fixed sequence
Because wait response element timing mechanism necessary prevent caused element
Roll call polling inefficient overhead polling message high numerous element polled polling cycle element active
In also referred token polling element poll next element fixed sequence
This continues first element reached time polling cycle start
Polling employed various computing context order control execution transmission sequence element involved
For example multitasking operating system polling used allocate processor time resource various competing process
In network polling used determine node want access network
It also used routing protocol retrieve routing information case EGP exterior gateway protocol
An alternative polling use signal generated device process indicate need attention want communicate etc
Although polling simple many situation multitasking operating system efficient use interrupt reduce processor usage bandwidth consumption
A message
In multidrop line arrangement central different terminal share single communication line computer system us polling arrangement whereby central computer sends message called polling message specific terminal outgoing line
All terminal listen outgoing line terminal polled reply sending information ready transmission incoming line
In simplest form consists one central computer act conduit transmit message polling required avoid chaos line often used allow master acquire input orderly fashion
These poll message differ multidrop line case site address needed terminal receives poll directed

The busy beaver max shift function S n known value
Is basic structural reason inconceivable ever find S n n
What different
Or
Somewhere along way must fundamental difference otherwise S n would principle computable n exactly difference
The reason program compute S n knew S n could decide halting problem know stop waiting
On hand program computes S n n us table
If possible prove value S n n n could prove S n could compute S n searching proof assumes proof system valid
So proof system minimal value n prove S n
Finally reason know S probably really small number
The number slightly bigger thing get complicated
There deep reason know S S like deep reason know Ramsey number R R though Ramsey number course computable
Scott Aaronson discus
He find explicit upper bound n S n computed
another angle informal sketch answer would take long time technically flesh research ie basically research program preliminary evidence limit computable Busy Beaver function measure algorithm complexity two ref hint direction
roughly small TMs state accomplish much sophisticated behavior complex algorithm state
therefore calculation appears also deep link
another way looking Busy Beaver function also closely coincides similar technological advance continually advancing frontier based mathematical computer science research

I interesting question
What fastest growing function known man
Is
We know function function grows slower turn grows slower x turn grows slower
We combine function grows faster
Then arrive recursive function Ackermann function A x x grows much faster
Then people though busy beaver B x function grows even faster Ackermann function
At point I heard function grow faster busy beaver
Does mean function possibly grow quicker busy beaver
Aside factorial B x like A B x B x etc
This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
The busy beaver function grows faster
However computed Turing machine given access oracle solving halting problem
You define second order busy beaver function grows faster function computed even Turing machine oracle halting problem
You keep forever building hierarchy ever faster growing busy beaver function
See Scott Aaronson excellent essay topic
There thing fastest growing function
In fact even sequence fastest growing function
This already shown Hausdorff
Given two function f N N say g grows faster f g n f n
Given function f following function g grows faster f g n nf n
Given sequence function following function g grows faster g n n n n
A natural question ask whether scale fastest growing function
This set function cofinal given function f function
Instead set equivalently talk chain two function set need comparable
The existence scale independent ZFC assuming CH scale Cohen model falsifies CH adding real scale exists
Other answer address question directly
For deeper background paper Lafitte subject considers larger context busy function
It also result theorem fitting idea general framework
It show informally busy function close connection Chaitin incompleteness phenomenon Theorem
It also show theory powerful enough comprehend busy function
unprovable theory due incompleteness
It show idea assuming busy result axiom logical progression theory result similar idea originally envisioned Turing
Lafitte
Abstract We show incompleteness result Ã la Chaitin using busy beaver function
Then help ordinal logic show obtain theory value busy beaver function provably established use reveal structure provability value function
The hierarchy theorem prove fastest growing function term time space scale unbounded
But give well behaved function compared
But many fast growing math function seem evaluated term complexity far despite somewhat obvious even glaring theoretical gap fill
Doing could lead important bridge theorem

From Wikipedia article Polling polled operation computer science refers actively sampling status external device client program synchronous activity
Polling often used term also referred polled software driven
Polling sometimes used synonymously polling busy waiting
In situation operation required computer nothing check status device ready point device accessed
In word computer wait device ready
Polling also refers situation device repeatedly checked readiness computer return different task
Although wasteful CPU cycle generally efficient alternative polling interrupt driven
So thread use condition variable called polling data change busy waiting
The difference two application poll
If program poll device say every second something else mean time data available including possibly sleeping leaving CPU available others polling
If program poll device resource whatever without anything check called
This directly related synchronization
A program block condition variable signal device resource available neither polling
That like
But example thread loop around form polling possibly loop tight
Suppose one microprocessor microcontroller supposed perform action notice button pushed
A first approach program enter loop nothing except look see button changed yet perform required action
A second approach case would program hardware trigger interrupt button pushed assuming button wired input wired cause interrupt
A third approach configure timer interrupt processor rate say handler interrupt check state button act upon
The first approach us
It offer good response time one particular stimulus expense totally tuning everything else
The second approach us interrupt
It often offer slightly slower response time allow CPU thing waiting
It may also allow CPU go sleep mode button pushed
The third approach offer response time far inferior two usable even hardware would allow interrupt triggered button push
In case rapid response required often necessary use either interrupt
In many case however polled approach may practical
Hardware may exist support event one might interested number event one interested may substantially exceed number available interrupt
Further may desirable certain condition generate delayed response
For example suppose one wish count number time switch activated subject following criterion The easiest way enforce requirement observe state switch seen closed previous state open increment counter
Very simple easy even switch open close sort weird way preceding following real event software wo care
It would possible use interrupt along timer yield faster response switch input meeting required blanking requirement
Initially input would armed trigger next time switch close
Once interrupt triggered software would disable set timer trigger interrupt
Once timer expired would trigger interrupt would arm interrupt fire next time switch open
That interrupt would turn disable switch interrupt set timer timer interrupt would switch interrupt
Sometimes approach useful software lot complicated simple polled approach
When approach sufficient often preferable
In system use multitasking OS rather direct interrupt many principle apply
Periodic polling waste CPU time compared code OS wo run certain event occur many case event response time amount time wasted event occurs acceptable using periodic polling
Indeed buffered situation periodic polling might turn quite efficient
For example suppose one receiving large amount data remote machine via serial port byte arrive per second device send data ahead last acknowledged packet serial port input buffer
While one could process data using data received event may efficient simply check port process packet received point
Such polling would waste time remote device sending data incoming data expected may efficient process chunk roughly process every little piece incoming data soon come

In contraction Latin communication system transfer data component inside computer
This expression cover related hardware component wire optical fiber etc
software including communication protocol
Early computer bus parallel electrical wire multiple connection term used physical arrangement provides logical function parallel
Modern computer bus use connection wired either electrical parallel topology connected switched hub case
Computer system generally consist three main part CPU process data hold program data processed device communicate outside world
An early computer might contain CPU main memory reading writing data respectively
A modern system might memory display system interaction connection
In example computer bus one form another move data device
In traditional CPU main memory tend tightly coupled
A conventionally single chip number electrical connection pin used select main memory another set pin read write data stored location
In case CPU memory share signalling characteristic operate
The bus connecting CPU memory one defining characteristic system often referred simply
It possible allow peripheral communicate memory fashion attaching adaptor form directly system bus
This commonly accomplished sort standardized electrical connector several forming
However performance difference CPU peripheral varies widely solution generally needed ensure peripheral slow overall system performance
Many CPUs feature second set pin similar communicating memory able operate different speed using different protocol
Others use smart controller place data directly memory concept known
Most modern system combine solution appropriate
As number potential peripheral grew using expansion card every peripheral became increasingly untenable
This led introduction bus system designed specifically support multiple peripheral
Common example port modern computer allow number hard drive connected without need card
However system generally expensive implement device like mouse
This led parallel development number bus system solution common example standardized All example may referred although terminology universal
In modern system performance difference CPU main memory grown great increasing amount memory built directly CPU known
In system CPUs communicate using bus operate speed much greater memory communicate memory using protocol similar used solely peripheral past
These system bus also used communicate peripheral adaptor turn talk peripheral controller
Such system architecturally similar communicating bus rather network
In case expansion bus entirely separate longer share architecture host CPU may fact support many different CPUs case
What would formerly system bus often known
Given change classical term system expansion peripheral longer connotation
Other common categorization system based bus primary role connecting device internally externally PCI instance
However many common modern bus system used associated one example system would formerly described internal certain automotive application use primarily external fashion similar system bus
Other example like designed start used internally externally
The internal bus also known internal data bus memory bus system bus connects internal component computer CPU memory motherboard
Internal data bus also referred local bus intended connect local device
This bus typically rather quick independent rest computer operation
The external bus made electronic pathway connect different external device printer computer
Buses carry parallel multiple wire carry data form
The addition extra power control connection differential driver data connection direction usually mean serial bus conductor minimum one used
As data rate increase problem power consumption electromagnetic interference across parallel bus become difficult circumvent
One partial solution problem bus
Often serial bus operated higher overall data rate parallel bus despite fewer electrical connection serial bus inherently timing skew crosstalk
example
connection work well fast serial bus modern serial bus use hub design
connection generally regarded bus although difference largely conceptual rather practical
An attribute generally used characterize bus power provided bus connected hardware
This emphasizes origin bus architecture supplying switched distributed power
This excludes bus scheme serial parallel interface Ethernet since device also needed separate power supply
device may use bus supplied power often use separate power source
This distinction exemplified system connected connection associated modulated signalling scheme considered bus analogous connection
A phone line connection scheme considered bus respect signal us bus connection phone
However power provided case many data connection STANAG EFABus commonly referred data bus sometimes databuses
Such usually characterized several equipment connected common shared
They may ARINC
single source ARINC STANAG allow connected act different time transmitter receiver data
Over time several group people worked various computer bus standard including IEEE Bus Architecture Standards Committee BASC IEEE Superbus study group open microprocessor initiative OMI open microsystems initiative OMI Gang Nine developed etc
Early bus bundle wire attached peripheral
Anecdotally termed named electrical power bus
Almost always one bus memory one separate bus peripheral
These accessed separate instruction completely different timing protocol
One first complication use
Early computer program performed peripheral become ready
This waste time program task
Also program attempted perform task might take long program check resulting loss data
Engineers thus arranged peripheral interrupt CPU
The interrupt prioritized CPU execute code one peripheral time device others
system introduced idea essentially small computer dedicated handling input output given bus
introduced became common feature platform
Other vendor like implemented similar design
Generally channel controller would best run bus operation internally moving data CPU known busy elsewhere possible using interrupt necessary
This greatly reduced CPU load provided better overall system performance
To provide modularity memory bus combined unified
In case single mechanical electrical system used connect together many system component case
Later computer program began share memory common several CPUs
Access memory bus prioritized well
The simple way prioritize interrupt bus access
In case signal naturally flow bus physical logical order eliminating need complex scheduling
DEC reduced cost memory bus input output device appeared memory location
This implemented around
Early bus system essentially passive connected directly buffer amplifier pin
Memory device would added bus using address data pin CPU used connected parallel
Communication controlled CPU read wrote data device block memory using instruction timed central clock controlling speed CPU
Still device CPU signaling separate CPU pin
For instance controller would signal CPU new data ready read point CPU would move data reading memory location corresponded disk drive
Almost early microcomputer built fashion starting computer system
In instance notably although similar physical architecture employed instruction access peripheral memory others made uniform still generate distinct CPU signal could used implement separate bus
These simple bus system serious drawback used computer
All equipment bus talk speed shared single clock
Increasing speed CPU becomes harder speed device must increase well
When practical economical device fast CPU CPU must either enter work slower clock frequency temporarily talk device computer
While acceptable problem tolerated long computer
Such bus system also difficult configure constructed common equipment
Typically added requires many order set memory address address interrupt priority interrupt number
Second generation bus system like addressed problem
They typically separated computer two world CPU memory one side various device
A accepted data CPU side moved peripheral side thus shifting communication protocol burden CPU
This allowed CPU memory side evolve separately device bus bus
Devices bus could talk CPU intervention
This led much better real world performance also required card much complex
These bus also often addressed speed issue bigger term size data path moving first generation second well adding software setup standardised supplant replace jumper
However newer system shared one quality earlier cousin everyone bus talk speed
While CPU isolated could increase speed CPUs memory continued increase speed much faster bus talked
The result bus speed much slower modern system needed machine left starved data
A particularly common example problem quickly outran even newer bus system like computer began include drive video card
By AGP outgrown video card peripheral replaced new bus
An increasing number external device started employing bus system well
When disk drive first introduced would added machine card plugged bus computer many slot bus
But new system like introduced serve need leaving slot modern system empty
Today likely five different bus typical machine supporting various device
Third generation bus emerging market since including
They also tend flexible term physical connection allowing used internal bus well connecting different machine together
This lead complex problem trying service different request much work system concern software design opposed hardware
In general third generation bus tend look like original concept bus higher protocol overhead needed early system also allowing multiple device use bus
Buses developed movement attempt remove legal patent constraint computer design

A collection wire transmitted one part another
You think bus highway data travel within computer
When used reference term usually refers
This bus connects internal computer component
There also enables access CPU memory
All bus consist two part data bus
The data bus transfer actual data whereas address bus transfer information data go
The size bus known important determines much data transmitted one time
For example bus transmit bit data whereas bus transmit bit data
Every bus measured
A fast bus allows data transferred faster make faster

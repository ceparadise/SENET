In programming object instance class
Think common example Employee class new employee object used program considered instance class
Therefore fancy term creating new instance class
So really mean
When say Employee class think specific employee
Rather think generally employee would ID name job title pay rate
Then hire employee named Jane also posse attribute pay rate name
Jane considered instance Employee class
And put concept inherited value generic Employee class
One key principle programming concept object inherit trait property object
In Employee example every instance Employee created code characteristic original Employee class
If create ideal Employee Java let u clone hundred
In real world instance clone
As run code process payroll instance Employee class may method calculate wage hour
These static value variable within method vary
Still transparent Java
Java interested creating new instance Employee completing processing repeating process done
It efficient way processing since need create single Employee object instance class contain method variable created
No need repetitive redundant code
The syntax requires new keyword create new object
Let say class called Employee might method variable
We want create new instance employee class instantiate Employee
What looking basic syntax And output would look like The previous syntax look like subroutine called parenthesis give away
Every class Java call constructor much like subroutine key piece code build instance
The tell system go grab memory object initialize variable
Get FREE access day create account
In previous Employee example default constructor used since create one
There nothing worry since Java take care step
However create constructor accepts value
Actually could create dozen hundred constructor
Each time create new Employee use one
We cover example
What looking basic example constructor
Note code create constructor need within class definition
Before get example let quickly recap concept Instantiation creation new instance class
In order work constructor needed
If specify one okay Java us default constructor
However create multiple constructor need arises
Let put practice expand upon sample Employee class includes detailed constructor Employee
We covered basic constructor earlier let put together Java code
Notice use keyword constructor
We telling Java constructor future object call
It help avoid confusion
The following example show Employee class updated constructor
Remember constructor created within class definition
And want instantiate Employee class create new instance class invoke constructor pas value pay rate hour worked see Here output Now constructor longer instantiate new instance Employee class without using
Either need create another constructor argument always use new constructor argument
creation new instance class part programming object instance class
Think generic employee
When true employee hired inherit property generic Employee class
When new instance created invoked tell system go grab memory object initialize variable
If constructor defined programmer Java us default
However define constructor add parameter Employee ID Rate Pay time new instance created instantiation constructor called
You number special constructor
Creating new instance object instantiation key component programming
Each new instance go meaning inherits property method variable main class

In OOP concrete occurrence existing usually computer program
Formally instance synonymous object particular value realization may called instance emphasizes distinct identity object
The creation instance called instantiation
In object created called destroyed
An object instance class may called instantiation also known construction
Not class instantiated instantiated class instantiated called
In instantiation instead done copying cloning prototype instance
An object may varied number way
Each realized variation object instance class
Each time run instance
That member given class specified rather
In context could think dog type particular dog instance class
An important distinction interface implementation
The meaning term type computer science rather similar meaning word type everyday language
For example barman ask client type beverage want coffee tea beer
A particular cup coffee client receives role instance two cup coffee would form set two instance coffee determining type time

To instantiate create instance object programming OOP language
An instantiated object given name created memory disk using structure described within class declaration
In similar language instantiate class create object whereas Java instantiate class creates specific class
The result language executable file difference use terminology
Instantiation also known instance
Instantiation creation instance abstraction object class also known template computer process whereby object used
Each instance created instantiation unique depending variation element within object
Until object becomes instantiated none code within relevant class declaration used
Prior modern OOP method instantiate similar meaning relation creation data within empty template
For example entry record database considered instantiation

The term refers object instantiated
Use Singleton Design pattern In application appropriate enforce single instance object example window manager print spoolers database access filesystems
In programming language like Java create instance object type commonly called Class use throughout code
Let take example code This also written single line save space
At time need one instance object type
You create multiple instance object type
Take instance Now I two instance object type I use instance separately program
Any change would effect instance created separate memory space
To see whether object actually different something like The code return object different
Contrary behavior behaves differently
A Singleton object type instantiated yet obtain instance object type
Let u create normal object using Java
What done created class object type identify object
Within brace class single method name class method identified usage parenthesis end name
Methods name class return type called OOP syntax
To create instance class code much simpler
Note encourage instantiation object constructor called
The constructor case called outside class paranthesis another class definition declared public accessor creating Constructor example
Now create Singleton object
You change one thing adhere Singleton design pattern Make Constructor accessor
Notice constructor accessor
This time around declared
Just changing private applied great change object type
Now instantiate object type
Go ahead try following code
The code return error private class member accessed outside class another class
This way disabled instantiation process object type
However find way obtaining instance object type
Let change
The change involve adding static class field called method accessible outside scope class using name Class
To see obtain instance let code This way control creation object derived class
But still unearthed final interesting part whole process
Try getting multiple object see happens
Unlike multiple instance normal object type multiple instance Singleton actually object instance
To validate concept Java try The code return object declaration actually referring object
So summarizing whole concept Singleton defined object instantiated
Typically obtained using static custom implementation
Java us multi threading concept program
Consider class SingletonObject discussed
Call method getInstance one thread point time might create two instance SingletonObject thus defeating whole purpose creating singleton pattern
To make singelton thread safe three option
Synchronize method would look like Synchronizing method guarantee method never called twice time
The problem code expensive
check occur every time function called
Therefore code first option

Another approach would create singleton instance shown The code much faster singleton instance created synchronization needed
It return instance reference

Use static initialization block create instance
The JVM make sure static block executed class loaded
In Java class singleton
Its constructor protected get instance calling method
Beware design pattern
It creates issue global variable procedural programming hard debug
It expensive
You may refactor instantiation class unless class new
There additional cost
This pattern easily removed automatic refactoring operation easily remove existence
The Scala programming language support Singleton object
The keyword creates class also defines singleton object type
Singletons declared like class except object replaces keyword class
This solution without requiring special language construct This technique lazy possible work known version Java
It take advantage language guarantee class initialization therefore work correctly compiler virtual machine
The nested class referenced getInstance called making solution without requiring special language construct
In second edition book Effective Java Joshua Bloch claim enum type best way implement singleton Java support enums
The use enum easy implement drawback regarding serializable object circumvented way
Singleton pattern D programming language Or manner Singleton pattern PHP Private constructor available ActionScript prevents use ActionScript approach Singleton Pattern
Many different Singleton implementation published around web
A common way implement singleton following If required synchronization left leaving method like This pattern widely used Cocoa framework see instance name
Some may argue strictly speaking Singleton possible allocate one instance object
A common way around use assertion exception prevent double allocation
There alternative way express Singleton pattern always simple easily understood least may rely method returning object
Some Cocoa Class Clusters
known exhibit type behaviour
Note available configuration relies runtime
It also comparatively slow look lock based object parenthesis
The simplest This example lazy initialization
Example C lazy initialization Note This recommended implementation TestClass default public constructor violates definition Singleton
A proper Singleton must never instantiable
More generic singleton solution C As described James Heyworth paper presented Canberra PC Users Group Delphi SIG several example Singleton pattern built Delphi Visual Component Library
This unit demonstrates technique used order create Singleton component Singleton object The desired property Singleton pattern simply encapsulated Python defining module containing variable function
To use modular Singleton client code merely import module access attribute function normal manner
This sidestep many wrinkle version singular advantage requiring zero line code implement
According influential Python programmer Alex Martelli
A rough consensus Python community sharing state among instance elegant least Python caching creation identical instance class initialization
Coding shared state nearly transparent But new style class better solution one instance created Two caveat To create singleton inherits multiple inheritance must used
Be sure call NonSingletonClass function Singleton function
A elegant approach using metaclasses also suggested
In Perl version newer state variable used
In older Perls use global variable
If Moose used extension module
In Ruby include Singleton module standard library class
In ABAP Objects make instantiation private add attribute type ref class static method control instantiation
Add illustration

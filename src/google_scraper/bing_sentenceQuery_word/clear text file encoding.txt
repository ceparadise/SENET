I lack clear understanding concept file file encoding file format
Google helped point
I understand far file binary byte file contain possible string bit
ASCII file get encoding part subset binary file byte us bit
And thing get mixed
A file seems way interpret byte file file extension seem one used way identifying file format
Does mean format defined binary file format defined ASCII file
Are format like xml pdf doc rtf html xl sql tex java c referring ASCII file
Whereas format like jpg avi eps obj dll clue talking binary file
I think talk file file
In sense text file XML HTML RTF SQL TEXT JAVA CSS EPS
And binary file PDF DOC XLS JPG AVI OBJ DLL
ASCII table character used beginning computing represent text nowadays somewhat discouraged since ca represent text language Chinese Arabic Spanish word tilde French others
Nowadays CHARACTER REPRESENTATIONS encouraged instead ASCII
The well known probably
But others like
Take look article Joel Spolsky talking UNICODE
It enlightening
File format another different issue
File format protocol program agree represent information
In sense file image certain well know internal format allows program Browsers Spreadsheets Word Processors use image
Text file also format specification text file like XML HTML
Its format binary file permit application use coherent specific way achieve something render WEB PAGE HTML XHTML file format
The actual way file stored defined OS
The actual content file described array byte one byte size possible value
Text file use either char ASCII set read easily wider char set case suitable apps read
The rest might call binary format unreadable text viewer format designed read certain apps OS
executable OS read execute others like jpg designed understand photo viewer ect
This old question still relevant
I confused well asked around clarification
Here summary hope help someone format way
You might use CSV TSV JSON Apache Log format Thrift format Protobuf format etc represent data
Format responsible ensuring data structured properly correctly represented
Ex read json file nested pair guarantee always present
Encoding basically
Now scheme
Scheme specific purpose encoding
Example transferring data wire internet would want make sure example json reach side correctly corrupted
To ensure would add meta info like checksum used verify data correctness
Other usage encoding involve shortening data exchanging secret etc
I think worth noting medium file mpeg others form medium codecs
They explain digital data express visual audio
They generally housed medium file container avi file really riff file type medium

There many plain text file encoded variant charsets
I want convert running iconv I need know original encoding
Most browser option encoding however I ca check text file one one many
Only known original encoding I convert text
Is utility detect encoding plain text file
It DOES NOT perfect I mind file misconverted file
Try Python module available PyPi Do read
I would use simple command Or want actual character set like On Linux package provides command line tool
See package description For Linux Solaris use
Getting back chardet python
call might enough Though far perfect UTFCast worth try
Did work maybe file terrible look good
Mozilla nice codebase web page Detailed description algorithm package job I tried incorrectly guessed test file
The simplest solution open file type display encoding
correctly detected test file

Images either vector bitmap
Bitmap image made small part called pixel
Vector image made using coordinate geometry
Images compressed reduce file size
used reduce file size change various attribute image file
These attribute include You need JavaScript enabled view video clip
An explanation lossy lossless compression Compression
Lossless compression mean file size compressed picture quality remains get worse
Also file decompressed original quality
Lossy compression permanently remove data
There number type compressed image file
These include following
compression type
It often used graphic might changed another person image contains layer graphic need kept separate
It
often used digital camera image fairly small file size quality display
JPEG format offer higher compression rate PNG quality
compress image maximum making
GIF often used transparency needed graphic
GIF also used store simple animated image

In computing used represent repertoire kind system
Depending context corresponding resulting code space may regarded natural electrical etc
A character encoding used transmission textual
Character set character map codeset related identical term
Early character code associated optical electrical could represent subset character used written language sometimes restricted upper case letter numeral punctuation
The low cost digital representation data modern computer system allows elaborate character code represent character used many written language
Character encoding using internationally accepted standard permit worldwide interchange text electronic form
Early binary repertoire include encoding Chinese character
Common example character encoding system include American Standard Code Information Interchange
introduced used encode letter character via series long short press
Representations character encoded using Morse code varied length
The encoding created patented modified Donald Murray standardized CCITT International Telegraph Alphabet No
code introduced Army Signal Corps late
encoding scheme used IBM early computer example computer well associated peripheral
BCD extended existing simple numeric encoding include alphabetic special character mapping easily encoding already widespread use
It precursor EBCDIC
introduced encoding scheme used encode letter numeral symbol device code using
usually abbreviated EBCDIC encoding scheme developed
The limitation set soon became apparent number method developed extend
The need support different language including family East Asian script required support far larger number character demanded systematic approach character encoding rather previous ad hoc approach
In trying develop universally interchangeable character encoding researcher faced dilemma one hand seemed necessary add bit accommodate additional character hand user relatively small character set Latin alphabet still constituted majority computer user additional bit colossal waste expensive computing resource would always zeroed user
The compromise solution eventually found developed Unicode break assumption dating back telegraph code character always directly correspond particular sequence bit
Instead character would first mapped universal intermediate representation form abstract number called
Code point would represented variety way various default number bit per character code unit depending context
To encode code point higher length code unit unit solution implement escape sequence would signal subsequent bit parsed higher code point
Terminology related code unit The Latin character set used English European language though Greek character set used Greek language
The character repertoire abstract set one million character found wide variety script including
Other symbol musical notation also included character repertoire
Both Unicode standard character repertoire
As new character added one standard standard also add character maintain parity
The code unit size equivalent bit measurement particular encoding Consider letter abc followed represented
That string contains To express character Unicode hexadecimal value prefixed string
The range valid code point Unicode standard inclusive divided identified number
Characters range plane called BMP
This plane contains character
Characters range plane called
The following table show example code point value A code point represented sequence code unit
The mapping defined encoding
Thus number code unit required represent code point depends encoding parallel standard together constitute modern unified character encoding
Rather mapping character directly octet separately define character available corresponding natural number number encoded series natural number code unit finally unit encoded stream octet
The purpose decomposition establish universal set character encoded variety way
To describe model correctly requires precise term character set character encoding
The term used modern model follow A full set abstract character system support
The repertoire may closed
addition allowed without creating new standard case ASCII series may open allowing addition case Unicode limited extent
The character given repertoire reflect decision made divide writing system basic information unit
The basic variant alphabet broken letter digit punctuation space arranged simple linear sequence displayed order read
But even alphabet pose complication regarded either part single character containing letter diacritic known precomposed character separate character
The former allows far simpler text handling system latter allows combination used text
pose similar problem
Other writing system Arabic Hebrew represented complex character repertoire due need accommodate thing like bidirectional text joined together different way different situation
A CCS map character code point represents one character
For example given repertoire capital letter A Latin alphabet might represented code point character B
Multiple coded character set may share repertoire example IBM code page cover repertoire map different code point
A CEF mapping code point facilitate storage system represents number bit sequence fixed length
practically computer system
For example system store numeric information unit directly represent code point unit larger code point say million could represented using multiple unit
This correspondence defined CEF
Next CES mapping code unit sequence octet facilitate storage file system transmission network
Simple character encoding scheme include compound character encoding scheme switch several simple scheme using compressing scheme try minimise number byte used per code unit
Although simpler CES system working Unicode use either ASCII map Unicode code point sequence octet map Unicode code point sequence word
See detailed discussion
Finally may supply additional information select particular variant character particularly regional variant Unicode character
An example attribute xml lang
The Unicode model us term historical system directly assign sequence character sequence byte covering CCS CEF CES layer
Historically term character encoding character map character set synonymous standard would specify repertoire character encoded stream code unit usually single character per code unit
But term related distinct meaning due effort standard body use precise terminology writing unifying many different encoding system
Regardless term still used interchangeably nearly ubiquitous
A usually mean encoding regard suite encoding covering different script many character share code page
code page suite Windows based IBM DOS based see detail
Most encoding referred code page encoding see byte size
IBM Character Data Representation Architecture CDRA designates coded character set identifier variously called charset character set code page CHARMAP
The term code page occur Unix Linux charmap preferred usually larger context locale
Contrasted character encoding map abstract character
A character set parlance character encoding CCS
encoding term sometimes used characterize old character encoding ambiguity sense
Most use context refers encoding fail cover Unicode code point generally using somewhat different character repertoire several code point representing one Unicode character versa see

Some source refer encoding preceded Unicode
All Windows code page usually referred legacy antedate Unicode unable represent possible Unicode code point
As result many character encoding method use need backward compatibility archived data many computer program developed translate data encoding scheme form data

codecs designed remove data without losing quality possible
work data removed reduce file size
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
Google software engineer Diana Gorea explains video encoding algorithm work One simplest example compression
RLE basic form data compression convert consecutive identical value code consisting character number marking length run
The similar value value compressed
The sequence data stored single value count
For example minute scene filmed beach would similar colour screen duration shot blue sky sea yellow sand
Each frame would contain similar data file need record colour time
Compression software understands seeing colour recycle data captured rather storing every detail every frame

Find pick best Computer Science Program Menu These day IT risk management quickly becoming part running business
Regardless industry understanding IT risk help management increase security reduce cost achieve greater accomplishment
Failure properly identify mitigate IT risk set business serious data breach financial loss
An IT risk defined potential threat data business process critical system information technology
Management responsible identify vulnerable area implement effective control continually improve process
Employees expected follow policy report problem contribute problem solving effort
The collective goal reduce wait time control testing bureaucratic process solution implementation
Because always labor resource financial constraint certain risk must managed instead mitigated
By holistically evaluating sharing impact security risk management reduce problem increase organizational effectiveness
The first step perform comprehensive risk assessment
Companies use assessment determine severity potential threat
The tangible deliverable process formal risk assessment report living document identifies potential vulnerability current control minimizing eliminating associated risk
In order determine probability future incident IT system threat must analyzed operational technical perspective
A numerical ranking system often used specify threat level impact turn produce measurable value affected IT asset resource
Risk assessment involve universal step system characterization threat identification control analysis probability determination impact analysis control recommendation evaluation
Some risk assessment conducted company invest major product new ERP software hardware upgrade even whole IT system
During planning phase scope purpose IT system compared security requirement
As IT system designed developed security control integrated IT architecture programming
Before employee access new software system IT professional test verify configure system security feature function
Once new IT system officially accessible risk management activity shift monitoring activity security maintenance adjustment changing policy process
The final phase involves properly moving archiving disposing data file secure systematic way
Effective risk management requires managerial participation support IT professional
Senior management ultimately accountable providing resource maintain security develop capability accomplish IT goal
They incorporate IT risk assessment activity strategic planning process
Chief information officer responsible company IT budgeting performance activity
Department manager responsible implement enforce proper control maintain data integrity confidentiality
These manager expected approve major IT system change software hardware enhancement
Supervisors deal business operation must ensure employee follow IT policy protocol
Lower level supervisor power improve risk management holding training holding employee accountable

A methodology describe specific method nevertheless specify several process need followed
These process constitute generic framework

According risk assessment IT field Risk assessment receives input output previous step output list assessed risk prioritized according risk evaluation criterion
The process divided following step The following table compare ISO process framework process The Code practice information security management recommends following examined risk assessment Risk identification state could cause potential loss following identified The output sub process made There two method risk assessment information security field
Purely quantitative risk assessment mathematical calculation based security metric system application
For taking consideration different SLE determined
Then considering probability occurrence given period basis example annual rate occurrence ARO determined product ARO X SLE
It important point value considered involved asset value directly affected resource
For example consider risk scenario threat consider value data related asset contained computer reputation liability company asset deriving lost availability confidentiality data could involved
It easy understand data reputation liability worth much physical resource risk laptop hardware example
Intangible asset value huge easy evaluate consideration pure quantitative approach
Qualitative risk assessment three five step evaluation Very High Low performed organization requires risk assessment performed relatively short time meet small budget significant quantity relevant data available person performing assessment sophisticated mathematical financial risk assessment expertise required
Qualitative risk assessment performed shorter period time le data
Qualitative risk assessment typically performed interview sample personnel relevant group within organization charged security asset assessed
Qualitative risk assessment descriptive versus measurable
Usually qualitative classification done followed quantitative evaluation highest risk compared cost security measure
Risk estimation input output risk analysis split following step The output list risk value level assigned
It documented
Risks arising security threat adversary attack may particularly difficult estimate
This difficulty made worse least IT system connected Internet adversary intent capability may attack physical closeness access necessary
Some initial model proposed problem
During risk estimation generally three value given asset one loss one property Integrity
The risk evaluation process receives input output risk analysis process

The level impact governed potential mission impact produce relative value IT asset resource affected criticality sensitivity IT system component data
The methodology encompasses nine primary step Risk mitigation second process according SP third according ISO risk management involves prioritizing evaluating implementing appropriate control recommended risk assessment process
Because elimination risk usually impractical close impossible responsibility senior management functional business manager use approach implement appropriate control decrease mission risk acceptable level minimal adverse organization resource mission
The risk treatment process aim selecting security measure risk produce risk treatment plan output process residual risk subject acceptance management
There list select appropriate security measure single organization choose appropriate one according business strategy constraint environment circumstance
The choice rational documented
The importance accepting risk costly reduce high led fact risk acceptance considered separate process
Risk transfer apply risk high easy reduce significantly likelihood mean security control premium compared mitigation cost eventually evaluating mixed strategy partially treat risk
Another option outsource risk somebody efficient manage risk
Risk avoidance describe action way conducting business changed avoid risk occurrence
For example choice storing sensitive information customer avoidance risk customer data stolen
The
risk remaining risk treatment decision taken estimated ensure sufficient protection achieved
If residual risk unacceptable risk treatment process iterated
Risk mitigation systematic methodology used senior management reduce mission risk
Risk mitigation achieved following risk mitigation option Address greatest risk strive sufficient risk mitigation lowest cost minimal impact mission capability suggestion contained Risk communication horizontal process interacts bidirectionally process risk management
Its purpose establish common understanding aspect risk among organization stakeholder
Establishing common understanding important since influence decision taken
The Risk Reduction Overview method specifically designed process

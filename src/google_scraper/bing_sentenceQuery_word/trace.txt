In program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
Most commonly profiling information serf aid program
Profiling achieved either program binary executable form using tool called
Profilers may use number different technique statistical instrumented simulation method
Profilers use wide variety technique collect data including operating system
Profilers used process
Program analysis tool extremely important understanding program behavior
Computer architect need tool evaluate well program perform new
Software writer need tool analyze program identify critical section code
writer often use tool find well algorithm performing
The output profiler may tool existed platform early usually based timer interrupt recorded PSW set detect hot spot executing code
This early example see
In early permitted full trace feature
program analysis Unix date back Unix system included basic tool listed function much program execution time used
In extended concept complete analysis
In Amitabh Srivastava published paper describing ATOM Analysis Tools OM
The ATOM platform convert program profiler insert code program analyzed
That inserted code output analysis data
This technique modifying program analyze known
In ATOM paper appeared list influential paper period ending
Flat profilers compute average call time call break call time based callee context
profilers show call time frequency function also involved based callee
In tool full context preserved
profilers add dimension flat profilers relating performance measure feature input workload input size input value
They generate chart characterize application performance scale function input
Profilers also program analyze target program collecting information execution
Based data granularity profilers collect information classified event based statistical profilers
Since profilers interrupt program execution collect information finite resolution time measurement taken grain salt
The programming language listed profilers Some profilers operate
A sampling profiler probe target program regular interval using
Sampling profile typically le numerically accurate specific allow target program run near full speed
The resulting data exact statistical approximation
The actual amount error usually one sampling period
In fact value n time sampling period expected error n sampling period
In practice sampling profilers often provide accurate picture target program execution approach intrusive target program thus many side effect memory cache instruction decoding pipeline
Also since affect execution speed much detect issue would otherwise hidden
They also relatively immune cost small frequently called routine loop
They show relative amount time spent user mode versus interruptible kernel mode processing
Still kernel code handle interrupt entail minor loss CPU cycle diverted cache usage unable distinguish various task occurring uninterruptible kernel code activity
Dedicated hardware go beyond ARM recent MIPS processor JTAG interface PCSAMPLE register sample truly undetectable manner allowing collection flat profile
Some commonly used statistical profilers OSX Linux Parallel Amplifier part
This technique effectively add instruction target program collect required information
Note program cause performance change may case lead inaccurate result
The effect depend information collected level detail required
For example adding code count every call probably le effect counting many time statement obeyed
A computer special hardware collect information case impact program minimal
Instrumentation key determining level control amount time resolution available profilers

There different model software development
Testing major phase developing software
It important use test plan carry different type test
When testing complex example sometimes necessary test number condition time
A also called used record outcome test
The trace table simple example would look like A trace table might appear look similar without heading like outcome outcome
Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

Students able use trace table check code error
A trace table technique used test algorithm order make sure logical error occur whilst algorithm processed
The table usually take form table With column showing variable row showing number input algorithm subsequent value variable
Trace table typically used school college teaching student program
They essential tool teaching student certain algorithm work systematic process occurring algorithm executed
They also useful debugging application helping programmer easily detect error occurring may occurring
Large algorithm may difficult understand first glance
However often broken smaller simpler component easier comprehend
A trace table used track process occur throughout algorithm
It used see value variable througout execution program
During process completing trace table purpose algorithm may revealed
This chapter discus create trace table given algorithm

Trace evidence best described small piece evidence collected Scenes Crime Officers SOCO place suspect scene crime
Normally Scenes Crime Officers SOCO dressed protective clothing neither contaminate crime scene disturb evidence may already
This protective clothing normally take guise protective plastic suit glove head covering footwear protector designed stop hair fibre skin transferring forensic scientist surrounding crime scene
Police officer also attending crime required wear protective clothing reason
It uncommon perpetrator act murder move victim try slow process identification also remove suspicion
In many murder investigation common victim known killer surroundings sometimes something giveaway therefore moving body post mortem another locale attempt albeit mostly futile one cast doubt elsewhere
As mentioned already many different type trace evidence collected part forensic scientist pathologist look sign struggle lead discovery skin particle blood fleck hair fibre transferred contact perpetrator victim
Where hair found tested DNA match also trace element various chemical found hair care product identifying product give indication sex assailant
Grass glass soil trace also important element crime scene environment trace element given due care attention often lead surprising revelation also bring avenue investigation fore would previously considered viable option
Every Scene Crime Officer SOCO responsible collection material crime scene spend many hour meticulously combing sign trace evidence spend equally much time within laboratory referencing cross referencing material order build comprehensive picture crime scene event unfolded

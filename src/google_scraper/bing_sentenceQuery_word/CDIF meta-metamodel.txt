A metamodel surrogate model model model metamodeling process generating metamodels
Thus analysis construction development frame rule constraint model theory applicable useful predefined class problem
As name implies concept applies notion modeling
Metamodels many type diverse application
A thorough discussion presented following text
A metamodel surrogate model model model
simplified model actual model circuit system software like entity
Metamodel mathematical relation algorithm representing input output relation
A abstraction phenomenon metamodel yet another abstraction highlighting property model
A model conforms metamodel way computer program conforms grammar programming language written
Various type metamodels include polynomial equation neural network etc
Metamodeling construction collection concept thing term etc
within certain domain
Metamodeling typically involves studying output input relationship fitting right metamodels represent behavior
Common us metamodels Because meta character metamodeling theory metamodels relevance
The concept useful practical application
The latter main focus article
In use recommended
This contrasted classical development technique
A model always conforms unique metamodel
One currently active branch approach named proposed
This approach based utilization language write metamodels called
Typical metamodels proposed SPEM CWM
also published standard metamodel
All language presented could defined MOF metamodels
type metamodeling used analysis construction model applicable useful predefined class problem
see also
One important move systematic use
The OMG proposed standard called
based MOF
Among many MTLs example implementation standard AndroMDA
closely related
Both often used describe analyze relation concept For software engineering several model corresponding modeling activity distinguished A library similar metamodels called Zoo metamodels
There several type zoo
Some expressed ECore
Others written
The metamodels expressed may uploaded tool

Clostridium difficile often known simply C diff bacteria attack digestive system particularly large intestine
While many organism living digestive tract harmful many actually helpful
However time balance organism get disturbed long strong course antibiotic overgrow making sick
The c diff bacteria release toxin gut attack lining intestine causing many unpleasant c diff symptom
Check hensoftware information
Symptoms C Diff The symptom infection mild severe intensity
They last short period time many month
It possible difficult treat C Diff grown resistant many commonly used antibiotic
Symptoms mild case C Diff include watery stool watery discharge three time per day
In addition abdominal pain tenderness may complication infection
Mild case usually last day week

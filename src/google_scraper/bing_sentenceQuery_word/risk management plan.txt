MITRE Systems Engineers SEs working government program propose influence often design risk management approach
They prepare monitor risk mitigation plan strategy government project program office review risk management plan prepared government contractor
As management process risk management used identify avoid potential cost schedule risk system take proactive structured approach manage negative outcome respond occur identify potential opportunity may hidden situation
The risk management approach plan operationalize management goal
Because two project exactly alike risk management approach plan tailored scope complexity individual project
Other consideration include role responsibility size project team risk management process required recommended government organization risk management tool available project
Risk occurs across spectrum government various enterprise individual system
At system level risk focus typically center development
Risk exists operation requirement design development integration testing training fielding etc
see section Guide
For dependency risk rise top
Working consistency across synchronizing capability development fielding considering whether interface interoperate integrate risk associated path come forefront environment
At enterprise level governance complexity risk become prominent
Governance risk different guidance across enterprise benefit enterprise trickle individual system resulting potentially unanticipated demand perhaps suboptimal solution low level may beneficial enterprise level
Dealing unknown increase risk associated Guide section loose coupling federated architecture portfolio help MITRE SE alleviate risk
risk management predominantly responsibility team working provide capability particular development effort
Within risk area primary responsibility fall system program manager SE working risk management developer integrator helping identify create approach reduce risk
In addition key responsibility user community decision maker onwhen accept residual risk consequence identified
The article topic area provide guidance identifying risk mitigating risk system level option like control transfer watch program risk assessment scale matrix
These guideline together MITRE SEs using tool identified article help program team deal risk management provide realism development implementation capability user
Today body literature engineering risk management largely aimed addressing traditional engineering system system designed engineered set user requirement specification technical standard
In contrast little exists risk management principle apply system whose functionality performance governed interaction set highly interconnected yet independent cooperating system
Such system may referred
A thought set arrangement system related interconnected provide given capability otherwise would possible
The loss part supporting system degrades case eliminates performance capability whole
What make risk management engineering challenging managing risk traditional system engineering project
The basic risk management process step
The challenge come implementing managing process step across complex whose subordinate system manager stakeholder may geographically dispersed organizationally distributed may fully intersecting user need
How delivery capability time affect risk managed
The difficulty aligning mapping identified risk capability planned delivered within specified build specified time
Here critically important risk impact assessment made function capability affected effect occur impact user stakeholder
Lack clearly defined system boundary management line responsibility accountability challenge management risk engineering
User stakeholder acceptance risk management participation process essential success
Given program need establish environment reporting risk potential consequence encouraged rewarded
Without incomplete picture risk
Risks threaten successful engineering may become evident late effectively manage mitigate
Frequently planned engineered deliver capability series evolutionary build
Risks originate different source threaten different time evolution
These risk source mapped capability potentially affect according planned delivery date
Assessments made risk potential impact planned capability whether collateral effect dependent capability technology
In case overall risk linear subordinate risk
Rather combination specific lower level individual system risk put together potential adversely impact way equate simple risk
The result risk important individual system managed level others warrant attention engineering management
Risk management enterprise system pose even greater challenge risk management program
Enterprise environment Internet offer user ubiquitous access wide variety service application information repository
Enterprise system engineering emerging discipline
It encompasses extends traditional system engineering create evolve web system operate way deliver capability via service data application interconnected network information communication technology
This environment system engineering
In enterprise risk management viewed integration people process tool together ensure early continuous identification resolution enterprise risk
The goal provide decision maker understanding risk potential consequence interdependency rippling effect within beyond enterprise boundary
Ultimately risk management aim establish maintain holistic view risk across enterprise capability performance objective achieved via resource investment decision
Today early stage understanding system engineering engineering management social science method weave together create system live evolve enterprise environment
The Risk Management Plan describes process fundamental step shown Figure intended enable engineering system accomplished within cost delivered time meet user need
In supporting Department Defense DoD civilian agency project program MITRE SEs found following minimum condition needed initiate continuously execute risk management successfully
With program increase chance identifying risk early goal objective achieved
It important MITRE SEs well project program leader keep minimum condition mind taking action appropriate role
In particular SE provide effective support follows MITRE Systems Engineering Guide Questions

It example transference
It purely mitigation case
The specialist library subroutine requested employed company join development team
Transference whole part plan transferred third party outside development team
Since specialist team member employee transference case

The risk avoidance strategy ensures part anticipated causing trouble project eliminated early advance
Risk avoidance ensures risk threat impact never occur project
In process avoidance complete change project delivery plan
On contrary risk acceptance management method acknowledges risk hand exists low probability occurrence
It also assumes occurs contained within short time impact minimized
Project team alter original plan

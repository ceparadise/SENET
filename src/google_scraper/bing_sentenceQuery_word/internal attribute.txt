In specification defines property element file
It may also refer set specific given instance
For clarity attribute correctly considered
An attribute frequently generally property property
However actual usage term attribute often treated equivalent depending technology discussed
An attribute object usually consists name value element type class name file name extension
For example computer graphic line object attribute thickness real value color descriptive value brown green value defined certain color model RGB dashing attribute etc
A circle object defined similar attribute plus origin radius
In attribute attached field block code like equivalent
Attributes accessible compiler programmatically
Users language see many example attribute used address concern mechanistic platform us
This creates false impression sole intended purpose
With attribute possible extend attribute
Their specific use metadata left developer cover wide range type information given application class member
The decision expose given attribute property also left developer decision use part larger application framework
Attributes implemented class derived
They often used service like interoperability queried runtime
The example show attribute defined C Positional parameter like first parameter type string parameter attribute constructor
Name parameter like Boolean parameter example property attribute constant value
Attributes contrasted XML documentation also defines metadata included compiled assembly therefore accessed programmatically
Display checked attribute property checkbox change
On many database system relative SQL table file row item column attribute
Both database code attribute synonymous property variable although attribute defined contain value subvalues
The first database
Two current platform include
In markup construct consisting pair exists within
Markup language use attribute describe data formatting data
A good example process XML assigning value property element
Note element value found separate end tag element
The element may number attribute set
If element question could considered property another entity let say element zero attribute property

Before delve attribute computer programming sense word let u first define word
A simple explanation term describes something
In computer programming element field file data type manipulated referenced way attribute
Let consider portrait How would describe person image
Brunette attractive couple characteristic come mind
These characteristic also considered attribute
Now let consider image sandwich Besides attribute might assign image
So exactly portrait photo sandwich relate computer programming
In computer programming element entity field file specific characteristic
For example web programming element assigned unique attribute
Computer programming attribute describe characteristic data whether file paragraph field
Let take closer look
The language used render webpage HTML HyperText Markup Language comprised various element paragraph unordered list image
These element represent item displayed web page
The paragraph element includes specific group characteristic attribute assigned
In former version language one specific attribute paragraph element align attribute
This attribute could set left right center justify
If attribute set right paragraph would aligned right rendered page
Get FREE access day create account
In separate programming language CSS Cascading Stylesheet attribute may also referenced
In either example attribute alignment seen communicated code
In database world attribute may refer single field table even table
An attribute field could preferred data type
For example attribute social security number field could limit nine character
Let look back attribute example provided original photo brunette attractive
The woman portrait described brunette
When hear term automatically connect color hair
Keeping mind must acknowledge attribute apply data type
We would apply hair color attribute sandwich would
It important note attribute may reserved specific data type
For example computer world paragraph would attribute last modified date
Last modified date attribute file
The available attribute may vary depending data type referenced
With various type data available many way described
Data whether file text table field manipulated referenced way
Each data type specific set attribute addressed

I read get length array I use attribute like
What attribute
Is class
An attribute another term field
It typically public constant public variable accessed directly
In particular case array Java actually object accessing public constant value represents length array
A class element object oriented programming aggregate attribute field public accessible method function also public private usually attribute
class like public attribute public method
Attribute public variable inside
length attribute variable int type
In context attribute simply mean data member object
Attribute synonym Attributes also data member property class
They Variables declared inside class
A class contains data field description property field data member field type name associated either state variable program run time
An attribute instance variable
Attributes term used alternativly property field data member class member
An abstract class type class used base class another class thus instantiated
To make class abstract keyword abstract used
Abstract class may one abstract method header line method body
The method header line end semicolon
Any class derived base class define method body way consistent header line using designated parameter returning correct data type return type void
An abstract method act place holder derived class expected override complete method
Example Java abstract public class Shape double area public abstract double getArea A variable belongs term used alternatively property field data member class member field instance variable You need declare attribute beginning class definition outside method

When referring internal private variable Java POJOs I used following term Is difference
If correct term use
Is different term use entity persisted
From field property attribute variable Yes
local field constant although technically wrong
It vague like attribute
Also know people like call local instance variable
This probably come emerging JVM FP language like Scala
generally private variable instance class
It mean getter setter
vague term
It easily confused XML Java Naming API
Try avoid using term
getter setter combination
There many combination finger getting tired If question prompted using JAXB wanting choose correct I question
The JAXB say field instance variable
A property pair private variable
A public member public therefore probably constant
Also JAXB attribute refers part XML element
It seems Java property general defined field least getter public method allows get value
Some people also say property need setter
For definition like context everything
Dietel Dietel nice way explaining field v variable
static variable instance variable known Section declared field required use one method class program save value call Section So class field static instance variable
declared class scope
Reference Dietel Dietel How To Program Early Objects Tenth Edition If take clue Hibernate Hibernate Object state field
Hibernate also map Java Bean style property DB Schema
Hibernate Access field object
If mapping done property hibernate us getter setter
must declared initialized used
Mostly class internal use
changed setter exposed getters
Here field price property
Similarly using In hibernate recommended way MAP using field private int id annotated Id Property control Java doc say Field data member class
A field non static instance variable
Field generally private variable instance class
Variables comprised field
Fields either either In conclusion key distinction variable whether field meaning whether inside method outside method
Basic Example excuse syntax I beginner Actually two term often used represent thing exceptional situation
A field store state object
Also field variable
So clear variable field
So looking type variable class variable instance variable local variable parameter variable see class variable instance variable affect state object
In word class instance variable change state object change
So say class variable instance variable field local variable parameter variable
If want understand deeply head source The question old another important difference variable field field get default value variable hand must initialized
My understanding I saying correct I might well A something declare default change different value also explicitly said final
In Java would So basically variable anything declared hold value
Method foo return variable
It return variable type Integer hold memory address new Integer Everything else see also variable listVariable aFinalVariableExample explained A field variable scope clear concrete
The variable returning method foo scope clear example I would call field
On hand iAmAlsoVariable local field limited scope method foo listVariable instance field scope field variable limited object scope
A property field accessed mutated
Any field expose getter setter property
I know attribute I would also like repeat understanding variable field property

In referenced
In paradigm object refers particular object combination variable function data structure
In management object table column association data database entity relating person age specific person
An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

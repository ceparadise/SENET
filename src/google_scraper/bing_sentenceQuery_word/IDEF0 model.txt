Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville shown
It perform trillion calculation per second
That ability help run computer model complex dynamic system Earth changing climate
Computers use math data computer instruction create representation event
They also predict happening could happen complex situation climate system spread rumor throughout town
And computer spit result without people wait year take big risk
The scientist build computer model start important feature whatever event hope represent
Those feature may weight football someone kick
Or might degree cloud cover typical region seasonal climate
Features change vary known
Next computer modeler identify rule control feature relationship
The researcher express rule math
The math built model rather simple mostly addition subtraction multiplication logarithm note Jon Lizaso
He work Technical University Madrid Spain
Logarithms express number power number help simplify calculation working big number
Even still much work one person
We talking probably thousand equation explains
mathematical expression use number relate two thing equal
But usually look complicated x z Solving even equation might take whole day rate one equation every second
And single mistake might throw answer way
More difficult math might bump time needed solve equation average minute
At rate solving equation could take nearly three week took time eat sleep
And one mistake might throw everything
In contrast common laptop computer perform billion operation per second
And one second Titan supercomputer Oak Ridge National Laboratory Tennessee trillion calculation
How much trillion
That many second would come million year
A computer model also need algorithm data
set instruction
They tell computer make decision calculation
Data fact statistic something
With calculation computer model make prediction specific situation
For instance might show simulate result particular football player kick
Computer model also deal dynamic situation changing variable
For example likely rain Friday
A weather model would run calculation changing factor one one various combination
After would compare finding run
After adjusting likely factor would issue prediction
The model would also rerun calculation Friday got closer
To measure model reliability scientist might computer run calculation thousand even million time
Researchers also could compare model prediction answer already know
If prediction closely match answer good sign
If researcher must work find missed
It could include enough variable relied much wrong one
Computer modeling deal
Scientists always learning experiment event real world
Researchers use knowledge improve computer model
The better computer model useful become
A group rule procedure solving problem series step
Algorithms used mathematics computer program figuring solution
The weather condition prevailing area general long period
An electronic device process information based rule stored device
A program run computer creates model simulation feature phenomenon event
A set instruction computer us perform analysis computation
The writing instruction known Facts statistic collected together analysis necessarily organized way give meaning
For digital information type stored computer data typically number stored binary code portrayed string zero one
In mathematics statement two quantity equal
In geometry equation often used determine shape curve surface
The power exponent one base number must multiplied produce another number
For instance base system must multiplied produce
So logarithm base system
In base logarithm would would
computing To try imitate condition function appearance something
Computer program referred
mathematics A letter used mathematical expression may take one different value
experiment A factor changed especially one allowed change scientific experiment
For instance measuring much insecticide might take kill fly researcher might change dose age insect exposed
Both dose age would variable experiment
Being almost like something
An object concept virtually real would almost true real quite
The term often used refer something modeled accomplished computer using number using part
So virtual motor would one could seen computer screen tested computer programming device made metal

initially abbreviation renamed refers family field
They cover wide range us functional modeling data simulation knowledge acquisition
These definition language developed funding although still commonly used well military agency
The recognized used component IDEF family language building address issue
IDEF refers family cover wide range us functional modeling data simulation knowledge acquisition
Eventually IDEF method defined In developed full
Some IDEF concept preliminary design
Some last effort new IDEF development toward establishing reliable method business constraint discovery design rationale capture human system interaction design network design
The method IDEF developed initial definition
IDEF originally stood initiated US Air Force Materials Laboratory Air Force Base Ohio Dan Shunk others
completed
IDEF product ICAM initiative
The recast IDEF abbreviation Integration DEFinition
The specific project produced IDEF ICAM project priority later renumbered
The subsequent Integrated Information Support System IISS project priority attempted create environment could run physical computing environment
Further development IDEF occurred project result experience gained application new modeling technique
The intent IISS effort create subsystem could used large number collaborating enterprise armed force friendly nation
At time ICAM effort numerous mostly incompatible method storing computer data TOTAL
The emerging promising way thinking structuring data easy efficient accurate access
yet emerged general standard data management
The ICAM program office deemed valuable create neutral way describing data content system
The emerging academic literature suggested method needed process way
Thus language created allow neutral description data structure could applied regardless storage method file access method
developed ICAM program priority Dr Robert Brown contract Dr Brown previously responsible development working
Rockwell chose pursue IMS marketable product served support contractor development subsequently took product successful developing market
Dr Brown credit Hughes colleague Mr Timothy Ramey inventor viable formalism modeling information structure
The two Hughes researcher built idea interaction many luminary field time
In particular draw following technique The effort develop resulted new method information modeling example use form reference information model manufacturing
This latter artifact developed Coleman Appleton Company DACOM acting Hughes direction Mr Ramey
Personnel DACOM became quite expert modeling subsequently produced training course accompanying material modeling technique
Experience revealed translation difficult originally anticipated
The beneficial value information modeling technique ability represent data independent data stored used
It provided data modeler data analyst way represent process
This allowed designer decide DBMS use nature data requirement understood thus reduced misfit data requirement capability limitation DBMS
The translation model database design however proved difficult
The functional modeling method designed model decision action activity organization system
It derived established graphic modeling language SADT developed
In original form includes definition graphical modeling language description comprehensive methodology developing model
The US Air Force commissioned SADT developer develop method analyzing communicating functional perspective system
assist organizing system analysis promote effective communication analyst customer simplified graphical device
To satisfy enhancement requirement identified project obtained license LDDT supporting software ADAM
LDDT developed Robert Brown The Database Design Group entirely outside IDEF program knowledge
LDDT combined element relational data model model generalization way specifically intended support data modeling transformation data model database design
The graphic syntax LDDT differed importantly LDDT contained interrelated modeling concept present
Mary Loomis wrote concise summary syntax semantics substantial subset LDDT using terminology compatible wherever possible
DACOM labeled result supplied ICAM program
Because IDEF program funded government technique
In addition ADAM software sold DACOM name Leverage number tool use representation technique data modeling
The IISS project actually produced working prototype information processing environment would run heterogeneous computing environment
Current advancement technique achieving goal ubiquity versatility across computing environment first demonstrated IISS
The third IDEF originally intended user interface modeling method
However since ICAM program needed simulation modeling tool resulting method representing time varying behavior resource manufacturing system providing framework specification math model based simulation
It intent methodology program within rectify situation limitation funding allow happen
As result lack method would support structuring description system major shortcoming IDEF system
The basic problem methodology point view need distinguish description system existing proposed supposed representative simulation model predict system
The latter focus former focus
The development came recognition modularity maintainability code reusability result paradigm realized traditional application
The proven ability programming paradigm support data level integration large complex also major factor widespread interest technology traditional data processing community
developed design tool software designer use language others
Since effective usage paradigm requires different thought process used conventional procedural standard methodology traditional hierarchical relational network sufficient
seek provide necessary facility support design decision making process
software engineering method develop maintain usable accurate domain
In field computer science ontology used capture specific along associated relationship meaning
In addition ontology capture help coordinate project standardizing creates opportunity reuse
The Ontology Capture Method developed reliably construct ontology way closely reflects human specific domain
In method ontology constructed capturing content certain assertion object property interrelationship representing content intuitive natural form
The method three main component A graphical language support conceptual ontology analysis structured text language detailed ontology characterization systematic procedure provides guideline effective ontology capture
method facilitate acquisition representation manipulation used development
Rationale reason justification underlying motivation excuse moved designer select particular strategy design feature
More simply rationale interpreted answer question Why design done manner Most design method focus design
final product rather design way
method posse conceptual resource linguistic capability needed applicable phase information system development process initial conceptualization preliminary detailed design activity
To extent detailed design decision software system relegated coding phase technique usable software construction process well
method producing design interaction user system operate
Systems characterized collection object perform function accomplish particular goal
The system user interacts system necessarily computer program
interaction designed three level specification within method
The first level defines philosophy system operation produce set model textual description overall system process
The second level design specifies scenario system use
The third level design design detailing
At level design provides library metaphor help user designer specify desired behavior term object whose behavior familiar
Metaphors provide model abstract concept term familiar concrete object experience
designed assist discovery analysis constraint
A primary motivation driving development acknowledgment collection constraint forge enterprise system generally poorly defined
The knowledge constraint exist constraint interact incomplete disjoint distributed often completely unknown
This situation necessarily alarming
Just living organism need aware genetic autonomous constraint govern certain behavior organization perform well without explicit knowledge glue structure system
In order modify business predictable manner however knowledge constraint critical knowledge genetics genetic engineer
method target modeling design
It used model existing envisioned network
It help network designer investigate potential network design document design rationale
The fundamental goal research project developed perceived need good network design implemented quickly accurately

form intended ensure continuing function piece unforeseen circumstance
Defensive programming practice often used high availability safety security needed
Defensive programming approach improve software source code term Overly defensive programming however introduces unnecessary code error impossible even happen thus wasting runtime maintenance cost
There also risk code trap prevents many exception potentially resulting unnoticed incorrect result
Secure programming subset defensive programming concerned
That say security concern necessarily safety availability software may allowed fail certain way
As kind defensive programming avoiding bug primary objective however motivation much reduce likelihood failure normal operation safety concern reduce attack surface programmer must assume software might misused actively reveal bug bug could exploited maliciously
The function result undefined behavior input character
Some novice programmer may feel problem supposing user enter long input
This particular bug demonstrates vulnerability enables
Here solution example Offensive programming considered category defensive programming added emphasis certain error
In practice error outside program control handled user input software well data within program line defense trusted methodology
Here defensive programming technique If existing code tested known work reusing may reduce chance bug introduced
However reusing code good practice also amplifies damage potential attack initial code
Before reusing old source code library APIs configuration forth must considered old work valid reuse likely prone problem
Legacy problem problem inherent old design expected work today requirement especially old design developed tested requirement mind
Many software product experienced problem old legacy source code example Notable example legacy problem Malicious user likely invent new kind representation incorrect data
For example program check requested file cracker might pas another variant file name like
library employed avoid bug due input
Assume code construct appear problem prone similar known vulnerability etc
bug potential security flaw
The basic rule thumb I aware type
I must protect I know I must proactive

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I attempting identify element software engineering I think overlooked emphasized taught typical undergraduate course work CS SE
What I came concept defensive programming
I would like hear community option defensive program specific technique use regular basis
Also I would know language specific technique
Edit Just clear
I looking lesson defensive program
I understand
I hoping would discussion different method member community employ find valuable
Here technique I use
Keep mind I use C almost exclusively
Coding standard
You might initially think anything defensive programming
To illustrate suppose coding standard requires prepend variable name type variable IntValue UIntValue
The convention allows easily spot potential promotion rule issue like IntX IntValue UIntValue Use preprocessor macro constant
Personally I think also make program readable maintainable also provided safety net
You sure area code use macro updated change value
Other us preprocessor macro also provided defensive attribute code
Some technique built right language static variable function declaration data encapsulation
Of course obvious one including validating input output
As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
Take look chapter Defensive programming
For best source kind technique far
Small page main idea
Some main concept strictly copied book word may better buy book read original But key concept lay whether trust code working
I suppose never many assertion program Add tight invariant class take granted whatever use null one time another Parts defensive programming much incorporated accepted learning curriculum
Defensive programming entail many different thing even though revolve around unexpected
Mainstream language like Java C explicit come defensive programming philosophy
You definitely use exception code
Assertions defensive programming caveat use sparingly outside test code appropriate
Two aspect traditional defensive programming handled different name
The first simply
I wo go everything involved writing secure code
Another Design By Contract
This method programming out due rise Agile seen much design
Part reason first many previous need enforce contract imperative programming handled OOP class hierarchy impossible get bad state need check
Second many traditional need check parameter like buffer overflow automatically throw exception runtime thus need checked coder runtime checking
Finally drive agile towards development sometimes impossible generate unit test condition expected happen
In case piece defensive code cause decrease bad thing

This paper describes toolkit help improve robustness code DoS attack
We observe developing software programmer primarily focus functionality
Protecting code attack often considered responsibility OS firewall intrusion detection system
As result many DoS vulnerability discovered system attacked damage done
Instead reacting attack fact paper argues better solution make software defensive systematically injecting protection mechanism code
Our toolkit provides API programmer use annotate code
At runtime annotation serve sensor actuator watching resource abuse taking appropriate action abuse detected
Experience three network service demonstrates effectiveness toolkit

learn share knowledge build career
I always advised programmer pay concentration
What extend considered practicing
And one important question consider coding
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
Have look Defensive programming idea developer make assumption absolutely necessary
In addition developer preemptively creates code anticipates potential problem also specification change
As rule thumb catch thinking always true write place
That probably core defensive programming
If defensive programming meant one thing
good article use
There many situation good use assertion
This section cover Defensive programming mean check file exists permission open instead trying open catching eventual exception

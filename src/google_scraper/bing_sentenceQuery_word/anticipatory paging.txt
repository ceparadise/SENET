In scheme computer store retrieves data use
In scheme operating system retrieves data secondary storage called
Paging important part implementation modern operating system using secondary storage let program exceed size available physical memory
For simplicity main memory called RAM acronym secondary storage called disk shorthand concept depend whether term apply literally specific computer system
introduced paging first mass market memory page concept computer architecture regardless whether page moved RAM disk
For example instruction bit comprised memory address selected one word
This zone memory called
This use term rare
In swapping early virtual memory technique
An entire program would RAM disk another one would
A program would current execution would suspended RAM use another program
A program might include multiple occupy memory different time
Overlays method paging RAM disk merely minimizing program use RAM
Subsequent architecture used individual program segment became unit exchanged disk RAM
A segment program entire code segment data segment sometimes large data structure
These segment resident RAM requiring additional computation movement remedy
The invention let processor operate arbitrary page anywhere RAM seemingly contiguous space
These page became unit exchanged disk RAM
When program try reference page currently present RAM processor treat invalid memory reference transfer control program operating system
The operating system must When page frame use operating system must select page frame reuse page program need
If evicted page frame program hold data program modified since read RAM word become dirty must written disk freed
If program later reference evicted page another page fault occurs page must read back RAM
The method operating system us select page frame reuse important efficiency
The operating system predicts page frame least likely needed soon often LRU algorithm algorithm based program
To increase responsiveness paging system may predict page needed soon preemptively loading RAM program reference
After completing initialization program operate small number code data page compared total memory program requires
The page frequently accessed called
When working set small percentage system total number page virtual memory system work efficiently insignificant amount computing spent resolving page fault
As working set grows resolving page fault remains manageable growth reach critical point
Then fault go dramatically time spent resolving overwhelms time spent computing program written
This condition referred
Thrashing occurs program work huge data structure large working set cause continual page fault drastically slow system
Satisfying page fault may require freeing page soon disk
Thrashing also used context virtual memory system example describe issue computing networking
A worst case imagined comparable mainframe
An execute instruction crossing page boundary could point move instruction also cross page boundary set move data source cross page boundary target cross page boundary
This single instruction reference eight page RAM cause page fault
If operating system could allocate eight page program remedying page fault would discard another page instruction need restart instruction would fault
To decrease excessive paging resolve thrashing problem user increase number page available per program either running fewer program concurrently increasing amount RAM computer
In environment many user may execute program written code data separate page
To minimize use RAM user share single copy program
Each process set page address code point single shared copy page address data point different physical page process
The first computer support paging jointly developed
The machine associative memory one entry word page
The Supervisor handled interruption managed transfer page core drum order provide store program
Paging feature since
Windows creates named use swap file
It generally found may appear elsewhere typically WINDOWS directory
Its size depends much swap space system setting selected user Enhanced Virtual Memory
If user move deletes file appear next time Windows started The permanent swap file corrupt
The user prompted choose whether delete file whether exists
use similar file setting located Control Panel System Performance tab Virtual Memory
Windows automatically set size page file start size physical memory expand physical memory necessary
If user run application system low physical memory preferable manually set size value higher default
The file used paging family
The default location page file root directory partition Windows installed
Windows configured use free space available drive pagefiles
It required however boot partition
drive containing Windows directory pagefile system configured write either kernel full memory dump
Windows us paging file temporary storage memory dump
When system rebooted Windows copy memory dump pagefile separate file free space used pagefile
In default configuration Windows pagefile allowed expand beyond initial allocation necessary
If happens gradually become heavily potentially cause performance problem
The common advice given avoid set single locked pagefile size Windows expand
However pagefile expands filled default configuration total amount physical memory
Thus total demand virtual memory must exceed computer physical memory pagefile expand
The fragmentation pagefile occurs expands temporary
As soon expanded region longer use next reboot sooner additional disk space allocation freed pagefile back original state
Locking pagefile size problematic Windows application request memory total size physical memory pagefile leading failed request allocate memory may cause application system process fail
Also pagefile rarely read written sequential order performance advantage completely sequential page file minimal
However large pagefile generally allows use application penalty beside using disk space
While fragmented pagefile may issue fragmentation variable size page file time create number fragmented block drive causing file become fragmented
For reason contiguous pagefile better providing size allocated large enough accommodate need application
The required disk space may easily allocated system recent specification
system GB memory GB pagefile GB disk drive system GB memory GB pagefile TB disk space
In example system using disk space pagefile maximum
page file also occasionally recommended improve performance Windows system chronically using much memory total physical memory
This view ignores fact aside temporary result expansion pagefile become fragmented time
In general performance concern related pagefile access much effectively dealt adding physical memory
system operating system use term swap describe act moving memory page RAM disk region disk page stored
In system common dedicate entire partition hard disk swapping
These partition called
Many system entire hard drive dedicated swapping separate data drive containing swap partition
A hard drive dedicated swapping called swap drive scratch drive
Some system support swapping swap partition others also support swapping file
The Linux kernel support virtually unlimited number swap backends device file supporting time assignment backend priority
When kernel need swap page physical memory us backend available free space
If multiple swap backends assigned priority used fashion somewhat similar storage layout providing improved performance long underlying device efficiently accessed parallel
From perspective swap file version later Linux kernel virtually fast swap partition limitation swap file contiguously allocated underlying file system
To increase performance swap file kernel keep map placed underlying device access directly thus bypassing cache avoiding filesystem overhead
Regardless recommends swap partition used
When residing HDDs rotational magnetic medium device one benefit using swap partition ability place contiguous HDD area provide higher data throughput faster seek time
However administrative flexibility swap file outweigh certain advantage swap partition
For example swap file placed mounted file system set desired size added changed needed
Swap partition flexible enlarged without using partitioning tool introduce various complexity potential downtime
When system memory highly insufficient current task large portion memory activity go slow swap system become practically unable execute task even CPU idle
When every process waiting swap system considered
Swap death happen due incorrectly configured
The original description swapping death problem relates memory X swap every keystroke requires Linux read swap processed system practically unresponsive even actually executing task normally
us multiple swap file
The default installation place root partition though possible place instead separate partition device
introduced new system allocating RAM defragmenting physical memory
It still us flat shared address space defragmented
It based paging memory allows swapping
Paging implemented may lock system physical memory used
Swap memory could activated deactivated moment allowing user choose use physical RAM
The backing store virtual memory operating system typically many order slower
Additionally using mechanical storage device introduces several millisecond hard disk
Therefore desirable reduce eliminate swapping practical
Some operating system offer setting influence kernel decision
Many operating system example allow using multiple storage device swap space parallel increase performance
In older virtual memory operating system space swap backing store reserved program allocate memory runtime data
Operating system vendor typically issue guideline much swap space allocated
Paging one way allowing size address used process process virtual address space logical address space different amount main memory actually installed particular computer physical address space
In system size process virtual address space much larger available main memory
For example A computer true addressing may addressable unit RAM installed
An example processor without PAE
In case processor able address RAM installed
However even case paging used create virtual memory GB
For instance many program may running concurrently
Together may require GB RAM
A paging system make efficient decision memory relegate secondary storage leading best use installed RAM
Although processor example address RAM beyond GB operating system may provide service program envision larger memory file grow beyond limit installed RAM
The operating system let program manipulate data file arbitrarily using paging bring part file RAM necessary
A computer main memory larger virtual address space process machine system using processor
This nullifies significant advantage virtual memory since single process use main memory amount virtual address space
Such system often use paging technique obtain secondary benefit The size cumulative total virtual address space still limited amount secondary storage available

Among many exist today one frequently used
By form memory management scheme computer retrieve store data secondary storage space use main memory
In system retrieved data secondary storage form equal sized block known long time back paging came existence system used stuff entire program storage contiguously
This used give rise many problem related storage fragmentation
come effective solution address issue
Sometimes happens certain page currently mapped physical memory RAM
It may also happen program may want access page time function begin
The situation arises program try access inaccessible page known page fault
This viable thing happen operating system must find way address without making whole affair obvious program
In order operating system must able determine location data secondary storage acquire empty page frame RAM hold obtained data load sought data available page frame update page table show new data lastly return control program
It always possible page frame RAM empty perform corrective operation empty page frame vital
What choose page frame none empty
This require choosing page expected used anytime near future
Paging system use various page algorithm part work
These include demand paging anticipatory paging free page queue page stealing pre cleaning thrashing
During use demand paging paging happens time data requested
There preemptive loading time case
In case anticipatory paging also known swap prefetch us technique preloading non resident page process probably going used near future
The benefit tends reduce number page fault process experience
Free page queue refers number page frame area available occurrence page fault
many advantage name
The foremost advantage paging allows physical address space process
This cut problem storage fragmentation

Similarly smallest contiguous block memory page mapped operating system
A transfer page main memory auxiliary store hard disk drive referred swapping
Page size usually determined processor architecture
Traditionally page system uniform size example
However processor design often allow two sometimes simultaneous page size due benefit
There several point factor choosing best page size
Most operating system allow program discover page size runtime
This allows program use memory efficiently aligning allocation size reducing overall internal fragmentation page
system may use system function illustrated following example written programming language
In many Unix system command line utility used
For example return page size byte
operating system family may use system function
Some support multiple page size including page significantly larger standard page size
The available page size depend instruction set architecture processor type operating addressing mode
The operating system selects one size size supported architecture
Note processor implement defined larger page size
This support larger page known Linux terminology allows best world reducing pressure sometimes increasing speed much depending application allocation size large allocation still keeping memory usage reasonable level small allocation

In us decide memory page page sometimes called swap write disk memory need allocated
happens requested page memory free page used satisfy allocation either none number free page lower threshold
When page selected replacement paged referenced paged read disk involves waiting completion
This determines page replacement algorithm le time waiting better algorithm
A page replacement algorithm look limited information access page provided hardware try guess page replaced minimize total number page miss balancing cost primary storage processor time algorithm
The page replacing problem typical competitive analysis perspective sense optimal deterministic algorithm known
Page replacement algorithm hot topic research debate
That mostly ended development sophisticated least recently used approximation algorithm
Since basic assumption made traditional page replacement algorithm invalidated resulting revival research
In particular following trend behavior underlying hardware software affected performance page replacement algorithm Requirements page replacement algorithm changed due difference operating system architecture
In particular modern OS kernel unified virtual memory file system cache requiring page replacement algorithm select page among page user program virtual address space cached file
The latter page specific property
For example locked write ordering requirement imposed
Moreover goal page replacement minimize total time waiting memory take account memory requirement imposed kernel allocate memory
As result page replacement modern kernel tends work level general purpose kernel memory allocator rather higher level virtual memory subsystem
Replacement algorithm
When process incurs page fault local page replacement algorithm selects replacement page belongs process group process sharing
A global replacement algorithm free select page memory
Local page replacement assumes form memory partitioning determines many page assigned given process group process
Most popular form partitioning algorithm based model
The advantage local page replacement scalability process handle page fault independently leading consistent performance process
However global page replacement efficient overall system basis
Most replacement algorithm simply return target page result
This mean target page contains data written stable storage page reclaimed initiated send page stable storage page
In early day virtual memory time spent cleaning much concern virtual memory first implemented system channel stable storage cleaning customarily overlapped paging
Contemporary commodity hardware hand support full duplex transfer cleaning target page becomes issue
To deal situation various policy implemented
Precleaning mechanism start dirty page likely replaced soon
The idea time precleaned page actually selected replacement complete page clean
Precleaning assumes possible identify page replaced
Precleaning eager waste bandwidth writing page manage get selected replacement
Some system use page actually requested loading RAM
Other system attempt reduce latency guessing page RAM likely needed soon page RAM page requested
This often combination guess page currently RAM likely needed soon storage
When page fault occurs anticipatory paging system bring referenced page also next consecutive page analogous CPU
The mechanism go even loading page even consecutive likely needed soon
The h k problem generalization model paging problem Let h k positive integer
We measure performance algorithm cache size relative
If provide optimal page replacement algorithm strictly le resource
The h k problem way measure online algorithm performs comparing performance optimal algorithm specifically separately parameterizing cache size online algorithm optimal algorithm
Marking algorithm general class paging algorithm
For page associate bit called mark
Initially set page unmarked
During stage page request mark page first requested stage
A marking algorithm algorithm never page marked page
If ALG marking algorithm cache size k OPT optimal algorithm cache size h ALG
So every marking algorithm attains ratio
LRU marking algorithm FIFO marking algorithm
An algorithm conservative consecutive request sequence containing k fewer distinct page reference algorithm incur k fewer page fault
If ALG conservative algorithm cache size k OPT optimal algorithm cache ALG
So every conservative algorithm attains ratio
LRU FIFO CLOCK conservative algorithm
There variety page replacement algorithm The theoretically optimal page replacement algorithm also known OPT replacement algorithm optimal page replacement policy algorithm work follows page need swapped swap page whose next use occur farthest future
For example page going used next second swapped page going used within next second
This algorithm implemented general purpose operating system impossible compute reliably long page going used except software run system either known beforehand amenable static analysis memory reference pattern class application allowing analysis
Despite limitation algorithm exist offer performance operating system keep track page referenced program us data decide page swap subsequent run
This algorithm offer performance first run program program memory reference pattern relatively consistent time run
Analysis paging problem also done field
Efficiency randomized online algorithm paging problem measured using
The recently used NRU page replacement algorithm algorithm favour keeping page memory recently used
This algorithm work following principle page referenced referenced bit set page marking referenced
Similarly page modified written modified bit set
The setting bit usually done hardware although possible software level well
At certain fixed time interval timer interrupt trigger clear referenced bit page page referenced within current timer interval marked referenced bit
When page need replaced divide page four class Although seem possible page modified yet referenced happens class page referenced bit cleared timer interrupt
The NRU algorithm pick random page lowest category removal
So four page category NRU algorithm replace page page exists
Note algorithm implies modified within last timer interval page le important page intensely referenced
NRU marking algorithm
The simplest algorithm FIFO algorithm
The FIFO page replacement algorithm algorithm requires little bookkeeping part
The idea obvious name operating system keep track page memory queue recent arrival back oldest arrival front
When page need replaced page front queue oldest page selected
While FIFO cheap intuitive performs poorly practical application
Thus rarely used unmodified form
This algorithm experience
In simple word page fault frame memory longest replaced
FIFO page replacement algorithm used operating system modification
Partial second chance provided skipping limited number entry valid translation table reference additionally page displaced process working set systemwide pool recovered already
FIFO conservative algorithm
A modified form FIFO page replacement algorithm known page replacement algorithm fare relatively better FIFO little cost improvement
It work looking front queue FIFO instead immediately paging page check see referenced bit set
If set page swapped
Otherwise referenced bit cleared page inserted back queue new page process repeated
This also thought circular queue
If page referenced bit set second encounter first page list page swapped referenced bit cleared
If page reference bit cleared second chance algorithm degenerate pure FIFO
As name suggests give every page old page referenced probably use swapped new page referenced
Clock efficient version FIFO page constantly pushed back list performs general function
The clock algorithm keep circular list page memory hand iterator pointing last examined page frame list
When page fault occurs empty frame exist R referenced bit inspected hand location
If R new page put place page hand point
Otherwise R bit cleared clock hand incremented process repeated page replaced
CLOCK conservative algorithm
The least recently used LRU page replacement algorithm though similar name NRU differs fact LRU keep track page usage short period time NRU look usage last clock interval
LRU work idea page heavily used past instruction likely used heavily next instruction
While LRU provide performance theory almost good rather expensive implement practice
There implementation method algorithm try reduce cost yet keep much performance possible
The expensive method linked list method us linked list containing page memory
At back list least recently used page front recently used page
The cost implementation lie fact item list moved every memory reference process
Another method requires hardware support follows suppose hardware counter incremented every instruction
Whenever page accessed acquires value equal counter time page access
Whenever page need replaced selects page lowest counter swap
With present hardware feasible OS need examine counter every page cache memory
Because implementation cost one may consider algorithm like follow similar LRU offer cheaper implementation
One important advantage LRU algorithm amenable full statistical analysis
It proven example LRU never result page fault OPT algorithm N proportional number page managed pool
On hand LRU weakness performance tends degenerate many quite common reference pattern
For example N page LRU pool application executing loop array N page cause page fault every access
As loop large array common much effort put modifying LRU work better situation
Many proposed LRU modification try detect looping reference pattern switch suitable replacement algorithm like Most Recently Used MRU
A comparison ARC algorithm LRU MQ LRFU found Megiddo Modha
LRU marking algorithm
Random replacement algorithm replaces random page memory
This eliminates overhead cost tracking page reference
Usually fare better FIFO looping memory reference better LRU although generally LRU performs better practice
us global LRU approximation fall back random replacement LRU performance degenerate processor used random replacement policy Rhodehamel
The frequently used NFU page replacement algorithm requires counter every page one counter initially set
At clock interval page referenced within interval counter incremented
In effect counter keep track frequently page used
Thus page lowest counter swapped necessary
The main problem NFU keep track frequency use without regard time span use
Thus compiler page heavily used first pas needed second pas favoured page comparably lightly used second pas higher frequency counter
This result poor performance
Other common scenario exist NFU perform similarly OS
Thankfully similar better algorithm exists description follows
The frequently used algorithm generates fewer page fault least recently used page replacement algorithm page table contains null pointer value
The aging algorithm descendant NFU algorithm modification make aware time span use
Instead incrementing counter page referenced putting equal emphasis page reference regardless time reference counter page first shifted right divided adding referenced bit left binary number
For instance page referenced bit past clock tick referenced counter look like
Page reference closer present time impact page reference long ago
This ensures page referenced recently though le frequently referenced higher priority page frequently referenced past
Thus page need swapped page lowest counter chosen
The following code simulates aging algorithm
Counters initialized updated described via using
In given example page clock tick function print following output list clock tick individual counter value page representation
Note aging differs LRU sense aging keep track reference latest depending bit size processor integer time interval
Consequently two page may referenced counter even though one page referenced interval ago interval ago
Generally speaking knowing usage within past interval sufficient making good decision page swap
Thus aging offer performance moderate price
The basic idea behind algorithm Locality Reference used LRU difference LDF locality based distance used reference
In LDF replace page longest distance current page
If two page distance page next current page rotation get replaced
For detail Many technique discussed assume presence reference bit associated page
Some hardware bit efficient use requires technique operate well without one
One notable example hardware running
This system know page modified necessarily page read
Its approach known Secondary Page Caching
Pages removed working set memory generally placed list remaining physical memory time
Removing page working set technically operation effectively identifies page candidate
A page whose backing store still valid whose content dirty otherwise need preserved placed tail Free Page List
A page requires writing backing store placed Modified Page List
These action typically triggered size Free Page List fall adjustable threshold
Pages may selected working set removal essentially random fashion expectation poor choice made future reference may retrieve page Free Modified list removed physical memory
A page referenced way removed Free Modified list placed back process working set
The Modified Page List additionally provides opportunity write page backing store group one page increasing efficiency
These page placed Free Page List
The sequence page work way head Free Page List resembles result LRU NRU mechanism overall effect similarity algorithm described earlier
Another example used
The lack hardware functionality made providing two page table page table neither referenced bit page table required bit present
The emulated bit table set page fault
In order get page fault clearing emulated bit second table revoke access right corresponding page implemented altering native table
The working set process set page expected used process time interval
The working set model page replacement algorithm strict sense actually kind

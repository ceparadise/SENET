Lessons learned huddle recorded reviewed weekly team meeting
Weekly staff meeting used discus lesson learned huddle well identify issue beyond care team
For example care team huddle may identify problem location computer need deflect patient away team due reaching limit supply
Staff meeting good place raise staffing issue

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


Karma Questions I want become computer scientist I want know normal day computer scientist like
Also I want know feel work big company Microsoft Apple Facebook etc
Student New York New York Karma Questions Enter phone number email send message update question


myEmail phone number email address required
United States America Software Engineer Google There always variation course multiple answer able build picture
I majored Computer Science college working Software Engineer Google
This common path technically different going Computer Science job
That would likely involve lot theoretical work I
On typical day Google I start checking email large part company California three hour later use email lot tends large amount built night I went home figure project start working
Sometimes I program needed run hour execute overnight I base start result reported
The division Google I large complicated program work revolves around
I usually handful different project involving
Right I adding feature customer investigating whether change one source data another one improving testing tool main program make better use Google infrastructure I involved finding place clean code base addition various small task
On given day I pick project based people waiting I get result old test simply I feel like I make progress start working
I actually spend much time writing new code main program I spend lot time examining see work add new piece writing test small change I make
I also write lot smaller program help thing like data analysis making tool others use
I usually work couple project different time day I get stuck one meeting usually happens least day I use boundary spur shift project
I work around hour day though vary slightly depending I making particularly large amount progress something want leave
I let make habit staying longer hour though since engineer degrades quality life
While working I try stay fairly focused though variety way take small mental break quick chat friend online work person work online people work website like Google News
I find I productive I give brief chance rest
So
Get work check email cycle among project mean writing code looking data I go home
I greatly enjoy though everyone
Thank much Eric
Senior Network Engineer Zynga Greetings Eddie
I pleased see variety answer question
Having weathered late worked several tech startup large r company since I happy ofder personal response question
In addition linear often repetitive task outlined thread professional I add variable On Call generally applies computer science type bona fide engineer work within Global Foundation Services GFS also sometimes referred DevEng DevOps SiteOps TechOps ITOps
The vast majority Tech organization operational infrastructure consists team On Call engineer share rotational Duty Roster defines escalation path Whom Shall I Contact Customer Affecting Outage
On Call engineer Network Engineering Site Reliability Engineering SRE typically support one company revenue stream Corporate Production
Production resource router switch firewall virtualized application server cluster database cluster typically reside physically secured datacenter environment
When something break On Call team called immediate service
The longer issue unscheduled website related maintenance example go unresolved revenue lost thoroughly company reputation damaged
As On Call Network Engineer I wear multiple hat often simultaneously I worked long hour straight scenario past however average day hour
proactive versus reactive work
Within dynamic context Internet environment remain long
The constant pace Big Business demand equipment data circuit upgraded seemingly endlessly
If think might enjoy almost academic work mind frequent stress occasional GRUELING hour career Network Engineering Site Operations may prove aspiration
Fiscal compensation reasonably good certainly quite acceptable however type work I perform daily considered utterly unacceptable many value insist upon static unchanging predictable seems popular term de rigueur
I know fewer peer held similar post endured divorce spouse specifically due interruptive unpredictable nature work
Your mileage may vary
I hope help
Good luck
Client Education Manager It truly depends type environment working
With related job around computer science find working ether waterfall agile based senario
Under waterfall I like call waterfail mentality find coding several project much communication client besides beginning end project
If working environment like important developed promised
There room change
The method called Agile
This iterative based mentality work one project time communicate client thoughout project
You still find coding lot interaction client throughout project
Note reflect type work implementing way work delivered
Software Engineer Test Sqrrl I test engineer experience bit different average developer lot procedure I get office around meeting talk yesterday planning today anything blocking u something stopping u moving forward completing task
It short meeting make sure team page
After I check email engineer startup mean inbox usually blissfully empty
I worked Amazon though I sift good amount email every morning
Then I pick whichever project I working day
We try avoid meeting afternoon startup even ca time
At bigger company meeting generally occur throughout day
My project usually consist writing automated test exercise new feature diagnosing test failure reviewing developer code occasionally manual testing release feature set automated testing wo work well
It definitely varies day day boring
I like say I get paid break people stuff actually fairly accurate
I generally office hour day typical startup ideal promote healthy balance work rest life
I sometimes office crunch time say working make deadline time rare perk make
Software developer general spoiled rotten
So summarise get sync team check email work project write code read code test code look data go home around pm
Much like Eric Google I enjoy much everybody

used design new software test evaluate quality existing software test
Mutation testing involves modifying program small way
Each mutated version called test detect reject mutant causing behavior original version differ mutant
This called mutant
Test suite measured percentage mutant kill
New test designed kill additional mutant
Mutants based either mimic typical programming error using wrong operator variable name force creation valuable test dividing expression zero
The purpose help tester develop effective test locate weakness test data used program section code seldom never accessed
Mutation testing form
Most article program mutation program modified
A general definition using rule defined syntactic structure make systematic change software artifact
Mutation analysis applied problem usually applied testing
So defined using mutation analysis design new software test evaluate existing software test
Thus mutation analysis testing applied design model specification database test XML type software artifact although program mutation common
Tests created verify correctness implementation given software system creation test still pose question whether test correct sufficiently cover requirement originated implementation
This technological problem instance deeper philosophical problem named Who guard guard
In context mutation testing pioneered locate expose weakness
The theory mutant introduced without behavior generally program affected indicated either code mutated never executed dead code test suite unable locate fault represented mutant
For function scale large number mutant usually introduced large program leading compilation execution extremely large number copy program
This problem expense mutation testing reduced practical use method software testing increased use framework led creation mutation testing tool many programming language way test individual portion application
Mutation testing originally proposed Richard Lipton student first developed published DeMillo Lipton Sayward
The first implementation mutation testing tool part work titled
Recently availability massive computing power resurgence mutation analysis within computer science community work done define method applying mutation testing
In company called Certess part extended many principle hardware verification domain
Whereas mutation analysis expects detect difference output produced Certess extends verifying checker testbench actually detect difference
This extension mean three stage verification namely activation propagation detection evaluated
They called functional qualification
considered special case mutation testing
In fuzzing message data exchanged inside communication interface inside software instance mutated catch failure difference processing data
evolved concept fully stateful mutation testing platform complete monitor thoroughly exercising protocol implementation
Mutation testing based two hypothesis
The first hypothesis
This hypothesis state software fault introduced experienced programmer due small syntactic error
The second hypothesis called
The coupling effect asserts simple fault cascade form emergent fault
Subtle important fault also revealed mutant support coupling effect
mutant enabled creating mutant one mutation
Mutation testing done selecting set mutation operator applying source program one time applicable piece source code
The result applying one mutation operator program called
If test suite able detect change
one test fails mutant said
For example consider following code fragment The condition mutation operator would replace produce following mutant Now test kill mutant following three condition met These condition collectively called
requires first second condition satisfied
requires three condition satisfied
Strong mutation powerful since ensures test suite really catch problem
Weak mutation closely related method
It requires much le computing power ensure test suite satisfies weak mutation testing strong mutation testing
However case possible find test case could kill mutant
The resulting program behaviorally equivalent original one
Such mutant called
Equivalent mutant detection one biggest obstacle practical usage mutation testing
The effort needed check mutant equivalent high even small program
A systematic literature review wide range approach overcome Equivalent Mutant Problem presented identified relevant technique article three category technique detecting DEM suggesting SEM avoiding equivalent mutant generation AEMG
The experiment indicated Higher Order Mutation general JudyDiffOp strategy particular provide promising approach Equivalent Mutant Problem
Many mutation operator explored researcher
Here example mutation operator imperative language These mutation operator also called traditional mutation operator
There also mutation operator language concurrent construction complex object like container etc
Operators container called mutation operator
For example muJava tool offer various mutation operator Access Modifier Change Type Cast Operator Insertion Type Cast Operator Deletion
Mutation operator also developed perform security vulnerability testing program

In inspired process belongs larger class EA
Genetic algorithm commonly used generate solution relying operator
In genetic algorithm called individual creature optimization problem evolved toward better solution
Each candidate solution set property mutated altered traditionally solution represented binary string encoding also possible
The evolution usually start population randomly generated individual population iteration called
In generation every individual population evaluated fitness usually value optimization problem solved
The fit individual selected current population individual genome modified possibly randomly mutated form new generation
The new generation candidate solution used next iteration
Commonly algorithm terminates either maximum number generation produced satisfactory fitness level reached population
A typical genetic algorithm requires A standard representation candidate solution
Arrays type structure used essentially way
The main property make genetic representation convenient part easily aligned due fixed size facilitates simple operation
Variable length representation may also used crossover implementation complex case
representation explored representation explored mix linear chromosome tree explored
Once genetic representation fitness function defined GA proceeds initialize population solution improve repetitive application mutation crossover inversion selection operator
The population size depends nature problem typically contains several hundred thousand possible solution
Often initial population generated randomly allowing entire range possible solution
Occasionally solution may seeded area optimal solution likely found
During successive generation portion existing population breed new generation
Individual solution selected process solution measured typically likely selected
Certain selection method rate fitness solution preferentially select best solution
Other method rate random sample population former process may
The fitness function defined genetic representation measure represented solution
The fitness function always problem dependent
For instance one want maximize total value object put knapsack fixed capacity
A representation solution might array bit bit represents different object value bit represents whether object knapsack
Not every representation valid size object may exceed capacity knapsack
The solution sum value object knapsack representation valid otherwise
In problem hard even impossible define fitness expression case may used determine fitness function value
used determine air resistance vehicle whose shape encoded phenotype even used
The next step generate second generation population solution selected combination also called recombination
For new solution produced pair parent solution selected breeding pool selected previously
By producing child solution using method crossover mutation new solution created typically share many characteristic parent
New parent selected new child process continues new population solution appropriate size generated
Although reproduction method based use two parent biology inspired research suggests two parent generate higher quality chromosome
These process ultimately result next generation population chromosome different initial generation
Generally average fitness increased procedure population since best organism first generation selected breeding along small proportion le fit solution
These le fit solution ensure genetic diversity within genetic pool parent therefore ensure genetic diversity subsequent generation child
Opinion divided importance crossover versus mutation
There many reference support importance search
Although crossover mutation known main genetic operator possible use operator regrouping migration genetic algorithm
It worth tuning parameter probability probability population size find reasonable setting problem class worked
A small mutation rate may lead nature
A recombination rate high may lead premature convergence genetic algorithm
A mutation rate high may lead loss good solution unless employed
In addition main operator heuristic may employed make calculation faster robust
The heuristic penalizes crossover candidate solution similar encourages population diversity help prevent premature convergence le optimal solution
This generational process repeated termination condition reached
Common terminating condition Genetic algorithm simple implement behavior difficult understand
In particular difficult understand algorithm frequently succeed generating solution high fitness applied practical problem
The building block hypothesis BBH consists Goldberg describes heuristic follows Despite lack consensus regarding validity hypothesis consistently evaluated used reference throughout year
Many example proposed attempt provide environment hypothesis would hold
Although good result reported class problem skepticism concerning generality practicality hypothesis explanation GAs efficiency still remains
Indeed reasonable amount work attempt understand limitation perspective estimation distribution algorithm
There limitation use genetic algorithm compared alternative optimization algorithm The simplest algorithm represents chromosome
Typically numeric parameter represented though possible use representation
The floating point representation natural
The notion genetic algorithm offered really misnomer really represent building block theory proposed
This theory without support though based theoretical experimental result see
The basic algorithm performs crossover mutation bit level
Other variant treat chromosome list number index instruction table node imaginable
Crossover mutation performed respect data element boundary
For data type specific variation operator designed
Different chromosomal data type seem work better worse different specific problem domain
When representation integer used often employed
In way small change integer readily affected mutation crossover
This found help prevent premature convergence called many simultaneous mutation crossover event must occur order change chromosome better solution
Other approach involve using array number instead bit string represent chromosome
Results theory schema suggest general smaller alphabet better performance initially surprising researcher good result obtained using chromosome
This explained set real value finite population chromosome forming selection recombination dominant much lower cardinality would expected floating point representation
An expansion Genetic Algorithm accessible problem domain obtained complex encoding solution pool concatenating several type heterogenously encoded gene one chromosome
This particular approach allows solving optimization problem require vastly disparate definition domain problem parameter
For instance problem cascaded controller tuning internal loop controller structure belong conventional regulator three parameter whereas external loop could implement linguistic controller fuzzy system inherently different description
This particular form encoding requires specialized crossover mechanism recombines chromosome section useful tool modelling simulation complex adaptive system especially evolution process
A practical variant general process constructing new population allow best organism current generation carry next unaltered
This strategy known guarantee solution quality obtained GA decrease one generation next
Parallel implementation genetic algorithm come two flavor
parallel genetic algorithm assume population computer node migration individual among node
parallel genetic algorithm assume individual processor node act neighboring individual selection reproduction
Other variant like genetic algorithm problem introduce noise fitness function
Genetic algorithm adaptive parameter adaptive genetic algorithm AGAs another significant promising variant genetic algorithm
The probability crossover pc mutation pm greatly determine degree solution accuracy convergence speed genetic algorithm obtain
Instead using fixed value AGAs utilize population information generation adaptively adjust order maintain population diversity well sustain convergence capacity
In AGA adaptive genetic algorithm adjustment depends fitness value solution
In adaptive genetic algorithm use clustering analysis judge optimization state population adjustment depends optimization state
It quite effective combine GA optimization method
GA tends quite good finding generally good global solution quite inefficient finding last mutation find absolute optimum
Other technique simple hill climbing quite efficient finding absolute optimum limited region
Alternating GA hill climbing improve efficiency GA overcoming lack robustness hill climbing
This mean rule genetic variation may different meaning natural case
For instance provided step stored consecutive order crossing may sum number step maternal DNA adding number step paternal DNA
This like adding vector probably may follow ridge phenotypic landscape
Thus efficiency process may increased many order magnitude
Moreover opportunity place step consecutive order suitable order favour survival efficiency
See instance example particular use
A variation population whole evolved rather individual member known gene pool recombination
A number variation developed attempt improve performance GAs problem high degree fitness epistasis
fitness solution consists interacting subset variable
Such algorithm aim learn exploiting beneficial phenotypic interaction
As aligned Building Block Hypothesis adaptively reducing disruptive recombination
Prominent example approach include mGA GEMGA LLGA
Problems appear particularly appropriate solution genetic algorithm include scheduling problem many scheduling software package based GAs
GAs also applied
Genetic algorithm often applied approach solve problem
As general rule thumb genetic algorithm might useful problem domain complex mixing combination designed move population away traditional algorithm might get stuck
Observe commonly used crossover operator change uniform population
Mutation alone provide ergodicity overall genetic algorithm process seen
Examples problem solved genetic algorithm include mirror designed funnel sunlight solar collector antenna designed pick radio signal space walking method computer figure
In advises genetic algorithm task I quite unnatural model application term genetic operator like mutation crossover bit string
The pseudobiology add another level complexity problem
Second genetic algorithm take long time nontrivial problem
T analogy significant progress require sic million quite appropriate
In proposed learning machine would parallel principle evolution
Computer simulation evolution started early work using computer
His publication widely noticed
Starting Australian quantitative geneticist published series paper simulation organism multiple locus controlling measurable trait
From beginning computer simulation evolution biologist became common early method described book Fraser Burnell Crosby
Fraser simulation included essential element modern genetic algorithm
In addition published series paper also adopted population solution optimization problem undergoing recombination mutation selection
Bremermann research also included element modern genetic algorithm
Other noteworthy early pioneer include Richard Friedberg George Friedman Michael Conrad
Many early paper reprinted
Although Barricelli work reported simulated evolution ability play simple game became widely recognized optimization method result work early Rechenberg group able solve complex engineering problem
Another approach evolutionary programming technique proposed generating artificial intelligence
originally used finite state machine predicting environment used variation selection optimize predictive logic
Genetic algorithm particular became popular work early particularly book
His work originated study conducted student
Holland introduced formalized framework predicting quality next generation known
Research GAs remained largely theoretical The First International Conference Genetic Algorithms held
In late General Electric started selling world first genetic algorithm product toolkit designed industrial process
In Axcelis released world first commercial GA product desktop computer
technology writer wrote Evolver remained interactive commercial genetic algorithm
Evolver sold Palisade translated several language currently version
Genetic algorithm Evolutionary algorithm
Swarm intelligence

Developing timer API Linux
I want called periodically task How I create timer using called API specific task
I already used Qtimer qt
But need implement using standard C library
Sorry English Use Linux standard C library
This question many possible answer
You say often
If need something happen daily hourly let OS work use If need something kick every second precisely trouble
Unless dedicated machine nothing else interrupting process
And happens last chunk work completed want start next time
Does anything need know result sending mail shot whoever listening
Do need know task complete even began ok
If program trying something every five minute crash
Or machine run catch fire

I bit confused task period exactly mean For example assume task Assume released time total execution time time unit something part deadline execution time Suppose task preempted execution cycle hence time period next time released time T Now suppose task preempted another one time come back time enough time time execute remaining part time unit So finish time hence time period next time released time T What task period
In RM scheduling task priority assigned based task period value task period considered
On schedule chart periodic task always shown fixed period example period task released etc released finish What finish guarantee next release
Or assume released executes guarantee next release
Well example clearly deadline defined task period
multiple task finish later next intended release task period defined required release time understand release time kept multiple As see example beginning next release task may different depending situation matter far execution finish time Jose et

Consider system containing following periodic task T T T
A periodic server period used schedule aperiodic job
Suppose server task scheduled

If periodic server deferrable server large maximum execution budget
ii
If periodic server sporadic server large maximum execution budget
iii
Suppose sporadic server ii simple sporadic server
If aperiodic job queue rarely empty server use
iv
Suppose aperiodic job arrive le regularly every unit time apart execution time around half execution budget server
Which server better
Suppose sporadic server SpSL server
Which server better aperiodic job iv
b Suppose server task scheduled EDF basis
Repeat ii part
ii
Suppose server total bandwidth server
How large size server
Will perform least well deferrable server condition ii iv part
Choose Subject Â Select Duration Â Schedule Session Get notified immediately answer question available
best choice server size
b What maximum server size server total bandwidth server
c Find response time A A Problem server maximum server size
ii
Consider two aperiodic job A A
The execution time job equal respectively
Their arrival time
What job
b Note utilization periodic server part
We give server different period keeping utilization fixed
Repeat periodic task surely met

Suppose server part pure polling server
What response time following two aperiodic job One arrives

operation refers actively sampling status synchronous activity
Polling often used term also referred
Polling process computer controlling device wait check readiness state often hardware
For example connected via computer wait printer received next character
These process minute reading
Τhis sometimes used synonymously polling
In situation operation required computer nothing check status device ready point device accessed
In word computer wait device ready
Polling also refers situation device repeatedly checked readiness computer return different task
Although wasteful cycle busy waiting generally efficient alternative polling
In simple system even perfectly appropriate action possible access often traditionally consequence simple hardware
Polling often intimately involved
For example polling parallel printer port check whether ready another character involves examining little one
That bit represents time reading whether single wire printer cable low high voltage
The instruction read byte directly transfer voltage state eight real world wire eight circuit make one byte CPU register
Polling disadvantage many device check time required poll exceed time available service device
Polling described following step add pic A time element monitored
The optimal polling cycle vary according several factor including desired speed response overhead processor time bandwidth polling
In polling device process query element list fixed sequence
Because wait response element timing mechanism necessary prevent caused element
Roll call polling inefficient overhead polling message high numerous element polled polling cycle element active
In also referred token polling element poll next element fixed sequence
This continues first element reached time polling cycle start
Polling employed various computing context order control execution transmission sequence element involved
For example multitasking operating system polling used allocate processor time resource various competing process
In network polling used determine node want access network
It also used routing protocol retrieve routing information case EGP exterior gateway protocol
An alternative polling use signal generated device process indicate need attention want communicate etc
Although polling simple many situation multitasking operating system efficient use interrupt reduce processor usage bandwidth consumption
A message
In multidrop line arrangement central different terminal share single communication line computer system us polling arrangement whereby central computer sends message called polling message specific terminal outgoing line
All terminal listen outgoing line terminal polled reply sending information ready transmission incoming line
In simplest form consists one central computer act conduit transmit message polling required avoid chaos line often used allow master acquire input orderly fashion
These poll message differ multidrop line case site address needed terminal receives poll directed

give list axiom define topology
However exactly tell u topology
In normal language say word typically talk region around u
However mathematician like take thing one step generalize
A topological space set equipped topology
The topology collection subset set therefore subset power set
This denoted set topology
Every metric every set equipped distance topology induced metric
Thus every metric space topological space
However general topological space let u play around notion continuity convergence
We generalize function well set thing much easier prove metric space treating topological space
One favorite theorem exists continuous function general topological space metric whose inverse also continuous find metric general topological space creates identical space

Topology branch mathematics describes mathematical space particular property stem space shape
Many shape topologists deal incredibly strange much practically everyday object bowl pet tree make small minority
The word topology derives Greek word place study
Topology important guide several area study A topologist study property shape particular one preserved shape twisted stretched deformed
This list allowed change fit mathematical idea known roughly mean stretching tearing For example circle may pulled stretched ellipse something complex like outline hand print
Tearing merging cause known allowed
Two object stretched shape described Latinized Greek similar Greek form shape figure
Through lens virtually everyday object homeomorphic sphere ball variety torus donut
Some branch topology allow object pas stretched others
When considering surface pas important pinch surface infinitely tight since also add discontinuity
This usually encountered surface doubled back trying turn sphere inside difficult possible
One example property change continuous deformation object named Leonhard Euler German mathematician
To demonstrate object Euler characteristic first take sphere object homeomorphic sphere like human head tile surface polygon
Then count number face side edge place two side meet vertex place three side meet
Now add number face F vertex V subtract number edge E F V It matter divide surface answer always come two
Since five platonic solid shape made one kind regular polygon homomorphic sphere also Euler characteristic two
We make sense Euler characteristic conserved think mean add edge vertex
Adding edge two vertex split one face two Edges increase one face increase one vertex stay
Likewise adding vertex along edge split edge two Edges increase one vertex increase one face stay
Now tile surface torus count F V E get Euler characteristic zero
Here example With double torus Euler characteristic negative two triple torus negative four
Each additional hole reduces Euler characteristic two
One thing shape talked thus far common said
This mean bug walking outside surface always remain outside go inside
There also surface meaning bug wandering surface end side
The famous example Euler characteristic zero EC
While language like side Mobius strip useful introducing concept run counter mind topologist say surface being inhabit
Through lens useful think bug living within surface
For orientable surface bug bug surface bug indistinguishable
This emphasizes Mobius strip represents space interested property stem space shape
With perspective surface convenient represent topological space term
To turn surface fundamental polygon object stretch surface corresponding side join direction indicated arrow
As seen joining parallel side make cylinder EC joining line make Mobius strip EC
A bug walk arrowed boundary fundamental polygon transported boundary oriented way compared direction arrow
Whether bug stay flip indicates surface orientable respectively
A bug allowed cross dotted boundary
The first shape talked also fundamental polygon
To make torus first make cylinder stretch end cylinder meet
To make sphere fold sheet corner corner make triangular envelope inflate spherical
The dotted edge Mobius strip combined two different way give rise two surface Klein Bottle EC thought cross Mobius strip cylinder disk EC thought cross two Mobius strip
As Mobius strip third dimension wrap map gain perspective overall shape space
Both construction require surface allowed pas
A bug would notice intersection world flipped taking certain path space
Topology existed century already rich history problem subfields story

By Kanaga Rajan You may think exhibition Taping Shape fun science
Well certainly IS fun excellent study
field math study geometric spatial property shape maintained deformation stretching twisting
What mean
Imagine elastic sphere
What think happens stretched sphere
You create ellipsoid
What pinch eight equidistant point sphere stretch
You create cube
The amazing fact though transformed sphere two different shape destroyed surface original sphere
The surface manipulated entirely new shape continuous outer surface ellipsoid cube still sphere
Believe object topologically
When think geometry usually think math class took school
Those class focused Euclidean geometry study angle length object
In example sphere turning cube new shape topologically equivalent homeomorphic
Another shape called torus surface made two circle one fixed circle another stand perpendicularly first move space along path fixed circle generate torus
It creates shape basically donut
Try imagine elastic torus try deform back sphere without breaking surface It possible
A torus homeomorphic sphere
For object topologically related deformed transformation
Though topology seems like abstract type geometry widely applicable different science outside strict mathematics
In biology branch topology called knot theory used estimate property enzyme unknot DNA
Topology also used understand describe shape universe
Additionally topology applicable physic computer science

discipline initiating planning executing controlling closing achieve specific goal meet specific success criterion specified time
A temporary endeavor designed produce unique product service result defined beginning end usually often constrained funding staffing undertaken meet unique goal objective typically bring beneficial change added value
The temporary nature project stand contrast repetitive permanent functional activity produce product service
In practice distinct production approach requires development distinct technical skill management strategy
The primary challenge project management achieve project goal within given constraint
This information usually described project documentation created beginning development process
The primary constraint time
The secondary ambitious challenge necessary input apply meet objective
The object project management produce complete project complies client objective
In many case object project management also shape reform client brief order feasibly able address client objective
Once client objective clearly established impact decision made people involved manager designer contractor etc
If project management objective tightly prescribed detrimental effect decision making
Until project generally managed creative architect engineer example first century BC
In organization started systematically apply tool technique complex engineering project
As discipline project management developed several field application including civil construction engineering heavy activity
Two forefather project management called father planning control technique famous use project management tool alternatively first proposed creation five management function form foundation body knowledge associated project program management
Both Gantt Fayol student theory
His work forerunner modern project management tool including WBS
The marked beginning modern project management era core engineering field come together work one
Project management became recognized distinct discipline arising management discipline engineering model
In United States prior project managed basis using mostly informal technique tool
At time two mathematical model developed
The CPM developed joint venture managing plant maintenance project
The PERT developed conjunction part submarine program
PERT CPM similar approach still present difference
CPM used project assume deterministic activity time time activity carried known
PERT hand allows stochastic activity time time activity carried uncertain varied
Because core difference CPM PERT used different context
These mathematical technique quickly spread many private enterprise
At time model developed technology project cost cost management engineering economics evolving pioneering work Hans Lang others
In American Association Cost Engineers Association Advancement formed early practitioner project management associated specialty planning scheduling cost estimating control project control
AACE continued pioneering work released first integrated process portfolio program project management framework
In PMI formed USA
PMI publishes PMBOK Guide describes project management practice common project time
PMI also offer range certification
Recent study point four P project management together P suffice describe culture exists within project team P Plan refers activity involve planning forecasting
At stage project element project materialized yet P Processes well documented PMBOK project consist largely series predetermined process P People People essential component project dynamic number study show people heart project endemic problem

There number approach organizing completing project activity including phased lean iterative incremental
There also several extension project planning example based outcome activity
Regardless employed careful consideration must given overall project objective timeline cost well role responsibility participant
The phased staged approach break manages work series distinct step completed often referred traditional
Although vary typically consists five process area four phase plus control Many industry use variation project stage uncommon stage renamed order better suit organization
For example working design construction project typically progress stage like conceptual design schematic design design development construction drawing contract document construction administration
While phased approach work well small project often result challenge failure larger project complex ambiguity risk
Lean project management us principle focus delivering value le waste reduced time
In critical study project management noted phased approach well suited project undefined ambiguous requirement high degree risk dependency technology
The explains planning made initial phase project suffers high degree uncertainty
This becomes especially true software development often realization new novel product
These complexity better handled exploratory iterative incremental approach
Several model iterative incremental project management evolved including Innovation
Critical chain project management CCPM application TOC planning managing project designed deal uncertainty inherent managing project taking consideration limited availability physical human skill well management support capacity needed execute project
The goal increase flow project organization
Applying first three TOC system constraint project well resource identified
To exploit constraint task critical chain given priority activity
Finally project planned managed ensure resource ready critical chain task must start subordinating resource critical chain
planning structured approach project management based identifying product project contribute achieving project objective
As defines successful project rather
The common implementation approach
The incorporation management driven use maturity model capability maturity model integration see predecessor SPICE software process improvement capability estimation
Unlike SEI CMM maturity model describes make project management process capable performing successfully consistently predictably order enact strategy organization
Project production management application operation management delivery capital project
The Project production management framework based project production system view project transforms input raw material information labor plant machinery output good service
Benefits realization management BRM enhances normal project management technique focus outcome benefit project rather product output measuring degree happening keep project track
This help reduce risk completed project failure delivering agreed upon failing deliver requirement
In addition BRM practice aim ensure alignment project outcome business strategy
The effectiveness practice supported recent research evidencing BRM practice influencing project success strategic perspective across different country industry
An example delivering project requirement might agreeing deliver computer system process staff data manage payroll holiday staff personnel record
Under BRM agreement might achieve specified reduction staff hour required process maintain staff data
Earned value management EVM extends project management technique improve project monitoring
It illustrates project progress towards completion term work value cost
Traditionally depending project management methodology used project management includes number element four five project management process group control system
Regardless methodology terminology used basic project management process stage development used
Major process group generally include In project environment significant exploratory element stage may supplemented decision point go decision project continuation debated decided
An example
The initiating process determine nature scope project
If stage performed well unlikely project successful meeting business need
The key project control needed understanding business environment making sure necessary control incorporated project
Any deficiency reported recommendation made fix
The initiating stage include plan encompasses following area
These area recorded series document called Project Initiation document
Project Initiation document series planned document used create order duration project
These tend include After initiation stage project planned appropriate level detail see
The main purpose plan time cost resource adequately estimate work needed effectively manage risk project execution
As Initiation process group failure adequately plan greatly reduces project chance successfully accomplishing goal
generally consists Additional process planning communication scope management identifying role responsibility determining purchase project holding meeting also generally advisable
For project conceptual design operation final product may performed concurrent project planning activity may help inform planning team identifying deliverable planning activity

The phase ensures project management plan deliverable executed accordingly
This phase involves proper allocation management human resource resource material budget
The output phase project deliverable
Documenting everything within project key successful
In order maintain budget scope effectiveness pace project must physical document pertaining specific task
With correct documentation easy see whether project requirement met
To go along documentation provides information regarding already completed project
Documentation throughout project provides paper trail anyone need go back reference work past
In case documentation successful way monitor control specific phase project
With correct documentation project success tracked observed project go
If performed correctly documentation backbone project success
Monitoring controlling consists process performed observe project execution potential problem identified timely manner corrective action taken necessary control execution project
The key benefit project performance observed measured regularly identify variance project management
Monitoring controlling includes In project monitoring control process also provides feedback project phase order implement corrective preventive action bring project compliance project management plan
Project maintenance ongoing process includes In stage pay attention effectively quickly user problem resolved
Over course construction project work scope may change
Change normal expected part construction process
Changes result necessary design modification differing site condition material availability change value engineering impact third party name
Beyond executing change field change normally need documented show actually constructed
This referred change management
Hence owner usually requires final record show change specifically change modifies tangible portion finished work
The record made contract document usually necessarily limited design drawing
The end product effort industry term drawing simply built
The requirement providing norm construction contract
Construction document management highly important task undertaken aid online desktop software system maintained physical documentation
The increasing legality pertaining construction industry maintenance correct documentation caused increase need document management system
When change introduced project viability project
It important lose sight initial goal target project
When change accumulate forecasted result may justify original proposed investment project
Successful project management identifies component track monitor progress stay within time budget frame already outlined commencement project
Closing includes formal acceptance project ending thereof
Administrative activity include archiving file documenting lesson learned
This phase consists Also included phase Post Implementation Review
This vital phase project project team learn experience apply future project
Normally Post Implementation Review consists looking thing went well analyzing thing went badly project come lesson learned
Project controlling also known established independent function project management
It implement verification controlling function processing project order reinforce defined performance formal goal
The task project controlling also Fulfillment implementation task achieved applying specific method instrument project controlling
The following method project controlling applied Project control element project keep track within budget
Project control begin early project planning end late project review thorough involvement step process
Projects may audited reviewed project progress
Formal audit generally risk management direct objective audit
An examination may include comparison approved project management process project actually managed
Each project assessed appropriate level control needed much control time consuming little control risky
If project control implemented correctly cost business clarified term error fix
Control system needed cost quality communication time change procurement human resource
In addition auditor consider important project reliant stakeholder control many control exist
Auditors review development process procedure implemented
The process development quality final product may also assessed needed requested
A business may want auditing firm involved throughout process catch problem earlier fixed easily
An auditor serve control consultant part development team independent auditor part audit
Businesses sometimes use formal system development process
These help assure system developed successfully
A formal process effective creating strong control auditor review process confirm well designed followed practice
A good formal system development plan outline There five important characteristic project
It always specific start end date
ii They performed completed group people
iii The output delivery unique product service
iv They temporary nature
v It progressively elaborated
example Designing new car writing book
A professional field project management
Project manager charge people project
People key successful project
Without correct people right place right time project successful
Project manager responsibility planning execution controlling closing project typically relating engineering architecture telecommunication
Many field production engineering design engineering heavy industrial project manager
A project manager need understand order execution project schedule project correctly well time necessary accomplish individual task within project
A project manager person accountable accomplishing stated project objective
Project Managers tend multiple year experience field
A project manager required know project supervising worker along project
Typically construction engineering architecture industrial project project manager another manager working alongside typically responsible execution task daily basis
This position case known superintendent
A superintendent project manager work hand hand completing daily project task
Key project management responsibility include creating clear attainable project objective building project requirement managing including constraint calling competing constraint project cost time scope first three three additional one current project management
A typical project composed team worker work project manager complete assignment
A project manager normally report directly someone higher stature completion success project
A project manager often client representative determine implement exact need client based knowledge firm representing
The ability adapt various internal procedure contracting party form close link nominated representative essential ensuring key issue cost time quality client satisfaction realized
Project management apply project often tailored accommodate specific need different highly specialized industry
For example construction industry focus delivery thing like building road bridge developed specialized form project management refers project manager become trained certified
The information technology industry also evolved develop form project management referred specializes delivery technical asset service required pas various lifecycle phase planning design development testing deployment
focus intricacy biotechnology research development
includes many standard project management practice even though many consider type management different discipline
It focus three important goal time quality budget
Successful project completed schedule within budget according previously agreed quality standard
For type project management project manager develop utilize repeatable template specific industry dealing
This allows project plan become thorough highly repeatable specific intent increase quality lower delivery cost lower time deliver project result
There tendency confuse project success project management success
They two different thing
Project management success criterion different project success criterion
The project management said successful given project completed within agreed upon time met agreed upon scope within agreed upon budget
Meanwhile project said successful succeeds achieving expected business case

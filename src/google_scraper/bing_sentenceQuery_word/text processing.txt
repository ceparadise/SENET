In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

Almost every computer user need kind document preparation system
How many computer enthusiast know still use pen paper
Not many wager
In PC world norm involves editing manipulating text often environment producing printed copy text complete figure table garnish
In UNIX world much common quite different classical concept word processing
With text processing system text entered author using typesetting language describes text formatted
Instead entering text within special word processing environment source may modified text editor Emacs
Once source text typesetting language complete user format text separate program convert source format suitable printing
This somewhat analogous programming language C compiling document printable form
There many text processing system available Linux
One GNU version classic text formatter originally developed Bell Labs still used many UNIX system worldwide
Another modern text processing system developed Donald Knuth computer science fame
Dialects also available
Text processor differ mostly syntax formatting language
The choice one formatting system another also based upon utility available satisfy need well personal taste
For example people consider formatting language bit obscure use readable human
However capable producing plain ASCII output viewable terminal intended primarily output printing device
However various program exist produce plain ASCII document convert example
Another text processing system extension used software documentation Free Software Foundation
capable producing printed document hypertext Info document single source file
Info file main format documentation used GNU software Emacs
Text processor used widely computing community producing paper thesis magazine article book fact book produced using
The ability process source language plain text file open door many extension text processor
Because source document stored obscure format readable particular word processor programmer able write parser translator formatting language extending system
What formatting language look like
In general formatting language source consists mostly text along control code produce particular effect changing font setting margin creating list
As example take following text We upset current plan implement terminal driver code
We feel way three reason This text would appear formatting language following The author enters source text using text editor generates formatted output processing source
At first glance typesetting language may appear obscure actually quite easy learn
Using text processing system enforces typographical standard writing
For example enumerated list within document look unless author modifies definition enumerated list environment
The primary goal allow author concentrate writing actual text instead worrying typesetting convention
WYSIWYG word processor attractive many reason provide powerful sometimes complex visual interface editing document
However interface inherently limited aspect text layout accessible user
For example many word processor provide special format language producing complicated expression mathematical formula
This identical text processing albeit much smaller scale
The subtle benefit text processing system allows specify exactly mean
Also text processing system allow edit source text text editor source easily converted format
The tradeoff flexibility power lack WYSIWYG interface
Many user word processor used seeing formatted text edit
On hand writing text processor one generally worry text appear formatted
The writer learns expect text look formatting command used source
There program allow view formatted document graphic display printing
For example program display device independent file generated system X Windows environment
Other software application provide WYSIWYG graphic interface drawing figure diagram subsequently converted text processing language inclusion document
Admittedly text processor around long word processing available
However many people still prefer use text processing versatile independent graphic environment
In either case word processor also available Linux long expect see commercial word processor becoming available well
If absolutely want give word processing text processing always run operating system addition Linux
There many utility available
The powerful METAFONT system used designing font included Linux port
Other program include interactive spell checker corrector used generating indicies document well many macro package formatting many type document mathematical text
Conversion program translate source myriad format available

In finite sequence letter numeral symbol punctuation mark
An important characteristic string number character
The length zero positive integer
A particularly useful string programming application string containing character thus length zero
A contiguous sequence character string
widely used programming language system way categorizing thereby facilitating error prevention system optimization
Data type differ according programming language database system string important useful data type implemented way virtually every programming language
How string string data type represented depends largely defined method represented
String implementation formerly usually designed work character encoding used computer communication equipment represent text subsequent extension particularly ISO series allows representation many national alphabet English alphabet represented original ASCII
In recent year however trend implement string attempt provide character code existing extinct written language
Several programming language specifically designed facilitate development application processing string
They include awk Perl sed Tcl
Perl take particularly flexible approach string data type allowing contain kind data even data
The probably widely used language used write language used write take different approach string
It special data type string rather string treated data
An array ordered sequence data element single data type
The char data type used storing individual character letter punctuation mark classified integer data type actually store integer representing ASCII value character letter b stored
There numerous set precise unambiguous rule designed solve specific problem perform specific task processing string including searching sorting comparing transforming
Even C programming language designed string processing several standard string operation including finding length joining comparing copying
In Linux operating system numerous utility processing string
These utility used manipulating contain text binary data operating system text file string considered essentially thing
Moreover utility feature ability combined using send output one utility another utility use input case ability easily programmed provide powerful flexible efficient string processing algorithm
Among utility used concatenating used sorting used convert tab space used searching used cutting piece used translate delete character used convert space tab used counting character word
powerful technique searching text string searching string substring pervades programming tool operating system also used many programming language
Several system developed regular expression PCRE generally regarded richest predictable syntax thus greatest flexibility ease use
The designed extract ASCII string
Binary file file contain least data binary data usually also contain character data include runnable program output file commercial program word processing spreadsheet program image file

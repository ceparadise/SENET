Decision Tables long history date back Babylon
Regarding Structure section final sentence Decision table used combination condition given
In decision table condition known cause serinal number condition known business rule
This article quite problem
The extensive use decision table outside field computing made clear
The last section embedded decision table add nothing article belong lookup table example might added article similar example already provided simple lookup table something anyone would ordinarily call table
The usefully concrete printer troubleshooter example similar example decision table typical form provided beginning article rather misleadingly abstract quadrant schema sufficiently general cover decision table format anyway
The phrase balanced decision table demand definition none provided inessential reference anyway like much varied competing obscure terminology advanced different proponent decision table back
Unless objection alternative suggestion I propose make major change perhaps complete rewrite along line
December UTC This contains number mistake spelling grammar
It also flow well rest article
I know enough decision table correct someone know
I assume cause clause serinal serial MrTwitchy I removed paragraph indeed pointless December UTC Hello fellow Wikipedians I added archive link one external link
Please take moment review
If necessary add link keep modifying
Alternatively add keep page altogether
I made following change When finished reviewing change please set parameter let others know
Cheers
October UTC The order action may vary rule rule
Unsolved problem
February UTC Hello fellow Wikipedians I modified one external link
Please take moment review

Visual Basic tutorial Learn Learn Advanced Learn Visual Basic Condition entry used specifying condition analyzed
Action stub show various action taken different condition
And action entry used find action taken corresponding particular set condition
The step taken certain possible condition listed action statement
Action entry display specific action undertaken selected condition combination condition true
At time note added table indicate use table distinguish decision table
The right side column table link condition action form decision rule hence state condition must fulfilled particular set action taken
In decision tree fixed ordered sequence followed condition examined
But case decision rule incorporates required condition must true
Before describing step involved building decision table important take note important point
Every decision given name logic decision table independent sequence condition rule written action take place order event occur
Wherever possible duplication term meaning avoided standardized language must used
The step building concerned table given
Firstly figure essential factor considered making decision
This identify condition involved decision
Only condition selected potential either occur partial occurrence permissible
Determine possible step take place varying condition current condition
This step identify action
Calculate possible combination condition
For every N number condition
N time combination considered
Fill decision rule table
Entries decision table filled action entry generally marked X
For condition immaterial hyphen generally put
Decision table simplified eliminating consolidating certain rule
Impossible rule eliminated
There certain condition whose value affect decision always result action
These rule consolidated single rule
Example Consider recruitment policy ABC Software Ltd
It applicant BE recruit otherwise
If person Computer Science put software development department person science background put HR department
If Person Computer Science experience equal greater three year take Team leader experience le take person Team member
If person recruited non Computer Science background experience le three year make Management Trainee otherwise Manager

A necessary fact Flow chart certainly number dozen score program bigger
Hence programmer try construct flowchart directly surely maximum chance going wrong missing many thing
Find A Decision Table classified four part
list comparison condition

list action taken along various program branch

list different head possible computation answer question contained condition stub

contains action applicable set answer question condition column
In type table condition action complete
These condition action tell whether condition exists
The symbol used Y Yes condition exists
N No condition exist
The condition action incomplete
But support condition action entry completes
Thirdly come Mixed Entry table form group limited extended entry form
Though limited extended entry form mixed table one form used condition statement action statement

List condition action

Combine condition describe two possibility condition
In word delete condition derived response condition

Make yes Y N response mark action taken rule X

Combine redundant rule simplify table

Check completeness

It provides skeleton constructing complete accurate body statement processing decision logic
It force discipline programmer think possible condition

It may easier construct flow chart

It make possible check test combination considered

Alternatives shown side side facilitate analysis combination

A truth table breakdown logic listing possible value function attain
Such table typically contains several row column top row representing logical variable combination increasing complexity leading final function
In logic function three basic operation NOT also called inversion negation symbolized OR also called disjunction addition symbolized AND also called conjunction multiplication symbolized
The value function normally assigned logic false logic true
Thus following rule apply If A If A except A B A B except A B A B The following table show process evaluating value logic function determined breaking constituent function
The two logic variable A B listed top first two column
All possible combination value A B listed column counting binary numeral
The case seventh column contains function evaluated final function
Once framework set value third fourth column determined simple rule addition multiplication Then value fifth sixth column determined negating value third fourth column Finally value function evaluated determined multiplying value fifth sixth column This simple logic function
Some function many input variable consist many constituent function
This result table hundred row column
Computers used generate truth table highly complex logic function
An alternative truth table use theorem
This method called Boolean algebra used engineer find simplest possible circuit perform desired logic function
This optimizes system efficiency minimizing number operation must performed accomplish given task

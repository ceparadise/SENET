I know Big O notation used ass efficient algorithm I understand read Big O notation exactly efficient algorithm
Can somebody perhaps explain basic Big O notation
Thanks
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
good explanation notation use
page look explain pretty clearly
Essentially convenient way quickly accurately assessing performance characteristic algorithm
Be quickly worst case average case algorithm run
How much space worst average case us
Sometimes useful algorithm performs number item known amortized analysis
The fundamental characteristic notation leaf term become irrelevant get large
For example get large becomes irrelevant
This would
describes limiting behavior function
For computer science typically use show algorithm scale well get larger set data
For example lookup collection typically vary described using notation based type collection
A Framework property documented follows Getting setting value property approach O operation That basically say matter many item add collection getting item done constant time
A hand describes follows This method performs linear search therefore method O n operation n Count
This basically say algorithm get slower linear time add item
If put item take approximately long average list containing item etc

also referred UK way expressing number big small conveniently written
It commonly used scientist mathematician engineer part simplify certain
On scientific calculator usually known SCI display mode
In scientific notation number written form time ten raised power called
However term mantissa may cause confusion name
If number negative minus sign precedes ordinary decimal notation
In exponent chosen absolute value coefficient least one le ten
computer arithmetic system closely related scientific notation
Any given integer written form many way example written
In scientific notation called standard form UK exponent chosen remains least one le ten
Thus written
This form allows easy comparison number exponent give number
In normalized notation exponent negative number absolute value
written
The exponent often omitted exponent
Normalized scientific form typical form expression large number many field unless unnormalized form desired
Normalized scientific notation often called latter term general also applies restricted range engineering notation instance
Engineering notation often named ENG display mode scientific calculator differs normalized scientific notation exponent restricted
Consequently absolute value range rather
Though similar concept engineering notation rarely called scientific notation
Engineering notation allows number explicitly match corresponding facilitates reading oral communication
For example read nanometer written scientific notation equivalent would likely read time meter
A significant figure digit number add precision
This includes nonzero number zero significant digit zero
Leading trailing zero significant exist show scale number
Therefore usually five significant figure final two zero serve placeholder add precision original number
When number converted normalized scientific notation scaled number
All significant digit remain place holding zero longer required
Thus would become
However also possibility number may known six significant figure case number would shown instance
Thus additional advantage scientific notation number significant figure clearer
It customary scientific measurement record definitely known digit measurement estimate least one additional digit information available enable observer make estimate
The resulting number contains information would without extra digit may considered significant digit conveys information leading greater precision measurement aggregation measurement adding multiplying together
Additional information precision conveyed additional notation
It often useful know exact final digit
For instance accepted value unit elementary charge properly expressed shorthand
Most many present large small result scientific notation typically invoked key labelled depending vendor model
Because exponent like always conveniently displayed letter often used represent time ten raised power would written followed value exponent word two real number usage E would indicate value
In usage character related confusion unlikely scientific notation represented capital
Although stand notation usually referred rather
The use facilitates data entry readability textual communication since minimizes keystroke avoids reduced font size provides simpler concise display encouraged publication
Scientific notation also enables simpler comparison
A mass
If written easier compare mass electron given
The ratio mass obtained comparing exponent instead task counting leading zero
In case larger therefore proton roughly four order magnitude time massive electron
Scientific notation also avoids misunderstanding due regional difference certain quantifier might indicate either
In physic astrophysics number order magnitude two number sometimes referred dex contraction decimal exponent
For instance two number within dex ratio larger smaller number le
Fractional value used within dex ratio le
In normalized scientific notation engineering notation may represented normal width space allowed front E sometimes omitted though le common alphabetical character
Converting number case mean either convert number scientific notation form convert back decimal form change exponent part equation
None alter actual number expressed
First move decimal separator point sufficient place put number value within desired range normalized notation
If decimal moved left append right
To represent number normalized scientific notation decimal separator would moved digit left appended resulting
The number would decimal separator shifted digit right instead left yield result
Converting number scientific notation decimal notation first remove end shift decimal separator digit right positive left negative
The number would decimal separator shifted digit right become would decimal separator moved digit left
Conversion different scientific notation representation number different exponential value achieved performing opposite operation multiplication division power ten significand subtraction addition one exponent part
The decimal separator significand shifted place left right added subtracted exponent shown
Given two number scientific notation performed using rule operation Some example require number represented using exponential part significand simply added subtracted Next add subtract significands An example While base ten normally used scientific notation power base used base next commonly used one
For example scientific notation number written using binary number shorter binary context obvious
In written shorter letter standing time two power
In order better distinguish exponent exponent exponent sometimes also indicated using letter instead shorthand notation originally proposed shorter
For comparison number using decimal representation still using decimal representation
Some calculator use mixed representation binary floating point number exponent displayed decimal number even binary mode becomes shorter
This closely related representation commonly used computer arithmetic usage IEC

Similar letter sometimes also used indicate
Another similar convention denote exponent using letter power
In notation significand always meant hexadecimal whereas exponent always meant decimal
This notation produced implementation family function following specification standard using conversion specifier
Starting function could parse print well
Meanwhile notation fully adopted language standard since
support well
It also required binary standard
Example represents
viewed scientific notation

mathematical notation describes argument tends towards particular value infinity
It member family notation invented others collectively called
In big O notation used according running time space requirement grow input size grows
In big O notation often used express bound difference better understood approximation famous example difference remainder term
Big O notation characterizes function according growth rate different function growth rate may represented using O notation
The letter O used growth rate function also referred
A description function term big O notation usually provides growth rate function
Associated big O notation several related notation using symbol describe kind bound asymptotic growth rate
Big O notation also used many field provide similar estimate
Let two function defined subset
One writes positive constant sufficiently large value absolute value multiplied absolute value
That exists positive real number real number In many context assumption interested growth rate variable go infinity left unstated one writes simply The notation also used describe behavior near real number often say exist positive number If value definition unified using In typical usage formal definition notation used directly rather notation function derived following simplification rule For example let suppose wish simplify function using notation describe growth rate approach infinity
This function sum three term
Of three term one highest growth rate one largest exponent function namely
Now one may apply second rule product first factor depend
Omitting factor result simplified form
Thus say
Mathematically write
One may confirm calculation using formal definition let
Applying statement equivalent expansion suitable choice
To prove let
Then Big O notation two main area application In application function appearing within typically chosen simple possible omitting constant factor lower order term
There two formally close noticeably different usage notation This distinction application principle formal definition big O case different limit function argument
Big O notation useful efficiency
For example time number step take complete problem size might found
As grows large come dominate term instance term time large term
Ignoring latter would negligible effect expression value purpose
Further become irrelevant compare expression expression containing term
Even latter always exceed former grows larger
Additionally number step depends detail machine model algorithm run different type machine typically vary constant factor number step needed execute algorithm
So big O notation capture remains write either say algorithm time complexity
Note meant express equal normal mathematical sense rather colloquial second expression sometimes considered accurate see discussion first considered
Big O also used describe approximation mathematical function
The significant term written explicitly term summarized single big O term
Consider example two expression valid small The second expression one mean error constant time close enough
If function written finite sum function fastest growing one determines order
For example In particular function may bounded polynomial tends one may disregard term polynomial
Another thing notice set different
If greater one latter grows much faster
A function grows faster called
One grows slowly exponential function form called
An algorithm require time superpolynomial subexponential example include fastest known algorithm function
We may ignore power inside logarithm
The set log exactly log
The logarithm differ constant factor since log log thus big O notation ignores
Similarly log different constant base equivalent
On hand exponential different base order
For example order
Changing unit may may affect order resulting algorithm
Changing unit equivalent multiplying appropriate variable constant wherever appears
For example algorithm run order replacing mean algorithm run order big O notation ignores constant
This written O
If however algorithm run order replacing give
This equivalent general
Changing variable may also affect order resulting algorithm
For example algorithm run time measured term number input number run time log measured function input number log
This implies mean
Big little Ω also used multiple variable
To define Big formally multiple variable suppose two function defined subset
We say Equivalently condition replaced condition denotes
For example statement asserts exist constant defined Note definition allows coordinate increase infinity
In particular statement quite different
Note definition subset function defined significant generalizing statement univariate setting multivariate setting
For example restrict defined
This generalization big O multivariate function practice inconsistency choice definition
The statement defined usually written
Some consider since use equal sign could misleading suggests symmetry statement
As say true
describes statement equality since side could reversed could deduce ridiculous thing like identity
For reason would precise use write thinking class function constant
However use equal sign customary
Knuth pointed mathematician customarily use sign use word English Aristotle man man necessarily Aristotle
Big O notation also used conjunction arithmetic operator complicated equation
For example denotes collection function growth plus part whose growth limited
Thus express Suppose developed operate set element
Its developer interested finding function express long algorithm take run arbitrary measurement time term number element input set
The algorithm work first calling subroutine sort element set perform operation
The sort known time complexity subroutine run algorithm must take additional step terminates
Thus overall time complexity algorithm expressed
Here term subsumed within
Again usage disregard formal meaning symbol allow one use big O notation kind convenient placeholder
In complicated usage appear different place equation even several time side
For example following true The meaning statement follows function satisfy left side function satisfying right side substituting function equation make two side equal
For example third equation mean For function function
In term set notation meaning class function represented left side subset class function represented right side
In use formal symbol unlike usual use
Thus example imply false statement Big O consists uppercase O
Unlike notation need special symbol
Yet commonly used calligraphic variant like available derived typesetting system
Here list class function commonly encountered analyzing running time algorithm
In case positive constant increase without bound
The function generally listed first
The statement sometimes weakened derive simpler formula asymptotic complexity
For subset may considered polynomial bigger order
Big commonly used asymptotic notation comparing function
Here define related notation term Big progressing family notation Big notation belongs
Intuitively assertion read mean grows much faster
This often written le frequently set notation
Formally mean every positive constant exists constant Note difference earlier notation present definition former true constant latter must hold positive constant however small
In way notation make corresponding notation every function also every function also
For example
If nonzero least becomes nonzero beyond certain point relation equivalent notation common mathematics rarer computer science
respect number arithmetic operation
For example It also satisfies transitivity relation There two widespread incompatible definition statement real number real function defined neighbourhood positive neighbourhood
The first one chronologically used one
When two subject meet situation bound generate confusion
In introduced new symbol defined follows Thus negation
In author introduced two new symbol thus defined Hence negation negation
Although wrote otherwise use three symbol meaning
These symbol prototype Landau never used exactly thus
These three symbol well meaning satisfied currently used
We precisely We precisely however In published paper justify use describe stronger property
Knuth wrote For application I seen far computer science stronger requirement much appropriate
He defined comment Although I changed Hardy Littlewood definition I feel justified definition mean wide use way say want say comparatively rare case definition applies
The limit definition assume sufficiently large
The table sorted smallest largest sense O Θ version Ω ω function correspond real line
Computer science us big Big Theta Θ little little omega ω Knuth big Omega Ω notation
Analytic number theory often us big small big Omega Ω notation
The small omega ω notation used often analysis
Informally especially computer science Big notation often permitted somewhat abused describe asymptotic tight bound using Big Theta Θ notation might factually appropriate given context
For example considering function following generally acceptable tighter bound number usually strongly preferred looser bound number
The equivalent English statement respectively So three statement true progressively information contained
In field however big O notation number list would used commonly Big Theta notation bullet number list
For example represents running time newly developed algorithm input size inventor user algorithm might inclined put upper asymptotic bound long take run without making explicit statement lower asymptotic bound
In book consider set function function belongs satisfies In correct notation set instance called The author state use equality operator denote set membership rather set membership operator abuse notation advantage
Inside equation inequality use asymptotic notation stand anonymous function set eliminates term help reduce inessential clutter equation example Another notation sometimes used computer science Õ read shorthand log
Essentially big O notation ignoring logarithmic factor effect function indicate explosion input parameter important predicting bad performance effect contributed factor
This notation often used obviate nitpicking within stated tightly bounded matter hand since log always constant ε
Also defined convenient function term
The generalization function taking value straightforward replacing absolute value norm need take value space
A generalization function taking value also possible
The limiting process also generalized introducing arbitrary
directed
The notation used define quite general space also asymptotical equivalence function restrictive notion relationship Θ
It reduces lim positive real valued function
For example Θ
The symbol O first introduced number theorist second volume book first volume yet containing big O notation published
The number theorist adopted thus inspired introduce notation hence called Landau symbol
These notation used applied mathematics asymptotic analysis
The symbol sense introduced Hardy Littlewood
Hardy Littlewood also introduced symbol right left precursor modern symbol smaller small larger small
Thus Omega symbol original meaning sometimes also referred Landau symbol
This notation became commonly used number theory least since
In big O popularized computer science introduced related Theta notation proposed different definition Omega notation
Landau never used Big Theta small omega symbol
Hardy symbol term modern notation Hardy however never defined used notation sometimes reported
It also noted Hardy introduces symbol well symbol tract Orders Infinity make use three paper
In nearly remaining paper book consistently us Landau symbol O Hardy notation used anymore
On hand Russian number theorist introduced notation increasingly used number theory instead notation
We frequently notation used paper
The originally stand order Ordnung Bachmann thus Latin letter
Neither Bachmann Landau ever call Omicron
The symbol much later viewed Knuth capital probably reference definition symbol
The digit used

also called Britain special way writing number It make easy use big small value
Why written Both value shown different way
Scientific Notation So number written In example written Enter number see Scientific Notation Now try use Scientific Notation We use symbol keyboard easy type
Example Calculators often use E e like Example Example When number smaller decimal point move power
Because We move decimal point power But Scientific Notation After putting number Scientific Notation check Because make easier dealing big small number common Scientific Engineering work
Example easier write read It also make calculation easier example Let first convert three length scientific notation Then multiply digit together ignoring Last multiply easier look together The result It used lot Science The Sun Mass kg
Easier writing kg number give false sense many digit accuracy
Use Scientific Notation Engineering Notation like Scientific Notation except use power ten multiple etc
Example written Notice digit part never
The advantage replace
So use standard word thousand million prefix kilo mega symbol k M etc Example meter written Example second written

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Can anyone point direction good introductory material use mathematical notation field computer science
I often come across notation research paper I understand I would like least overview thorough understanding
I much mathematical background expect become expert field overnight idea would appreciated
The kind notation I trouble seen
Note article I using research first publicly available example I came across
That set theory
I honestly recommend study set theory nowdays mathematics built set
Just pick introductory book set theory ill imo enough
Now may difficulty interpretation thing let take example page Given set N observation Y yi


N want identify observation belong object
This basically mean Y set containing observation simple formal translation could We bunch observation
We looking partition observation Y several trajectory Yk Y subset Y trajectory collect observation believed come single person
This mean defined next parragraph partition space partition looking subset call believed belong person
Now translation We looking observation believe belong person going separate observation belong every person different group set
A valid partition express set observation exhaustive union trajectory Y


number object proposed partition
The trajectory must mutually exclusive Y Yk And last say valid must trajectory contain alltogether initial set Y trayectories intersection must empty
The translation The partition must subset observation mean must formed group cover observation two different subset observation share member would obviously absurd two belonging person A another two belonging person B one two repeated A B would person That go whole article
The final parragraph mean We bunch observation
We looking observation believe belong person going separate observation belong every person different group set separation called partition
The partition must subset observation mean must formed group cover observation two different subset observation share member would obviously absurd two belonging person A another two belonging person B one two repeated A B would person
This notation used let space ambiguity rigouruos besides studying set theory basic train interpretation article read try I done BTW I think book mathematical notation computer science would really surprise thing exist notation
It look like notation referenced set theory
I know first chapter discus set theory somewhat
It free reference cost anything time look
I formally covered set theory yet curriculum I know book suggest Perhaps look discrete math book
The notation article linked entirely set theory
Any textbook discrete mathematics course cover notation concept reasonably well
Discrete Mathematics Applications Susana Epp good introduction seems used lot computer science department
If need improve background mathematics computer science I strongly recommend reading working Knuth The Art Computer Programming book
Look chapter one book
It short chapter cover notion page
You also quickly look book
Chapter one book set theory notation probability notation bottom page
They simple book without lot explanation take long familiarize notation
More broadly paper provided look like machine learning good introductory book
A review probability start page
There section called end book list general machine learning notation

How arithmetic problem solved advent pocket calculator
In day three method solving multiplication problem person could head pencil paper getting time mainframe computer using slide rule
Many student would rely slide rule
How slide rule work
First multiply number outside range
So order multiply number would rewritten something Then slide rule could used find However still left work done get final answer
Enough slide rule
Thank goodness calculator
By using slide rule however individual could learn valuable lesson work number different magnitude
This led appreciation something called scientific notation
defined standardized way represent number product real number power
In form called coefficient exponent
The defined integer except zero left decimal point plus mantissa
A defined significant digit right decimal point
Here example scientific notation important part expression labeled Consider following expression important engineer physicist Look zero
This expression charge single electron
The stand Coulomb unit electrical charge
In form cumbersome number work
It might easier expressed follows Here another example
Sometimes mass earth kilogram used solve gravity problem
Here raw form Again pretty unwieldy number
It would nicer represented follows So convenient use scientific notation
But rule expressing number scientific notation expression found
The great thing scientific notation universally accepted standardized form
Here rule Most scientific calculator put number scientific notation done hand simple procedure With number original form start decimal point count space digit either left right get first digit
Follow example using number
In case move decimal point first number
If moving left go one additional space whole number left mantissa right
The number space decimal point moved becomes exponent
If moved right exponent negative
If left exponent positive
If exponent zero scientific notation needed
x If number result quite standard form mantissa greater le corrected
Count left right decimal point one whole number left
If moved left add number existing exponent
If right subtract
Here look like charge electron Get FREE access day create account
Counting right decimal point move digit first digit case isolated
That mean coefficient exponent
This result form Here another example using mass earth This result following Once number scientific notation form used addition subtraction multiplication division
Here rule assuming number scientific notation According NASA equal mile
The Andromeda galaxy approximately million light year away
How many mile
Convert quantity scientific notation multiply A final example dalton atomic unit mass equal x kg
The molecular weight water molecule dalton
A mole water contains x molecule Avogadro Number
How much mole water weigh
The strategy first multiply mass represented dalton
This give mass one water molecule kilogram
Then multiply result Avogadro Number
To finish problem convert result standard form standardized way represent number product coefficient power
The signed real number includes integer left decimal point mantissa right
The absolute value coefficient must greater equal strictly le
To create scientific notation form start counting digit left right existing decimal point
The number digit counted becomes exponent base ten
Count left exponent positive count right negative
There also rule follow ensure number correct form performing arithmetic number represented scientific notation
For example two number multiplied together coefficient multiply exponent add
When used correctly scientific notation provides convenient way represent manipulate large small number would otherwise cumbersome work

Scientific notation also called notation method writing extremely large small number
There two form scheme one far common
In common scientific notation nonzero quantity expressed two part whose absolute value greater equal le power coefficient multiplied
In writing coefficient closer zero one order magnitude
In scheme nonzero quantity expressed two part coefficient whose absolute value greater equal le power coefficient multiplied
The quantity zero denoted unless precision demanded case requisite number significant digit written example
For number reasonable magnitude conventional decimal notation often used even scientific writing
Let number rounded truncated significant figure
If absolute value least le usually written full
Examples
However absolute value smaller larger scientific notation usually preferred writing number decimal form confusing messy
This especially true absolute value close zero exceedingly large
It inconvenient example write either expression x x decimal form
The table show several example number written standard decimal notation column scientific notation column
For negative number value simply positive number minus sign placed front value
The number digit coefficient number significant figure
Note expression various degree precision greater number significant figure greater precision
Scientific notation make easy multiply divide gigantic minuscule number use decimal notation would give rise frustration
Consider example following product x x x To obtain product two number coefficient multiplied power added
This produce following result x x x x x The proper form common scientific notation requires absolute value coefficient larger le
Thus coefficient expression divided power increased one giving x Because multiplicand original product specified three significant figure scientist might see fit round final expression three significant figure well yielding x product
Now consider quotient two number multiplied previous example x x To obtain quotient coefficient divided power subtracted
This give following x x x The proper form common scientific notation requires absolute value coefficient larger le
Thus coefficient expression multiplied power decreased one giving x Because number original quotient specified three significant figure scientist might see fit round final expression three significant figure well yielding x quotient

Big O notation used Computer Science describe performance complexity algorithm
Big O specifically describes scenario used describe execution time required space used
memory disk algorithm
Anyone read Computer Science book grounding Mathematics hit wall reached chapter mention O N log N seemingly crazy syntax
Hopefully article help gain understanding basic Big O Logarithms
As programmer first mathematician second maybe third fourth I found best way understand Big O thoroughly produce example code
So common order growth along description example possible
O describes algorithm always execute time space regardless size input data set
O N describes algorithm whose performance grow linearly direct proportion size input data set
The example also demonstrates Big O favour performance scenario matching string could found iteration loop function would return early Big O notation always assume upper limit algorithm perform maximum number iteration
O N represents algorithm whose performance directly proportional square size input data set
This common algorithm involve nested iteration data set
Deeper nested iteration result O N O N etc
O denotes algorithm whose growth double additon input data set
The growth curve O function exponential starting shallow rising meteorically
An example O function recursive calculation Fibonacci number Logarithms slightly trickier explain I use common example technique used search sorted data set
It work selecting middle element data set essentially median compare target value
If value match return success
If target value higher value probe element take upper half data set perform operation
Likewise target value lower value probe element perform operation lower half
It continue halve data set iteration value found longer split data set
This type algorithm described
The iterative halving data set described binary search example produce growth curve peak beginning slowly flattens size data set increase
input data set containing item take one second complete data set containing item take two second data set containing item take three second
Doubling size input data set little effect growth single iteration algorithm data set halved therefore par input data set half size
This make algorithm like binary search extremely efficient dealing large data set
June Excellent explanation big O notation sometimes hard imagine teaching example made easier It might worth mentioning O log N theoretical limit searching data set
I remember learning college went right head
Your article gave better understanding professor ever
Thanks
O log N log base well
This important distinction
When programming professor went intro programming class said subject
Seeing O logN look scary know mean really difficult concept pick
A helpful easy understand explanation Big O thanks providing
I always find code example make understanding problem easier
Nice article I quibble Big O specifically describes scenario
That case
notation describes asymptotic bound correct say something like example Quicksort O n
even though Quicksort actual running time never exceed O
All saying input size n value n quicksort always take le n
step complete
It say Quicksort take n
step worst case
Thanks writing article using programming code example
It insightful useful
Very nice article
A graph showing time would helpful
This one right region bad http different scale
This one better example http Very well put
It shame people concern design pattern domain model giving bit attention core programming concept method born mathematical logic
Of course play equal role development none never forgotten often mathematical logic
Thank crystal clear guide
I studied concept long ago almost seems another life PS I knew binary search another name dichotomic search
Nice post
I like code example add context describing
It might worth mentioning O log N theoretical limit searching data set
bluehavana O log N log base well
This important Regarding O notation distinction O log N O ln N logarithm base
This O notation saying asymptotically algorithm time complexity limited log function
A logarithm base b real multiple generic logarithm N log N log b
These equivalent O notation definition g x O f x exists real constant M g x M f x obviously multiply b another real constant N M log b satisfies definition
Anyway nice article Rob hopefully I joining lunch London soon
Short accurate content
Its much easier source code mention quite good explanation O log N
Thanks Great article
This made understanding Big O notation much easier
I looking forward reading blog post
Very nice article beginner want gain understanding Big Oh
Good work
Fantastic want come lecturer
As mature computing student grounding mathematics I really hitting wall
The O big O I grip finding n within program problem
The example great I better angle Thanks I found excellent introductory post used inspiration post ive included example java
Thanks lot http This brilliant piece work easy understand
Most programming university serious hardship trying explain big O notation
Thank
Nice article
I tired reading textbook cryptic writing lack introduction Big O logarithm
I still struggle post given foundation I grateful
Hey great explanation man

This first three post series
The second post talk
The third article talk
notation used really scary concept
I thought real programmer talked code
It scary academic description made little sense
This frustrating underlying concept actually hard
Simply put notation programmer talk algorithm
Algorithms another scary topic I cover another post purpose let say algorithm mean function program far
A function notation determined responds different input
How much slower give list thing work instead list thing
Consider code So call function like pretty quick
We loop thing list find first argument function return True
If get end find return False
The complexity function
I explain mean second let break mathematical syntax
read Order N function also known Order function
I think approximation deal order magnitude
Orders magnitude mathematical term basically tell difference class number
Think difference
If picture closest friend people really big difference
Similarly difference pretty big fact difference junker car lightly used one
It turn approximation long within order magnitude pretty close
If guess number gumballs machine within order magnitude said gumballs
gumballs would
A gumball machine whose number gumballs probably within order magnitude
Back dissecting say graph time take run function different sized input
array item item item etc see approximately corresponds number item array
This called linear graph
This mean line basically straight graph
Some may caught code sample item always first item list code would really fast
This true approximate performance something
The worst case code thing searching list
Note The math term upper bound mean talking mathematic limit awfulness
If wanted see graph function ignore function change variable
You type Wolfram Alpha plot x show diagonal line
The reason swap n x graphing program want variable name corresponds x axis
The getting bigger left right corresponds giving bigger bigger array function
The represents time higher line slower
Runtime characteristic O n function So example
Consider function This bit silly example bear
This function called called constant time
What mean matter big input always take amount time compute thing
If go back Wolfram see always stay matter far right go
If pas list million integer take time going pas list integer
Constant time considered best case scenario function
Runtime characteristic O function Consider function This match every item list every item list
If gave array get back
This part field mathematical field study combination thing
This function algorithm want sound fancy considered
This every item list aka input size operation
So
Below comparison graph reference
You see function get slow quickly something operates constant time much better
This particularly useful come data structure I post soon
Comparison O n v O n v O function This pretty high level overview notation hopefully get acquainted topic
There give depth view topic warned hop mathematic notation quickly
If anything make sense send
I also written
I thinking writing book topic
If something like see please express interest

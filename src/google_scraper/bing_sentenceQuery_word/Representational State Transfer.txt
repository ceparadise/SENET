That extremely difficult thing within process accepts proposal anyone topic rapidly becoming center entire industry
I comment well developer many distinguished engineer decade experience I explain everything abstract notion Web interaction finest detail HTTP syntax
That process honed model core set principle property constraint called REST
The constraint REST architectural style affect following architectural property REST separation concern simplifies component implementation reduces complexity connector semantics improves effectiveness performance tuning increase scalability pure server component
Layered system constraint allow introduced various point communication without changing interface component thus allowing assist communication translation improve performance via shared caching
REST enables intermediate processing constraining message interaction stateless request standard method medium type used indicate semantics exchange information response explicitly indicate
Six guiding constraint define RESTful system
These constraint restrict way server may process respond client request operating within constraint service gain desirable performance scalability simplicity modifiability visibility portability reliability
If service violates required constraint considered RESTful
The formal REST constraint follows The first constraint added hybrid style architectural style
The principle behind constraint separation concern
Separating user interface concern data storage concern improves portability user interface across multiple platform
It also improves scalability simplifying server component
Perhaps significant Web however separation allows component evolve independently thus supporting requirement multiple organizational domain
The communication constrained client context stored server request
Each request client contains information necessary service request session state held client
The session state transferred server another service database maintain persistent state period allow authentication
The client begin sending request ready make transition new state
While one request outstanding client considered
The representation application state contains link may used next time client chooses initiate new
As World Wide Web client intermediary cache response
Responses must therefore implicitly explicitly define cacheable prevent client reusing stale inappropriate data response request
caching partially completely eliminates interaction improving scalability performance
A client ordinarily tell whether connected directly end server intermediary along way
Intermediary server may improve system scalability enabling load balancing providing shared cache
They may also enforce security policy
Servers temporarily extend customize functionality client transferring executable code
Examples may include compiled component script
The uniform interface constraint fundamental design REST service
It simplifies decouples architecture enables part evolve independently
The four constraint uniform interface Web service adhere called RESTful APIs
RESTful APIs defined following aspect The following table show HTTP method typically used RESTful API The GET method meaning calling produce retrieving accessing record change
The PUT DELETE method meaning state system exposed API unchanged matter many time request repeated
Unlike Web service official standard RESTful Web APIs
This REST architectural style SOAP protocol
REST standard RESTful implementation make use standard
Many developer also describe APIs RESTful even though APIs actually fulfill architectural constraint described especially uniform interface constraint

I reading net get exact meaning two word REPRESENTATIONAL STATE I doubt
I misunderstanding term
want clarify understanding one good idea
My understanding resource located server
SO Rest mean transferring representational state resource client
server resource x make representational state resource x transferring web REST mean correct correct meaning
could one explain
Representational State Transfer refers transferring representation
You using representation resource transfer resource state life server application state client
Although REST stateless state transfer name
It little bit confusing everyone
When open web page browser act service consumer www server act service provider serve webpage
If normal connection client server perform handshake initiate session called TCP connection
After based server client behavior state change either ESTABLISHED IDLE TIMEOUT etc
But REST using HTTP protocol stateless meaning server store session information client
The client responsible sending detail required server get serviced meaning invoke URI server enough detail client serve fully
Using example open web page using URL view image file RESOURCE server www server show client image format REPRESENTATION RESOURCE image file
During process constant server
state image file stored server database represented client understandable format
client
So resource state remain constant respect client representation resource change turn would change application state
Finally representation resource image displayed client implicitly change state server client called REST
The meaning REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER REST RESTful put DIRECT VERB server In actual consideration example value put VERB commonly HTTP GET POST Has SIMPLE protocol much un like SOAP much complex
If answer satisfaction please provide elaborate question REST much topic discus topic many blog book I think whole question concern REST architectural style go around understanding author Roy Fielding mind suggest dissertation set architectural principle build architecture based hipertext hipermedia paradigm
This paradigm I think central key understand important topic
Behind style organizing application architecture proposed Roy Fielding I think specific idea modern application consists sort engine govern application state transition whose state potentially extensible infinite
In vision center whole architectural style proposed Fielding key concept allows paradigm work representational state transfer
instead concept state transfer representational representational type opinion main cause name Representational State Transfer
And first client architecture transit state showing rapresentation state sended component component call endorsing uniform consistent interface private api
This transition end communication representation called server component via verb compose public api belong stateless communication protocol used component
In way component interaction consists interchanging transferring communicating representation component state using stateless protocol
And core concept allows architecture potentially extend infinite representational transfer endorse architecture
Imagine state diagram following
If set web page would start landing page student
Per diagram would click Next link take page assume student graduated
By clicking next multiple time get last page
Of course could transition like Home allowing jump default page
The visible state website nothing server implement association internally internal state
It may involve multiple database server
A student may graduate status may updated via method
The client aware detail always expect get coherent visible state set human machine consumption
Another example As looking page particular identifiable reproducible location StackOverFlow web hierarchy
So RESTful State deal navigation

Representational state transfer REST distributed system framework us Web protocol technology
The REST architecture involves client server interaction built around transfer resource
The Web largest REST implementation
Systems conform REST principle referred RESTful
Roy Fielding one main author HTTP specification developed REST concept part doctoral dissertation
REST may used capture website data interpreting extensible markup language XML Web page file desired data
In addition online publisher use REST providing syndicated content user activating Web page content XML statement
Users may access Web page website URL read XML file Web browser interpret use data needed

Contributing Writer In Roy Fielding one primary author HTTP specification wrote doctoral dissertation titled
In coined term Representational State Transfer describe networking principle characterize World Wide Web
In broadest term REST outline define address source specific information commonly known resource
Resources referred individually universal resource identifier URL used Web address
The term REST often describes simple interface used transmit data HTTP without need additional messaging layer session tracking
REST architectural style standard implementation specification
The largest REST application Web characterized use HTTP transport URLs addressing mechanism
REST support type medium XML popular method used transport represent structured information
REST used HTML XHTML RSS proprietary XML vocabulary
Systems follow Fieldings REST principle called RESTful RESTs advocate call RESTafarians
But REST isnt possible approach building network application disagreement whether another might preferable
REST involves several basic notion Resources data object resource identifier network address URLs representation resource HTML document JPEG image accessed standardized interface HTTP
Origin server gateway proxy user agent communicate transferring representation resource interface operating directly resource
This generally done using operation Get Put
Clients server cache well tunnel Socks SSL connection present abstract interface communication hiding implementation detail communication mechanism
All request made connector must contain information necessary understand request without depending previous request
This contrast way many Web site use cooky maintain data session
With REST message must include information necessary understand context interaction
Many developer find REST challenging requires rethink problem term manipulating addressable resource instead calling another routine something data
With RESTful design Web service seen simply mean publishing information component process make accessible user machine process
For example Atom Publishing Protocol RESTful application widely used blog simplifies process publishing information make process available others interact information
In general REST requires le software approach single standard browser access application data resource

What Representational State Transfer refer
Found explanation
I still understand
For example article said The representation place client application state
Why
What state I understand something like session representation resource
Why
What state I understand something like session representation resource
An object attribute state behavior method
If I want move object desktop server I following Create representation state object
Transfer representation desktop server
The method I transfer
I install class definition machine
So REST creating representation object current state transferred another server object reconstructed
We send state attribute object
And create external serialized representation state
Consider client application kind giant state machine
The client initial state equal first representation returned server
Links returned representation provide possible state transition
One think note two major type link passive active
Passive link like actually cause state transition simply augment current state
Links like however active link cause state transition
After following one link new client state equal returned representation aka
If used building traditional desktop client application find radically different architecture
Not one likely grok overnight
Initially approach may seem limiting consider client application host many simultaneously executing state machine start realize anything could using remote object architecture still maintain loose coupling web browser
The Web comprised resource
A resource item interest
For example theBoeing Aircraft Corp may define resource
Clients may access resource thisURL representation resource returned
The representation place client application state
The result client traversing hyperlink another resource accessed
The new representation place client application yet another state
Thus client application change transfer state resource representation Representational State Transfer

In time program running contrast
A error detected execution running state program whereas error detected program ever executed
code optimization typically done compile time may done run time depending particular language compiler
When program executed first performs necessary setup link program need execution begin starting program
In case language implementation task done language runtime instead though unusual mainstream language common consumer operating system
Some program debugging performed efficient accurate performed runtime
bound checking example
For reason programming discovered program tested real data despite sophisticated checking testing
In case end user may encounter message
one language feature designed handle runtime error providing structured way catch completely unexpected situation well predictable error unusual result without amount inline error checking required language without
More recent advancement runtime engine enable provides debug information every exception interest implemented independent source code attaching special software product runtime engine

Why computer designer trade clock rate cycle count
Can somebody explain sentence
Should clock rate increase cycle count decrease
I understand cycle rate cycle count proportional
I sure I understand question
When designing CPU decide many pipeline stage accordingly much work done stage
Often part CPU work frequency well really true complex part limit frequency CPU able achieve
Some CPUs optimised high frequency many pipeline level ex Intel Pentium IV AMD Steamroller
Good number crunchers
Some CPUs optimised lower frequency cram work pipeline level ex
Intel Core Apple
This option often power efficient
Deeply pipelined CPUs waste cycle narrow one pipeline must emptied mispredicted branch interrupt
The number cycle wasted higher frequency also higher delay cycle bit shorter CPU
Maybe give context question

process performs instruction
The instruction program trigger sequence simple action executing machine
Those action produce effect according instruction program
Programs computer may execute without human interaction may type
In case command simply program whose execution chained together
The term used almost synonymously
A related meaning run execute refers specific action user starting program Please run application
The context execution take place crucial
Very program execute
Programs usually contain implicit explicit assumption resource available time execution
Most program execute support specific source language provide crucial service supplied directly computer
This supportive environment instance usually decouples program direct manipulation computer peripheral providing general abstract service instead
Prior execution program must first written
This generally done compiled statically linked executable
This executable invoked often operating system load program memory possibly performs begin execution moving control program step depend operating system
At point execution begin program enters
The program run end either normal termination
A system executes program called program
Loosely speaking interpreter actually program say
This contrast language translator convert program one language another
The common language translator
Translators typically convert source human readable language language sometimes low native simpler faster directly execute
The idea ratio execution translation program large program need compiled run number time
This provide large benefit translation versus direct interpretation source language
One development time increased compilation
In case changed file must recompiled
Then executable need relinked
For change executable must rebuilt scratch
As computer compiler become faster fact becomes le obstacle
Also speed end product typically important user development time
Translators usually produce abstract result completely ready execute
Frequently operating system convert translator final executable form execution program begin

I trying solve question concerning performance
I final answer I ca determine get
I know formula performance Execution time CPI I CPI Cycles Per Instruction I Instructions Question Determine number instruction reduces execution time
The first step find cycle per Instruction
The equation would I know answer CPI I understand get
would make mathematical sense
What I missing
Thanks
Since clock rate fixed number instruction needed new x x
That reduce number instruction original execution time drop well
Note question made mention cycle per instruction
It asked many instruction needed produce desired execution time

CSCI Great Ideas Computer Science c John Howland All Rights Reserved Department Computer Science Trinity University One Trinity Place San Antonio Texas Internet jhowland We say computer program written function constant execution time program
We say size problem program solves course often interested happens execution time size problem large
As example order notation consider following function computes largest element list number
To complete sort list notice could use list remains removing last known largest element
This process repeated successively shorter list list two number obtained
We see n used time used entire list find largest element put end
Then used list find largest element
Finally used two element list returned since element right order
Next count number comparison required sort element list
The first us comparison second us comparison last us comparison total comparison
For list element comparison total The execution time maximum function bubble sort QuickSort compared following chart
The numeric data graph show bubble sort probably practical n value much larger also show even QuickSort difficulty sorting large list
A computation said execution time le equal polynomial It follows computation execution time greater polynomial
We verify exponential behavior execution time experimentally
The rather complex J expression All mean execution time exponential approximately clearly greater polynomial
Hence fibonacci function example intractable computation
Suppose wish move one disk peg peg This easy task move disk Next consider problem moving two disk peg peg The move would b c b The problem moving three disk c bit complex
However decomposed three smaller problem namely moving top two disk b moving one disk c moving two disk b The move problem A algorithm exists computes possible path
There way choose first city path way choose second city etc
Since path city city b length city b city path consider
For n city program requires computing length path This problem studied year researcher found better solution one found tractable solution yet
Research continues problem
Here solution consider possible position shape bit harder describe since object orientation must considered well
This problem yet tractable solution
For example game Checkers piece small number move
At start game black possible move
White possble response move starting move black make reasonable response
It left exercise reader consider possibility
We organize complexity decision process drawing tree diagram represent decision choice
Samuels IBM Research studied problem developed program learned make checker decision playing copy program made random choice move
The program saved information decision led win learned avoid decision lead loss
After learning period time program able easily beat Samuels Checkers game
Brute force attempt consider possible choice clearly intractable
More complex game Chess also studied
Heuristic algorithm algorithm proven terminate finite amount time necessarily lead optimal solution used Chess playing computer program
Programs exist play almost Master level using method
Many problem remain intractable solution found
Such problem provide exciting challanging research experience computer scientist

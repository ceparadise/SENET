A budget allocated project begin
The budget sum cost likely incurred life project
The project manager goal stay within budget make sure project successful
There several indicator efficiency project
These indicator also point project progressing according plan corrective action needed
used performance indicator
Cost performance index CPI calculated using following formula Earned value abbreviated EV actual cost AC
denotes much money spent particular point project whereas indicates actual expenditure project point
Consider project budget
The project allocates budget follows At end design phase project estimated complete
This actual cost project completion
This calculated adding expense incurred project point
The earned value essentially budgeted value completion
Note earned value calculated project initiation various stage
In example project complete end build state earned value project
Let apply cost performance index formula The cost performance index le one indicates project budget stage
Generally calculating cost performance index value exactly one project budget value greater one project budget

Now design phase supposed last six month delayed
At end six month actual cost incurred
Since design complete earned value approximately put project budget
The cost performance index scenario In scenario cost performance index le one place project budget
This requires investigation cause extra cost
Once investigation complete necessary corrective action may required place project back budget
Projects might proceed according plan due variety reason
useful indicator project performance
If CPI equal project proceeding exactly per plan
If greater project budget
Even though good scenario might useful check le money spent
If CPI mean project budget corrective action might need taken

Building Better Project Managers In project management getting early indication problem silver bullet allows project manager correct problem start
The usually abbreviated CPI one fundamental output
It tell project manager far ahead behind project point analysis usually right
Where For example The Cost Performance Index represents relative amount task budget
For example task budget
cost performance index
This would represent task budget
The underlying Earned Value EV Actual Cost AC must calculated task task basis summed determine overall project CPI
It must time point reference word snapshot certain point time
The cost performance index always changing project getting budget time go work performed
The cost performance index analyzed conjunction SPI tell far ahead behind schedule project
The CV similar CPI give absolute rather relative amount project budget
In order calculate CPI project must initially divided task task must assigned following data This called give project manager something track
This planning step part one fundamental aspect project management
Also known Budgeted Cost Work Performed BCWP Earned Value amount task completed
It calculated project budget
For example actual percent complete task budget EV x
Also known Actual Cost Work Performed ACWP Actual Cost amount spent task
It include value labor material equipment item cost necessary complete task
For example actual cost lumber labor AC
Let say project two task building fence laying sod
The initial cost baseline Let say
Determine Cost Performance Index project
Determine percent complete task
Since real project assume task complete respectively
We add percent complete column table
Determine Earned Value EV Task complete therefore EV x
Task complete therefore EV x
Next add column called EV
Determine Actual Cost AC
Again since real project assume Task actual cost Task actual cost
Now add column called AC
Determine Cost Performance Index CPI CPI EV AC
The overall project cost performance index CPI therefore project budget
Even though second task budget first task budget greater amount therefore project good shape overall

By In blog post I going discus performance index project cost management Schedule Performance Index SPI Cost performance Index CPI
This blog post fourth blog post series seven Earned Value Management project forecasting
If coming search engine referral I suggest go previous three blog post reading post
Here link blog post So studied schedule variance cost variance
Like variance index also let know health project
They help analyze schedule cost performance project
Schedule Performance Index give information schedule performance project
In simple word Schedule Performance Index tell efficiently actually progressing compared planned progress
Below formula calculate SPI Schedule Performance Index Earned Value Planned Value SPI With formula conclude While calculating Schedule Performance Index make sure consider task
Sometimes may consider task ignore rest cause wrong result
Therefore ensure activity ignored
Given question Actual Cost AC Planned Value PV Earned Value EV Now Schedule Performance Index SPI EV PV Hence Schedule Performance Index Since Schedule Performance Index le one behind planned schedule
The Cost Performance Index indication cost performance project
The Cost Performance Index help analyze efficiency cost utilized project
It measure value work completed compared actual cost spent project
In simple word Cost Performance Index informs much earning dollar spent project
Below formula calculate CPI Cost Performance Index Earned Value Actual Cost CPI With formula conclude Given question Actual Cost AC Planned Value PV Earned Value EV Now Cost Performance Index CPI EV AC Hence Cost Performance Index Since Cost Performance Index le one mean earning USD every USD spending
In word budget
A consistently high low value SPI CPI indication something wrong either planning cost estimate
In case check assumption estimate correctness take corrective action needed
You studied variance index
Now thinking get information set parameter
variance index discard one set parameter
Why schedule variance cost variance taken account schedule performance index cost performance index
There difference variance index
In variance find difference two value index get ratio two value
In cost schedule variance result come dollar form
If number negative say project bad shape
However number positive say project good shape
The problem variance compare health project another project organization many project
Therefore use Performance Indexes compare health project among many project
The Performance Index ratio parameter glimpse ratio sufficient get idea health project
Performance Indexes make easier compare relative health project
Here concept related Earned Value Management EVM complete
In next blog post discus forecasting technique
If interested learning mathematical formula PMP exam try practice PMP exam sample question
image credit Hi
If CPI SPI would expect project end
Let say finished year end instead decleare finish May next year
Also reduction resource way
It seems contradiction av SPI long project still ongoing time amount resource Hello Sitara
Thanks visiting blog
As said CPI SPI I would say condition really bad I say project worst shape something terribly wrong schedule
In case project manager review project schedule network diagram
There must mistake otherwise condition mentioned rare
Let u say schedule OK project manager two option complete project either fast tracking crashing
If manage complete project fast tracking would needing extra money otherwise fresh cost estimation required
Hi Fahad
Good discussion
In case see budget exhausted
So could say fast require additional money case additional resource required complete job
Thanks Ram Since CPI project budget exhausted
How would explain situation CPI greater SPI le
If CPI greater one mean budget
If SPI le one mean behind schedule
These parameter simple telling although spending le money complete work moving slowly
You must speed activity cover schedule delay
hello sir please solve given project detail project

calculating CPI SPI value multiply get percentage value
No need multiply number
Thanks lot In blog u said every rupee v r earning cpi doesnt thar mean running budjet dont enough money
It mean budget corrective action taken fund may finish soon
hi u say good excelent
cpi spi
ur answer exellent ru approach
Hello Majid I get question correctly explain
I spi cpi teacher say spi cpi bad
cpi spi bad indicator
approach Alternative cpi spi
Thanks SPI CPI indicator direction project leading
CPI SPI good bad depends condition project
Hi help Exercises cod source Assumed I task day teacher say student must Design gant chart With c text file
Sincerely
Majid Sorry Majid I idea
You say explanation performance index value lie
However CPI SPI value exceed project well
That error Corrected
Thanks pointing
Hi Just question If PV EV AC task calculate SPI work package
SPI Schedule Performance Index
As name suggests SPI calculated schedule individual activity task work package
In case roll activity calculate SPI
These information used Performance Report show progress forecast project management
Management want see whole picture broad level interested seeing status thousand activity hundred work package
Hi Usmani I one question
Whether task type task impact SPI CPI EVM Metrics
example fixed duration task impact SPI CPI differ SPI CPI value fixed unit fixed work

I understand want ask
Can clarify I mean Does task type fixed duration fixed work fixed unit play hand determining CPI SPI value
start project allow determine baseline
work compared baseline
Great explanation Fahad
One question I
If SPI le say course mean behind always mean deliverable met
Can possible project complete deliverable accepted SPI still
Thanks Deliverable met even project behind schedule
It possible complete project spi still project complete work left spi
Thanks Fahad
How possible Fahad Deliverables met project behind schedule
Can elaborate
Suppose working project deliver deliverable interval
And deliver deliverable late say although deliverable met project behind schedule
Still could get
Let u say Project X deliverable
Day Day Day
If I saying Day delivered Day Project behind schedule
But deliverable met
No
Then saying met wrong
In case yes met SPI SPI
And importantly project SPI
No
As Cumulative SPI pull
Or I understanding differently
Yes right
In case proceeding correct direction deliver however delivering deviate schedule delayed
Thanks Fahad
The correct wording would Project delayed SPI however deliverable met NOT
When read first time felt like Project delayed deliverable met meaning case
Btw take CPI case complete Project project delivered delayed delivered
Will different
Regarding CPI need see much earned much spent
Hello CPI SPI benchmark recognized internationally
And You thé RD business
Regards thanks Pierre General understanding say revolve around
Some organization comfortable others
It organization decide benchmark depending risk tolerance
sir Fahad Usmani sb would like send primavera note
I search send I get something
Hello Do think CPI SPI would help determine whether project behind ahead schedule

Yes Schedule Performance Index SPI help determine whether project behind ahead schedule
Hello sir help solving one problem There project A completed day get completed day
And Planned value Actual cost What CPI SPI project
Since project completed mean SPI SPI EV PV Now CPI According question AC PV And This mean CPI Hence SPI CPI equal
Hope help
Yes sir really helped Thanks lot
But sir SPI CPI negative
And sir CPI SPI problem If activity completed day got completed day SPI CPI depends EV PV AC
These ratio negative
Regarding next doubt analyse logic
Thank cal elaborate Can SPI
And second question Is SPI Acc logic
The logic say SPI Mathematically come number get result
Hi When calculating SPI calculated PV complete BAC example six month passed one year duration project way may deceiving sometimes
assumes budget divided equally along month project duration
Would accurate get actual planned amount date use PV
Regards If concept clear deceived
I took simplest example make concept clear
another question please In calculating EV use complete term quantity ex
planned quantity cubic meter reinforced concrete finished month BAC date completed cubic meter EV BAC right accurate
Regards Let u use simple mathematics
The cost cubic meter concreting USD
This mean cost cubic meter concreting USD Therefore cost cubic meter concreting USD Hope help
Why use CPI correctly forecast EAC use SPI correctly forecast schedule completion
There another term called To complete schedule performance index
I understand PMI included PMBOK Guide
Hello congratulation blog
How calculate SPI activity start schedule
I tried cant calculate lower part fraction planned value equal zero
Thanks advance
You need review schedule first
To calculate SPI EV PV hand
I already calculated EV PV example EV PV task begun ahead schedule
Then impossible calculate SPI condition
Yes
Dear Fahad Here example BAC million Project Time month After one month EV million AC million PV million After calculation CPI mean project budget EAC million SPI mean project behind schedule EAC million Now question I relate CPI SPI time duration project month
If I devide time duration project SPI tell u estimated time duration project month case estimated cost would million
Is approach right wrong
If No please explain right approach Yes Can I also use CPI calculate estimated time duration project
And case estimated cost would relative cost
You relate CPI SPI
These two different parameter
CPI tell cost performance SPI tell schedule performance
Dear Fahad Thank much response
Its OK question relate specially SPI time duration
For example SPI mean behind schedule much behind term time duration
The approach I adopted right wrong
devide project time duration SPI estimated project time duration would month
Dear Fahad Thanks reply
Actually I want ask relate SPI project time duration
For example SPI tell u behind schedule question much behind term project time
If I devide project time duration month SPI estimated project time duration would month
Is approach right wrong
You compare actual progress planned progress schedule baseline
This comparison show much lagging
I project CPI SPI
However tracked MSP schedule show variance delay day
Can anybody comment wrong situation project based
The project duration day day passed
Raghu Hi Fahad Quick question
SPI change order added PV suddenly change
Some CO added already complete time added schedule time planned date change order need adjusted otherwise SPI seem calculate properly
Any thought
Thanks Lisa Once change request approved baseline updated calculate PV per current situation
Thanks sharing knowledge started discus lot
regard You welcome Anwar
Dear sir thanks nice article
could please tell PV calculated project delayed
As calculate per initial date PV exceeds budget
Or need make new baseline calculate PV respect delayed date
thanks vpt
You calculate PV based current schedule
If behind schedule recover must change schedule baseline

Project Cost Management involves monitoring project performance based index
In article explore Cost Performance Index CPI Schedule Performance Index SPI conducting Earned Value Analysis
Examples also provided Earned Value Analysis
Earned Value EV Analysis leverage determine project performance index pertaining project cost schedule
Earned Value part process group Project Cost Management
Earned Value Performance formula consist You start see many different abbreviation next section I listed help continue reading
EV Earned Value PV Planned Value BAC Budget Completion AC Actual Cost The following formula used following example
PV Planned Completion BAC EV Actual Completion BAC CPI SPI Suppose budgeted cost project
The project completed month
After month completed percent project total expense
The planned completion percent
Now let see healthy project computing CPI SPI
From scenario extract following The Planned Value PV Earned Value EV computed follows Compute earned value variance Since Cost Performance Index CPI index Schedule Performance Index SPI index le mean project budget behind schedule
This example project major trouble corrective action need taken

Suppose managing software development project
The project expected completed month cost per month
After month realize project percent completed cost
You need determine whether project month
Step Calculate Planned Value PV Earned Value EV From scenario Therefore Step Compute Cost Performance Index CPI Schedule Performance Index SPI Since Cost Performance Index CPI le one mean project budget
For every dollar spent getting cent worth performance
Since Schedule Performance Index SPI one project ahead schedule
However come cost going budget
If work continued rate project delivered ahead schedule budget
Therefore corrective action taken
Apart computing Cost Performance Index CPI Schedule Performance Index SPI calculate earned value
In addition use

amount work accomplished computer system
Depending context high computer performance may involve one following The performance computer system evaluated measurable technical term using one metric listed
This way performance Whilst definition relates scientific technical approach following definition given would useful audience performance performance particularly response time aspect important
Performance engineering within system engineering encompasses set role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase system development life cycle ensures solution designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement defined solution
Performance engineering continuously deal type performance
Occasionally find way make CPU better overall performance improving one aspect performance presented without sacrificing CPU performance area
For example building CPU better faster transistor
However sometimes pushing one type performance extreme lead CPU worse overall performance important aspect sacrificed get one number example chip see
Application Performance Engineering APE specific methodology within designed meet challenge associated application performance increasingly distributed mobile cloud terrestrial IT environment
It includes role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase application lifecycle ensure application designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement
Computer performance thing measure include
benchmark available
Availability system typically measured factor reliability reliability increase availability le
Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication
In reliable communication system latency limit maximum rate information transmitted often limit amount information one moment
In field interaction perceptible latency delay user command computer provides result strong effect user satisfaction usability
Computers run set instruction called process
In operating system execution process postponed process also executing
In addition operating system schedule perform action process commanding
For example suppose process command computer card voltage output set rate Hz
The operating system may choose adjust scheduling transition based internal clock
The latency delay process instruction commanding transition hardware actually transitioning voltage high low low high
System designer building system want guarantee response
That easier CPU low deterministic response
In computer networking bandwidth measurement available consumed data communication resource expressed bit per second multiple etc
Bandwidth sometimes defines net bit rate aka
peak bit rate information rate physical layer useful bit rate channel capacity maximum throughput logical physical communication path digital communication system
For example bandwidth test measure maximum throughput computer network
The reason usage according Hartley law maximum data rate physical communication link proportional bandwidth hertz sometimes called frequency bandwidth spectral bandwidth RF bandwidth signal bandwidth analog bandwidth
In general term throughput rate production rate something processed
In communication network throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth consumption
In unit maximum system throughput aggregate throughput divided analog bandwidth measure system coverage area
In integrated circuit often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis
Scalability ability system network process handle growing amount work capable manner ability enlarged accommodate growth The amount electricity used computer
This becomes especially important system limited power source solar battery human power
System designer building pick CPUs based speed per watt power cost powering CPU outweighs cost CPU
Compression useful help reduce resource usage data storage space transmission capacity
Because compressed data must decompressed use extra processing imposes computational cost decompression situation far free lunch
Data compression subject complexity
This important performance feature mobile system smart phone keep pocket portable embedded system spacecraft
The effect computer computer environment manufacturing recycling well use
Measurements taken objective reducing waste reducing hazardous material minimizing computer
Because many program test CPU aspect performance developed
The famous benchmark SPECint benchmark developed benchmark developed Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium
In software engineering performance testing general testing performed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
Performance testing subset performance engineering emerging computer science practice strives build performance implementation design architecture system
In profiling program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
The common use profiling information aid program
Profiling achieved instrumenting either program binary executable form using tool called
A number different technique may used profilers statistical instrumented simulation method
Performance tuning improvement performance
This typically computer application method applied economic market bureaucracy complex system
The motivation activity called performance problem real anticipated
Most system respond increased degree decreasing performance
A system ability accept higher load called modifying system handle higher load synonymous performance tuning
Systematic tuning follows step Perceived performance computer engineering refers quickly software feature appears perform task
The concept applies mainly user acceptance aspect
The amount time application take start file download made faster showing startup screen see Splash screen file progress dialog box
However satisfies human need appears faster user well providing visual cue let know system handling request
In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design
For given instruction set therefore fixed N semiconductor process maximum performance requires balance brainiac technique speedracer technique

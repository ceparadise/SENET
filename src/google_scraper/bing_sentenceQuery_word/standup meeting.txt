The common format meeting always felt bit odd
It even lead
In post I like share meeting hack use
meeting popular way start day many product development team
Usually take around minute held standing surprise
The idea keep meeting short point
With mind everybody go routine question I huge fan meeting effective way get everyone date identify potential roadblock ahead
Less email le unfocused meeting le interruption flow time
As added bonus also great onboarding new team member
Let look introducing three simple concept helped u make work way better u
In ideal world people well prepared go question quickly start day Ã©lan
Unfortunately always case
Turns answering usual meeting question easy especially caught
What I yesterday I What I today I Starting daily hurry easily lead commitment
That start brewing enjoying tea together
It beautiful ritual reminds u slow clear mind
It connects u moment
A day full challenge distraction want make time contemplate
The tea ritual act buffer whatever come
On similar note I quite surprised I first saw following HSBC ad cultural difference also feature meeting Following update meeting difficult
Another issue conventional format task workstreams discussed coherently instead subject come briefly depending order team member speak
This make hard tell really going
Constant context switching hard grasp drain energy
We make meeting bit easier follow using Kanban board
A Kanban board nothing simple board card
You use physical whiteboard dedicated app like
A Kanban board provides context meeting visualizing going moment
The board show working workflow ready next stage item stuck blocked
Also looking board get sense whether working many thing time something interesting forgot mention
A Kanban board help notice thing might easily get lost common meeting
Just grab try
You surprised much help
We experimented lot common format added tea ritual changed strict question format conversation board actually stand time pssst
We even calling meeting
We call tea time might tweak thing going forward
After another tool
Play around
Another great example team
Joel Gascoigne decided include section routine
Looks like great team join care self improvement environment actively support

This daily standup supposed
As scrum master job clarify daily standup PO meeting

If happend job turn tide bring meeting back track
You talk team clarify reporting PO
Its main purpose work team keep everyone updated proceeding happened day
It way bring notice impediment faced member team

A simply meeting attendee typically participate standing
The discomfort standing long period intended keep meeting short
Stand meeting may also benefit
By tradition meet standing
Some software development methodology envision daily make commitment team member
The daily commitment allows participant know potential challenge well coordinate effort resolve difficult issue
The particular value process utilized context
The meeting usually minute take place participant standing remind people keep meeting short
The meeting sometimes also referred morning rollcall daily
The meeting take place time place every working day
All team member encouraged attend meeting postponed team member present
One crucial feature meeting intended communication vehicle team member status update management stakeholder
Although sometimes referred type structure meeting meant promote conversation well identify issue become problematic
The practice also promotes closer working relationship frequency need conversation short structure turn result higher rate knowledge transfer much active intention typical status meeting

We professional Scrum Master consultant recently joined project
Unfortunately know name never introduced u came one day said daily seem much else except chair daily stand meeting I asked also give daily feedback meeting quite affronted saying Scrum Master job facilitate participate
This seems fairly worked agile project team self directed supposed egalitarian I sure work Scrum Methodology
I suspect much day reason defensiveness issue
Does Scrum Master take part yesterday today impediment spiel meeting role chair facilitate meeting
We actually told job assume since call Scrum Master Ideally scrum master responsible facilitating project activity address sort impediment faced
participate yesterday today impediment spiel daily per se however answerable team member kind status impediment reported earlier
I worked scrum team reputed organization followed practice
To get detailed picture responsibility scrum master I recommend look I SM many year I defer team
If would like participate I well facilitate
The idea one leader
The team ability SM sweep demand stand without introducing
In give status impediment retrospective give opinion could made meaningful efficient
If one expects SM give status daily activity IMHO one wrong expectation
Purpose status team align activity know team member would want know SM yesterday plan today
At least one even suggest SM even required daily basis
A quote The Scrum Master job Nevertheless IMHO increase transparency join yesterday today impediment procedure
Also IMHO perfect optionally also participate answer three sentence inside Daily Scrum
But official Scrum
I Scrum Teams position Scrum Master use electronic Taskboard agile practice
All team exception one provides status task working moving one person next typical standup process
The exception team decided wanted standup going story story asked I lead one drive meeting
Is Scrum Master take role standup
I understand team resource seems babysitting role designed make everyone pay attention instead team responsible adult want take trouble
One member team also work one team mentioned sprint retro much faster meeting go person step take lead board
It make difference team PO pushed team stand ground method
Your company started wrong
The scrum master part team
By hiring full time scrum master add another layer team holder
Totally Agile
One person team normally manager also part team take role scrum master
But really
role anyone fill needed
In one team used rotate every month
Now answer question
The SM part team take part team
easy
SM menial job following thing externally team
So SM usually take little le work one interrupted time external communication sending email like update ask
nothing
Snake oil salesman saw opportunity selling full time scrum master scum earth go completely Agile noted
Scrum Master give status update facilitate stand meeting
Their role make sure meeting start time everyone meeting give status update within time frame take action roadblock completing task
FYI using daily stand meeting online also allows offshore team participate facilitate meeting process submitted task online
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

The special attribute parser LR k grammar transformed LR grammar
It handle
In past LR k parser avoided huge memory requirement favor le powerful alternative parser
Recently however minimal LR parser whose space requirement close LALR parser offered several parser generator
Like parser LR parser automatically generated like MSTA Menhir HYACC LRSTAR
In invented LR k parser eft right parser type generalization existing
This parser potential recognizing deterministic language produce left right derivation statement encountered input file
Knuth proved reach maximum language recognition power provided method transforming LR k k grammar LR grammar
Canonical LR parser practical disadvantage enormous memory requirement internal representation
In Frank DeRemer suggested two simplified version LR parser called
These parser require much le memory Canonical LR parser slightly le power
LALR parser common implementation LR Parser
However new type LR parser people call minimal LR parser introduced David Pager showed LR parser created whose memory requirement rival LALR parser
Recently parser generator offering minimal LR parser solve memory requirement problem also inherent LALR parser generator
The LR parser operation based static
These codify grammar language recognizes typically called parsing table
The parsing table LR parser parameterized lookahead terminal
Simple parsing table like used parser represent grammar rule form mean go state state go state
After parameterizing rule lookahead mean transition performed lookahead terminal
This allows richer language simple rule different meaning depending lookahead context
For example LR grammar following rule transition different state spite based state sequence
The would true lookahead terminal taken account
Parsing error identified without parser read whole input declaring rule error
For example declared error causing parser stop
This mean lookahead information also used catch error following example In case A B reduced lookahead b c error reported lookahead The lookahead also helpful deciding reduce rule
The lookahead help avoid reducing specific rule lookahead valid would probably mean current state combined following instead previous state
That mean following example state sequence reduced instead lookahead parser went state B acceptable
transition rule existed
It noted state produced directly terminal allows state sequence appear
LR parser requirement rule expressed complete LR manner
sequence two state specific lookahead
That make simple rule requiring great many artificial rule essentially enumerate combination possible state lookahead terminal follow
A similar problem appears implementing rule possible lookaheads must enumerated
That reason LR parser practically implemented without significant memory optimization
LR parsing table constructed way modification contains lookahead
This mean contrary LR parser different action may executed item process followed different terminal
Starting language first item set language determined
In plain word item set list production rule currently processed symbol might part
An item set correspondence parser state item within set together next symbol used decide state transition parser action applied
Each item contains marker note point currently processed symbol appears rule item represents
For LR parser item specific lookahead terminal thus lookahead terminal also noted inside item
For example assume language consisting terminal symbol nonterminals starting rule following production rule Items set generated analog procedure LR parser
The item set represents initial state created starting rule The dot denotes marker current parsing position within rule
The expected lookahead terminal apply rule noted comma
The sign used denote input expected case starting rule
This complete item set though
Each item set must mean production rule nonterminal following recursively included item set nonterminals dealt
The resulting item set called closure item set began
For LR production rule item included possible lookahead terminal following rule
For complex language usually result large item set reason large memory requirement LR parser
In example starting symbol requires nonterminal turn requires thus production rule appear item set
At first ignore problem finding lookaheads look case LR whose item contain lookahead terminal
So item set without lookaheads look like To determine lookahead terminal FIRST FOLLOW set used
FIRST A set terminal appear first element chain rule matching nonterminal A
FOLLOW I Item I A α B β x set terminal appear immediately B α β arbitrary symbol string x arbitrary lookahead terminal
FOLLOW k B item set k nonterminal B union follow set item k followed B
The FIRST set determined directly closure nonterminals language FOLLOW set determined item usage FIRST set
In example one verify full list item set first set Within item set follow set found From full item set LR parser created creating item LR item set one copy terminal follow set LHS nonterminal
Each element follow set may valid lookahead terminal The rest item set created following algorithm In example get set item set item set nonterminal E item set nonterminal T item set terminal n item set terminal item set
Item set E Item set T Item set n Item set Item set From item set several item set produced
The complete list quite long thus stated
Detailed LR k treatment grammar
found
The lookahead LR item used directly considering reduce action marker right end
The LR item S A B e c LR item S A B Different LR item may share core
For example item set parser required perform reduction E T next symbol shift next symbol
Note LR parser would able make decision considers core item would thus report conflict
A state containing A α X β move state containing A α X β label X
Every state transition according Goto
If A α b β state I I move state I label b add action If state I add action

To parse computer science string command usually program separated easily processed component analyzed correct syntax attached tag define component
The computer process program chunk transform machine language
To parse break sentence group word separate component including definition part function form
The technical definition implies concept

I college student getting Computer Science degree
A lot fellow student really done lot programming
They done class assignment let honest question really teach program
I several student ask question parse thing I never quite sure explain
Is best start going line line looking substring give complicated lecture using proper lexical analysis etc
create token use BNF stuff
They never quite understand I try explain
What best approach explain without confusing discouraging actually trying
Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise
I explain parsing process turning kind data another kind data
In practice almost always turning string binary data data structure inside Program
For example turning C process analyzing text made sequence token determine grammatical structure respect given le formal grammar
The parser build data structure based token
This data structure used compiler interpreter translator create executable program library
If I gave english sentence asked break sentence part speech noun verb etc
would parsing sentence
That simplest explanation parsing I think
That said parsing computational problem
You start simple example work way complex
In computer science parsing process analysing text determine belongs specific language

It informal name process
For example suppose language mean number character A followed number character B
A parser language would accept input reject input
That parser
In addition process data structure could created processing
In previous example could instance store two separate stack
Anything happens like giving meaning transform something else parsing
Giving meaning part input sequence token called
I think best way understanding parsing concept begin simpler concept
The simplest one language processing subject finite automaton
It formalism parsing regular language regular expression
It simple input set state set transition
Consider following language built alphabet
The automaton represents possible parser language whose valid word start
It simple parser language
You start initial state read symbol input move state otherwise remember remember alphabet move state
If reach state input accepted
As visual need pencil piece paper explain parser anyone including child
I think simplicity make automaton suitable way teaching language processing concept parsing
Finally Computer Science student study concept theoretical computer science class Formal Languages Theory Computation
Have try write program evaluate arbitrary simple arithmetic expression
This simple problem understand start getting deeper lot basic parsing start make sense
In linguistics divide language small component analyzed
For example parsing sentence would involve dividing word phrase identifying type component verb adjective noun
Parsing important part many computer science discipline
For example compiler must parse source code able translate object code
Likewise application process complex command must able parse command
This includes virtually application
Parsing often divided lexical analysis semantic parsing
Lexical analysis concentrate dividing string component called token based punctuationand key
Semantic parsing attempt determine meaning string
I think need teach think like
So simplest way I think explain parsing someone new concept
Generally try parse data one line time generally easier human think way dividing conquering also easier code
We call field every minimum undivisible data
Name field Age another field Surname another field
For example
In line various field
In order distinguish delimit field separator maximum length assign field
For example By separating field comma Jones Or space Name letter max age digit Jones letter Paul Any set field called record
To separate delimited field record need delimit record
A dot enough though know apply
A list could James
Jordan James You say list nba nlf player like
Then type according format
Then make program parse display record
One group make list format program parse list fixed size format viceversa
Parsing breaking something meaningful part using definable predefined known common set part definition
For programming language would keyword part usable punctuation sequence For pumpkin pie might something like crust filling topping
For written language might word sentence verb For spoken language might tone volume mood implication emotion context Syntax analysis well common sense would tell parsing pumpkinpie programming language
Does crust
well maybe pumpkin pudding perhaps spoken language
One thing note parsing stuff usually many way break thing part
For example could break pumpkin pie cutting center edge bottom top scoop get filling using sledge hammer eating
And parse thing would determine something part easy hard
In computer language world common way parse text source code
These common method algorithims title name
Search Internet common way parse language
Wikipedia help regard
Simple explanation Parsing breaking block data smaller piece token following set rule using delimiters example data could process piece piece managed analysed interpreted transmitted ets
Examples Many application like Spreadsheet program use CSV Comma Separated Values file format import export data
CSV format make possible application process data help special parser
Web browser special parser HTML CSS file
JSON parser exist
All special file format must parser designed specifically

No typo word sparse
The word parse mean analyze object specifically
It commonly used computer science refer reading program
For example program written whether language code need parsed order compiled
Web written scripting language need parsed Web server output correct user browser
Parsing also refer breaking ordinary text
For example typically parse search phrase entered user accurately search word
Some program parse text document extract certain information like name address
program turn formatted document table row column parsing text
As see way parse clearly sparse

process analysing either conforming rule
The term come Latin meaning
The term slightly different meaning different branch
Traditional parsing often performed method understanding exact meaning sentence word sometimes aid device
It usually emphasizes importance grammatical division
Within term used refer formal analysis computer sentence string word constituent resulting showing syntactic relation may also contain semantic information
The term also used describing language comprehension
In context parsing refers way human being analyze sentence phrase spoken language text term grammatical constituent identifying part speech syntactic relation etc
This term especially common discussing linguistic cue help speaker interpret
Within computer science term used analysis referring syntactic analysis input code component part order facilitate writing
The term may also used describe split separation
The traditional grammatical exercise parsing sometimes known involves breaking text component part speech explanation form function syntactic relationship part
This determined large part study language quite intricate heavily inflected language
To parse phrase bite dog involves noting singular noun subject sentence verb third person singular present tense verb bite singular noun object sentence
Techniques sometimes used indicate relation element sentence
Parsing formerly central teaching grammar throughout world widely regarded basic use understanding written language
However general teaching technique longer current
Normally parsing defined separation
To separate sentence grammatical meaning word phrase number
In system written text human language parsed computer program
Human sentence easily parsed program substantial structure human language whose usage convey meaning amongst potentially unlimited range possibility germane particular case
So utterance Man bite dog versus Dog bite man definite one detail another language might appear Man dog bite reliance larger context distinguish two possibility indeed difference concern
It difficult prepare formal rule describe informal behaviour even though clear rule followed
In order parse natural language data researcher must first agree used
The choice syntax affected computational concern instance parsing system use general parsing grammar type known
another linguistic formalism popular parsing community research effort focused le complex formalism one used Penn
aim find boundary major constituent noun phrase
Another popular strategy avoiding linguistic controversy parsing
Most modern parser least partly rely corpus training data already annotated parsed hand
This approach allows system gather information frequency various construction occur specific context
Approaches used include straightforward probabilistic grammar
Most successful system use statistic consider identity word involved well
However system vulnerable require kind effective
Parsing algorithm natural language rely grammar property manually designed grammar programming language
As mentioned earlier grammar formalism difficult parse computationally general even desired structure kind approximation grammar used perform first pas
Algorithms use grammar often rely variant usually prune away unlikely analysis save time
However system trade speed accuracy using version algorithm
A somewhat recent development parser proposes large number analysis complex system selects best option
In parsing involves assignment word category evaluation meaning sentence according rule syntax drawn inference made word sentence
This normally occurs word heard read
Consequently psycholinguistic model parsing necessity meaning build interpretation sentence processed normally expressed term partial syntactic structure
Creation initially wrong structure occurs interpreting
A software component take input data frequently text build often kind hierarchical structure giving structural representation input checking correct syntax process
The parsing may preceded followed step may combined single step
The parser often preceded separate creates token sequence input character alternatively combined
Parsers may programmed hand may automatically generated
Parsing complementary produce formatted These may applied different domain often appear together pair input front end parsing output back end code generation stage compiler
The input parser often text may also text natural language le structured textual data case generally certain part text extracted rather parse tree constructed
Parsers range simple function complex program frontend parser
An important class simple parsing done using group regular expression defines regular expression engine automatically generating parser language allowing pattern matching extraction text
In context regular expression instead used prior parsing lexing step whose output used parser
The use parser varies input
In case data language parser often found file reading facility program reading HTML text example
In case parser component par create form internal representation parser key step
Programming language tend specified term fast efficient parser written
For compiler parsing done one pas multiple pass see
The implied disadvantage compiler largely overcome adding provision made forward pas applied backwards current program segment recognized completed
An example mechanism would useful would forward GOTO statement target GOTO unknown program segment completed
In case application would delayed target GOTO recognized
Obviously backward GOTO require
grammar limited extent express requirement language
Informally reason memory language limited
The grammar remember presence construct arbitrarily long input necessary language example name must declared may referenced
More powerful grammar express constraint however parsed efficiently
Thus common strategy create relaxed parser grammar accepts superset desired language construct accepts invalid construct later unwanted construct filtered contextual analysis step
For example following syntactically valid code The following code however syntactically valid term grammar yielding syntax tree structure previous syntactically invalid term requires variable initialized use Rather analyzed parsing stage caught checking syntax tree hence part analysis syntax practice often easily analyzed semantics
The following example demonstrates common case parsing computer language two level grammar lexical syntactic
The first stage token generation input character stream split meaningful symbol defined grammar
For example calculator program would look input split token meaningful symbol context arithmetic expression
The lexer would contain rule tell character mark start new token meaningless token like generated
The next stage parsing syntactic analysis checking token form allowable expression
This usually done reference recursively defines component make expression order must appear
However rule defining programming language expressed grammar alone example type validity proper declaration identifier
These rule formally expressed
The final phase analysis working implication expression validated taking appropriate action
In case calculator interpreter action evaluate expression program compiler hand would generate kind code
Attribute grammar also used define action
The parser essentially determine input derived start symbol grammar
This done essentially two way example parser accommodate
Although believed simple implementation parsing accommodate direct indirect may require exponential time space complexity parsing ambiguous sophisticated algorithm parsing created Frost Hafiz Callaghan accommodate polynomial time generate representation potentially exponential number parse tree
Their algorithm able produce derivation input regard given
An important distinction regard parser whether parser generates see
LL parser generate leftmost LR parser generate rightmost derivation although usually reverse
Some well known parser development tool include following
Also see
Lookahead establishes maximum incoming token parser use decide rule use
Lookahead especially relevant often explicitly indicated affixing lookahead algorithm name parenthesis LALR
Most primary target parser carefully defined way parser limited lookahead typically one parse parser limited lookahead often efficient
One important change trend came created thesis efficient LL parser fixed value
Parsers typically action seeing token
They shift add token stack later reduction reduce pop token stack form syntactic construct end error known rule applies conflict know whether shift reduce
Lookahead two advantage
Example Parsing Expression Most programming language except APL Smalltalk algebraic formula give higher precedence multiplication addition case correct interpretation example
Note semantic rule
It possible rewrite grammar incorporate syntax
However rule translated syntax
Initially Input The parse tree resulting code correct according language semantics
To correctly parse without lookahead three solution The parse tree generated correct simply efficient parser
This strategy followed

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I read algorithm LR k parser frequent mention selecting handle grammar given
For example one document said Please help understand handle parsing
This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
Let consider following grammar S A b S B b A B Obviously language totally uninteresting word aab aaab
However grammar LL LL sure know problem
Let try parsing input aaab going one character time pretending know absolutely nothing rest string except next token essentially use token lookahead
We allowed use knowledge everything seen far though
Initially know string start
This tell u absolutely nothing whether production production grammar
Luckily really care point
Let skip go next point
We remember look next token
This another
Note seen aa mean might case might case first two constitute instance A
We leave moment first officially
We look third token find
We want decide whether two saw earlier really constitute A LR k algorithm never delay decision
As A always followed b decide case next token
Reading know definitely case assuming input correct
Our lookahead becomes b precisely expect
We therefore decide three seen far fact B
Note point longer need seen three need know seen B
This effectively situation would Bb input read B make everything easier remember precisely corresponds reduce action LR k parser
Finishing read b find end input decide left part must S decide input correct
The LR k algorithm work pretty much described
It remembers seen far decides based information next token whether last bit seen far nonterminal
It replaces nonterminal shuffle information around continues replacement taken place input
The crucial bit finding seen far precise last bit seen far actually instance nonterminal expansion production
In example transformed two start A everything would went wrong
We say aa handle point
However aaa handle correctly replaced B
A grammar LR k always make correct decision handle using k token lookahead everything seen far

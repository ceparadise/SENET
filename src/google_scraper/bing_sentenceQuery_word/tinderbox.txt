When think romance unlikely first thing come mind neuroscience lab
But idea attraction love actually shaped
Not long ago relationship date would largely limited people encountered advent online dating changed
Undoubtedly one biggest modern dating landscape Tinder simple ubiquitous allows individual give yes brief profile potential match
Once two individual say yes become match talk
Due simplicity also relatively straightforward test online dating format may come endless form questionnaire lengthy profile fill text Tinder largely driven single image
With mind researcher set investigate different feature image affect desirability potential match using Tinder
As Tom van Bommel lead study put Over past decade quite large amount research predict something brain activity done yet dating one important part life partner going
So gap quite interesting u
With elegant experimental setup configured iMotions Tom colleague able present participant Tinder replica asking accept reject swiping right left respectively photo potential match
As stimulus essentially simple relatively straightforward manipulate image see changing parameter affect outcome participant desire person image
As Tom stated We make Tinder replica wanted control photo make concession realism For study Tom colleague used With approach able extract information brain activity participant looked reacted image
One crucial piece information used measure prefrontal asymmetry recording brain activity relates difference activity two frontal lobe
essence indicates approach avoidance feeling participant
ABM EEG device also calculates predefined metric cognitive workload used determine mentally taxing certain stimulus
By combining measure researcher able determine brain activity participant basis thus tie image participant saw
One first finding Tom colleague discovered increased prefrontal asymmetry positively correlated success image
This showed increased brain engagement linked attractiveness image
Going one step researcher also looked level cognitive workload relation attractiveness image whether participant swiped left right
What found helpful information seeking improve online profile correlation showed workload increased le likely participant attracted person image
For looking tip use science improve dating app success team ST T worked five parameter linked level cognitive workload related impact adjusted image fared presented participant
They found following affected image attractiveness Testing researcher found recipe perfect Tinder photo consists Examples image would increase cognitive workload parameter shown well image would require le workload
Images require large amount cognitive processing appear le attractive within online dating context
This made possible using biometric approach defining brain activity change relate image success researcher able delineate feature would work
As Tom noted iMotions made incredibly easy By integrating multiple sensor synchronously Tom van Bommel team able construct insight preference shown mobile dating app
While finding certainly goldmine interested science attraction looking get date researcher already sight set field addition everyday work neuromarketing agency including investigation gambling stock market
Tom see brighter future work This definitely grow everytime visit client potential client talk neuromarketing research hear often going really enthused I hope enjoyed reading biometric study Tinder use feel inspired carry research

Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace

Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy

Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

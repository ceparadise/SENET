computer programming mechanism method called upon object function called argument looked name
With language compilation phase fix type variable expression
This usually stored compiled program offset efficient
With late binding compiler read enough information verify method exists bind slot
Instead method looked name runtime
The primary advantage using late binding COM programming require compiler reference library contain object
This make compilation process resistant version conflict class may accidentally modified
This concern platform Java created runtime library loaded running application
The term late binding date back least found
The term widely used describe calling convention language like Lisp though usually negative connotation performance
In popularized OOP late binding
said OOP mean messaging local retention protection hiding extreme thing
It done Smalltalk LISP
There possibly system possible I aware
In early Microsoft heavily promoted COM standard binary interface different OOP programming language
COM programming equally promoted early late binding many language supporting syntax level
In coined term refer similar concept different emphasis
While late binding generally focus implementation detail duck typing focus ability ignore type concentrate method object currently
In language list method object altered runtime
This requires late binding
In
late bound global function call efficiently looked runtime via function cell
These function binding mutable
Example using interactive session In late binding also called dynamic binding normally happens keyword used method declaration
creates virtual table table function always consulted called
Usually late binding term used favor
In COM programming method call performed using interface
Some language Visual Basic syntactical support calling interface
This done defining variable type Object
Others require explicitly call GetIDsOfNames look method Invoke call
Like COM Java Common Language Runtime provides reflection APIs make late binding call possible
The use call varies language C Visual Basic
Prior version C allowed late binding via appropriate reflection API
A different API would needed COM DLR object
With C language gained dynamic
This would used place Object type indicate late binding desired
The specific late binding mechanism needed determined runtime using Dynamic Language Runtime starting point
Visual Basic us whenever variable type Object compiler directive Option Strict Off force
This default setting new VB project
Prior version COM object could late bound
With VB extended object
There three definition late binding Java
Early document Java discussed class linked together compile time
While type statically checked compile time different implementation class could swapped prior runtime simply overwriting class file
As long new class definition class method name code would still work
In sense similar traditional definition late binding
Currently popular use term late binding Java programming synonym
Specifically refers Java mechanism used virtual method
Finally Java use late binding using reflection APIs much way done COM programming
Generally speaking program Java call late binding
Likewise use duck typing technique frowned upon Java programming abstract interface used instead
It noted Oracle current owner Java known use term late binding duck typing sense discussing Java language documentation
When using early binding Ada procedure timestamp checked verify stored procedure changed since code compiled
This allows faster execution prevents application running wrong version stored procedure
When using late binding timestamp check performed stored procedure executed via anonymous block
While slower remove need recompile client application stored procedure change
This distinction appears unique Ada
Other language call procedure well database engine use late binding
Late binding poorer performance early bound method call
Under implementation correct method address must looked name call requiring relatively expensive dictionary search possibly overload resolution logic
Late binding necessarily prevents use static type checking
When making late bound call compiler assume method exists
This mean simple spelling error cause runtime error thrown
The exact exception varies language usually named something like Method Not Found Method Missing
Late binding prevents many form static analysis needed IDE
For example IDE go definition feature used call IDE way know class call may refer
Another problem lack typing information prevents creation dependency graph
However programming method abstract interface result problem

I read
seem thing
It confusing
Can I tell free variable one assigned value whereas bound variable value assigned
Binding giving name thing value given well delimited context
Assignment storing thing value location variable
Another assignment replace previous value new one
Valuation consist binding identifier formal text something value
In mathematics identifier often called variable cause confusion concept variable
memory storage computer science
Name binding attache meaning identifier within part called scope concerned mathematical programming text
This meaning indeed seen value domain text interpreted
For example declare integer variable value attached within scope integer variable
An integer variable may seen informally container carry integer value may changed
You also see address place memory content may stored
But declare integer whithin scope use identical use
If declare foo integer constant change thus value must specified
Binding attaching name value change within scope name
An example legal document stating The scope legal document
And everywhere document use word mean Brown Smith family
You see definition local terminology
It giving name thing
Binding speaking reading writing
It executing moving value around corresponds assignment
A variable may seen chunk memory contain value When variable change value contained variable contains assignment
If bound denotes variable current scope assign value
variable denoted read value contained variable
And change value new assignment
So binding operation tell meaning name text program mathematical discourse
It static sense text change
But assignment programming concept consist storing value variable
container usually place memory
It dynamic concept related representation value stored memory change program progress
Note variable may exist independently name could bound
This case element array take simple example
In various context one may consider expression text use name defined
For example write arithmetic expression
Then may valuate variable associating environment may read approximately scope variable b bound value example interested value taken exression
A valuation association set name specific value
The name valuation used formal mathematics assigment programming concept

I understand implementation dynamic binding work also difference static dynamic binding I trouble wrapping brain around definition dynamic binding
Basically binding type
Basically dynamic binding mean address function call code segment program translated assembly language instead obtained elsewhere
stack variable array lookup etc
At higher level line code If known compile time exactly function call static binding
If foo could mean multiple function depending thing knowable compile time dynamic binding
I understand evident polymorphism
Typically creating multiple class derive base class
If one derived class contains function one us
The base class used execute function derived class properly call correct function
For example print woof meow My interpretation hopefully help

Computer science study computer programming practice making computer thing
Take look offered university interested find whether course CS course programming course something else example Software Engineering even combination
Many course advertised computer science offer significant programming component may put theoretical part course practice may sake learn skill making program
A caveat Science become muddied field modern time least United States university degree programming
This mean people interested programming must sign Computer Science degree reaction Computer Science program emphasize programming
That said Computer Science mathematical science Computational Mathematics might better term
It involves study graph theory algorithmic complexity formal logic automaton general logical structure describe transformation response input algorithm
A Computer Scientist classic sense could reason rule govern computing system including modern computer without necessarily knowing detail implementation current architecture
A strong background Computer Science give ability develop recall efficient scalable algorithm anticipate logical reduction reason soundly tractable
Programming contrast person use transform something machine

When I CS university spent lot time mucking around assembler learning difference compiling linking interpreting etcetera
A lot done programming act writing code compiled run via interpreter intention generating result solve problem
That Programming act solving problem described knowledge Computer Science
It kind Pure Maths Applied Maths split
You need Computer Science degree programmer programmer CS background likely deeper understanding behaviour computer program
I would reword question What difference Computer Science Software Engineering
After involve programming
Computer Science theortical study computation possible
It look thing like Godels Theorem Halting problem
Software engineering write program designed maintanable
theory programming
Programming implementation
scientific practical approach computation application
A computer scientist specializes theory computation design computational system
Its subfields divided variety theoretical practical discipline
Some field computational complexity theory explores fundamental property computational problem highly abstract field computer graphic emphasize visual application
Still field focus challenge implementing computation
For example programming language theory considers various approach description computation whilst study computer programming investigates various aspect use programming language complex system
interaction considers challenge making computer computation useful usable universally accessible human
If programming carpentry computer science
More info carpentry interested thing like order build thing frame subfloor interior wall drywall etc
How build take le time construct modified later
In case architecture part like CS anyway concerned thing like capability material big beam need support span
Similarly CS theoretical capability computer programming practical application knowledge
Computer science programming physic mechanical engineering
Computer science theoretical take scientific mathematical approach information computation
Computer programming practical process designing writing testing debugging maintaining source code computer program
They different related field
Both benefited
A degree computer science lot broader scope cover theory behind computing
A hand focused developing coding programming skill student training different programming language
If confused browse detail program California College San Diego
That may provide clarity regarding scope degree
It study problem solving method
Computer programming It part problem solving process make field computer science
Computer programming small subset computer science
Programming people
People read write maintain code
Computer science implement describe algorithm
Programming development making money
Science discovering new thing

activity determines testing beyond limit normal operation
Stress testing particularly important software used type software
Stress test commonly put greater emphasis robustness heavy load would considered correct behavior normal circumstance
Failures may related Reasons stress testing include specific type metric number branch executed test branch coverage mean every branch program executed least test
Branch coverage one important metric software testing software branch coverage low generally considered thoroughly tested
Note code coverage metric property test piece software software tested
Achieving high branch coverage often involves writing test variation variation software supposed fail way addition usual test variation test intended usage
An example negative variation would calling illegal parameter
There limit branch coverage achieved even negative variation however branch may used handling error beyond control test
For example test would normally control memory allocation branch handle memory error difficult test
Stress testing achieve higher branch coverage producing condition certain error handling branch followed
The coverage improved using
Stress testing try break system test overwhelming resource taking resource away case sometimes called negative testing
The main purpose process make sure system fails recovers quality known recoverability
Load testing implies controlled environment moving low load high
Stress testing focus random event chaos unpredictability
Using web application example way stress might introduced

This action might possible undo
Are sure want continue
Stress Testing available

Stress Testing Software process involve quantitative test done lab measuring frequency error system crash
It also process determining ability computer network program device maintain certain level effectiveness unfavorable condition
This particularly important mission critical software used type software
It refers qualitative evaluation factor availability resistance DoS attack

Breaking always bad thing
With soda can example want rim around opening break anything else
Have ever pull tab break open
Do hate happens
Think two different explanation kind soda failure
For obvious reason want bridge strong hold many different environmental condition
For information Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster online reference good place start In use English system everyone else world including England
us metric system
You certainly seen metric prefix example meter byte second
For interesting exercise magnitude thing try think different measurement prefix would convenient
Here reference When hear word stress usually think
In term material science mechanical engineering stress defined force material divided material area diagram
We talk different type stress depending force applied
For example force tending stretch material diagram left call stress
If force tending squish material diagram right call stress
Strain response material stress
It defined change length material stress divided original length
For material tension material may show incremental increase length
For material compression material may show incremental decrease length
One way demonstrate strain use compressible packing foam beam insulation tube
Draw regular grid foam shown
What happens grid spacing squish stretch bend foam
When bend foam see combination compressive tensile stress opposite side bend
How mechanical engineer describe way material behaves stress
One measurement called defined stress divided strain
It measure much strain produced given amount stress material
Another measure Poisson ratio describes stress applied along one dimension material affect dimension
Here demonstration try
As one example compare tootsie roll jolly rancher
What difference
How respond tensile compressive force
If squish tootsie roll happens
Materials like tootsie roll taffy caramel change shape permanently
They also get lot wider squished shorter narrower stretched longer
How jolly rancher
These brittle deform plastically break fracturing
Other material might try silly putty see recipe making ice cube
Materials scientist mechanical engineer use specialized test equipment like tension test machine diagram measuring material response stress
The test equipment apply large amount force
Both magnitude duration force measured precision
The diagram also show typical response ductile material tension
As might guess type specialized test equipment expensive
There much cheaper method use measure stress strain science fair project
For example see Good question ask These many good reason carefully testing material
Here example type data engineer use evaluating ductile material
The applied stress plotted along measured strain response stress plotted along
The definition help understand diagram
Moments torque stress normally call bending twisting
It still idea stress strain talking unit measurement
The difference axis application stress
You see diagram moment produce compressive tensile stress depending part material examine
You use gridded foam beam tube compressible foam packing material pipe insulation respectively visualize effect moment torque
Draw grid line interval
Materials different property break differently
Think back jolly rancher tootsie roll
Which ductile brittle
Think paper clip
Ductile brittle
You use small stack paper many time spring back original shape
But open paper clip shown deform plastically retains new shape permanently exceeding yield point
How windshield
Metals strong corrode rust
Paint help protect metal water air ingredient corrosion
Repeated loading open close tiny defect eventually defect become crack propagate fracture tear
Under repeated loading structure ultimately fail much lower load originally thought
Take paperclip try unfolding refolding different direction rotating bending
Try cycling different range deflection count number cycle needed break paper clip
Is relationship deflection angle number cycle breakage
Plastics cheap easy shape light pretty strong weight easily soften temperature
Their ratio good steel popular structural material
Steel however quite heavy subject corrosion
Ceramic brittle aluminum ductile
Concrete usually reinforced metal bar inside total structure mixed property
How strong different structure
What advantage different shape
Strength depends How material illustration differ term material property geometry support placement
These product engineered using carbon fiber composite light yet strong
How material property geometry support placement give product strength
For project explore strength geometry see How make thing strong light
It take combination good material right shape
How measure see work best
This gallery image give inspiration making structure strong lightweight
For project apply idea see
The Hong Kong Shanghai Bank building triangle frame around tall rod make sure rod support building buckle
Architects often play geometry designing building
Using simple shape help keep cost weight material keeping building safe supported
The Eiffel Tower achieves large ratio utilizing truss support structure
A construction crane tall tower truss frame designed lift move heavy object
The height structure compared weight good comparison much weight lift
Different material different property
A lot metal like steel strong also heavy
Structural hard plastic strong durable molded shape lightweight
Even simple thing like rope cord exhibit enormous strength weight
They use fact material made strong tension
Carbon fiber another material strong tension
When combine honeycomb shape good compression get strong structure
Both material example hollow titanium carbon fiber frame geometric triangular shape bicycle allow strong low weight
Spider silk amazing property
Many material occurring nature interesting property human able copy
Wood exhibit high ratio due cellular microstructure
The way cell tree grow grain help make wood strong
Even different wood different property
Balsa wood extremely light example formed right shape also extremely strong
This structure made balsa wood super glue weighed gram supported kg breaking
Bamboo another nature resource building material

Assuring likelihood survival fundamental reason stress testing large bank Europe United States mandate called Basel I II III CCAR respectively
Similarly stress testing corporation organization municipality become necessary exercise prevent insolvency time economic uncertainty shortened corporate life expectancy
The concept stress testing entirely new
For example computer software get routinely stress tested order assure survive volume fluctuation data storage requirement hacking attempt
In field engineering stress testing material condition extreme heat cold load around age
In banking sector economy stress testing mean sufficient capital meet current obligation even prevent run neighborhood ATM
So logical extension reasonable practice stress test large firm municipality respect solvency intent preserve public service commercial product job invested capital supplier customer relationship quite possibly preserve whole community
It well established academic business literature insolvency bankruptcy predictable phenomenon vast majority case
However testing condition yet customary business municipality
During manager presumed certain percentage business failure expected constituted risk market entry
More recently Harvard Business Review dedicating entire issue business failure postulating succeeding constitutes learning experience one embrace ashamed
The clear message learn failure try better next time
That acceptable theory tell failing entrepreneur great idea mortgaged house put entire future risk
Failure good thing many type failure predictable importantly preventable
The fiduciary responsibility preventing business insolvency rest primarily director corporate officer individually collectively
States line municipal failure Chapter Bankruptcy Code irrespective whether Chapter applies
States bear large reputational risk future borrowing cost may increase
Corporations municipality solvency quantitative qualitative process showing likelihood fiscal survival probability adverse condition
It address question lead better decision good governance reduces likelihood financial stress
Of Bankruptcy code pertains corporate personal case reorganization restructuring viable option
Is defined financial state person company municipality unable meet obligation due
Usually liability exceed current asset situation
Is plausible future state enterprise town may find usually quite different expected normal operating condition
Of Bankruptcy code pertains municipality applicability varies State
For example apply Commonwealth Puerto Rico creating challenging legal issue financial crisis
Of Bankruptcy code pertains corporate case individual insolvency restructuring unlikely success liquidation option
A successful legal procedure declaration seeking protection creditor
All bankrupt debtor fact insolvent

Senior Editor PCs reliable ever mean infallible
Equipment failure still happen however rarely even beefiest computer component worth weight silicon dependable
Thankfully hot heavy world stress testing help identify critical fault PC crap middle critical operation
Whenever buy build PC swap major component overclock piece hardware good idea burn fresh gear
Why
Simple To ensure reliability stability system
Even computer boot performs well normal usage fickle hardware cause woe step heftier task gaming video editing
software place component intense workload simulate scenario component crash hang otherwise fails dedicated stress test good chance wo reliable heavy everyday load
It best uncover unstable component sooner rather later still warranty
Running stress test also let know need additional cooling computer
If graphic card overclocked CPU consistently overheats shuts stress test time dump stock cooler add case fan
All said actual process stress testing terribly complicated though
Ladies gentleman time start engine
Actually
Before start torturing PC going need way keep tab screaming
exactly providing glimpse component temperature voltage fan speed
though interface quite polished HWMonitor
You want least one two program open stress test
While many component automatically shut overheat want pull plug testing hardware hit dangerous heat level
You fry component scenario occurs paying attention
If see CPU temperature starting creep north degree Celsius graphic card temperature around C homework
stop test add cooling computer
You also want halt testing temperature continuously hover around mark extended period time
Before start testing I recommend closing nonessential program diving system Power setting prevent going sleep
You want computer doze busy burning
If use screensaver disable
If single component CPU
It frequently culprit behind unstable system
While handful program available stress CPU limit become standard
Ostensibly designed find software absolutely hammer processor point developer include dedicated Torture Test mode people interested system stability complex mathematics
Open program head bring list option
Many people use test
Blend stress CPU RAM error pop four hour consider stable normal use
Alternatively torture test lay RAM bit subject CPU much respective stress heat possible
If time adequate cooling feel free torture PC much much longer particularly plan use computer folding project consume ton CPU resource extended period
sometimes catch CPU error even half day testing
If rig run Small FFT test full hour without issue CPU solid rock ready fold
Want second opinion
Different program test CPUs different way
type also hold high regard
Both hit processor ramp temperature rapidly however keep close eye software first start
No matter testing program choose run least four hour full overnight run preferable
Personally I like new PCs using Blend Small FFT test least twelve hour apiece I sometimes follow stress level IntelBurnTest run
Overkill
Maybe
But CPU survives definitely keeper
When come seriously testing RAM one option worth considering
This diagnostic software around seemingly forever definitely look rock ugly program effective always
Simply burn flash drive CD insert PC boot computer medium type using
Once running let software thing long overnight
The goal error
If run error retest RAM module individually identify problem child
If gamer stress testing graphic card especially since graphic card tend fail heavier know like one generated game
Another bonus Graphic torture test usually coax underpowered faulty power supply giving ghost stressing two bird one stone
Yay efficiency
Benchmarking tool abound designed specifically give GPU workout punishes graphic card harder average game
This bad boy us rendering furry object undulating front groovy background push graphic card limit complete antialiasing resolution option
Stick standard test keep eye HWMonitor get GPU hot quickly
You wo need run FurMark long
If graphic card going crash start tossing funky visual artifact within minute
Alternatively maker popular Heaven graphic released new GPU tool lot prettier Furmark
I chance use extensively however
Once GPU pass primary stress test I like run benchmark derived actual game see graphic card hold usage
My favorite software benchmarking tool freely available
The CPU GPU RAM major system component really need worry
Should benchmark storage drive make sure delivering promised data transfer rate
performance issue stability reliability issue
I recommend usual Make sure data backed
axiom aside
Likewise loop long video display brightness high worried battery life laptop far necessary benchmark test stress test
While guide help ensure stability system method tool outlined far option
In fact plethora different strategy software solution exist wild

A computer science education sure ticket job today tech economy right
Hardly say one startup CEO lambasts school failing teach practical computer skill suggesting developer skip degree path first place
In weekend Daniel Gelernter explains hire CS graduate work app company
Here gist argument emphasis mine The thing I look developer degree computer science
Computer science department prepare student academic research career spurn job actually pay money

Harvard one make good developer one term
So college graduate coding skill tech startup need likely learned problem set
As one developer told The people good school part computer good My experience hiring show exactly
But
I one developer degree electrical engineering learn development skill college I ask
No
Taking shot computer science hardly new course
I recall college experience decade ago friend physic math department sneered intellectual confines subject meanwhile others told serious tech occurred electrical engineering department
I say sure friend right background law liberal art I add Gelernter comment jibe experience tech reporter
In course talking hundred startup founder developer year I recall meeting many computer science I certainly met successful dropout
Interestingly Gelernter also skeptical coding school bootcamps sprouting
He say program typically last around week cost thousand dollar unlikely land student plum job Facebook
The simple reason argues enroll coding bootcamp unlikely natural chop good developer first place want job
He prefers people innate passion talent coding first place
So mean one get CS degree attend boot camp
Not necessarily
There plenty good job computer field employer looking credential even position lack cachet Pinterest engineer Silicon Valley app It also worth noting Gelernter proposed path limit renegade coder ideal fine certain cultural young wealthy unattached practical option people
More seriously Gelernter dismissive view academic approach computer science risk glorifying minor technical talent expense understanding computer relation science humanity

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field
Professor chair Mathematics Computer Science Director Master Science Information Security Lewis University
You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

Published As everything ever wanted know tech internship plus bloviating experience
The I CS senior University Pennsylvania
I interned Facebook Summer I worked application privacy generalist Summer new startup serial enterpreneur Flickr Hunch
Both internship great invaluable
They also different term type work I I gained experience
Luckily number great post written subject already
To I add Before applying consider Am I excited product company make
Would I excited know I work
It much easier get motivated show excitement company excited
I Dropbox user I neglect mention I applied
It helped
I think
I strongly advice looking internship big tech company startup rather company esp
financial company happens engineer
The explanation little long I assume nod along hummingly
For inquisitive
You want work learn going successful Venture Capital industry know always easy pick winner
There however hint pick prioritize thinking work In short working top technical people teach software engineering right IE turning ugly code homework assignment going filed away forever
That mean different thing earlier later stage company though I relate experience
First foremost I learned write code
My first commit line rejected time I finally put right amount spacing fixed trailing whitespace
These important brilliant engineer politely telling intern time time something found coding guideline doc
I little bit embarrased show lot code result improvement least significant
In general experience taught Code Culture
The fact top FB engineer willing spend much time code review fantastic way Facebook commitment good code
I ca say I able pay overhead code review every project team I worked since background working quality matter team infused way I think programming today
I also learned engineer immune politics even great company
I playing around hackathon improvement one sharing feature engineer understood code would reply email week claimed busy I walked desk
My original pitch feature I wanted work You know suck Facebook
X
We fix
In retrospect I nearly good enough job trying get person board show respect work already done
I joined team several week engineering work begun
It humbling see ease would put together component decide several day later better way something throw away
When know code good chance thrown away priority becomes writing quickly way cleaned later different writing sloppily writing code
I also got lot training breadth required fluent Javascript Coffeescript Ruby Rails
It early life company specialize meant lot time Google StackOverflow learning ton thing I went
I became much comfortable forking Github project thing sort I wanted
That
That I got
Mostly
Comment question
Some valid point brought via post
I see still
Alright
I spent summer freshman year sort odd thing playing lot Settler Catan online working recruiting father travelling around France
It mixed bag unstructured way retrospect I found le ideal
There nothing say working three summer strictly necessary two internship type I recommend best option though I happen think
Here option either third internship alternative first two something ranked order

In general situation bit mess
But studying US visa like I I learned More Theme based

The origin term software engineering attributed different source
The term software engineering used August issue Communications ACM Volume number letter ACM membership ACM President Anthony Oettinger
More commonly traced title seminal NATO conference Professor
Bauer first conference software engineering
The conference attended international expert software agreed defining best practice software grounded application engineering
The result conference report defines software developed
The original report publicly available
The field also give credit many work development spread
The discipline software engineering created address poor quality software get project exceeding time budget control ensure software built systematically rigorously measurably time budget within specification
Engineering already address issue hence principle used engineering applied software
The widespread lack best practice software time perceived
documented several key advance field book Engineering Economics
These include Constructive Cost Model relates software development effort program T SLOC
The book analyzes software project concludes cost fixing error escalates project move toward field use
The book also asserts key driver software cost capability software development team
In SEI established federally funded research development center headquartered campus Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh Pennsylvania United States
founded SEI Software Process Program aimed understanding managing software engineering process
His book Managing Software Process asserts Software Development Process controlled measured improved
The Process Maturity Levels introduced would become Capability Maturity Model Integration Development defined US Government evaluates ability software development team
Modern generally accepted software engineering collected subcommittee published SWEBOK
Software engineering divided
Some Knowledge prerequisite becoming software engineer
In produced published Technical Report describing body knowledge recommend mastered graduate software engineer four year experience
Many software engineer enter profession obtaining university degree training vocational school
One standard international curriculum undergraduate software engineering degree defined updated
A number university Software Engineering degree program Campus program Online program program program program United States
In addition university education many company sponsor internship student wishing pursue career information technology
These internship introduce student interesting task typical software engineer encounter every day
Similar experience gained software engineering
Legal requirement licensing certification professional software engineer vary around world
In UK licensing legal requirement assume use job title Software Engineer
In area Canada Alberta British Columbia Ontario Quebec software engineer hold Professional Engineer designation Information Systems Professional
designation
In Canada legal requirement one want use title engineer practice software engineering
In Europe Software Engineers obtain EUR ING professional title
The United States since offered exam Software Engineering thereby allowing Software Engineers licensed recognized
Mandatory licensing currently still largely debated perceived controversial
In part US Texas use term regulated law reserved use individual license
The two main professional organization software engineering publish guide profession software engineering
The IEEE defines field describes knowledge IEEE expects practicing software engineer
The current SWEBOK updated version released
The IEEE also promulgates Software Engineering Code Ethics
In November counted software engineer holding job time period million practitioner employed engineering discipline combined
Due relative newness field study formal education software engineering often taught part computer science curriculum many software engineer hold computer science degree engineering background whatsoever
Many software engineer work employee contractor
Software engineer work business government agency civilian military organization
Some software engineer work
Some organization specialist perform task
Other organization require software engineer many
In large project people may specialize one role
In small project people may fill several role time
Specializations include industry academia
Most software engineer programmer work hour week percent software engineer percent programmer worked hour week
Injuries occupation rare
However like worker spend long period front computer terminal typing keyboard engineer programmer susceptible eyestrain back discomfort hand wrist problem
The field future look bright according rated Software Engineer best job United States
In software engineering ranked best job United States time
The offer certification specific topic like process improvement
company also sponsor certification examination
Many program oriented toward specific technology managed vendor technology
These certification program tailored institution would employ people use technology
Broader certification general software engineering skill available various professional society
As certified software professional CSDP
In added certification known Certified Software Development Associate CSDA
The professional certification program early discontinued due lack interest
The ACM examined possibility professional certification software engineer late eventually decided certification inappropriate professional industrial practice software engineering
In developed legally recognized professional certification called available fully qualified member
Software engineer may eligible membership qualify Chartered Engineer status
In Canada developed legally recognized professional certification called
In Ontario Canada Software Engineers graduate accredited program successfully complete PEO Professional Practice Examination PPE least month acceptable engineering experience eligible licensed become Professional Engineers
The PEO recognize online distance education however consider Computer Science program equivalent software engineering program despite tremendous overlap two
This sparked controversy certification war
It also held number holder profession exceptionally low
The vast majority working professional field hold degree CS SE
Given difficult certification path holder degree never bother pursue license
The initial impact outsourcing relatively lower cost international human resource developing third world country led massive migration software development activity corporation North America Europe India later China Russia developing country
This approach flaw mainly distance timezone difference prevented human interaction client developer massive job transfer
This negative impact many aspect software engineering profession
For example student avoid education related software engineering fear importing software product service country displaced
Although statistic currently show threat software engineering related career appear affected
Nevertheless ability smartly leverage offshore resource via workflow improved overall operational capability many organization

How much leader mood affect climate team
GettyImages AlexSava Find feature make customer rejoice
Imagine scene innovation team excited next year product upgrade
The idea flowing people come lot new feature firm product
But project leader doubt
The cost extra feature considerable tough deliver finished product budget time
This tool like Kano Model useful
It simple versatile technique deciding feature product service
In article look origin detail Kano Model explore guide using help develop product service delight customer without bankrupting business
The product development customer satisfaction published Dr Noriaki Kano professor quality management Tokyo University Science
Kano say product service much functionality
It also customer emotion
For example customer buy new car expect stop hit brake many delighted system
The model encourages think product relate customer need moving always better approach le approach
Constantly introducing new feature product expensive may add complexity without boosting customer satisfaction
On hand adding one particularly attractive feature could delight customer increase sale without costing significantly
The model assigns three type attribute property product service
These basic feature customer expect product service
For example book hotel expect hot water bed clean linen absolute minimum

These element absolutely necessary increase customer enjoyment product service
Returning example pleased discover hotel room free superfast broadband HD TV normally expect find standard TV

These surprise element really boost product
They feature customer even know want delighted find
In hotel room might finding complimentary Belgian chocolate evening service left bed
Figure illustrates presence absence three attribute product service affect

You see product feature meet customer Threshold Attributes satisfaction level low
However even fully deliver wo impress customer much
Most product compete Performance Attributes customer weighs one product another judge satisfaction availability various feature
But may discover Excitement Attribute really appeal give high satisfaction even perfectly implemented
Figure show customer reaction certain feature lack also negative zero effect satisfaction level
In bottom right quadrant see product Threshold Attributes even number may even lead indifferent level customer satisfaction
Customers begin find product attractive offer Performance Attributes along line top right quadrant organization position product market
Excitement Attributes wow factor feature give
These feature represent good need many generate high level customer satisfaction

I first admit I still case tape
For young know tape please ask parent
As customer purchased lot music need simple
I wanted clearer sound something smaller store
The music industry responded introduced cassette
The cassette indeed smaller
It fade back annoying click tape used
I pleased cassette collection
Then suddenly music industry introduced something called CD compact disc
The CD offered better clarity storage capacity ability jump specific song shuffle order play
Best one never rewind
The point simple
As customer need changed
In move CDs I realize need changed music industry research keeping competition advance technology delighted new product offering
Even today CDs dust covered I utilize iPod new advance music technology made address music customer need
How company analyze customer need
How easily determine delight customer basic need
One powerful technique address question developed Professor Noriaki Kano Tokyo Rika University colleague
This Kano theory For customer requirement customer satisfaction proportional extent product service fully functional
The Kano model address three type requirement Expected feature characteristic product service legible form correctly spelled name basic functionality
These need typically If need fulfilled customer extremely dissatisfied
An example unspoken need staying hotel cleanliness
This includes clean bathroom clean linen pleasant fresh aroma air
When person book reservation hotel request clean room
They expect
If basic need met extremely dissatisfied
Standard characteristic increase decrease satisfaction degree ease use speed
These need typically Using hotel example spoken need could Internet access room away elevator room corporate rate etc
Unexpected feature characteristic impress customer earn company extra These need also typically Think Doubletree Hotels
Those stay delighted freshly baked chocolate chip cookie delivered room service
Figure The Kano Model Illustrated The horizontal axis figure indicates fully functional
The vertical axis indicates satisfied customer
The line going origin degree represents situation customer satisfaction directly proportional fully functional
In word represents situation customer satisfied fully functional le satisfied le functional
Kano term requirement requirement
A percent improvement functionality result percent improvement customer satisfaction
For example faster response time system mile per gallon vehicle customer like
Figure The Extended Kano Model Illustrated Figure How Requirements Can Be Identified Here Kano Analysis summary Needs change
For example Doubletree Hotel example freshly baked chocolate chip cookie Many people becoming health conscious
Perhaps confectionary item longer top delighter
Also consider comment need Internet access hotel room satisfier
While wireless Internet access could considered delighter quickly becoming basic need convenience
The important point keep mind delighted customer past expected expected today meet minimum customer expectation future
The author well captured market dynamic Kano model extended model
Very good work I really like Time element paper discus
I suppose could call getting spoiled
This exactly I needed hear
Putting work next task
Developing right analysis format sandwich shop I studying
Thanks
Thanks article
I referred many article per Kano Model meeting requirement understand concept
This article made WOW providing additional unexpected input Figure
Thanks
Two point First It case customer need changing much delighted got asked
Wouldn delighted got two scoop ice cream paid one
Its human nature want even I know I want
Just give tell I delighted disappointed
LOL Second I would submit much consumer product feature delight consumer developed invented scientific research lab initially directed towards military noncommerical application
Only year later made available consumer product application
Yes I would beyond delighted I could teleport vacation destination instead using delightful airline flight
But delightful feature unlikely lifetime even scientist figure guess would get first dibs
My two cent worth

The Kano Model may also referred Kano Model Analysis Kano Model Survey people called multiple different name
This website created Kano model enthusiast wanted create quick simple way explain Kano Model client
After success decision made make information open public minimal cost
Professor Noriaki Kano created Kano Model studying contributing factor customer satisfaction customer loyalty
The professor classified unique category customer requirement want end offering taken
The Kano Model main objective help team understand classify integrate main category requirement product service developing
The category customer requirement classified depending ability create customer satisfaction cause dissatisfaction
Knowing category customer requirement fall importance requirement help prioritize development activity determine include offering spend resource improving requirement
The model describes category set axis
The degree satisfaction requirement level fulfillment execution requirement company
All category requirement mapped axis Simply stated requirement customer able articulate top mind evaluating option
They visible model requirement better performed satisfaction bring conversely worse performed dissatisfaction bring
The Professor originally called better execute satisfaction customer get
Simply stated requirement customer expect taken granted
When done well customer neutral done poorly customer dissatisfied
Kano originally called requirement must included price entry market
Simply stated requirement unexpected pleasant surprise delight
These innovation bring offering
They delight customer cause dissatisfaction missing customer never expected first place
Kano originally called Attractive Delighters exactly
Simply stated requirement customer simply care present absent satisfaction remains neutral either circumstance
Simply stated requirement cause dissatisfaction present satisfaction absent
These rare happen occasionally
Kano also designed special survey known today Kano Model Survey
It designed used categorize requirement
In survey formulate two strategic question functional dysfunctional representation requirement
Depending respondent answer question result aggregated compiled graph clearly show category fall
Using information along voice customer data development team find gap offering potential hole customer research
Understanding list requirement fit Model also help development team determine requirement feature include need enhancement need cost reduction excluded simply leave alone

A Kano Model based Computer System Respondents determination Customer Needs Analysis Product development Aspects available

The theory product development developed Professor classifies customer preference five category
These category translated English using various name delighters satisfier dissatisfiers etc
refer original article written Kano
One main point assessment Kano model threshold attribute
These basically feature product must order meet customer demand
If attribute overlooked product simply incomplete
If new product examined using threshold aspect may possible enter market
This first important characteristic Kano model
The product manufactured type consumer base therefore must crucial part product innovation
Threshold attribute simple component product
However available product soon leave market due dissatisfaction
The attribute either
An example threshold attribute would steering wheel car
The car good able steered
The threshold attribute often seen price entry
Many product threshold attribute overlooked
Since component product necessary guideline many consumer judge advanced particular feature
Therefore many time company want improve attribute consumer remain neutral change threshold section
A performance attribute defined skill knowledge ability behavioral characteristic associated
Performance attribute metric company base business aspiration
They explicit purpose
Companies prioritize investment decision effort explain strategy using performance attribute
These strategy sometimes recognized company slogan
For example slogan The Pursuit Perfection Quality Always low price
Always Cost
In retail focus generally assuring availability product best cost
Performance attribute better better performance attribute improve customer satisfaction
Conversely weak performance attribute reduces customer satisfaction
When customer discus need need fall performance attribute category
Then attribute form weighted need product concept evaluated
The price customer willing pay product closely tied performance attribute
So higher performance attribute higher customer willing pay product
Performance attribute also often require analysis cost
As customer start rate attribute important company ask much extra would willing pay attribute
And increase price product attribute deter customer purchasing
Prioritization matrix useful determining attribute would provide greatest return customer satisfaction
Not Kano model feature performance attribute additionally incorporates excitement attribute well
Excitement attribute part unforeseen client may yield paramount satisfaction
Having excitement attribute help scenario okay included
The beauty behind excitement attribute spur potential consumer imagination attribute used help customer discover need never thought
The key behind Kano model engineer discover unknown need enlighten consumer sort engage awe effect
Having concurrent excitement attribute within product provide significant competitive advantage rival
In diverse product assortment excitement attribute act WOW factor trigger impulsive want need mind customer
The customer think amazing new idea want
Out attribute introduced Kano model excitement one powerful potential lead highest gross profit margin
Innovation undisputedly catalyst delivering attribute customer need able distinguish excitement today tomorrow becomes known feature day used throughout whole world
An attribute drift time Exciting performance essential
The drift driven customer expectation level performance competing product
For example mobile phone battery originally large bulky hour charge
Over time come expect hour battery life slim lightweight phone
The battery attribute change keep customer expectation
QFD make use Kano model term structuring matrix
Mixing Kano type QFD matrix lead distortion customer weighting product characteristic
For instance mixing product cost reliability workmanship safety technology used initial usually result completely filled row column high correlation value
Other Comprehensive QFD technique using additional matrix used avoid issue
Kano model provides insight dynamic customer preference understand methodology dynamic
The Kano model offer insight product attribute important customer
The purpose tool support product specification discussion better development team understanding
Kano model focus differentiating product feature opposed focusing initially customer need
Kano also produced methodology mapping consumer response questionnaire onto model

contribution team internal stakeholder customer prospect anyone say product yes even
like everyone demanding

You may good either certain present rest organization

There many different reason might need include given feature order know one make future customer happy prefer others
Creating product satisfy customer common topic UX Design Product Management circle
This natural end goal job
These question easy answer thankfully useful tool guide u
I gone every online resource I could find including scientific research create guide Kano Model
This extensive read
You also get guide Product Management resource
Japanese researcher consultant published paper set idea technique help u determine customer prospect satisfaction product feature
These idea commonly called based upon following premise Let go
It start goal
Kano proposes dimension go total satisfaction also called total dissatisfaction
In image dimension annotated different satisfaction level
It important note always linear scale see second
You might think always want top scale right
Well possible
That come
Also called represents much given feature customer get well implemented much invested development
This dimension go functionality best possible implementation
That term also good concept
It clear reminding u cost something
Naming aside really important know see next section
Kano classifies feature four category depending customer react provided level Functionality
Some product feature behave might intuitively think Satisfaction work provide satisfied customer become
Because proportional relation Functionality Satisfaction feature usually called attribute Kano literature I prefer
When buying car gas mileage usually Performance attribute
Other example might internet connection speed laptop battery life storage space Dropbox account
The greater satisfaction
Going back graphic representation model see dynamic customer reaction kind feature
Every increase functionality lead increased satisfaction
It also important keep mind functionality add bigger investment make
team build required resource etc
Other product feature simply customer
If product considered incomplete plain bad
This type feature usually called Basic Expectations Here deal feature need make customer satisfied

We expect phone able make call
Our hotel room running water bed
The car brake
Having make u happy lacking definitely make u angry towards product service
Notice satisfaction curve behaves
Even slightest bit investment go long way increasing satisfaction
But also notice satisfaction never even reach positive side dimension
No matter invest feature ever make customer satisfied product
The good news basic level expectation reached keep investing
There unexpected feature presented cause positive reaction
These usually called
I tend prefer term conveys notion talking scale
We reaction ranging mild attractiveness absolute delight still everything fit Attractive name
The first time used iPhone expecting fluid touchscreen interface
Think first time used Google Maps Google Docs
You know feeling get experiencing something beyond know expect similar product
Just remember brain something fall category
It might anything make go This best explained graphically
Look even level Functionality lead increased Satisfaction quickly rise
This fact key keep check investment make given feature
Beyond certain point
Naturally also feature towards feel
Those presence absence make real difference reaction product
These feature fall along middle Satisfaction dimension horizontal axis intersects
That mean matter much effort put user really care
This another way saying really
Now complete picture Kano category feature important take note fundamental fact static change time
What customer feel product attribute feel future
Attractive feature turn Performance feature time go
Consider iPhone example sort fluid touchscreen interaction wowed u basic expectation
Go back every memory amazement experienced past product
How would feel product presented
When enough time passed likely consider feature Performance attribute
This disenchantment due many different factor including technological evolution emergence competitor vying bring functionality first mover
The takeaway analysis given point time reflecting moment reality
The farther get point le relevant seem

We covered first two part Kano model interplay define
In order uncover customer perception towards product attribute need use
It consists pair question feature want evaluate The first question called form second one form also called
These question though
There specific option use
To feel feature possible answer There thing consider wording option get later
After asking customer prospect two question getting answer able categorize feature
One great thing Kano model account functionality
This show extent something actually wanted needed indifferent customer
We evaluation table combine functional dysfunctional answer row column respectively get one previously described category
Each answer pair lead one category couple come using question format
Given fact asking side thing able tell These actual Kano category mere artifact questionnaire useful nevertheless
If someone say dislike functional version like dysfunctional version person clearly interested offering perhaps actually want opposite
This new category called
If majority customer telling feature switch Functional Dysfunctional question score answer asked question order
When get conflicting response Like Like question answer
For reason Fred Pouliot suggested cell standard Kano evaluation table changed also Questionable
Some expected result get majority user Questionable answer probably something wrong asking
From using Pouliot slightly revised table classify answer
We try internalize category derived pair response better understand model avoid needing reference table every time
We already covered answer contradictory response pair form diagonal evaluation table except middle cell
feature straightforward position
They one customer
This extreme reaction translates linear better relation two dimension
feature remaining case customer
Customers go tolerating expecting feature
feature found customer
This another way saying proposing new attractive
We feature
These occur I neutral I tolerate answer either Functional Dysfunctional question
That occupy middle cell table discounting previously described category
Finally answer positioned along two reaction either
You see category reversal flipping Functional Dysfunctional value
You know Reverse Performance Attractive feature
Now basic understanding Kano model work time go mean use multiple user feature
Our goal Product Managers UX Designers determine feature lead satisfied customer use information help u prioritize need build
There important detail consider order get
This section based upon multiple account Kano model usage practitioner researcher shared experience lesson learned step process The first thing consider scope analysis term feature user
The feature choose
Your backlog may contain number different kind item may need include technical debt something sale marketing team reporting system design refresh
All scope Kano analysis
We measuring customer satisfaction among externally feature product way
If need data support something internal stakeholder asking disservice team customer use Kano study
Also include survey specially study volunteer participant
This improve participation level subject available attention
When selecting customer prospect participate study must consider demographic logical cohort persona belong
Otherwise data likely map
Your base probably homogenous think feature either
But take account grouping belong significantly reduce noise analysis
Jan Moorman detected importance presenting feature new product group potential user
A core feature product already present supposedly well known competition product
Nevertheless subset user still considered Attractive another considered
She came conclusion distinct reaction due
When segmented response profile result feature much clearer
There plenty possible segmentation must choose make sense product
Suppose working SaaS
If considering adding feature let user associate invoice purchase order attractiveness small business different enterprise customer
You keep point mind either selecting user study know feature target afterwards analyzing survey result
The questionnaire present input method Kano study
Thus ensure step effective possibly make
It critical make question clear succinct possible

If feature complex requires multiple step probably break question
Your question term product able
For instance automatically improve photo look feel better feel
Be careful polar wording question pair
That one
Here example video editing app considering optimizing exporting speed Whenever possible something even better writing clear question actually show functionality customer ask feel
We describe feature benefit show prototype interactive wireframes mockups place textual question
By visual dynamic explanation user even clearer understanding proposed
If presenting question form ask standard response right user interacting feature prototype
Just textual descriptive question
This keep memory fresh without confusing feature may presenting survey
Some people feel confused ordering standard answer Kano questionnaire
Usually understand I like way appears It must way seems much softer statement
The logic presenting answer way fall along scale pleasure avoidance displeasure
Here alternative wording proposal suggested Or one Robert Blauth team I actually think list option introduced start guide best balance clarity brevity
The takeaway need mindful option interpreted
Selecting set answer best fit case explaining participant wording option beforehand give much better result
One important addition Kano methodology suggested multiple team include another question pair
This question asks customer important given feature
Having piece information useful distinguish feature among know relevant customer
It give tool separate big feature small one impact customer decision product
The importance question may asked following format How important would requirement
For example How important would exporting video always take le second
Responses form scale going Not important Extremely important
If possible presenting customer
If internal confusion certainly talking people outside
We get step motivated study
After tabulating processing result able categorize feature get insight best way prioritize
There two level analysis go
These term something I came due lack standard better one method
Both reference mathematical concept relate map participant response Kano category
Each approach useful depending type insight looking
The simplest way work Kano result You end table like one If seeing multiple result without clear category may hidden customer profile considering
In case probably go back customer response look pattern try checking customer answer usually customer find demographic cluster may missing
From result table rank feature according importance
After general rule thumb use prioritizing go feature add much Performance one finally include Attractive one
This type analysis great give first level understanding useful many context need rigorous approach testing design idea making rough draft roadmap
Although discrete analysis great get u started give u overall sense result several issue
Namely Bill DuMouchel proposed excellent continuous analysis methodology explained next section
Don worry calculation though
For focus understanding step
First answer option translated numerical value within scale going
The bigger number answer reflects much customer want feature
Importance also scored
You may thinking Dysfunctional scale seems backwards
It
Higher positive score mean larger
In case Dysfunctional answer Disliking something mean strong disagreement feature absence
Thus would satisfaction potential included bigger score
starting instead category get
Thus DuMouchel decided emphasize side scale
These score lead categorization feature within plane
With method
Our
Outside find weaker answer well Questionable Reverse categorization
If feature end Reverse always use trick defining opposite switching Functional Dysfunctional score get classified another Kano category also drop study
If dig around Kano resource probably find reference
With DuMouchel methodology describing better alternative
But given often referenced least warrant brief introduction
Mike Timko proposed using Better Worse score reflected numerical term customer satisfaction dissatisfaction would change feature
Although call Satisfaction Dissatisfaction Coefficients original paper commonly known name
By considering total number answer category given feature calculated using formula Although produce numerical result useful relative comparison coefficient multiple issue Timko referred article
The main thing suffers problem discrete analysis number come using single Kano category answer
This loss information lead higher variance data equal weighting answer independently strong weak
The Functional Dysfunctional score calculating DuMuchel method serve purpose without issue focusing
If number possible answer mean work average
Here need calculate feature Taking feature Functional Dysfunctional score place categorization plane like We course talking average hide possibly large variation data
That useful add standard deviation graphic form error bar notion target categorization
Something like The final layer add Importance score
We visualize additional dimension converting scatter plot dot bubble size proportional importance
In way easily compare among feature similar positioning
The general prioritization rule thumb presented discrete analysis section still hold Performance Attractive Indifferent
This translates well graphical term For small feature set another probably better way visualize stack ranked list
It us three column rank feature order higher lower score potential dissatisfaction potential satisfaction importance
In case first two column Dysfunctional Functional score respectively
Here look Notice last two row
What would situation
You feature Indifferent actually quite near larger impact dissatisfaction another
The one would greatly increase satisfaction deemed really important customer
There case made prioritizing one
As see following ranking order solve every dilemma u still need make tough call experiment measure iterate necessary
That
You made far learned every important aspect Kano model

I realize immediately clear take knowledge make work
But
Even
In section go
Let go back step process introduced second section guide
You probably working new feature idea next product release
If follow along anyways even though might apply right
Out working Which demographic feature targeting

If using easy select subset customer within target
There two part step There two type question present survey
If work Software product probably wireframes mockups idea feature specification
If already best possible question present respondent
What need already
Using tool like link wireframes together interactive
This make feature come alive user help overcome problem question wording
If available wireframes mockups still use traditional question
You however extra careful creating question clear effective
Go back section need refresh topic
Now course need create survey capture response
There thing consider You create email field using URL parameter
If send user something like get identified response without input email address identifier may need end
After gathering enough response proceed analysis step
Along guide also get Excel spreadsheet jumpstart analysis
It following You need copy paste survey result spreadsheet add detail data feature user
You get suggested prioritization time
From easily play data make pivot table start drilling detail
There silver bullet come prioritizing product feature
Although consider many different dimension customer satisfaction probably important one
This led u question started These question definitive answer ever need look another job
What guide hopefully given another tool add arsenal making product Kano model

It clear average importance ranking frequency response category
Could clarify
The importance averaged respondent question
It independent data point go along overall category
If quantitative analysis think another coordinate
X Y value Z Importance
When discussing limit analysis suggest limitation Softer answer get weight harder one
Just think Attractive dysfunctional expect v live This clear
Could provide concrete example please
By stronger softer I mean sentiment
So someone think benefit attractive dysfunctional answer clue u attractive really
If say attractive benefit mean le valuable said
The latter response thus stronger

Thanks
Could explain feature category placement M P A I etc different using Discrete v Continuous analysis
In Discrete Each feature category frequent response mode In Continuous I quite grasp category end different
In example spreadsheet seen Results tab Feature Feature row row respectively
Both different category placement discrete v continuous analysis I quite figure occurring
edit Is simply mode v average scenario
Thanks advance
Hi Joshua Good question
In continuous scenario looking user response figuring category correspond
There notion intensity different response combination might map category indicate stronger weaker positioning within category
When average multiple user final categorization drift another depending response dataset
Hope help Hi I find article much informative quite interesting
I query Bill DuMouchel model explained
The score positive obvious reason
However I think instead average Mode shall taken getting max
positive score since scale still ordinal continuous
Please Hi I find nice book complete guide kano model
tell book published
thanks I really appreciate answer Great primer Kano Model use Kano analysis survey design
Hi
After analysed result feature working first
The feature came must delightful
It balance must calibrate depending objective
It usually ensuring performance finally delighters
Try establishing proportion beforehand like
Pingback Pingback Pingback In example well data I seeing negative value dysfunctional x functional
Yet example graph show value negative
I able get head around

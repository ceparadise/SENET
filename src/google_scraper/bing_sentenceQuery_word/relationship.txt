A relationship context database situation exists two relational database table one table foreign key reference primary key table
Relationships allow relational database split store data different table linking disparate data item
For example bank database table store customer data primary key column named also store customer data table hold information various bank account associated customer
To link two table determine customer bank account information corresponding column must inserted table referencing existing customer IDs table
In case table column foreign key reference column name table
This example relationship two table
The fundamental feature differentiates relational database database type ability define relationship

If two set A B refer Cartesian Product A x B
This mean A B b c A x B
It set pair value first A second B
A relation A B subset A x B
A relation said connect value together way showing relationship
As example let take two set
A B
Because two set say relation A
Now consider relation described greater
We start looking A x B
Now relation R subset
One way work relation look value turn
So look first value
The first value second value relation greater
This true part relation
The true say greater say greater
But get see yes greater value relation
In end find relation subset A x B
We show digraph follows say b related R arrow going b
If related b relation R also say aRb
So case
There number different property relation
Let R subset A x R said reflexive true every possible value A true aRa
This mean everything map onto
On digraph shown fact every node loop attached point back
An example relation type could height Everything height still height thing
The key feature though aRa always true
R said transitive true every possible value b c A aRb true bRc true must case aRc true
An example kind relation smaller
If object smaller b object b smaller c obviously object must smaller object This hard spot digraph basically whenever arrow b arrow b c also arrow R said symmetric relation work backwards
For example two node relation b true aRb relation symmetric must also true bRa
height good example symmetric relation If height b obviously b height true object
On digraph shown fact wherever arrow two node another one going opposite direction
R said antisymmetric true b A aRb bRa must equal ie
relation work reverse two node
An equivalence relation relation reflexive symmetric transitive
To show look three feature show The idea equivalence relation aRb b sense
This usually divide set A seperate part
The idea part contains element equivalent b part aRb
So let assume A set natural number R relation state b equal mod
true true etc
true true etc
The digraph look like So see continued would partition odd number even number
The odd number equivalent relation even number equivalent relation
We say divided two class
We talk class set node equivalent
So case set set
This way see set natural number N consists element partition exactly
N
Similarly say conjunction always equal empty set value also appear
In fact equivalence relation following true A partition set subset make set
For example set partition make set There number operation possible relation set
Let relation A The union described set theory every pair thing either
For example family take union relation mother father get relation parent
The intersection described set theory every pair thing
For example intersection relation mother father empty nobody mother father child
The complement described R basically set pair A x A
For example inverse parent parent The inverse described R every pair backwards
For example relation true R
For example inverse parent child
If consider two relation parent mother define another relation grandmother combining finding value mother b b parent Then grandmother In general two relation A B B C relational composition described relation A C b B
For relation R property P say relation S P closure R S property P R another relation property P R subset R S subset R well
For example let assume P property transitivity
The P closure R transitive closure When P reflexivity known reflexive closure P symmetry known symmetric closure
The P closure constructed adding R minimum number pair b make new relation property For example let u consider relation consisting
The reflexive closure relation consisting
All added minimum pair required make reflexive
All rest left alone
The transitive closure harder find
But consider pair pair turn see way get straight
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
Not needed
equal
needed
needed already
And
The transitive closure relation
The symmetric closure much easier minimum pair ensure every pair work backwards
In case
We added
Another common type relation set relation share property le equal
Such relation called order relation
The simplest kind order relation called partial order follows A partial order relation R reflexive antisymmetric transitive
A partially ordered set poset additional property
Namely integer x either x le equal le equal x
We say two integer comparable relationship le equal
A partial order relation two element comparable called total order
Given ordering set define maximal minimal element
An element poset A partial order said least element element
An element poset A partial order said greatest element element
A minimal element partial order set A element b b
A maximal element partial order set A element b b
In basic term minimal element one another element smaller maximal element element another element bigger
That say minimal element smallest maximal element biggest two element may comparable partial order
A partial order lot minimal maximal element
In general poset A drawn partial order placing larger element top le large element
Draw minimum number line x le sequence line descending x
This called Hasse Diagram
And basically know relation
I recommend reading page note order relation minimal maximal element partial order stuff make tiny bit sense

A relationship established two one table foreign key reference primary key another table
This basic concept behind term
Let review basic primary foreign key
A uniquely identifies record table
It type usually first column table automatically generated database ensure unique
A foreign key another candidate key primary key used link record data another table
For example consider two table identify teacher teach course
Here Courses table primary key
Its foreign key You see foreign key Courses match primary key Teachers We say foreign key helped establish Courses Teachers table
Using foreign key candidate key implement three type relationship table This type relationship allows one record side relationship
The primary key relates one record none another table
For example marriage spouse one spouse
This kind relationship implemented single table therefore use foreign key
A relationship allows single record one table related multiple record another table
Consider business database Customers Orders table
A single customer purchase multiple order single order could linked multiple customer
Therefore Orders table would contain foreign key matched primary key Customers table Customers table would foreign key pointing Orders table
This complex relationship many record table link many record another table
For example business probably need Customers Orders table likely also need Products table
Again relationship Customers Orders table consider relationship Orders Products table
An order contain multiple product product could linked multiple order several customer might submit order contains product
This kind relationship requires minimum three table
Establishing consistent relationship database table help ensure data integrity contributing database normalization
For example link table foreign key instead combined data Courses Teachers table like This design inflexible violates first principle database normalization First Normal Form state table cell contain single discrete piece data
Or perhaps decided simply add second record Carmen order enforce This still weak design introducing unnecessary duplication called mean could contribute inconsistent data
For example teacher multiple record data need edited person performing data editing realize multiple record exist
The table would contain different data individual without clear way identify avoid
Breaking table two table Teachers Courses visualized creates proper relationship data therefore help ensure data consistency accuracy
There error

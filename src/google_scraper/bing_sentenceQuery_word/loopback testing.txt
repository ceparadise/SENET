What
Why exist used would I use
The special computer us communicate
It used mainly diagnostics troubleshooting connect server running local machine
When network interface disconnected example port unplugged turned associated communication interface possible even communication computer
The loopback interface represent actual hardware exists application running computer always connect server machine
This important troubleshooting compared looking mirror
The loopback device sometimes explained purely diagnostic tool
But also helpful server offering resource need
For example run web server web document could examine file file
You may able load file browser though active content wo work way someone access normally
So want experience site others best course usually connect server
The loopback interface facilitates
For loopback interface assigned
That represent computer
For purpose though necessary use one IP address
This IP mapped
Thus log via SSH server running machine would use Like network adapter loopback device show output
Its name
One common production diagnostic use Ubuntu perform advanced printer configuration
In web browser go run web server port used configure printing regardless GUI running even running GUI
If try connecting work
However try connect
All address identify computer loopback interface server program decide bind specific IP address
If come Windows background might expect synonym thus able ping connect server forth
That behavior peculiar Windows
The general concept mechanism message signal end loop back started
So way use Ubuntu confused loopback device networking
To mount disk image Ubuntu could run This usually called term occasionally used
This nothing loopback device networking
Pulseaudio sound system provide mechanism connect audio input echoed back
Pulseaudio facilitates
Here correct use term like loop mount also nothing loopback device networking
And nothing loop mount either

loopback Internet protocol IP address also referred The address used establish IP connection machine computer used
The convention defined support addressing using connotation
Establishing connection using address common practice however using IP address range
function similar manner
The loopback construct give computer device capable networking capability validate establish IP stack machine
The Internet Protocol IP set rule ensure standardized method address communicate computer network device
Besides governing method addressing IP protocol also standardizes manner method data packet sent delivered applicable acknowledged across Internet local network
Internet Protocol version fourth revision protocol widely deployed throughout world
IETF RFC finalized September current definition protocol
slowly replaced adoption still infancy
considered connectionless protocol designed used network
The protocol guarantee delivery data integrity proper data sequencing instead relying Transmission Control Protocol TCP handle concern
Establishing network connection loopback address accomplished manner establishing one remote computer device network
The primary difference connection avoids using local network interface hardware
System administrator application developer commonly use test application
When establishing connection normally assigned subnet mask
If public switch router gateway receives packet addressed loopback IP address required drop packet without logging information
As result data packet delivered outside localhost design accidently arrive computer try answer
This aspect loopback help ensure network security maintained since computer answer packet addressed respective loopback address may also unexpectedly activate service machine responding stray data packet
Human being able easily remember IP address number well
Plain language web address however much easier use require method resolve actual address remote computer server
As result Domain Name System DNS developed help direct local Internet traffic appropriate destination performing Internet address DNS server located Internet
Before local computer send DNS request DNS server local network however perform check locally stored Hosts file first save time network resource
The host file contains pairing IP address along one host name updated frequently based predefined condition local computer
Before invention DNS single Hosts file shared across network
This found pas test scalability however multiple network started get connected together resulted development DNS system use today
Whenever computer user try access website remote computer name computer check locally stored Hosts file domain name resolution sending request Domain Name Server DNS
The IP address commonly found Hosts file computer assigned plain English address It also used computer malware assign legitimate website localhost prevent seeking legitimate computer security assistance malware infection
This type change commonly associated many computer scareware package deployed across Internet maliciously infected website Trojan horse virus infected email attachment
Some computer administrator interested student modify host file prevent access undesirable website however preferred method administrator becomes responsible removing entry required
Examples host file entry localhost A special use IP address one assigned Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IANA reserved specific reason purpose
The authority delineate address come IETF make assignment support Internet Standards Process
The IANA defines special use IP address
RFC first specification collect various definition special use IP address defined year central location
Based lesson learned special user address included RFC beginning
The IANA state RFC Internet protect abuse special IP address
The organization also go recommend data packet reserved address assumed originated subnet border router filter reserved packet originate device since instance attack mounted based use one special address
Network Networks Networks Cable Television Networks Reserved subject allocation Loopback Reserved subject allocation Link Local Networks Reserved subject allocation Reserved subject allocation Anycast Networks Network Interconnect Device Benchmark Testing Reserved subject allocation Multicast commonly used multiplayer simulation gaming video distribution
Reserved Future Use A common technique verify networking equipment operating system implementation working correctly send ping request
Based result test administrator computer user troubleshoot network connectivity issue
Application developer also make use loopback address test basic network functionality developing program application component prior going network Internet testing deployment
Some us loopback address trick computer security computer science student attempting crack probe test network speed using address
There also number variation Worst found across Internet
In story least likely based true story fellow hacker urge hacker infect hack conduct DOS DDOS attack address
In humorous story hacker succeeds infecting deleting information computer amusement watching
RFC published Internet Engineering Task Force IETF first document reserve address block loopback purpose
IETF document RFC described usage address block loopback purpose
These definition later updated exclusively IANA continue excluded assignment Regional Internet Registries
As number people device use Internet grown demand address continued grow exponentially
Internet Protocol Version next generation protocol designed ultimately replace slowly adopted education research circle
The Internet Engineering Task Force IETF developed accommodate increasing number device user accessing Internet help address fundamental security shortcoming implementation
accommodates greater number address using bigger number create IP address
Under addressing convention address bit length allows approximately billion unique address
however us bit address permit trillion trillion IP address
Besides significant increase total number IP address also offer networking advantage
The new protocol allows device detect use service enabled network without requiring action
It also significantly reduces need Network Address Translation NAT used allow number client share single IP address
A number research project based underlying technology underway part Internet project led networking consortium comprised education community industry government

longhand loopback address
The loopback address performs similar function allowing node send data packet
It assigned physical interface computer considered scope
The address allowed used source address packet sent outside single node
If router allowed forward data packet
If packet address received interface must also dropped
The loopback address address embedded address assigned binary prefix space
Although pinging loopback address accomplished using DOS command prompt terminal MAC OS X computer also built many network administrator tool available market
computer using account administrator permission

property system increase capability result stressor shock volatility noise mistake fault attack failure
It concept developed Professor book technical paper
As Taleb explains book antifragility fundamentally different concept resiliency
ability recover failure robustness ability resist failure
The concept applied risk analysis physic molecular biology transportation planning engineering Aerospace NASA computer science
Taleb defines follows Simply antifragility defined convex response stressor source harm range variation leading positive sensitivity increase volatility variability stress dispersion outcome uncertainty grouped designation disorder cluster
Likewise fragility defined concave sensitivity stressor leading negative sensitivity increase volatility
The relation fragility disorder mathematical obtained theorem derived empirical historical narrative
It
In book Taleb stress difference antifragile
Antifragility beyond resilience robustness
The resilient resists shock stay antifragile get better
An adaptive system one change behavior based information available time utilization opposed behavior defined system design
This characteristic sometimes referred cognitive
While adaptive system allow robustness variety scenario often unknown system design necessarily antifragile
In word difference antifragile adaptive difference system robust volatile one robust previously unknown environment
The concept applied Aerospace NASA megaproject management
In computer science structured proposal Antifragile Software Manifesto react traditional system design
The major idea develop antifragility design building system improves environment input
Tatyana Kovalenko Didier Sornette argued antifragile system exist
In general system subjected variability noise shock random perturbation possible develop strategy design average benefit variability variability
Such strategy designed profit variability particular stressor
Simultaneously vulnerable stressor
The refusal accept fundamental characteristic intrinsic weakness shared strategy system dangerous may lead unexpected shock intended manipulation insider
For instance financial sphere antifragility name exploitation situation turn loss gain special design put option strategy however vulnerable occurrence
Moreover antifragile strategy contain germ large externality leading systemic crisis neither strategy system prepared
Throughout Taleb book recognize antifragile system benefit variability variability essentially address criticism raised Kovalenko Sornette
For example The bold conjecture made everything life extent antifragile reverse
Typically antifragile fragile depending source range variation

This book build upon idea previous work including fourth book philosophical essay uncertainty titled
Taleb introduces book follows Some thing benefit shock thrive grow exposed volatility disorder stressor love adventure
Yet spite ubiquity phenomenon word exact opposite fragile
Let u call antifragile
Antifragility beyond resilience robustness
The resilient resists shock stay antifragile get better
example mild antifragility stressor poisonous substance antifragile becomes better overall small dose stressor
This different robustness resilience Antifragile system improves withstands stressor stressor neither large small
The larger point according Taleb depriving system vital stressor necessarily good thing downright harmful
More technically Taleb defines antifragility nonlinear response Simply antifragility defined response stressor source harm range variation leading positive sensitivity increase volatility variability stress dispersion outcome uncertainty grouped designation disorder cluster
Likewise fragility defined concave sensitivity stressor leading negative sensitivity increase volatility
The relation fragility convexity sensitivity disorder mathematical obtained theorem derived historical narrative

Antifragility rising issue Software Engineering
Due pervasiveness software growing number mission critical application traditional resilience recovery system may sufficient
Software taken many functionality vital interest today future world
We relay lot software application may faulty cause immense damage
To cope scenario claiming develop better software enough since unexpected event
Black Swans may disrupt overcome system
The purpose paper propose new architectural design responds need build antifragile system contemporary complex scenario
We suggest system enhances strength experience error
It self adaptive system architecture improving facing error
The relevant aspect approach architecture resilient extract intrinsic value fault
This paper suggests fine grained architecture key issue build antifragile system

While technology made astounding advance last century problem confronting engineering community must solved
Cost schedule producing large system increasing unsustainable rate system often perform intended
New system required may achieved current method
To solve problem NASA working infuse concept Complexity Science engineering process
Some problem may solved change design philosophy
Instead designing system meet known requirement always lead fragile system degree system designed wherever possible antifragile designing cognitive system learn experience adapt unforeseen event face environment grow stronger face adversity
Several example presented ongoing research effort employ philosophy
Selection responsibility Program Chairs

Is possible build better system survive shock actually thrives
Nassim Taleb think
Today talking antifragility mean DevOps
Humpty dumpty heart easily broken easily mended
But could design system able handle shock stressor
We building robust system capable resisting sort assault one
Building system responds shock getting even better improving
This concept antifragile developed Professor Nassim Nicholas Taleb author
In book Taleb continues philosophical debate nature uncertainty
Put simply Taleb think shock good thing
Some thing benefit shock thrive grow exposed volatility randomness disorder stressor love adventure risk uncertainty
Yet spite ubiquity phenomenon word exact opposite fragile
Let u call antifragile
Antifragility beyond resilience robustness
The resilient resists shock stay antifragile get better Taleb writes beginning book
An excellent example antifragile might human immune system
The immune system work fine
However stressor germ actually serve way improve immune system whole
The immune system learns deal intruder becomes stronger time
Simply antifragility defined convex response stressor source harm range variation leading positive sensitivity increase volatility variability stress dispersion outcome uncertainty grouped designation disorder cluster
Likewise fragility defined concave sensitivity stressor leading negative sensitivity increase volatility
The relation fragility convexity sensitivity disorder mathematical obtained theorem derived empirical data mining historical narrative
It Taleb So antifragile mean developer
It mean need build better mousetrap need build mousetrap
Specifically growing consensus computer science need develop antifragile system design
This mean building system improves environment input
One area could greatly benefit increase antifragile system cloud computing
In article Guang et al
argued development cloud service require antifragility error failure existing architecture service become driving force develop future cloud architecture business model application
There two reason Guang et al
put forward simple implementation plan creating antifragile cloud service
This allows cloud cloud always approach better system considered stakeholder
This antifragile development process temporally spatially interleaved step making possible continued evaluation
In conclusion making system adaptive raison être many developer day
Antifragile system promise smarter way system handle shock even improve
It might good idea check Taleb book Guang paper improve process smarter adaptive system

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

We set long research endeavor understand story CMU got
We tell positive story new book share six primary takeaway contributed success believe applicable organization workplace
Curriculum depend trying teach learn prioritizing one gender another
Changes improve curriculum benefit student
Basing coursework people think interest woman perpetuate stereotype
This approach also applied workplace
Women need soft role career opportunity based organizational need think know woman
If culture computer science program dominated geeky stereotypical archetype
Data show
Efforts directed inclusive wide range personality enabling opportunity including leadership visibility encouragement networking mentorship advocacy
For example CMU School Computer Science dropped programming admission prerequisite resulting diverse set incoming student
key also come
In US men woman different
We need change perception show woman successful CS
We witnessed cultural change within CS department CMU
For example student organization promote diversity continues part larger CMU strategic plan
Men woman
Our study CS major CMU show men woman relate computer science spectrum attitude difference
Indeed CMU seen familiar simplistic gender divide attitude CS
We seen similar attitude even extend identifying image geek word shunned
In study real gender difference centered around confidence level men showing much higher rate confidence woman
This CS
Institutional support administrative help funding explicit leadership vision signal authorization influence show diversity essential part organization value system
increasing sustaining pipeline
Lots people
But le sharing success story
We need hear inspirational story success like CMU including approach recommendation
By showing woman might succeed CS help program ultimately profession become inclusive

But let practical well
No project afford spend time effort would required guarantee every deliverable perfect first time
Even company operating Six Sigma level small probability error
Rework normal process gathering feedback deliverable
If create document instance circulate gather feedback resulting change considered rework
These change document way making sure good document begin
However publish completed document find error content resulting update would considered rework
Likewise let say developing software module
If test module declare complete assumption fact complete final
However testing reveals flaw need addressed additional effort considered rework
Although may accept rework inevitable based nature project mean project manager project team strive eliminate
You team always strive eliminate defect rework continually improving process
If rework focus finding early lifecycle possible
Remember error analysis propagate error design error construction
If find error testing phase might rework required throughout lifecycle including prior analysis design construct phase
On hand le chance propagating requirement error downstream rigorous process validate deliverable complete correct moving subsequent project phase
You track rework determine much project time spent thrashing working problem twice
For instance testing process track number error effort associated resolving error
Much problem resolution require rework previously completed deliverable
When error corrected may find change work adequately cause rework
You may find fixing one problem may break something else
This second unintended error cause even rework
You track total number error require rework well effort hour associated rework
The nature rework caused problem quality management process

The structured communication technique method originally developed systematic interactive method relies panel expert
The expert answer questionnaire two round
After round change agent provides anonymised summary expert forecast previous round well reason provided judgment
Thus expert encouraged revise earlier answer light reply member panel
It believed process range answer decrease group converge towards correct answer
Finally process stopped predefined stop criterion
number round achievement consensus stability result score final round determine result
Delphi based principle forecast decision structured group individual accurate unstructured group
The technique also adapted use meeting called ETE
Delphi widely used business forecasting certain advantage another structured forecasting approach
The name Delphi derives although author method unhappy oracular connotation name smacking little occult
The Delphi method based assumption group judgment valid individual judgment
The Delphi method developed beginning forecast impact technology
In ordered creation report future technological capability might used military
Different approach tried shortcoming traditional method trend extrapolation quickly became apparent area precise scientific law established yet
To combat shortcoming Delphi method developed Norman Dalkey
It used ever since together various modification reformulations procedure
Experts asked give opinion probability frequency intensity possible enemy attack
Other expert could anonymously give feedback
This process repeated several time consensus emerged
The following key characteristic Delphi method help participant focus issue hand separate Delphi methodology technique panel expert drawn inside outside organisation
The panel consist expert knowledge area requiring decision making
Each expert asked make anonymous prediction
Usually participant remain anonymous
Their identity revealed even completion final report
This prevents authority personality reputation participant dominating others process
Arguably also free participant extent personal bias minimizes allows free expression opinion encourages open critique facilitates admission error revising earlier judgment
The initial contribution expert collected form answer questionnaire comment answer
The panel director control interaction among participant processing information filtering irrelevant content
This avoids negative effect panel discussion solves usual problem
The Delphi Method allows participant comment response others progress panel whole revise forecast opinion real time
The person coordinating Delphi method usually known Leader facilitates response selected reason usually hold knowledge opinion view
The facilitator sends questionnaire survey etc
panel expert accept follow instruction present view
Responses collected analyzed common conflicting viewpoint identified
If consensus reached process continues thesis antithesis gradually work towards synthesis building consensus
First application Delphi method field science technology forecasting
The objective method combine expert opinion likelihood expected development time particular technology single indicator
One first report prepared Gordon Helmer assessed direction trend science technology development covering topic scientific breakthrough space progress war prevention weapon system
Other forecast technology dealing system industrial robot intelligent internet broadband connection technology education
Later Delphi method applied place especially related public policy issue economic trend health education
It also applied successfully high accuracy business forecasting
For example one case reported Basu Schroeder Delphi method predicted sale new product first two year inaccuracy compared actual sale
Quantitative method produced error traditional unstructured forecast method error
This one example overall accuracy technique mixed
The Delphi method also used tool implement approach participative developing country
The government Latin America Caribbean successfully used Delphi method sector approach identify urgent challenge regional
As result government widely acknowledged value collective intelligence civil society academic private sector participant Delphi especially field rapid change technology policy
Use Patent Participation Identification In early Jackie Awerman Jackie Awerman Associates modified Delphi method identifying role various contributor creation product
Epsilon Corporation Chemical Vapor Deposition Reactor The result used patent attorney determine bonus distribution percentage general satisfaction team member
From use Delphi technique public introduces number methodological innovation
In particular Further innovation come use later Delphi conference
According Turoff Hiltz Delphis According Bolognini Delphis offer two possibility relevant context interactive
These One successful example partially policy Delphi Delphi exercise contribution creation Latin America
It believed extensive online participatory foresight exercise history intergovernmental process developing world time
In addition specific policy guidance provided author list following lesson learned include potential Policy Delphi method introduce transparency accountability public especially developing country utility foresight exercise foster networking development community usefulness embedding foresight exercise established mechanism representative democracy international multilateralism United Nations potential online tool facilitate participation developing country stemming scale international foresight exercise therefore adequacy region
A number Delphi forecast conducted using web site allow process conducted
For instance us panel expert worldwide forecast breakthrough field science technology
Another example educational futurist collaborate online using Delphi method come technological advancement look education next year
Traditionally Delphi method aimed consensus probable future iteration
Other version Policy Delphi instead decision support method aiming structuring discussing diverse view preferred future
In Europe recent experiment used Delphi method communication technique interactive
The Argument Delphi developed Osmo Kuusi focus ongoing discussion finding relevant argument rather focusing output
The Disaggregative Policy Delphi developed Petri Tapio us cluster analysis systematic tool construct various scenario future latest Delphi round
The respondent view probable preferable future dealt separate case
The computerization Argument Delphi relatively difficult several problem like argument resolution argument aggregation argument evaluation
The computerization Argument Delphi developed Sadi Evren Seker proposes solution problem
Overall track record Delphi method mixed
There many case method produced poor result
Still author attribute poor application method weakness method
It must also realized area science technology forecasting degree uncertainty great exact always correct prediction impossible high degree error expected
Another particular weakness Delphi method future development always predicted correctly consensus expert
The issue ignorance important
If panelist misinformed topic use Delphi may add confidence ignorance
One initial problem method inability make complex forecast multiple factor
Potential future outcome usually considered effect
Later several extension Delphi method developed address problem take consideration possibility occurrence one event may change probability event covered survey
Still Delphi method used successfully forecasting single scalar indicator
Despite shortcoming today Delphi method widely accepted forecasting tool used successfully thousand study area varying technology forecasting
Delphi characteristic similar structured approach aggregate diverse opinion group
Yet difference may decisive relative applicability different problem
Some advantage derive possibility provide incentive participation
Delphi seems advantage prediction market

What difference using brainstorming Delphi Technique risk identification
What advantage disadvantage approach
The difference using brainstorming Delphi Technique risk identification simple
The first risk management process Risk Identification idea want figure every possible risk might affect firm project
Applying technique Risk Identification called Information Gathering brainstorming Delphi Technique come
Project Risk Management state Brainstorming refers technique generate creative idea
This may done individual group setting
Brainstorming session effective participant defer judgment whether response problem statement correct good
It often suggested participant aim quantity idea crazy sounding idea lateral thinking encouraged
Brainstorming useful original problem definition generating long list possible impact
However based deferring judgment brainstorming clearly assessment technique tool play critical part large assessment project
A typical topic brainstorming technology assessment Who might impacted electrical vehicle legislation
Typical answer may include
consumer

The difference brainstorming Delphi Technique risk identification discussed

Delphi operates principle several head better one making subjective conjecture future expert make conjecture based upon rational judgment shared information rather merely guessing separate hope likelihood process Weaver
Originated early primarily developed Dalkey Helmer Rand Corporation Ludwig Delphi technique group communication process solicits opinion order specifically examine particular issue topic
The original source name Delphi come oracle Delphi spirit Greek god Phoebus Apollo asked advice critical issue associated politics question unknown social dilemma
As name indicated Delphi initially designed method predicting future event
The earliest application technique military purpose
Its first notable use period involving project funded Air Force
A group expert gathered explore possible bombing strategy viewpoint Soviet strategic planner Rowe Wright Novakowski Wellar
The Delphi process employed generate refine list strategy probability consequence perceived Soviet planner
The Delphi technique gradually became popular early applied various field
For example policy determination Wilenius Tirkkonen Hahn Rayens Syed Hjarone Aro curriculum development Reeves Jauch Stritter Tresolini Reeb resource utilization Anderson Schneider Tsaur Lin Lin need assessment Brooks Olshfski Joseph McGeary business management Mitchell Grisham nursing Duffield Gibson Keeney Hasson McKenna environmental management Green Hunter Moore Stubbles education general Wicklein Tigelaar Dolmans Wolfhagen van Der Vleuten Crews Scott Conboy explored using Delphi process collect data concerning issue related respective discipline
The popularity Delphi technique began fade mid Yousuf present uncommon Delphi technique used part exclusive method investigation evaluation research project
The philosophical base Delphi technique built Lockean idea stress importance human experience agreement Mitroff Turoff Powell
Therefore rationale Delphi relies upon two presumption
Foremost simply stated mind superior one
More specifically collective input better individual judgment alone Weaver Dalkey
Second idea comment produced expert based logical reasoning
The result generated reasoning better simple conjecture Weaver
In essence Delphi technique involves panel expert thorough examination specific area concern
The purpose using Delphi benchmarking policy investigation prediction future event
In common survey practice investigator attempt identify Delphi effort ass Miller Hsu Sandford

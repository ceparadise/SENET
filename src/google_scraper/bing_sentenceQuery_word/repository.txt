By Reviewed Murray Anderegg Computer Services recommends Subversion Git CVS code repository
Computer Services still maintains CVS source code control system limited expertise answering question CVS
This page give brief introduction CVS including CVS repository need one creation CVS repository access CVS repository much space user get CVS repository repository available Computer Science Department
The book available
Other information available online recommendation good source welcome
The process getting started CVS may take bit time plan try CVS repository read online documentation get speed
Record keeping became necessary people wanted compare program current state point past
For example normal course implementing new feature developer may bring program thoroughly broken state probably remain feature mostly finished
Unfortunately time someone usually call report bug last publicly released version
To debug problem may also exist current version source program brought back useable state
Restoring state pose difficulty source code history kept CVS
The developer simply say effect Give program three week ago perhaps Give program time last public release
If never kind convenient access historical snapshot may surprised quickly come depend
Personally I always use revision control coding project saved many For collaboration CVS assumes developer equal status project provides ability check copy project modify check copy independently
At check CVS check file committed one currently repository case conflict alert developer conflict
When conflict second person committing resolve conflict repository accept new code
To create CVS repository departmental CVS server send request help asking creation personal CVS repository creation project repository related research group class department
Personal CVS repository created CVS server project repository created CVS server project name
After repository space created necessary initialize repository CVS
Login CVS server run cv repository directory init This create CVSROOT initialize file CVSROOT directory
If wish run multiple CVS repository CVS repository directory need run init command inside repository subdirectory
For example mkdir cv init mkdir cv init Access CVS repository currently ONLY using SSH
We strongly suggest use key authentication SSH prompted password file committed
This make process committing CVS change atomic le painful
A document describing setup key authentication Linux Windows available
The CVS repository currently residing Linux server filesystem running POSIX draft file ACLs
The process sharing repository collaborating others require modifying ACLs
For information Linux file ACLs see man page setfacl getfacl see two web page
Here example adding user anderegg repository
You need set extended ACLs repository Login cv cd repository setfacl user anderegg rwX
setfacl user anderegg rwX
To remove access user anderegg cd repository setfacl user anderegg
setfacl user anderegg
NOTE Both command need run make change permission everything existing without everything created future default
There cron job sweep repository performs chown owner repository everything within case different user creates file within repository
Users allocated space personal CVS repository
Projects allocated space CVS repository
The department offer recommends two repository manager Subversion Git
These repository manager generally robust CVS

Computer Services hard copy available
Subversion centralized system sharing information
At core repository central store data
The repository store information form typical hierarchy file directory
Any number connect repository read write file
By writing data client make information available others reading data client receives information others
So interesting
So far sound like definition typical file server
And indeed repository kind file server usual breed
What make Subversion repository special ever written change every file even change directory tree addition deletion rearrangement file directory
When client read data repository normally see latest version filesystem tree
But client also ability view state filesystem
For example client ask historical question What directory contain last Wednesday Who last person change file change make These sort question heart system designed track change data time
To create Subversion repository departmental CVS server send request help asking creation personal CVS repository creation project repository related research group class department

As late department added support accessible Subversion repository
These repository accessible SSH
Instead repository accessed URL beginning Users need request web based Subversion repository time repository creation based different part filesystem
Access permission web based repository managed Computer Services
Therefore request access change directed help
If wish share Subversion repository user two option Buy Computer Science cvsonly account allows SSH access CVS server
Request Subversion repository beginning
External user added without need account

Contents The following basic introduction Subversion
For full online instruction book use Subversion visit available website
Programmers used version control year manage change software checking debugging
It introduced prevent programmer working file overwriting others software possibly reintroducing bug poor programmer spent age removing
It similar reason Computer Laboratory introduced
You right
Subversion going make simple editing work challenge various reason introducing Subversion introduces system remembers every change ever written repository addition deletion rearrangement file directory
Files stored central similar ordinary file server except remembers every change ever made file directory
This allows recover older version file examine history data changed changed
To manage multiple file version Subversion us model alternative locking
In model user client read repository creates personal working copy file project
Users work parallel modifying private copy
Finally private copy merged together new final version
The version control system often assist merging ultimately human responsible making happen correctly
This much efficient method mean one person editing file time
The may sound bit chaotic practice run extremely smoothly user work parallel never waiting one another

A database repository logical also sometimes physical grouping data related separate database
This usually done purpose data data item needed reside different database
In case repository necessary bring together discrete data item operate one
Database repository usually discussed implemented realm data warehousing business intelligence
This usually requires level aggregation data database simply provide thus necessitating creation structure
Consider case large bank
Such institution likely composed several different subsidiary physical sense rather functional sense
There traditional bank account division addition loan division forex treasury division investment banking division safe deposit division
All division run separate information system course implies separate database
However division must report financials back head office
The Chief Financial Officer CFO need aggregate financial data various division gauge profitability feed directly bank overall financial position
You see CFO office really concerned operational part various database really interested data deal financials
Another thing note relies completely division reporting inform decision take generate data
Enter data repository
This likely another system database distinct others directly access relevant data database aggregate meaningful information CFO
However important remember data information CFO looking may may physically located data repository
The repository may simply read direct database performance reason may store local copy data accessed others
The repository likely include ability show performance trend time compare contrast division target show deviation along period
Some goal clearly context Business Intelligence
Also since CFO mostly interseted reporting opposed data input generation data repository likely system one minimal writes addition aggregating data going back long period
This function start cross context Data Warehousing
A data repository thus logical aggregation data item separate database one centralized location specific purpose achieved using database

Data repository somewhat general term used refer destination designated data storage
However many IT expert use term specifically refer particular kind setup within overall IT structure group database enterprise organization chosen keep various kind data
Some expert refer data repository partitioning data partitioned data type stored together
It also commonly called data warehousing
One simple premise kind setup keeping different kind data together yet separated database container business leader facilitate data mining related research help overall planning
One issue pursuing construction data repository security
It may make sense massive amount data collected one physical space case remote backup may critical aspect securing data

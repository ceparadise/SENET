Created GLOSSARY OF EDUCATION REFORM comprehensive online resource describes widely used term concept strategy journalist parent community member
In education term refers wide variety method tool educator use evaluate measure document academic readiness learning progress skill acquisition educational need student
While assessment often equated traditional developed testing company administered large population use diverse array assessment tool method measure everything readiness kindergarten student comprehension advanced physic
Just academic lesson different function assessment typically designed measure specific element level knowledge student already concept skill teacher planning teach ability comprehend analyze different type text reading
Assessments also used identify individual student weakness strength educator provide specialized educational programming social service
In addition assessment developed wide array group individual including teacher district administrator university private company state department education group include combination individual institution
While assessment take wide variety form education following description provide representative overview major form educational assessment
Assessments used wide variety purpose school Formative assessment commonly said learning educator use result modify improve teaching technique instructional period summative assessment said learning evaluate academic achievement conclusion instructional period
Or assessment expert Paul Black put When cook taste soup formative assessment
When customer taste soup summative Assessments also designed variety way different purpose The purpose assessment generally drive way designed many way assessment used
A standardized assessment assessment example form assessment standardized test
A portfolio student work used formative summative form assessment
assessment may also created team teacher commonly used single course grade level school assessment almost never Screening assessment may produced university conducted research specific area child development skill attribute student entering kindergarten increase likelihood successful pattern behavior strength challenge suggest child particular learning disability
In short assessment usually created highly specialized purpose
While educational assessment test around since day schoolhouse increasingly assumed central role effort improve effectiveness public school teaching
score example arguably dominant measure educational achievement United States also commonly reported indicator school teacher performance
As school become increasingly equipped computer tablet wireless internet access growing proportion assessment administered school either online test assessment still common widely used school
New technology software application also changing nature use assessment innumerable way given system typically offer array feature traditional test assignment
For example system may allow student log take assessment time may make performance result available student teacher immediately assessment completed historically might taken hour day week teacher review score grade assessment class
In addition digital online assessment typically include feature analytics give educator detailed information student performance
For example teacher may able see long took student answer particular question many time student failed answer question correctly getting right answer
Many advocate digital online assessment tend argue system used properly could help teacher many digital online system provide far detailed information academic performance student educator use information modify educational program instructional approach way address distinct learning need interest aspiration cultural background individual student
In addition many standardized test administered online though state typically allow student take test computer unavailable student prefer option student technological skill literacy required perform well online assessment
Given assessment come many form serve many diverse function thorough discussion purpose use assessment could fill lengthy book
The following description however provide brief illustrative overview major way assessment used attempt improve school teaching In education widespread agreement assessment integral part effective educational system program
Educators parent elected official policy maker employer public want know whether student learning successfully progressing academically school
The complex wide ranging frequently center assessment used including frequently administered whether assessment beneficial harmful student teaching process
While comprehensive discussion debate beyond scope resource following representative selection major issue debated The Glossary Education Reform welcome comment suggestion

I thought I could read student body language
I wrong
As experiment I used Socrative I taught binary number
What I learned forever changed view better teacher
done student learning
end like test
Here happened classroom
I teaching hardest topic number student learn add one zero like computer
It look harder many student shut even want try
So I taught count binary number worked example together
After minute two student piped
We got easy said
Can move I looked student asked Do They nodded head furiously yes
My teacher instinct said everyone knew I decided experiment I wrote problem board
Students already logged Socrative box opened screen
Each student typed answer problem
They clicked Enter answer appeared screen beside name
I floored
Guess many knew right answer
Two
Just two student spoken one else
I taught another minute gave another problem
A solved everyone
We took problem another way another thought easy
Finally minute teaching everyone mastering problem
Their test score proved
But end result think
It take longer teach binary number
You see I move past lesson student scoring percent higher
And result experience I taught binary number accompanying standard three day instead usual five one come tutoring
I sold formative assessment
Good teacher every subject adjust teaching based student know point
Good formative assessment remove embarrassment public hand raising give teacher feedback impact teaching moment
Instant feedback
We
Here
Learn strength weakness tool
You need several meet every classroom situation
These favorite tool formative assessment
used quick quiz also fly I already shared
Here another feature Before class I create quiz play game called Space Race
The website automatically divide class team
Kids know color team look rocket racing one another board
I always record grade particularly I know I teaching
The advantage Socrative give percentage I use grade ready
You even use traditional quiz desired
another tool category different advantage
Whereas Socrative see answer student Formative student draw device type answer use variety method updated live screen student enter answer
Math teacher device likely prefer one
let u build fun quiz
Students use computer cell phone device join game
In platform embed video make game part teaching process student create review game share
One disadvantage student use alias
I like tool prefer accountability data I get Socrative SMART Lab see Kahoot live quiz game
I knew Kahoot winner I finished minute early last day school class asked play SAT vocab review
I use SMART Notebook called
It let gather result like Socrative
SMART Lab free purchased SMART Notebook software need SMART board
another fantastic tool along line
You create presentation include quiz assessment drawing board
I appreciate integrated nature Nearpod SMART Lab I really like present material switch formative assessment tool go back presentation tool
Everything one place
There two us formative assessment video
First student watch video flipped classroom want know student know
I used recommend Zaption tool shut
And claimed replacement I recommend instead
Edpuzzle let embed question video interact student know student engaging digital content
The second perhaps exciting formative assessment method student create video demonstrate learning
For example student use create video documenting learning
If want student read use audio good alternative
I find second method exciting huge
For example student learning count video audio
Then using app tool like teacher listen give feedback work class another time
The long line teacher desk longer necessary
But student computer cell phone nothing
Do smartphone tablet
If got two simple answer
For verbal question Log create card student
The card look bit like QR code student use answer question rotating one side represents A another B
When ask question student hold card answer top side
Looking class Plicker app smartphone see name student feedback
For quick quiz mobile scanning app iPhone
There several others
Your question must multiple choice
Print short form student fill bubble
Use smartphone scan quiz immediately know student know
Test score never surprise
You need mind need formative assessment toolbox need use every day
I invite share formative assessment tool tip comment dozen hundred way ass
Our student need u excellent teacher formative assessment one way
The ability add activity fly one favorite part Nearpod
I also use student analyze class individual pattern reading interpreting historical artifact exit slip

Computer forensics practice collecting analysing reporting digital data way legally admissible
It used detection prevention crime dispute evidence stored digitally
Computer forensics follows similar process forensic discipline face similar issue
This guide discus computer forensics neutral perspective
It linked particular legislation intended promote particular company product written bias either law enforcement commercial computer forensics
The guide aimed audience provides view computer forensics
Although term computer used concept apply device capable storing digital information
Where methodology mentioned provided example constitute recommendation advice
Copying publishing whole part article licensed solely term There area crime dispute computer forensics applied
Law enforcement agency among earliest heaviest user computer forensics consequently often forefront development field
Computers may constitute scene crime example hacking denial service attack may hold evidence form email internet history document file relevant crime murder kidnap fraud drug trafficking
It content email document file may interest investigator also metadata associated file
A computer forensic examination may reveal document first appeared computer last edited last saved printed user carried action
More recently commercial organisation used computer forensics benefit variety case Intellectual Property theft Industrial espionage Employment dispute Fraud investigation Forgeries Bankruptcy investigation Inappropriate email internet use work place Regulatory compliance For evidence admissible must reliable prejudicial meaning stage computer forensic investigation admissibility forefront examiner mind
A widely used respected set guideline guide investigator area PDF ACPO Guide short
Although ACPO Guide aimed United Kingdom law enforcement main principle applicable computer forensics
The four main principle guide reference law enforcement removed follows
No action change data held computer storage medium may subsequently relied upon court

In circumstance person find necessary access original data held computer storage medium person must competent able give evidence explaining relevance implication action

An audit trail record process applied electronic evidence created preserved
An independent able examine process achieve result

The person charge investigation overall responsibility ensuring law principle adhered
In situation would change suspect computer computer forensic examiner necessary
Traditionally computer forensic examiner would make copy acquire information device turned
A would used make exact bit bit copy original storage medium
The examiner would work copy leaving original demonstrably unchanged
However sometimes possible desirable switch computer
It may possible would example result considerable financial loss owner
The examiner may also wish avoid situation whereby turning device may render valuable evidence permanently lost
In circumstance computer forensic examiner would need carry live acquisition would involve running small program suspect computer order copy acquire data examiner hard drive
By running program attaching destination drive suspect computer examiner make change addition state computer present action
However evidence produced would still usually considered admissible examiner able show action considered necessary recorded action explain court consequence action
We divided computer forensic examination process six stage presented usual chronological order
Forensic readiness important occasionally overlooked stage examination process
In commercial computer forensics include educating client system preparedness example forensic examination provide stronger evidence device auditing feature activated prior incident occurring
For forensic examiner themself readiness include appropriate training regular testing verification software equipment familiarity legislation dealing unexpected issue indecent image child found present commercial job ensuring acquisition data extraction kit complete working order
The evaluation stage includes receiving instruction clarification instruction unclear ambiguous risk analysis allocation role resource
Risk analysis law enforcement may include assessment likelihood physical threat entering suspect property best counter
Commercial organisation also need aware health safety issue conflict interest issue possible risk financial reputation accepting particular project
The main part collection stage acquisition introduced
If acquisition carried rather computer forensic laboratory stage would include identifying securing device may store evidence documenting scene
Interviews meeting personnel may hold information relevant examination could include end user computer manager person responsible providing computer service IT administrator would usually carried stage
The collection stage also involves labelling bagging evidential item site sealed numbered bag
Consideration given securely safely transporting material examiner laboratory
Analysis depends specific job
The examiner usually provides feedback client analysis dialogue analysis may take different path narrowed specific area
Analysis must accurate thorough impartial recorded repeatable completed within available resource allocated
There myriad tool available computer forensics analysis
It opinion examiner use tool feel comfortable long justify choice
The main requirement computer forensic tool meant way examiner sure regularly test calibrate tool rely analysis take place
verification confirm result integrity analysis tool A examiner find artefact X location Y tool B replicate result
This stage usually involves examiner producing structured report finding addressing point initial instruction along subsequent instruction
It would also cover information examiner deems relevant investigation
The report must written end reader mind many case reader terminology used
The examiner also prepared participate meeting telephone conference discus elaborate report
As readiness stage review stage often overlooked disregarded
This may due perceived cost work billable need get next job
However review stage incorporated examination help save money raise level quality making future examination efficient time effective
A review examination simple quick begin stage
It may include basic analysis went wrong went well learning incorporated future examination
Feedback instructing party also sought
Any lesson learnt stage applied next examination fed readiness stage
The issue facing computer forensics examiner broken three broad category technical legal administrative
Encrypted data impossible view without correct key password
Examiners consider key password may stored elsewhere computer another computer suspect access
It could also reside volatile memory computer known RAM usually lost computer another reason consider using live acquisition technique outlined
Storage medium hold ever greater amount data examiner mean analysis computer need sufficient processing power available storage capacity efficiently deal searching analysing large amount data
Computing continually evolving field new hardware software operating system emerging constantly
No single computer forensic examiner expert area though may frequently expected analyse something previously encountered
In order deal situation examiner prepared able test experiment behaviour new technology
Networking sharing knowledge computer forensic examiner useful respect likely someone else already come across issue
practice attempting thwart computer forensic analysis
This may include encryption data make unrecoverable modification file metadata file obfuscation disguising file
As encryption evidence method used may stored elsewhere computer another computer suspect access
In experience rare see tool used correctly frequently enough totally obscure either presence presence evidence used hide
Legal issue may confuse distract computer examiner finding
An example would Trojan Defence
A Trojan piece computer code disguised something benign carry hidden malicious purpose
Trojans many us include uploading downloading file installation virus
A lawyer may able argue action computer carried user automated Trojan without user knowledge Trojan Defence successfully used even trace Trojan malicious code found suspect computer
In case competent opposing lawyer supplied evidence competent computer forensic analyst able dismiss argument
A good examiner identified addressed possible argument opposition carrying analysis writing report
There plethora standard guideline computer forensics appear universally accepted
The reason include body tied particular legislation standard aimed either law enforcement commercial forensics author standard accepted peer high joining fee professional body dissuading practitioner participating
In many jurisdiction qualifying body check competence integrity computer forensics professional
In case anyone may present computer forensic expert may result computer forensic examination questionable quality negative view profession whole

The assessment standard provide criterion judge progress toward science education vision scientific literacy
The standard describe quality assessment practice used teacher state federal agency measure student achievement opportunity provided student learn science
By identifying essential characteristic exemplary assessment practice standard serve guide developing assessment task practice policy
These standard applied equally assessment student teacher program summative formative assessment practice classroom assessment well external assessment
This chapter begin introduction describes component assessment process contemporary view measurement theory practice
This introduction followed assessment standard discussion way teacher use assessment characteristic assessment conducted district state national level
The chapter close two sample assessment task one probe student understanding natural world another probe ability inquire
In vision described assessment primary feedback mechanism science education system
For example assessment data provide student feedback well meeting expectation teacher parent teacher feedback well student learning district feedback effectiveness teacher program policy maker feedback well policy working
Feedback lead change science education system stimulating change policy guiding teacher professional development encouraging student improve understanding science
The assessment process effective tool communicating expectation science education system concerned science education
Assessment practice policy provide operational definition important
For example use extended inquiry assessment task signal student learn teacher teach resource allocated
Assessment systematic multistep process involving collection interpretation educational data
The four component assessment process detailed
As science educator changing way think good science education educational measurement specialist acknowledging change well
Recognition importance assessment contemporary educational reform catalyzed research development implementation new method data collection along new way judging data quality
These change measurement theory practice reflected assessment standard
In new view assessment learning two side coin
The method used collect educational data define measurable term teacher teach student learn
And student engage assessment exercise learn
This view assessment place greater confidence result assessment procedure sample assortment variable using diverse method rather traditional sampling one variable single method
Thus aspect science inquire scientific understanding natural world understanding nature utility measured using multiple method performance portfolio well conventional test
The assessment standard include increased emphasis measurement Figure
Components Assssment Process The four component combined numerous way
For example teacher use student achievement data plan modify teaching practice business leader use per caput educational expenditure locate business
The variety us user method data contributes complexity importance assessment process
opportunity learn
Student achievement interpreted light quality program experienced
Another important shift toward assessment
This movement call exercise closely approximate intended outcome science education
Authentic assessment exercise require student apply scientific knowledge reasoning situation similar encounter world outside classroom well situation approximate scientist work
Another conceptual shift within educational measurement area significant implication science assessment involves validity
Validity must concerned technical quality educational data also social educational consequence data interpretation
An important assumption underlying assessment standard state local district develop mechanism measure student achievement specified content standard measure opportunity learning science specified program system standard
If principle assessment standard followed information resulting new mode assessment applied locally common meaning value term national standard despite use different assessment procedure instrument different locale
This contrast traditional view educational measurement allows comparison based parallel form test
Assessments deliberately designed
Assessments explicitly stated purpose
The relationship decision data clear
Assessment procedure internally consistent
The essential characteristic assessment process used collect interpret data consistent purpose assessment
That match purpose process achieved thoughtful planning available public review
Educational data profoundly influence life student well people institution responsible science education
People must use result assessment make decision take action well affected decision action deserve assurance assessment carefully conceptualized
Evidence careful conceptualization found written plan assessment contain Statements purpose assessment serve
Descriptions substance technical quality data collected
Specifications number student school data obtained
Descriptions method
Descriptions method data interpretation
Descriptions decision made including make decision procedure
Conducting assessment activity
Routine assessment classroom place considerable demand time intellectual resource teacher student
assessment conducted district state federal government require tremendous human fiscal expenditure
Such resource expended assurance decision action follow increase scientific literacy assurance made purpose assessment clear
Assessments test assumption relationship among educational variable
For example purpose decide school district management system continued assessment data might collected student achievement
This choice assessment would based following assumed relationship management system give teacher responsibility selecting science program teacher incentive implement effectively program select effective implementation improves science achievement
The relationship decision made data collected specified
For assessment internally consistent component must consistent others
A link inference must established reasonable alternative explanation eliminated
For example district management example relationship management system student achievement adequately tested student achievement variable measured
The extent management system increased teacher responsibility led change science program could influence science achievement must also measured
Achievement data collected focus science content important student learn
data collected focus powerful indicator
Equal attention must given assessment opportunity learn assessment student achievement
The content standard define science student come understand
They portray outcome science education rich varied encompassing The ability inquire
Knowing understanding scientific fact concept principle law theory
Standards The Physical Science Content Standard includes understanding motion force
One supporting idea motion object described change position time
Students respond question frame reference extended written response diagram
This individual extended response exercise embedded teaching
The teacher us information activity improve lesson
Students written response
Teacher observation
A class studying motion object
One student describing idea motion force point book desk say right book moving
A second student interrupt Oh yes
The book desk desk floor floor part building building sitting Earth Earth rotating axis revolving around Sun whole solar system moving Milky Way
The second student sits back smile face
All discussion cease
signal time pose following question class
Imagine insect spider lily pad floating stream
The spider walking around edge lily pad
The insect sitting middle pad watching spider
How would insect describe motion
How would insect describe spider motion
How would bird sitting edge stream describe motion insect spider
After setting class work discussing question teacher walk around room listening discussion
asks student write answer question posed suggests student use diagram part response
The school principal observing class asked explain followed original lesson plan
explained girl made similar statement class twice
realized girl disruptive making legitimate point member class grasping
So decided continuing discussion motion force would fruitful class developed better concept frame reference
Her question designed help student realize motion described term point reference
The insect middle lily pad would describe motion motion spider term reference frame lily pad
In contrast bird watching edge stream would describe motion lily pad passenger term reference frame namely ground standing
Someone ground observing bird would say bird motion observer moon would different answer
The ability reason scientifically
The ability use science make personal decision take position societal issue
The ability communicate effectively science
This assessment standard highlight complexity content standard addressing importance collecting data aspect student science achievement
Educational measurement theory practice well developed primarily measure student knowledge subject matter therefore many educator policy analyst confidence instrument designed measure student command information science instrument designed measure student understanding natural world ability inquire
Many current science achievement test measure inert isolated bit active rich
Assessment process include outcome student achievement must probe extent organization student knowledge
Rather checking whether student memorized certain item information assessment need probe student understanding reasoning utilization knowledge
Assessment learning closely related outcome assessed teacher student likely redefine expectation learning science outcome assessed
The system program teaching professional development standard portray condition must exist throughout science education system student opportunity learn science
At classroom level powerful indicator opportunity learn teacher professional knowledge including content knowledge pedagogical knowledge understanding student extent content teaching professional development assessment coordinated time available teacher teach student learn science availability resource student inquiry quality educational material available
The teaching program standard define greater detail indicator opportunity learn
Some indicator opportunity learn origin federal state district level discussed greater detail system standard
Other powerful indicator opportunity learn beyond classroom include educational expenditure state science requirement graduation federal allocation fund state
Compelling indicator opportunity learn continually identified way collect data designed
Measuring indicator present many technical theoretical economic social challenge challenge obviate responsibility moving forward implementing assessing opportunity learn
The assessment standard call commitment resource necessary research development related assessing opportunity learn
That commitment includes development technical skill ass opportunity learn among science education professional including teacher supervisor administrator curriculum developer
Students held accountable achievement unless given adequate opportunity learn science
Therefore achievement opportunity learn science must assessed equally
The feature claimed measured actually measured
Assessment task authentic
An individual student performance similar two task claim measure aspect student achievement
Students adequate opportunity demonstrate achievement
Assessment task method presenting provide data sufficiently stable lead decision used different time
Standard C address degree data collected warrant decision action based
The quality decision appropriateness resulting action limited quality data
The serious consequence student teacher greater confidence making decision must technical quality data
Confidence gauged quality assessment process consistency measurement alternative assessment process
Judgments confidence based several different indicator discussed
The content form assessment task must congruent supposed measured
This validity
For instance assessment claim measure student ability frame question conducting scientific inquiry design inquiry address question format would appropriate task
Requiring student pose question design inquiry address would appropriate task
However purpose assessment task measure student knowledge characteristic distinguish group mineral format might suitable well efficient
When student engaged assessment task similar form task engage life outside classroom similar activity scientist great confidence attached data collected
Such assessment task authentic
Classroom assessment take many form including observation student performance instructional activity interview formal performance task portfolio investigative project written report multiple choice essay examination
The relationship form assessment task goal science education obvious others
For instance student ability obtain evaluate scientific information might measured using test identify source scientific information toxic waste
An alternative authentic method ask student locate information develop annotated bibliography judgment scientific quality information
This one aspect reliability
Suppose purpose assessment measure student ability pose appropriate question
A student might asked pose question situation set physical science
The student performance task consistent performance task set context life science assuming student equal opportunity learn physical life science
For decision maker confidence assessment data need assurance student opportunity demonstrate full understanding ability
Assessment task must developmentally appropriate must set context familiar student must require reading skill vocabulary inappropriate student grade level must free bias possible
This another aspect reliability especially important assessment change performance group interest
Only stable measure valid inference change group performance made
Although confidence indicator discussed focus student achievement data analogous set confidence indicator generated opportunity learn
For instance teacher quality indicator opportunity learn
Authenticity obtained teacher quality measured systematic observation teaching performance qualified observer
Confidence measure achieved number observation large enough teacher exhibit full range teaching knowledge skill
Consistency performance also established repeated observation
method take many form
Each advantage disadvantage
The choice among usually constrained tradeoff type quality amount information gained time resource requires
However serve intended purpose choice assessment form consistent one want measure infer
It critical data method collection yield information confidence level consistent consequence use
Public confidence educational data use related technical quality
This public confidence influenced extent technical quality considered educator policy maker skill communicate public
Assessment task must reviewed use stereotype assumption reflect perspective experience particular group language might offensive particular group feature might distract student intended task
assessment must use statistical technique identify potential bias among subgroup
Assessment task must appropriately modified accommodate need student physical disability learning disability limited English proficiency
Assessment task must set variety context engaging student different interest experience must assume perspective experience particular gender racial ethnic group
A premise student access quality science education expected achieve scientific literacy defined content standard
It follows process used ass student achievement must fair student
This ethical requirement also measurement requirement
If assessment result closely related gender ethnicity preparation received science understanding ability assessed validity assessment process questionable
Those plan implement science assessment must pay deliberate attention issue fairness
The concern fairness reflected procedure used develop assessment task content language assessment task process student assessed analysis assessment result
Statistical technique require sex different racial ethnic background included development assessment
Bias determined certainty combination statistical evidence expert judgment
For instance exercise ass understanding inertia using flywheel result differential performance female male judgment exercise biased might plausible based assumption male female different experience flywheel
Whether assessment large scale teacher conducted principle fairness requires method allow student physical disability learning disability limited English proficiency demonstrate full extent science knowledge skill
The requirement assessment exercise authentic thus context increase likelihood task degree bias population student
Some context appeal male others female
If however assessment employ variety task collection equally unfair
This one way deleterious effect bias avoided
When making inference assessment data student achievement opportunity learn science explicit reference need made assumption inference based
Even assessment well planned quality resulting data high interpretation empirical evidence result quite different conclusion
Making inference involves looking empirical data lens theory personal belief personal experience
Making objective inference extremely difficult partly individual always aware assumption
Consequently confidence validity inference requires explicit reference assumption inference based
For example science achievement assessment sample student certain population high several conclusion possible
Students population might highly motivated excellent instruction student population might greater opportunity learn science test might biased way favor student
Little confidence placed conclusion without clear statement assumption developed line reasoning evidence conclusion
The level confidence conclusion raised conducting assessment well trained process making inference educational assessment data
Even general public well professional demand open understandable description inference made
Teachers best position put assessment data powerful use
In vision science education described teacher use assessment data many way
Some way teacher might use data presented section
Teachers collect information student understanding almost continuously make adjustment teaching basis interpretation information
They observe critical incident classroom formulate hypothesis cause incident question student test hypothesis interpret student response adjust teaching plan
Teachers use assessment data plan curriculum
Some data teacher collected data come external source
The data used select content activity example incorporated course study module unit lesson
Teachers use assessment data make judgment The developmental appropriateness science content
Student interest content
The effectiveness activity producing desired learning outcome
The effectiveness selected example
The understanding ability student must benefit selected activity example
Planning assessment integral instruction
Assessments embedded curriculum serve least three purpose determine student initial understanding ability monitor student progress collect information grade student achievement
Assessment task used purpose reflect student expected learn elicit full extent student understanding set variety context practical aesthetic heuristic value meaning outside classroom
assessment task also provide important clue student important learn
Students need opportunity evaluate reflect scientific understanding ability
Before student need understand goal learning science
The ability understanding essential tool learning
Through student clarify idea supposed learn
They begin internalize expectation learn science
Developing skill ongoing process throughout student school career becoming increasingly sophisticated student progress
Conversations among teacher student assessment task teacher evaluation performance provide student necessary information ass work
In concert opportunity apply individual work work peer information contributes development student skill
By developing skill student become able take responsibility learning
Teachers communicated assessment practice standard performance criterion evaluation student student able Select piece work provide evidence understanding scientific concept principle ability conduct scientific inquiry
Explain orally writing illustration work sample provides evidence understanding
Critique sample work using teacher standard criterion quality
Critique work student constructive way
Involving student assessment process increase responsibility teacher
Teachers science representative scientific community classroom represent culture way thinking might quite unfamiliar student
As representative teacher expected model reflection fostering learning environment student review others work offer suggestion challenge mistake investigative process faulty reasoning poorly supported conclusion
A teacher formal informal evaluation student work exemplify scientific practice making judgment
The standard judging significance soundness creativity work professional scientific work complex arbitrary
In work classroom learning investigation teacher represent standard practice scientific community
When teacher treat student serious learner serve coach rather judge student come understand apply standard good scientific practice
An essential responsibility teacher report student progress achievement student colleague parent policy maker
Progress report provide information The teacher performance standard criterion evaluation
A student progress marking period marking period form year year
A student progress mastering science curriculum
A student achievement measured criterion
Each issue requires different kind information different mode assessment
Especially challenging teacher communicating parent policy maker new method gathering information gaining acceptance school
Parents policy maker need reassured newer method good better used school
Thus developing plan assessment strategy compile evidence student achievement teacher demonstrate alternative form data collection method interpreting valid reliable familiar test
The purported objectivity test highly valued newer mode assessment portfolio performance essay rely apparently subjective scoring method le trusted people professional educator
Overcoming lack trust requires teacher use assessment plan monitoring student progress grading
Clearly relating assessment task product student work valued goal science education integral assessment plan
Equally important plan explicit criterion judging quality student work policy maker parent understand
Master teacher engage practical inquiry teaching identify condition promote student learning understand certain practice effective
The teacher researcher engages assessment activity similar scientific inquiry collecting data answer question effective teaching practice
Engaging classroom research mean teacher develop assessment plan involve collecting data student opportunity learn well achievement
Science assessment conducted district state national authority serve similar purpose distinguished primarily number student teacher school data collected
Assessments may conducted authority external classroom purpose Formulating policy
Monitoring effect policy
Enforcing compliance policy
Demonstrating accountability
Making comparison
Monitoring progress toward goal
In addition purpose assessment conducted school district make judgment effectiveness specific program school teacher report taxpayer district accomplishment
The high cost external assessment influence science teaching practice demand careful planning implementation
assessment include teacher planning implementation
In addition data collected analyzed sample size well rationalized sample representative population interest
This section discus characteristic assessment
Far often educational data collected analyzed used make decision take action
assessment planner able describe data plan collect used improve science education
The development interpretation externally designed assessment monitoring educational system include active participation teacher
Teachers experience student make indispensable participant design development interpretation assessment prepared beyond classroom
Their involvement help ensure congruence classroom practice science education external assessment practice
Whether district state national level teacher science need work others make contribution assessment process educational researcher educational measurement specialist curriculum specialist educational policy analyst
The size sample data collected depends purpose assessment number student teacher school district state assessment plan address
If instance state conduct assessment learn student science achievement comparison student another state sufficient obtain data scientifically defined sample student state
If however purpose assessment give credit individual student science course data must collected every student
For assessment even district level information collected way minimize time demand individual student
For many accountability purpose sampling design employed different representative sample student receiving different set task
This permit many different dimension science education system monitored
Policy maker taxpayer make valid inference student achievement opportunity learn across nation state district without requiring extensive time commitment every student sample
To illustrate assessment standard two example provided
The content standard stated term understanding ability therefore first example understanding natural world
This example requires body scientific knowledge competence reason information make prediction develop explanation act scientifically rational way
The example focus prediction justifying prediction
The second example ability inquire also requires body scientific information competence reason conceptualize plan perform investigation
These assessment task content standard correspondence
The content standard call scientific understanding natural world
Such understanding requires knowing concept principle law theory physical life earth science well idea common across natural science
That understanding includes capacity reason knowledge
Discerning student know student reason possible without communication either verbal representational third essential component understanding
Inferences student understanding based analysis performance science classroom work product
Types performance include making class public presentation discussing science matter peer teacher conducting laboratory work
Products student work include examina tions journal note written report diagram data set physical mathematical model collection natural object
Communication fundamental performance assessment
Understanding take different perspective displayed different level sophistication
A physicist understanding respiration might quite different chemist cell biologist understanding respiration quite different physician
The physicist chemist biologist physician highly sophisticated understanding respiration
They bring many scientific principle bear concept
However likely give greater emphasis concept special significance particular discipline
A physicist emphasis might energetics little emphasis organism respiration take place
The physician hand might emphasize respiration specifically applies human
The context application also contributes difference perspective
The cell biologist understanding might focus mechanism respiration occurs cell physician understanding might focus human respiratory disorder physical pathological cause
An ordinary citizen understanding respiration much le sophisticated practicing scientist
However even citizen understanding different perspective reflecting difference experience exposure science
Legitimate difference perspective sophistication understanding also evident student scientific understanding natural world
A challenge teacher others responsible assessing understanding decide variability translated judgment degree individual student group understand natural world
The example follows illustrates explanation natural world rich source information student understand
Because explanation central scientific enterprise eliciting analyzing explanation useful way assessing science achievement
The example illustrates thoughtfully designed assessment exercise requiring explanation provide student opportunity demonstrate full range scientific understanding
Exercises sort designed learn whether student know particular fact concept rather tap depth breadth student understanding
Exercises sort difficult design challenge score
The example follows illustrates challenge
The assessment task begin prompt includes description task direction
The prompt read Many attribute make jar good exercise assessing understanding
The situation plant closed jar described student verbally diagram actual material thus eliminating reading barrier student response
The situation understood student age minimizing student prior knowledge situation factor ability respond
The explanation prediction developed many different level complexity qualitative quantitative
It based experience theory us idea physical life earth science well idea thus allowing student demonstrate full range understanding science various level study science
The process scoring explanation requires development scoring rubric
The rubric standard performance defined population
Typically scoring rubric developed teacher student target population
The performance standard developed consensus process called social moderation
The step designing scoring rubric involve defining performance standard scientifically literate adult deciding element standard appropriate student target population
The draft performance standard refined subsequent use student performance work
Finally student performance respect rubric differentiated
Performances rated satisfactory exemplary inadequate
Differences opinion rubric judgment quality student response moderated group teacher consensus reached rubric
Because target population identified rubric need function community develop section define rubric
Rather step developing rubric described
Developing scoring rubric begin description performance standard scientifically literate adult
That performance standard developed rubric development team
Members team write individual response exercise reflect belief scientifically literate adult respond
They also seek response adult
Based individual response team negotiates team response serf initial standard
The team standard analyzed component response
In exercise component prediction information used justify prediction reasoning used justify prediction quality communication
Examples prediction scientifically literate adult long plant live jar might include insufficient information make prediction plant live indefinitely insect disease might kill plant
Whatever prediction justified
For example assertion made information provided prompt insufficient make prediction explanation describe information needed make prediction information would used
Scientifically literate adult rely range knowledge justify prediction
The standard response developed team teacher include concept physical life earth science well unifying concept science
All applicable making justifying prediction life plant jar difference emphasis one person would expected use
Some concept evaporation condensation energy including heat light chemical energy conversion energy transmission chemical interaction catalysis conservation mass dynamic equilibrium physical science
Other concept life science plant physiology plant growth photosynthesis respiration plant disease plant insect interaction
Still concept earth science soil type composition atmosphere water cycle solar energy mineral cycle
Finally unifying concept might used predict justify prediction plant jar
Those might include closed open isolated system physical model pattern change conservation equilibrium
The knowledge required predict life plant jar limited single concept
A deeper understanding phenomenon could implied justification includes knowledge chemical specie energy
Keeping track energy C H O sugar CO carbon dioxide H O water O oxygen mineral requires knowing change undergo jar equilibrium among zone jar soil atmosphere
The jar content form closed system respect matter open system respect energy
The analysis life expectancy plant jar also requires knowing matter jar change form mass remains constant
In addition knowing gas atmosphere mineral soil become part plant important explanation
A deeper understanding science might inferred prediction justification included knowledge physical chemistry photosynthesis respiration
Photosynthesis process radiant energy visible light converted chemical bond energy form special carrier molecule ATP turn used store chemical bond energy carbohydrate
The process begin light absorption chlorophyll pigment give plant green color
In photosynthesis light energy used drive reaction Respiration process energy released chemical compound react oxygen
In respiration sugar broken produce useful chemical energy plant reaction Photosynthesis respiration complementary process photosynthesis result storage energy respiration release
Photosynthesis remove CO atmosphere respiration add CO atmosphere
A justification prediction life plant jar might include knowledge dynamic equilibrium
Equilibrium exists liquid vapor state water
The liquid water evaporates continuously
In closed container constant temperature rate condensation equal rate evaporation
The water state dynamic equilibrium
Another attribute justification relates assumption
The justification explicit assumption underlie even contain speculation concerning implication making alternative assumption
Finally justification prediction plant jar demonstrates reasoning characterized succession statement follow one another logically without gap statement statement
The assessment exercise appropriate prompt understanding plant grade level
Development scoring rubric student different grade level requires consideration science experience developmental level student
For instance justification student elementary school could expected based primarily experience plant
Student justification would contain little scientific terminology
A student might respond exercise following way Expectations justification constructed student grade different
These contain generalized knowledge use sophisticated language scientific concept light heat oxygen carbon dioxide energy photosynthesis
By grade level sophistication much higher
Ideally grader would see plant jar physical model Earth ecosystem view photosynthesis respiration complementary process
Setting performance standard population student depends population developmental level experience science
Considerations made using student response developing rubric illustrated discussing two justification constructed student completed biology
Student E constructed exemplary justification prediction plant jar
Student S constructed le satisfactory response completely missed point
O incomplete vaporization
This would shut root hair pressure plant allows water nutrient reach leaf
All plant live long day downhill
Judging quality information contained justification requires consensus information contained using certain standard compare information information rubric
Standards might applied include scientific accuracy information justification appropriateness knowledge student age experience sophistication knowledge appropriateness application knowledge situation
Foremost judgment quality information contained justification take account accuracy information student used crafting response
Student S justification contains misinformation water cycle dynamic equilibrium closed system
The statement inference made moisture soil likely start evaporate almost immediately
This leave soil dry air humid
Since closed container water restored soil condensation
The student statement soil container dry air humid suggests lack knowledge equilibrium closed system
In contrast Student S misinformation Student E justification contains information neither unusually sophisticated viewed content biology text erroneous
Judgments appropriateness information difficult make
A person familiar biology course student took might assert information student response sophisticated taught course
In case content biology course used standard rating quality response
Alternatively standard rating appropriateness information might scientific idea content standard
Student E response rated higher Student S basis quality information
Student S justification provides information student know provides evidence making inference structure student knowledge
For example student consider complementary relationship photosynthesis respiration crafting justification
Perhaps student know respiration process complementary
Alternatively two concept may stored memory way facilitate bringing bear exercise
Testing plausibility inference student knowledge structure would require conversation student
To learn student know respiration one simply ask
If student know apply making prediction evidence respiration understood context life process plant
Student E response well structured consistent prediction
The statement form connected progression
The prediction tentative justification indicates tentative due lack information prompt student uncertainty quantitative detail condition photosynthesis respiration occur
The student explicit certain assumption instance relationship mineral soil plant growth
The question student pose justification interpreted evidence alternative assumption considered
In contrast Student S prediction stated unwarranted assurance justified without consideration anything availability sufficient water
Furthermore justification proceed sequential way proceeding general principle empirical evidence justification prediction
Student S response highlight important point justifies separating scoring information scoring reasoning
A student compose justification using incorrect information
For instance student posed following justification reasoning would adequate even conclusion soil dry correct
The reasoning would rated higher student communicated Developing scoring rubric moderation requires highly informed teacher experienced process
Even teacher adequately prepared moderation process take time
The content standard call knowledge understanding
Considerable resource must therefore devoted preparing teacher others science education system design rate assessment require student display understanding described
The second assessment example focus inquiry
The content standard call understanding scientific inquiry developing ability inquire
As understanding natural world understanding inquiry contingent knowing concept principle law theory physical life earth science
Inquiry also requires reasoning capability skill manipulating laboratory field equipment
As understanding natural world inference student ability inquire understanding process based analysis performance science classroom work product
The example follows describes twelfth grade student participation extended inquiry
The exercise serf two purpose
It provides teacher information well student met inquiry standard
Equally important serf capstone experience school science program
The extended inquiry introduced early school year
It involves student working individual small group investigating question choice
Throughout school science program student encouraged identify question interest amenable investigation
These question recorded student research notebook
Early senior year high school student prepare draft statement question propose investigate discus question reasonable one
Those draft circulated member class
Students prepare written review classmate proposal commenting quality research question rationale investigating
Students revise research question based peer feedback
Finally student present defend revised question class
The teacher encourages require student work together research group two four student
After presenting research question class student form research group come agreement question investigate begin developing preliminary plan conducting investigation
Each individual group required keep extensive record group work especially documenting evolution final research question several question originally proposed
As plan investigation evolve research question sharpened modified meet practical constraint time resource available class
Each student maintains journal note process
When group satisfied plan progressed point work begin plan presented classmate
Written copy plan distributed written review followed class seminar discus research plan
On basis peer feedback group revise research plan recognizing plan implemented require still revision
Each student class responsible reviewing research plan every group including written critique recommendation modifying plan
During phase extended investigation student engage iterative process involving assembling testing apparatus designing testing form data collection developing testing data collection schedule collecting organizing interpreting data
Based note individual group prepares written report describing research
That report also includes data collected preliminary analysis
Based peer feedback group modify procedure continue data collection
When group convinced method working data reasonably consistent analyze data draw conclusion
After seminar research group present data analysis conclusion group prepares first draft research report
This draft circulated classmate preparation individual critique
This feedback used group prepare final report
While class engaged extended investigation teacher observes student performance student make presentation class interacts peer us computer laboratory apparatus
In addition teacher product individual student work well group work including draft research question critique student work individual student research notebook
Those observation student performance work product rich source data teacher make inference student understanding scientific idea nature scientific inquiry
For instance context planning inquiry student pose question investigation
Their justification question scientific one provide evidence infer extent quality understanding nature science understanding natural world understanding life physical earth science well quality extent scientific knowledge capacity reason scientifically
Evidence quality student ability reason scientifically come rationale student research question line reasoning used progress pattern collected data conclusion
In first instance student distills research question understanding scientific idea associated natural phenomenon
In second instance student generates scientific information based data
In either case quality reasoning inferred well connected chain reasoning explicit student assumption made extent speculation implication made alternative assumption made
The writing speaking requirement extended investigation provide ample evidence assessing ability student communicate scientific idea
The envision change throughout system
The assessment standard encompass following change emphasis Assessing easily measured Assessing highly valued Assessing discrete knowledge Assessing rich knowledge Assessing scientific knowledge Assessing scientific understanding reasoning Assessing learn student know Assessing learn student understand Assessing achievement Assessing achievement opportunity learn End term assessment teacher Students engaged ongoing assessment work others Development external assessment measurement expert alone Teachers involved development external assessment Baron

During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science

This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman

In technique arranging complexity computer system
It work establishing level complexity person interacts system suppressing complex detail current level
The programmer work idealized interface usually well defined add additional level functionality would otherwise complex handle
For example programmer writing code involves numerical operation may interested way number represented underlying hardware
whether detail suppressed said leaving simply programmer work
In addition task sending email message across continent would extremely complex programmer start piece fiber optic cable basic hardware component
By using layer complexity created abstract away physical cable network layout presenting programmer virtual data channel task manageable
Abstraction apply control data abstraction action
The notion programming viewed way combine abstraction data code
The abstract definition used common family object different implementation behavior share meaning
The mechanism programming used define common interface
The recommendation programmer use abstraction whenever suitable order avoid duplication usually known
The requirement programming language provide suitable abstraction also called abstraction principle
Computing mostly operates independently concrete world The hardware implement interchangeable others
The software structured enable human create enormous system concentrating issue time
These architecture made specific choice abstraction
architecture inevitable complex
A central form abstraction computing language abstraction new artificial language developed express specific aspect system
help planning
processed computer
An example abstraction process generational development
Each stage used stepping stone next stage
The language abstraction continues example
Within programming language feature let programmer create new abstraction
These include
Some abstraction remain invisible operate design system
Some abstraction try limit range concept programmer need aware completely hiding abstraction turn built
The software engineer writer criticised effort claiming abstraction never completely hide detail however negate usefulness abstraction
Some abstraction designed interoperate abstraction example programming language may contain making call language
Different programming language provide different type abstraction depending intended application language
For example Analysts developed various method formally specify software system
Some known method include Specification language generally rely abstraction one kind another since specification typically defined earlier project abstract level eventual implementation
The specification language example allows definition class waterfall project remain abstract architecture specification phase project
Programming language offer control abstraction one main purpose use
Computer machine understand operation low level moving bit one location memory another location producing sum two sequence bit
Programming language allow done higher level
For example consider statement written fashion To human seems fairly simple obvious calculation
However step necessary carry evaluation return value assign value variable actually quite subtle complex
The value need converted binary representation often much complicated task one would think calculation decomposed compiler interpreter assembly instruction much le intuitive programmer operation shifting binary register left adding binary complement content one register another simply human think abstract arithmetical operation addition multiplication
Finally assigning resulting value variable labeled used later involves additional step looking variable label resultant location physical virtual memory storing binary representation memory location etc
Without control abstraction programmer would need specify step time simply wanted add multiply couple number assign result variable
Such duplication effort two serious negative consequence Structured programming involves splitting complex program task smaller piece clear interface component reduction complexity potential
In simple program may aim ensure loop single obvious exit point possible single exit point function procedure
In larger system may involve breaking complex task many different module
Consider system handle payroll ship shore office These layer produce effect isolating implementation detail one component assorted internal method others
programming embrace extends concept
Data abstraction enforces clear separation property detail implementation
The abstract property visible client code make use data data concrete implementation kept entirely private indeed change example incorporate efficiency improvement time
The idea change supposed impact client code since involve difference abstract behaviour
For example one could define called uniquely associate value may retrieved specifying corresponding key
Such lookup table may implemented various way even simple linear key value pair
As far client code concerned abstract property type case
Of course relies getting detail interface right first place since change major impact client code
As one way look interface form agreed behaviour data type client code anything spelled contract subject change without notice
In theory involves facility define object represent abstract actor perform work report change state communicate object system
The term refers hiding detail extending concept earlier programming language associate strongly data standardizing way different data type interact beginning
When abstraction proceeds operation defined enabling object different type substituted called
When proceeds opposite direction inside type class structuring simplify complex set relationship called
Various programming language offer similar facility abstraction support general strategy programming includes substitution one another similar role
Although generally supported image package may predetermine great many
This would leave minimum binding change
example feature le distinction use delegation
Individual object function abstracted flexibly better fit shared functional heritage
exemplifies another extreme relies heavily static binding turn certain flexibility problem
Although example offer alternate strategy achieving abstraction fundamentally alter need support abstract noun code programming relies ability abstract verb function noun data structure either process
Consider example sample fragment represent common farm animal level abstraction suitable model simple aspect hunger feeding
It defines class represent state animal function With definition one could create object type call method like In example class abstraction used place actual animal abstraction case generalisation
If one requires differentiated hierarchy animal differentiate say provide milk provide nothing except meat end life intermediary level abstraction probably DairyAnimal cow goat would eat food suitable giving good milk MeatAnimal pig steer would eat food give best
Such abstraction could remove need application coder specify type food could concentrate instead feeding schedule
The two class could related using stand alone programmer could define varying degree two type
These facility tend vary drastically language general achieve anything possible others
A great many operation overload data type data type effect degree inheritance mean achieve polymorphism
The class notation simply coder convenience
Decisions regarding abstract keep control coder become major concern design determining relevant relationship real world concern
In general determine appropriate abstraction one must make many small decision scope domain analysis determine system one must cooperate legacy analysis perform detailed analysis expressed within project time budget constraint design
In simple example domain barnyard live pig cow eating habit legacy constraint detailed analysis coder must flexibility feed animal available thus reason code type food class design single simple Animal class pig cow instance function
A decision differentiate DairyAnimal would change detailed analysis domain legacy analysis would entirely control programmer refer abstraction programming distinct abstraction domain legacy analysis
When discussing refers act considering le detailed safe definition observed program behavior
For instance one may observe final result program execution instead considering intermediate step execution
Abstraction defined precise model execution
Abstraction may respect property one answer question property equally well concrete abstract model
For instance wish know result evaluation mathematical expression involving integer worth need perform operation modulo familiar form abstraction
Abstractions however though necessarily
That possible get sound answer though abstraction may simply yield result
For instance may abstract student class minimal maximal age one asks whether certain person belongs class one may simply compare person age minimal maximal age age lie outside range one may safely answer person belong class one may answer I know
The level abstraction included programming language influence overall
The framework includes concept formalism
This framework allows designer programming language study abstraction characteristic design change abstraction influence language usability
Abstractions prove useful dealing computer program property computer program essentially see
As consequence automatic method deriving information behavior computer program either drop termination occasion may fail crash never yield result soundness may provide false information precision may answer I know question
Abstraction core concept
generally take place abstract version studied system
Computer science commonly present le commonly abstraction wherein level represents different model information process varying amount detail
Each level us system expression involving unique set object composition apply particular domain
Each relatively abstract higher level build relatively concrete lower level tends provide increasingly granular representation
For example gate build electronic circuit binary gate machine language binary programming language machine language application operating system programming language
Each level embodied determined level beneath making language description somewhat
Since many user database system lack familiarity computer database developer often hide complexity following level The lowest level abstraction describes system actually store data
The physical level describes complex data structure detail
The next higher level abstraction describes data database store relationship exist among data
The logical level thus describes entire database term small number relatively simple structure
Although implementation simple structure logical level may involve complex physical level structure user logical level need aware complexity
This referred
must decide information keep database use logical level abstraction
The highest level abstraction describes part entire database
Even though logical level us simpler structure complexity remains variety information stored large database
Many user database system need information instead need access part database
The view level abstraction exists simplify interaction system
The system may provide many database
The ability provide different level abstraction use
Some specifically generate design contain various level abstraction
Layered architecture partition concern application stacked group layer
It technique used designing computer software hardware communication system network component isolated layer change made one layer without affecting others

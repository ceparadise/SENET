A access layer environment used get data user
The data mart subset data warehouse usually oriented specific business line team
Whereas data warehouse depth information data mart pertains single department
In deployment department business unit considered data mart including
This enables department isolate use manipulation development data
In deployment conformed dimension used business unit ownership hold true shared dimension like customer product etc
Organizations build data warehouse data mart information database organized way make readily accessible requiring query complicated
While designed updated data warehouse mart
Data warehouse designed access large group related record
Data mart improve response time allowing user access specific type data need view often providing data way support collective view group user
A data mart basically condensed focused version data warehouse reflects regulation process specification business unit within organization
Each data mart dedicated specific business function region
This subset data may span across many enterprise functional subject area
It common multiple data mart used order serve need individual business unit different data mart used obtain specific information various enterprise department accounting marketing sale etc
The related term derogatory label describing situation occurs one business analyst develop system linked perform business analysis grow size degree complexity make nearly impossible maintain
Data warehouse Data mart According school data warehousing logical subset physical subset extract larger isolated one following reason According Inmon school data warehousing tradeoff inherent data mart include limited silo information inability leverage enterprise source data
The alternative school data warehousing
In view data warehouse nothing union data mart
This view help reduce cost provides fast development create inconsistent data warehouse especially large organization
Therefore Kimball approach suitable corporation

Request Info There significant growing demand professional business public agency nonprofit
The supply professional work effectively data scale limited reflected rapidly rising salary data engineer data scientist statistician data analyst
A recent study McKinsey Global Institute concludes shortage analytical managerial talent necessary make Big Data significant pressing challenge
The report estimate four five million job requiring data analysis skill large number position filled training retraining
The author also project need million manager analyst deep analytical technical skill ask right question consume result analysis big data effectively
The statistic listed represent significant growing demand data scientist
Sources Data increasingly cheap ubiquitous
We digitizing analog content created century collecting myriad new type data web log mobile device sensor instrument transaction
IBM estimate percent data world today created past two year
At time new technology emerging organize make sense avalanche data
We identify pattern regularity data sort allow u advance scholarship improve human condition create commercial social value
The rise big data potential deepen understanding phenomenon ranging physical biological system human social economic behavior
Virtually every sector economy access data would imaginable even decade ago
Businesses today accumulating new data rate exceeds capacity extract value
The question facing every organization want attract community use data effectively data data available relevant
Our ability derive social economic value newly available data limited lack expertise
Working data requires distinctive new skill tool
The corpus often voluminous fit single computer manipulate traditional database statistical tool represent using standard graphic software
The data also heterogeneous highly curated data past
Digitized text audio visual content like sensor blog data typically messy incomplete unstructured often uncertain provenance quality frequently must combined data useful
Working data set also raise challenging issue privacy security ethic

Data Science NYU There much debate among scholar practitioner data science
Does deal big data
What constitutes big data
Is data science really new
How different statistic analytics
In virtually area intellectual inquiry data science offer powerful new approach making discovery
By combining aspect statistic computer science applied mathematics visualization data science turn vast amount data digital age generates new insight new knowledge
Facebook Twitter collect hour traditional method take sociologist month even year gather
Hedonometer tool created University Vermont researcher putting social data use
It pull million tweet day match tweet database word assigned happiness value
The higher Hedonometer number particular day happier collective mood Twitter user presumably wider group people
Some finding predictable day Boston bombing world saddest day five year
Other finding surprising Twitter user happiness increase move home
How much higher product labeled green organic sell around globe
What drive certain good stay price face changing economic condition
How much price adjust country exchange rate change
These among question MIT Billion Prices Project aim answer
The Project collect price hundred online retailer around world daily basis economic research
Researchers Columbia University attempting reverse model scientist coming new material finding application
Their method build DNA research NYU employ aspect data science help engineer design nanomaterials particular property
By harnessing huge growing body high throughput experimentation data researcher approach could replace expensive design method engineer traditionally use create new material accelerating new product
Legal professional scholar relied digitized legal document brief memo record conduct research many year
Proprietary platform however costly independent lawyer small firm search method limited
Enter startup like BriefMine San Francisco using data science provide affordable efficient alternative
Within growing repository document BriefMine technology identifies data point conduct trend analysis develops scoring framework based relevance natural language search
From production floor Facebook page every point company operation generates data
According McKinsey Quarterly big data may well become new type corporate asset cut across business unit function much powerful brand representing key basis To get asset company turning data scientist collect integrate analyze data
Schools like NYU developed degree program fill growing gap number trained data scientist need business
Joel Dudley Mt
Sinai offered example DataBeat data science help discover disease researcher even know look
Mt
Sinai unique resource clinical data patient genomic data
Researchers could two type data isolate smaller population people may share trait
For instance group diabetic may prone one particular disease another group diabetic patient prone another disease
This might illuminate new form diabetes lead personalized treatment
Astronomical instrument optical telescope collect huge amount information
Deblurring optical data find exoplanets requires new way represent image
One efficient deblurring method come recent advance applied mathematics
But efficiently computing sparse representation requires new optimization method involving statistical inference complex Bayesian model
With data science bring technique different discipline together aiding hunt planet outside solar system
Drawing insight piece data involves understanding fit larger picture organization explains IBM Jeff Jonas distinguished engineer chief scientist IBM Entity Analytics
Business environment one require context context necessity attempt know examining data
The data science initiative New York University effort establish country leading data science training research facility NYU
It launched help meet world demand researcher professional skilled developing utilizing automated method analyzing data
The initiative especially focused harnessing potential power big data transform area ranging healthcare business government
Data science overlap traditionally strong discipline NYU mathematics statistic computer science
It also stand impact discipline NYU school department actively engaged economics law sociology

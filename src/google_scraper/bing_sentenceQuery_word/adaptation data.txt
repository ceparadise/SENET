The term refers adapts behaviour individual user based acquired user environment
A pass potentially long cycle delivery realize component system
However impossible anticipate user single best optimal system configuration impossible
The active involvement user clear understanding user requirement challenge interactive system two reason With norm give guidance activity throughout life cycle interactive system
One core task design negotiate facilitate across acknowledging different form expression different requirement side
However despite implementation design process type modern application require instant adaptation due exposure increasing situational dynamic
Even design process implemented project guarantee certain degree yield richer understanding context use completed product ability adapt changing condition still play central role broad acceptance
The operational environment change task distinct competence expectation evolve
Here impossible developer anticipate possible requirement modification
Thus dynamic changing condition shift customisation process system characteristic development phase usage operation phase time needed professional development short new feature costly
For reason developer implement technique adaptation system order react changing condition fast possible
The example application scenario clearly show important distinction concerning adaptation technique differentiation manually automatically performed adaptation process
Accordingly term adaptation decomposes two term adaptivity
Adaptivity indicates system adapts automatically user according changing condition

Adaptability refers user substantially customise system tailoring activity
adaptable system
Adaptive adaptable system complementary
Both method increase match user need system behaviour development system finished
Thus system kept flexible usage
Changing condition trigger execution adaptation
Many characteristic might taken account adaptation process
They clustered three main category environmental difference
Differences address variety among several user along manifold dimension
Physiological characteristic like disability major concern application designer want system accepted large community
The consideration user like scheme interaction option property numberless personal preference popular source adaptation reused different application
Other source user interest disinterest personality characteristic like difficult ass automatically
difference consider development single user well task time
A static system fall short changing user requirement user activity goal evolve
In extreme case user system beginning perceive system cumbersome restricted user increase
In manner need higher computer system pushed changing task accomplished system
Environmental Differences basically result computing device application people lead highly dynamic computing environment
Unlike rely carefully configured largely static set resource application subject change available resource network connectivity device
Moreover frequently required cooperate spontaneously opportunistically previously unknown software service order accomplish task behalf user
Thus environment surrounding application user major source justify adaptation operation

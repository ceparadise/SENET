Operating system provide various service user including management running terminating operating system monitoring configuration
Most operating system shell interface underlying kernel even shell communicates user via attached computer directly
Shells actually special application use kernel way used application program
A shell manages interaction prompting user input interpreting input handling output underlying operating system much like REPL

On system protocol usually used shell used graphical user interface GUIs
On Microsoft Windows used provide GUI remote access
Most operating system shell fall one two category graphical
Command line shell provide interface CLI operating system graphical shell provide graphical user interface GUI
Other possibility although common include various implementation TUI CLI
The relative merit shell often debated
A CLI operating system shell us character typed keyboard provide instruction data operating system interactively
For example send code representing keystroke command interpreter program running computer command interpreter par sequence keystroke responds error message recognize sequence character may carry program action loading application program listing file logging user many others
Operating system UNIX large variety program different command syntax capability
Some operating system single style command interface commodity operating system came standard command interface interface also often available providing additional feature function menuing remote program execution
Application program may also implement interface
For example system program number command controlling link remote computer system

Batch mode use shell usually involves structure conditionals variable element programming language bare essential needed purpose others sophisticated programming language
Conversely programming language used interactively operating system shell program
The shell may offer feature interpreter expands command based character input user
A interpreter may offer history function user recall earlier command issued system repeat possibly editing
Since command operating system typed user short command name compact system representing program option common
Short name sometimes hard user recall early system lacked storage resource provide detailed user instruction guide

Graphical shell provide mean manipulating program based GUI allowing operation opening closing moving resizing well switching window
Graphical shell may included come separately even set loosely coupled utility
Most graphical user interface develop data file represented paper document desk application program similarly graphical representation instead invoked command name
Modern version operating system use shell
Windows Shell provides familiar well accessing file management function operating system
Older version also include shell series Microsoft Windows fact ship later version Windows NT type least Windows XP
The interface Windows version markedly different
Desktop application also considered shell long use engine
Likewise many individual developer dissatisfied interface Windows Explorer developed software either alters functioning appearance shell replaces entirely
good example former sort application

Interoperability programme software let Windows user use equivalent many various GUIs discussed well Macintosh
An equivalent Presentation Manager version run programme condition using version Windows NT
Graphical shell typically build top
In case shell consists respectively well one multiple program providing functionality start installed application manage open window virtual desktop often support widget engine
In case could thought windowing system shell consists SystemUIServer
Shell also used loosely describe application software built around particular component web browser email client analogy shell found nature

A shell software provides interface operating system user provide access kernel service
On operating system shell invoked shell command command line interface CLI allowing user direct operation computer command text script
Shells also exist programming language providing autonomy operating system allowing compatibility
Most shell created operating system offer equivalent Unix shell functionality
On Microsoft Windows system user may never use shell directly service handled automatically
In Unix shell created implementation system startup script
This happens Windows shell script usually preconfigured run automatically required system
Unix shell divided four category On system shell environment application run protected memory space resource shared among multiple active shell kernel managing resource request CPU stack execution memory access
Other system run everything inside single shell

Most people know shell small protective covering certain animal clam crab mollusk
You may also find shell outside egg I highly recommend remove eating
In computer science world however shell software program interprets command user understand perform appropriate function
The shell interface mean soley
The user type command perform function run program open browse view process currently running
Since shell one layer operating system perform operation always possible using graphical user interface
Some example include moving file within system folder deleting file typically locked
The catch need know correct syntax typing command may still prompted password order perform administrative function
Shells commonly associated many Unix user like interact operating system using interface
Two common Unix shell Bourne shell C Shell used BSD
Most Unix system shell available user
Windows user may familiar DOS shell long included Windows operating system
Most computer user need use shell interface fun way perform function computer well impress friend

The
The command processor program operating system command
The shell therefore part command processor accepts command
After verifying command valid shell sends another part command processor executed
system offer choice several different shell popular Each offer somewhat different
The phrase shell also used describe outermost layer

By Reviewed Bil Hays The ssh client program secure shell replacement telnet rlogin rsh program
You never use telnet rlogin login UNIX machine program insecure
Both telnet rlogin send user name password clear text network information sniffed someone
Below information ssh UNIX Windows Macs
The ssh program use Open SSH software To use ssh UNIX system type ssh hostname
You prompted password ssh encrypts sending network
The first time login UNIX system also prompted register remote machine public key UNIX stored home directory
Answer Yes prompted register subsequent logins
The ssh program available department UNIX machine
There many feature utility program ssh suite
For information see
There secure replacement UNIX ftp client called sftp
You use connect Computer Science UNIX system
Like telnet standard ftp client send password internet clear text
Both ftp sftp command line interface connect
The sftp command bit different standard ftp command enter using sftp client help command
See information
used recommend SSH SecureShell software longer supported connect many server
Our current recommends ssh client window transitioning installing window computer
It work much SecureCRT described
If logging UNIX machine Windows platform use SecureCRT terminal program start ssh window
While SecureCRT also support telnet use ssh otherwise may giving hacker password
SecureCRT installed default department Windows system
To connect UNIX machine start SecureCRT click File menu select Quick Connect
You presented following version Enter hostname system want log enter UNIX login name click Connect
The campus site license SecureCRT allows UNC employee student run SecureCRT personal system

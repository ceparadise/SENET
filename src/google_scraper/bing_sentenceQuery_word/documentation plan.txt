By Let honest
No one want write read actually
I talking documentation usually defined step Project Life Cycle
Although documentation occur point I focusing tip documentation phase
Please note two subset documentation I discussing
While research article I pulled editor Anthony Ralston Chester Meek
It definitely first edition classic thing timeless
It state Documentation listing Your opinion documentation phase Project Life Cycle likely depends role IT organization
If manager project lead documentation critical success project
If position documentation annoying nuisance get way work
While tip mainly targeted toward latter category manager supervisor also benefit
The old adage picture worth thousand word mean using picture augment text minimize length complexity documentation
System user like picture diagram table bulleted list quick reference
Examples excellent way end user quickly grasp concept may fully understand
It also good way end user learning new software sit tackle new challenge easily
Here example documentation picture term Microsoft us saving shadow copy file
If working document project labor intensive accidentally lost part work go back previous version
Think automated way make snapshot file looked previous point time
But first configure Vista Previous Versions Figures B E turned scroll bar scroll logical find one want enable Previous Versions
That logical drive name Documents example
check box next logical drive name

Sit follow instruction
If documenting building server network IT system start clean partition build everything scratch
You undoubtedly discover left something instruction unclear
Work uninformed committed get feedback publish
Let test documentation
You amazed learn sit person work software documentation first time
A lot feature software obvious obvious someone honest willing work
Watch closely navigating software
Ask feedback take note
I remember feedback I got testing one project
The feedback written I could review point point
The first thought came mind long take
You may also take comment critical personal
Do make mistake
Looking back I implemented missing feature helpful critic provided
Use opportunity make final tweak project
Feedback documentation process help make overall project successful
I writing review Foxconn motherboard I ran across two error manual
I first person review board
Foxconn missed error reviewer missed error well
One mistake manual far trivial
The diagram manual showing normal position clear CMOS jumper setting incorrect
I know turning motherboard verify proper seating heatsink jumper fell
I put jumper back according instruction manual
The computer failed POST
After careful look tiny diagram motherboard I discovered error corrected misplaced jumper
I working tech Foxconn time kind enough answer question I informed error
Documentation error like easy miss lead potentially large cost manufacturer
I would missed error fact jumper loose enough fall turning motherboard
How many time read user manual wondered really human end creation manual computer made manual
Although want create colorful novel humanize document enough personality reader feel little comfortable reading
Documentation costly even done correctly
New technology continue created help create effective documentation le costly develop
Look new tool opportunity reduce time cost documentation process
Documenting part project team especially difficult
Your documentation need shared added documentation team member
Changes made often daily basis
Software exists allow help ensure standardized end product also help foster sharing idea knowledge among team member
While working CSC Computer Sciences Corporation I experimented Microsoft Agent technology mixed result
I always thought offered wonderful way guide new user feature system
Some may remember offensive little paper clip character blinking eye Word
It slightly annoying
With Agent character move across screen point box programmatically open box allow character speak option presented
I created guided tour software let Peedy parrot point box fill text box change screen generally walk end user entire process creating new record database
I found using Agent saved write many tedious page documentation detailed step necessary create save modify new record
It also fun develop
It allowed creative side participate positive beneficial way
Creativity developer key component make successful
Creativity considered developing documentation depending standard expectation company
The feedback I received MS Agent experiment never taken seriously least part comical looking character
It lot extra work build require learn new coding technique
It pleasure person department trained
I told take guided tour
Perhaps Microsoft ahead time respectable character type technology could still become mainstream one day
I recently built computer dad wedding anniversary gift

What manager remember performance review time another person documentation project
My guess wo deserve promotion raise bonus
While exactly fun documentation rewarding done correctly
Not better overall project present customer also greatly reduce future support time provide
You also reduce amount support maintenance time help desk
When working CSC I given opportunity project lead design creation global reporting system infrastructure
I got see first hand side documentation
We good programmer group Crystal Reports API work custom function building
It obvious knowledge unique needed shared rest team better way properly document work

The second greatest compliment ever paid career I give presentation global technical support team
I create present documentation build reporting server
One database administrator chap England sit presentation
He looked document paraphrase commented good documentation able build reporting server using documentation
Statements like make hard work worth
And compliment main project work documentation
You cut documentation time build User Documentation time write System Documentation
You share information two reduce missing information
Even want inappropriate share information document benefit topic one document prompt include additional documentation
Create follow standard format guideline
This help ensure important information excluded allow easier reading system user
The one time I dedicated documentation expert work document system Hughes Aircraft Company
The result excellent
The format department standard result better I would done
It required lot time effort get result
The documentation expert needed access beta system access I could answer question
This expensive company resource allocate professional documentation result excellent system builder verify important information misinterpreted left end product

Were documentation pro learn never write Chinese I imagine Englese would sound people
Find use professional translator make documentation understandable important information lost translation
I also state obvious
Your documentation free misspelling grammatical error
Always use find error
I never cease amazed many obvious spelling error I made simply missed reread
If I already convinced creating good documentation good employer take comfort fact creating good documentation menial task
When document work also documentation

Keller You might uncertain computer science CS use every day
When use Google smartphone watch movie special effect lot CS
When order product Internet CS web site cryptography used keep credit card number secure way FedEx route delivery vehicle get order quickly possible
Nonetheless even computer scientist struggle answer question What CS Many science try understand thing work physic try understand physical world chemistry try understand composition matter biology try understand life
So computer science trying understand
Computers
Probably computer designed built human inner working known least people
Perhaps programming
Programming indeed important computer scientist grammar important writer telescope important astronomer
But nobody would argue writing grammar astronomy telescope
Similarly programming important piece computer science CS
If turn origin computer science root disparate field include engineering mathematics cognitive science among others
Some computer scientist design thing much like engineer
Others seek new way solve computational problem analyze solution prove correct much like mathematician
Still others think human interact computer software closely related cognitive science psychology
All piece part computer science
One theme unifies nearly computer scientist interested ranging rtificial intelligence oogenesis
Put another way computer scientist interested finding solution wide variety computational problem
They analyze solution determine goodness implement good solution create useful software people work
This diversity endeavor part make CS much fun
There several important concept heart computer science chosen emphasize six data problem solving algorithm programming abstraction creativity
When Google word pie recipe Google report find approximately million page ranked order estimated relevance usefulness
Facebook approximately billion active user generate billion comment Likes day
GenBank national database DNA sequence used biologist medical researcher studying genetic disease million genetic sequence billion DNA base pair
According International Data Corporation size Digital Universe reached zettabyte
How much
Jeffrey Heer computer scientist specializes managing visualizing large amount data put way A stack DVDs reached moon back would store approximately zettabyte data
Without computer science data would junk
Searching recipe Google friend Facebook gene GenBank would impossible without idea tool computer science
Doing meaningful thing data challenging even dealing million billion thing
In book interesting thing smaller set data
But much applicable large amount data
When presented computational problem first objective find computational solution algorithm solve
An precise sequence step carrying task ranking web page Google searching friend Facebook finding closely related gene Genbank
In case single good algorithm enough launch successful company Google initial success due Page Rank algorithm
Algorithms commonly compared recipe act ingredient data
For example imagine alien come Earth distant planet hankering pumpkin pie
The alien Google search pumpkin pie find following Assuming know perform basic cooking step measuring ingredient cracking egg stirring licking spoon etc
could make tasty pie following step precisely
Out respect gastronomical computer scientist rarely write recipe algorithm anything food
As computer scientist would likely write algorithm calculate precisely would write algorithm make pie
Let consider algorithm Take dart one time dart When thrown dart divide number landed inside circle total number n dart threw multiply
This give estimate
Figure show scenario
Figure Using dartboard approximate That description algorithm work
Here The area circle π case made radius board
The area square
Since assuming dart equally likely end anywhere square expect proportion land circle ratio area circle area square
Therefore throw n dart determine number k land inside circle approximately
So multiplying ratio give u approximation
Happily computer robotically throw physical dart instead simulate dart throwing process computer generating random coordinate describe dart land
The computer throw million virtual dart fraction second never miss thing considerably safer roommate
Although noted earlier computer science exclusively programming ultimately usually want implement algorithm operate data
Learning program bit like learning speak write new language
The good news programming vocabulary nearly complicated spoken language
In book program language called Python whose syntax particularly easy learn
But fooled thinking real programming real language used real programmer write real software
Moreover idea learn transferable learning language later
While data algorithm programming might seem like whole story truth important idea behind scene
Software often immensely complex difficult even impossible single person keep interacting piece mind
To deal complex system computer scientist use notion idea designing one part program ignore inessential detail part program long high level understanding
For example car engine drivetrain electrical system component
These component designed individually assembled work together
The designer drivetrain need understand every aspect engine work enough know drivetrain engine connected
To drivetrain designer engine In fact engine divided component engine block distributor others
These part viewed abstract entity interact one another
When designing engine block need think every detail distributor work
Software system even complicated car
Designing software requires think abstraction order ensure many people contribute project without everyone needing understand everything order test software methodically order able update future simply replacing one component new improved component
Abstraction therefore key idea design large system software particular
This book strives prepare write program interesting thing data
In process hope convey computer science enormously creative endeavor requires innovative exploration even experimentation
Often time one way solve problem
In case even clear best way solve problem
Different solution different merit
While Google Facebook GenBank wonderfully easy use many challenge continue design continual updating system
These challenge often lead group computer scientist working together find different solution evaluate relative merit
While challenge confront book modest scope hope share sense problem solving creativity heart computer science

Auden The best way get feel computer science jump right start solving computer science problem
So let
In section examine solution important problem How make sure never least room
To solve problem use simple programming language named Picobot control robot loosely based Roomba vacuum cleaner robot
You probably wondering happened Python programming language said would using throughout book
Why sweeping Python carpet brushing aside language plan use remainder book
The answer although Python simple powerful
programming language easy learn Picobot language learn
The entire language take minute learn yet allows powerful interesting computation
So able start serious computer science get sucked discussion programming language
This new whether programmed offer Eureka experience
So dust browser join u
It humblest turned killer app household robot
Imagine Roomba vacuum named Picobot goal suck debris free space around ideally without missing nook cranny
The robotics community call task ensuring grass mown surface receives paint Martian soil surveyed
At first problem might seem pretty easy
After parent gave vacuum cleaner told vacuum room without missing spot probably pretty great job without even thinking much
Shouldn straightforward convey strategy robot
Unfortunately couple obstacle make Picobot job considerably difficult
First Picobot limited sight sense directly around
Second Picobot totally unfamiliar environment supposed clean
While could probably walk around room blindfolded without crashing thing Picobot lucky
Third Picobot limited memory
In fact even remember part room seen part
While challenge make Picobot job job programming Picobot difficult also make coverage problem interesting computer science problem worth serious study
Our first task solving problem represent way computer handle
In word need define data working solve problem
For example represent obstacle room
Where Picobot
We could represent room plane list coordinate object corner coordinate Picobot location
While representation reasonable actually use slightly simpler approach
Whether lawn sand environment simpler cover discretized cell shown Figure
This first example abstraction ignoring detail environment simplifying something easily work
You Picobot similarly simplified occupy one grid square green one travel one step time one four compass direction north east west south
Picobot travel onto obstacle blue also wall mentioned know position obstacle ahead time
What Picobot sense immediate surroundings four cell directly north east west south
The surroundings always reported string four letter order meaning first see neighboring cell orth next ast est finally outh
If cell north empty letter first position
If cell north occupied letter first position The second letter indicates whether eastern neighbor empty occupied third west fourth south
At position corner Figure example Picobot sensor would report surroundings
There sixteen possible surroundings Picobot shown Figure textual representation
Figure There four type cell Picobot environment map green Picobot blue cell wall gray cell free space
Picobot sense whether empty cell visited dark light gray sense whether four immediate neighbor free space obstacle
Figure There sixteen possible surroundings string Picobot
The one Picobot completely enclosed occur simulator
As seen Picobot sense immediate surroundings
This important process
For example Picobot process moving north sens cell north wall try continue moving north
In fact simulator allow
But Picobot know whether moving north direction
Picobot innate sense direction
Instead make use powerful concept called
The state computer person almost thing simply current condition happy sad underwater outer space etc
In computer science often use state refer internal information describes computer
Picobot state extremely simple single number range
Somewhat surprisingly enough give Picobot pretty complex behavior
Although Picobot state numeric helpful think English term
For example might think state meaning I heading north I go However important note none state number special meaning u make decision
Moreover Picobot actually sense direction pointing
But define conception direction Picobot pointing defining appropriate set state
For example imagine Picobot want perform task continually moving north get wall
We might decide state mean I heading north I go I get wall north I consider next
When Picobot get wall might want enter new state I heading west I go I get wall west I think
We might choose call state state entirely u
Figure The five part two Picobot rule
One useful way interpret idea state attribute distinct intention state
With two rule Picobot initial state state represents go west far As see next job Picobot programmer define state meaning control Picobot make interesting thing
Now know represent Picobot surroundings represent state
But make Picobot anything
Picobot move following set rule specify action possibly state change
Which rule Picobot chooses follow depends current state current surroundings
Thus Picobot complete thought process follows Picobot us rule express thought process
Figure show two example rule
The first rule English say If I state western neighbor contains obstacle take one step east change state The second rule say If I state obstacle around move one step west stay state Taken together two rule use local information direct Picobot across open area westward boundary
Figure The result running Picobot section four rule
At step Picobot examines list rule written looking rule applies
A rule applies state part rule match Picobot current state surroundings part rule match current surroundings
What happens NO rule match Picobot current state surroundings
The Picobot simulator let know box robot stop running
Similarly one rule applies Picobot also complain
Figure show Picobot follows first rule match current state surroundings time step
But state
No rule specify Picobot action state
Just state represents go west task specify two rule make state go east task These rule transition back state creating infinite loop back forth across open row
Try
Note Picobot website start Picobot randomly selected empty cell
Note also Picobot start along top bottom wall rule match move
We remedy defect next section
Table Two equivalent formulation general behavior Picobot
Both set rule use two state wildcard character allows much succinct representation left right
By way sometimes might want Picobot move result applying rule
Rather specifying move direction E W N S may use letter X indicate stay
For example rule saying I state wall north move enter state The problem previous example rule specific
When going west really care whether wall present north south east
Similarly going east care neighboring cell north south west
The wildcard character indicates care surroundings given position N E W S
Table rule use wildcard direct Picobot forever visit vacuum row start
So far looked write rule make Picobot move
But trying solve problem Picobot usually helpful take global view Picobot accomplishing task translate approach rule
In word want develop algorithm allows Picobot accomplish desired task task usually cover entire room
In previous section Picobot modest goal simply moving back forth empty room
The algorithm accomplishing task following Now question becomes translate algorithm rule previous section As written difficult see connection step algorithm Picobot rule
We see Picobot need two state keep track direction moving step step still exactly clear algorithm translates precise rule
Essentially Picobot rule applies fashion
In word Picobot particular state see particular environment take certain action potentially enters new state
With minor modification rewrite algorithm follow Picobot rule structure directly Repeat following step forever Now see clearly direct translation step algorithm Picobot rule step algorithm translates directly rule Picobot state represents Picobot movingWest state represents Picobot moving East
Formulating algorithm way key writing successful program Picobot
Table rule direct Picobot visit entirety starting row
This section challenge develop set rule direct Picobot cover entirety empty rectangular room room Figure
The set work regardless big room regardless Picobot initially begin
Because Picobot distinguish unvisited cell may know visited every cell
The online simulator however detect report successful complete traversal environment
Try
You might find helpful simply play around modifying rule given
For example might start altering rule Figure neighboring row clearing current one
However idea might solve problem encourage plan algorithm express algorithm way easily translatable Picobot rule
Once developed Picobot program completely traverse empty room try write program complex environment
You see MAP option Picobot Web page scroll forward backward collection map created
You also edit map clicking cell mouse clicking empty cell turn wall clicking wall turn empty cell
Figure Picobot maze
One environment particularly interesting maze shown Figure
Notice maze wall connected outer boundary empty cell adjacent wall
A smaller maze property shown Figure
Any maze property completely explored simple algorithm called prefer
Imagine moment maze rather Picobot
In contrast Picobot clear sense direction pointing two hand
You start facing north right hand touching wall
Now visit every empty cell simply walking maze making sure right hand always touching wall
Pause moment convince true
Notice also algorithm visit every cell wall connected outer boundary shown maze Figure b empty cell adjacent wall shown Figure c
Figure A maze wall connected outer boundary empty cell adjacent wall
b A maze wall connected outer boundary
c A maze empty cell adjacent wall
Converting rule set Picobot rule interesting computational challenge
After sense direction right hand guiding around wall whereas Picobot neither hand sense orientation
To teach Picobot rule need use state represent direction Picobot pointing
It may seem impossibly large number situation must considered fact number situation finite actually quite small make possible program Picobot task
To get started seems pretty natural use four state represent Picobot pointing north south east west
Now need introduce rule allow Picobot behave right hand touch wall
Assume state arbitrarily choose correspond representing Picobot pointing north
Picobot imaginary right hand pointing east
If wall east none north rule would tell u take step north keep pointing north
Taking step north problem
Keep pointing north mean stay state On hand state wall east Picobot take step east think pointing east
Pointing east mean changing another state intended encode information
This fun challenge encourage stop try
Remember program work regardless Picobot start maze property wall connected outer boundary empty cell adjacent wall
Is possible write Picobot program fully explore room give
Surprisingly answer possible prove fact mathematically
Picobot computational capability enough guarantee coverage environment
However adding one simple feature Picobot programmed fully explore room
That feature ability drop sense pick marker along way
The fact computational challenge elementary Picobot lead u suggests computation computer far omnipotent
And time done reading book learned prove certain problem beyond limit computer solve

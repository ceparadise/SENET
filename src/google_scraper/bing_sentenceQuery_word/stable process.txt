In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

This topic contains reply voice last updated
I think funny keep debating around bush issue underlying theme undefined process stability
I recently posted Any one could tell I use CPK PPK
THKS following Montgomery state book Montgomery Douglas
Introduction Statistical Quality Control
Wiley Sons New York

ed
Pg Automotive Industry Action Group AIAG formed one objective standardize industry reporting requirement
He say recommend Cpk process control Ppk
Montgomery go get really personal emotional unique page book book I
He think Ppk baloney state Ppk actually step backwards
They waste engineering management effort tell nothing
While Montgomery get frustrated use Ppk poor job explaining stable process
I respect work alone even attempted try explain difference stable process one
This argument well numerous others find site regarding use Cpk Ppk metric validity Six Sigma shift process capability SPC etc
reflect lack definition process control
So define process stability process control
Perhaps agree given amount process shifting sigma
Perhaps agree stable process Cpk value
Perhaps combination event need take place three consecutive Cpk sample etc
Until define stable process doomed argue forever use statistical metric
For love science please help
Sincerely KN Kim It nice hear name
I hope came last course A
After last discussion opportunity I hope survive one dealing process stability
Well go two cent First I believe request mentioned using capability index measure stability
Unfortunately use process capability stability indicator done common practice
These index used compare variation process requirement process
To make comparison one assumes process operates consistent basis
A consistent process one variation time stable
So initial answer begs first question meant process Here I use word others probably concise elegant
In simple term stable process considered one chance variation exists
In word process exhibit systematic variation beyond certain degree called unstable
The degree possible systematic variation usually limited sigma standard error center
Please aware great controversy definition I sure hear shortly
Howerver definition I give based best recollection reference Shewhart
Even Shewhart close working partner Deming disagreed basic concept stable process alive
Deming known suggest thing stable process
From theoretical perspective I tend agree Deming
However practical basis I believe could define stable process economic perspective
This exactly Shewhart trying get publication The Economic Control Quality Manufactured Product If happen access ASQ Journal Quality Technology consider finding October issue Volume No

Pages review Controversies Contradictions Statistical Process Control presented William Woodall
From page prominent author provide comment insight Woodall article
It great read first part day attempt late night
Well I hope info help
Tell preparing another paper
If please feel free sen What great either opened interesting discussion real worm
First Deming disciple one saved M applying theory must understand thing truly stable process
Left unattended given enough time process deteriorate
The principle called entropy even affect human grow old die
However practical standpoint process stability something evaluated along process capability
One hardest thing get people new process LEAVE IT ALONE first determining process capability
Besides learning true variation also determining inherent stability long run without requiring either adjustment intervention
Many textbook state capability determined unstable process distribution
This incorrect
Theoretically determined TOTAL sigma using Chebychev inequality
I like draw case large normal distribution smaller normal distribution shown bump tail
Applying inequality find individual point fall sigma Ppk REGARDLESS shape distribution
It accident number accepted AIAG revised standard
Now stable process distribution modification Chebychev called state individual point fall sigma Cpk
Now I draw case normal distribution sigma shift
We put plain language follows If process one bull occasionally run china shop must Cpk Ppk better control
However bull Cpk Six Sigma suffice
Note principle apply REGARDLESS shape distribution
Obviously probability improve distribution appoaches normality Dear Ken You right I found excellent article suggested list highlight follows One purpose SPC distinguish common cause assignable cause variation order prevent overreaction underreaction process
The distinction two type variation context dependent may switch place time time
The distinction also change sampling one want react practical economic
A process statistical control probability distribution constant time
Deming advocate meeting variation Taguchi advocate variation reduction economically advantageous
It important distinguish control chart phase phase data analysis phase control
To view control charting equivalent hypothesis testing oversimplification Control limit X R chart assumes normality yet appears little effect Burr
probability SPC signal varies depending upon distribution shape degree autocorrelation data number sample
Wheeler state autocorrelation coef significant otherwise
shift mean normal distribution may also shifting normally process measure perfect
Discussion Bhote process control show good might capable based spec shown
ASQ reference Bhote CQE yet Bhote refers control charting waste time DOE low statistical validity
good point I support ASQ one New process adjustment strategy include multivariate variance component variable sampling technique etc
The consecutive point control chart method ineffective discontinued
The scope SPC broadened include understanding One communication problem researcher put narrow contribution context overall SPC strategy
KN Grant You present interesting proposition discussion
I curious use Chebychev always difficulty spelling
inequality property relation capability study
I certain I clearly understand tie original question What stable process Again seems invariably get discussion capability even question center around statistical I believe use capability index explicitly assumes variate distributed normally
Perhaps I incorrect assessment many reference seem indicate
Without assumption left wondering Cp Cpk estimate tell u using method determining capability
Not mention problem even assume normality probability computed high capability use tail distribution considerable estimation error occur
Could I suggest would like use Chebychev inequality property estimate report Pp Ppk process
These index explicitly require assumption normality
What think proposal
Ken Hi Kim Good hear
I confused two point ASQ reference Bhote CQE yet Bhote refers control charting waste time DOE low statistical validity
A waste time
Low statistical validity Wow
I guess I better read article find heck talking
The consecutive point control chart method ineffective discontinued
Wow
I guess I think anything effective show shift process average occurred well maybe eight row
Thanks bringing article look really interesting unusual
Jim
Had power brownout lately
Hope
I rechecked post I state application inequality required use TOTAL sigma estimate derived range type successive difference
I sure would think use sigma implies normality
This one great strength Chebychev inequality yes Russian spelled differently different author state ANY distribution probability point falling N sigma unit equal N squared
In order clarify point let explain BOTH example definition In first case I draw distribution unstable process large distribution smaller peak one tail
There may type instability resulting distribution I tell experience frustrating type deal run fine week two bull run china shop go away hope never see bull back another couple week Unless highly capable process Cpk stable busy segregating NCP either scrap rework effective search immediate cause NEVER find resource search root cause
Since distribution Chebychev inequality applies least data fall sigma
Now second case sigma theory come
By definition NEVER truly stable process exhibit wear break
This Six Sigma allows sigma shift
I draw case gradual shift two overlapping normal distribution result broad still strictly also notice two overlapping distribution ANY shape still create distribution
The modification inequality state unimodal distribution probability become sigma squared give identical probability sigma unit
Additionally There two property work favor
Probabilities increase distribution approach normality

Wheeler others proven empirically approximately ANY distribution fall standard deviation
Obv Thanks Kim Ken Jim good post
As far Keki Adi god bless worship Dorian
Dorian good guy knew
I never seen anybody better walking process cold seeing thing done
All stuff statistically valid
Email want know
Their tool powerful appropriate probably still process team environment computer software tool availble today I imagine would limit tool set Shanin tool
Precontrol using capbility data set green equal sigma yellow sigma Cp bad depend training appropriate reaction management normal SPC
Be soft Keki using Shanin tool far superior nothing
Gary You referred The consecutive point control chart method ineffective discontinued
Wow
I guess I think anything effective show shift process average occurred well maybe eight row There recent JQT article show old trend rule point steadily increasing decreasing ineffective replaced two Western Electric rule
point outside sigma
point outside sigma This article talking
Jim It difficult get real understanding Woodall journal article JQT others reponse reading Kim synopsis
In fact two key issue author agree upon Issues making decision chart data spoken personally Moving people away monotonically increasing decreasing trend rule value control chart
There considerable article last topic past year general consensus may yield desired significance signalling process change
Especially data greater
I instruct folk I work observe least monotonically increasing decreasing value control chart qualifying process change
Concerning Keki support Dorian All author made claim Gary Cone
Anything better nothing today better high performance computing tool work
They suggested working method stronger statistical foundation variable search method trying uncover variable suggested Dorian via Keki
Obviously charting approach still useful tool identifying input greatest level variation
However today simple nested ANOVA coupled quick analysis using Minitab characterize nicely component variation percent contribution total process variation
Again stuff NOT advanced
Rather today many would consider generally mainstream
Ken Wow Lots really super
THANKS
So
The problem I see help looking third order problem first second order thinking
There obviously many different way convince many different people process stability depending upon many different type situation
We either need universally acceptable solution supported respectable organization obvious third order solution via breakthrough fit type situation
For example ASQ ASA could state support AIAG definition process stability one within sigma regardless distribution shape process mean shifting
One example could descriptive formula allows anyone read fully understand process described comparison process
For example phase xx process measured xx capability xx stable xx time given xx number xx type distribution assumption
Any idea
You said For example ASQ ASA could state support AIAG definition process stability one within sigma regardless distribution shape process mean shifting
It would appear defining real conflict AIAG Six Sigma community
AIAG would support definition Six Sigma would restate within sigma regardless distribution shape process mean shifting sigma unit Could one still using second order thinking Six Sigma community
Remember neither one beleives process truly stable
The theorem I presented originally derived I working plant manager Deming advocate
We goal attaining Cpk critical process
Not saying every process I retired reason often interesting
I run process time tell experience anyone stop get Cpk missing real robust process
Are getting bogged terminology looking universal mathematical formula
Let come perspective statistic use whether control chart index mathematical model used describe predict process output
There discussion fit model based distribution variation
Stability fit model time
In process temporal variation greater others based internal constituent component complexity control strategy process
Then external process factor like organization approach continuous improvement process monitoring maintenance equipment training measurement system That estimate like sigma shift
It quick easy estimate temporal process shift
Is right
NO
There arrived number average
A practical set question ask applying could Does provide forecast reasonable fit
Is expense creating accurate forecasting model warrented value greater accuracy
How validate model forecasting power accuracy without waiting variability variability occur
Would model tend autocorrelating since would hope one would act upon forecast obtained order allocate improvement effort worthy process
So summary attempt construct forecasting model take account specific factor process may also change time apply constant simple formula like sigma shift
In end goodness fit time stability evaluation make process based solely process output certain amount time like control chart record
A mathematical formula based data like drawing line graph chart past region data collected
You speculate whether line straight fuzzy
But still speculation
So say management customer asks process stable
Personally I answer asked question Will process output continue essentially assuming significant change process To perfectly honest I could give requirement based experience example properly constructed control chart routinely show special cause point importance control charting measurement system etc
Accordingly definition stable process would first come capability I would expect see random special cause week two process left alone
But perfectly honest I also think period week may work industry heistant say would universal rule
One reasonable approach might look way scientist would look application using light
Theoretically light treated either wave particle
In practice however theory depends upon application studying
Therefore may completely appropriate say If process appears unstable appropriate time period base experience use sigma otherwise use sigma
Grant I must missed JQT article
Personally I find row side center line dead ringer process shift assuming autocorrelation noted Ken
I want give rule circumstance
I keep eye JQT article I plan go quality magazine I overrun tear keep good article toss rest
It fairly easy matter visualize problem trend rule point steadily increasing decreasing drawing point obvious trend jogging one point little bit
This really happens real Sometimes quite obvious trend common cause varaiation jog point enough break rule
It important REPLACE rule two Western Electric rule otherwise run risk many false signal
Also note WE rule use point either centerline
Again big deal reduces risk false signal
I think process considered stable given level subgroup point randomly distributed whithin control limit
Example level significance possible long run one point average may go limit without u jumping conclusion process OOC unless randomness hypothesis violated previous point show pattern
The Capability Coefficients statistic measure long term capability
I think two measure capability significantly different way test significance used Capabity Coefficients
certain period time conclude process also stable period time
I thought I clean lose end I prepare summarize different thought
I three related topic post made elsewhere site recently effort look
I great time learning lot thanks
Stable Process Posted By Rajanga Sivakumar Posted On Wednesday June Any process performs predictable manner period time known variance considered stable
However stable process necessarily mean best performing ideal process
If process improved extent natural variability remain could considered ideal process
This understanding may correct
Rjanga Sivakumar Stable process
Posted By SAMIR MISTRY Posted On Monday June stable process simple term process cause variation known acted upon process governed common cause variation output process fairly predictable
management decision requires increase capability process
Re Stable process
Posted By Ken Posted On Tuesday June I go far say cause variation known
That pretty extreme statement
I would tend say stable process one comprized mostly common cause variation opposed special cause variation
As hinted common cause variation comprized whole bunch source variation knowable
The whole idea process improvement understand many source variation try
Actually comment pretty consistent Japanese definition stable process
Discussed topic friend say Sayonara Yawl every time leaf work
Turns definition stable process process REQUIRES NO CONTROL CHARTS
Don mistake lack control
If mean asked person running process show chart think nut
Everything still controlled background
If certain limit exceeded unusual pattern detected operator alerted investigate
Also certain critical customer parameter still subject continual improvement team
Here example automotive industry everyone able relate When automaker first heard Japanese quality investigated found Japanese automaker gave worker ability stop assembly line whenever found slightest defect
The worker treated like hero cause investigated
What everyone overlooked simple statistic If defect level EVERY DEFECT special cause
No control chart required
Any process performs predictable manner period time known variance considered stable
However stable process necessarily mean best performing ideal process
If process improved extent natural variability remain could considered ideal process
This understanding may correct
Rjanga Sivakumar The process plot control chart

Collect data period time

Plot run chart

Collect minimum data set
preferably subgroup
Look special cause trend
If none exist plot control limit calculate capability later

Even phase control chart one need look special cause trend
These trend identified strong probability background tandem central limit theorm froms crux conrtol chart philosophy
As long process exhibit special cause trend process stable
Capability index Cpk index measuring process customer spec measure stability
You correct saying stable process necessarily capable
However careful saying stable process Shewhart Deming problem one
We also argue stable process UNPREDICTABLE
For example asked next point process I able tell even though I may confident likely within range value
I usually illustrate class referring thermostat I take regular reading kept getting number I would suspect either I reading set point thermostat broken On hand process special cause PREDICTABLE If I see sudden sharp change temperature I PREDICT confidence problem I search find
Also If I see following pattern Celsius class PREDICT confidence next reading
The problem making accurate prediction turn common cause variation UNPREDICTABLE part process
It may make reading look like problem fixed say read next reading Grant You raise interesting concept concerning definition stable unstable process
However I unable find reference claim supporting Shewhart Deming comment concerning stable predictable process
To best research Deming first one use word stable predictable together reference system process
Clearly book Out Crisis Deming appear problem using word together page state This plot run chart showed stable random variation average
The level mistake variation day day accordingly predictable
What mean
It mean stable system production defective I able find prose Shewhart using word Instead Shewhart used word chance cause conjunction process showing random variation within defined range
The nature Shewhart original work establish range operation underwhich economic control process could established
Your claim common chance cause variation unpredictable established fact
However definition stability constructed
Instead stability defined within statistical limit establishes demarcation explained predictable performance unexplained performance process
Within limit one claim process operates past continue operate way future
This claim prediction future behavior process
If process performs predicted one state established condition underwhich process may act predictable fashion
Under condition normally use term stable describe process
Again stability defined process exhibiting chance random variability
While variability presently unpredictable mean process operating unpredictable manner
Your example supporting predictable system assignable cause assumes apriori made change one input system
This example better explained using control theory
Ken Take look Figure Shewhart book Statistical Method Viewpoint Quality Control see I talking
Here Shewhart rearranged group drawing normal bowl ascending order magnitude
This data shown Figure conclusion make longer conclude data represents stable process BECAUSE THE SEQUENCE OF POINTS NO LONGER BEHAVE IN A RANDOM MANNER
Shewhart repeatedly emphasizes stability process showing histogram look like normal even show data set clealy normal like speed light Figure real key showing stability demonstrating random SEQUENCE measure show assignable cause present
The exercise I thermostat actually found one Deming book look one earlier work find
Obviously use thermostat back late approach similar
You seem missed point bumping set point see happen The reading I getting tell something unusual happening system I PREDICT confidence thorough search find cause
Grant I reviewed Figures reference cited Shewhart book
I read closely section associated Figure entitled The Specification Accuracy Precision Chapter IV
I believe Shewhart intent Figure illustrate difficulty judging whether grouping measure provides valid understanding accuracy precision true value prescribed requirement
Nowhere chapter I find word stable stable process
In constructing Figure Shewhart ordered random set data Figure could describe unusual run pattern
It clear new pattern developed ordered data would contain special cause existed natural stream
Shewhart used highly unusual run pattern Figure illustrate nonsense deriving meaningfull information accuracy precision process assignable cause present Surely would agree chance actually observing pattern shown Figure process exhibiting chance cause would astronomically I unclear Figures support claim process operating purely state chance cause variation could considered I agree simply developing normal histogram process data define stability process
However I believe I suggested past discussion
To determine economic stability process I would use tool Shewhart others prescribe process behavior control chart
I would contend many process theoretically exhibit extraordinary variation even control chart signal process stable
Again comment couched theoretically
In practical sense process satisfying basic Western Electric run rule would considered stable
Therefore practical perspective limit provide good guideline determining stability process
These guideline clearly supported many author Shewhart
I still sure recent response support original claim process assignable cause considered Perhaps I missed something perhaps dealing fine detail little use practitioner
Ken You apparently tangled theory missed practical application Shewhart chart
The discussion I presented earlier I use illustrate APPLICATION Control Charts A
A STABLE process ONLY common cause variation
really trying find discussion
Shewhart said look though drawn bowl normal random number I make offer I make student
If PREDICT next point x point series win free trip Los pay gamble Frankly get much reading Shewhart I see wasting time Six Sigma
I suspicion UNSTABLE process special cause variation
I make following PREDICTIONS
It going away
It may look like sooner later return keep returning cause found fixed

The average grunt floor find
Usually take team almost never easy since Shewhart time
Now really fry bacon XXX XXXXX expert
Insert name latest quality Sigma fit fine called say Process UNPREDICTABLE
This mean I calculate use Cpk etc
I know correct sigma etc
etc
Once grunt floor fixed special cause give call pay big buck XXX XXXXX Now see pay better Vegas
Now please take personally I trying knock someone make living
Just try say Shewhart Deming really supported I get writing support I said appear favor position
Grant I really wonder material get select worked
I never disagreed specific claim prediction efficiency within control limit
Obviously would difficult impossible predict next observation process operating solely chance variation
This observation associated claim trivial
I believe mutual confusion condition claim make prediction process
You claim I understand observation special cause observed control chart predict cause found
Again trivial observation provided resign NOT find associated cause process change time process data distributed normally
If process data NOT distributed normally Type I error higher
Again stability claim next point found somewhere within control limit process continues operate stable manner
It NOT claim determining exact location within control limit next observation
No one make claim
My definition predictability stable process based upon work Shewhart Deming Juran Feigenbaum Wheeler name
This well established I surprised see receive another understanding simple concept trip Las Vegas withstanding
May I suggest give Wheeler material look
He fine job translating Shewhart concept basic understanding
The track follow Shewhart Deming Wheeler
I usually work far harder I desire understand Shewhart perspective I trained area Shewhart
Try Wheeler clear concept Ken Opened Wheeler Advanced Topics Statistical Process Control even get first chapter We trying find exact model describe process trying determine process fit least approximately broad model RANDOM Futhermore Out Crisis Deming point practice opposed mathematical theory hypothesis EXACTLY STABLE PROCESSES DO NOT Entropy relentless
Because every process naturally inevitably migrate toward STATE OF Still looking something support position I still got another page go
Could give hint
Grant I sure close discussion clear note I try
Exactly stable
Please feel free point discussion note I submitted using You right never know exact model supporting process want control
But goal using SPC control chart
Wheeler pretty good job dispelling need process behave normally let alone exactly normal reference Avoiding Chaos Part II
In identifies unique probability distribution concludes adequately supported using limit detecting change process
Notice I NOT trying describe distribution supported OR supported using limit
It critical
Again concern comment centered around claim process exhibiting ONLY common cause varition Secondly process exhibiting special cause variation IS Did I get message wrong
If I apologize
If could direct reference provides exact language I could adequately review merit statement
So far none reference given provide support
Remember Shewhart operated data make appear special cause illustrate point
Thus reference Shewhart adquately support claim
I glad success student
Like I using stuff well year
Been teaching industrial college setting
It seems read material get different understanding
Usually situation come using language describe different thing
I willing accept explanation close discussion thread
What think
If would like correspond via email I try reply time permit
I believe hashed discussion enough Ken I agree time shut discussion
I repeat one key reason control chart work floor Common Cause variation unpredictable Special Cause variation predictable
Whenever try treat way screw process
Obviously get reasoning statement thermostat example infinite discussion number angel currently dancing Deming Shewhart head god never use listen wisdom trench
You looking card even noticing Spades Clubs red Hearts Diamonds much I
Well I count post including one printed page point text
The sad thing closer today defining stable process week ago discussion started
From really global perspective I think accept definition possibly exist A stable process one contains common cause variation
Why allow reality definition stable process without lot debate
We thinking outside box
My next step Quality guru would start placing key point sticky note organize category using affinity diagram order make effort think way
Talk later
Sincerely KN If saying stable process common cause variation
And also saying process common cause variation possibly exist
Can conclude thing stable process
This would certainly consistent Deming Wheeler viewpoint
Same
No cat tail Any cat one tail cat
Any cat tail I really think beaten topic death yet
There still hope couple squirrel jump another branch find new tree Saw reference Taguchi method thought I might make run shaking branch little
DiBono say get squirrel jump enough branch eventually realize tree
If squrrel think tree whole universe Taguchi theory say two type variable define system
Parameters level affect process variation

Parameters process variation unaffected level
The idea behind robust design set Type parameter level minimizes total process variation
Type parameter used control adjust process
Can assume Taguchi would define stable process robust
level chosen maintain process target minimum variance per Wheeler definition
Does imply truly stable process would
Well full summary post I promised first step
I reviewed post come realize fit two global method category defining stable process
The first category using statistic define stable process
Most post related method given seems controversy
method likely include Distribution type importance Variation type importance Entropy philosophical potential The second category using economics
We discus much make lot sense
Shewhart mentioned taking line argument defining stable process
I suppose process consistently produce good economic result relative expectation specification could considered stable regardless much type variation within expectation
Why accept economic model definition
Is simple
Can find hybrid definition includes statistical measurement well
We making progress
Thanks
KN Good summary excellent point
You may found good ally Shewhart
Here say economic role statistic Statistical Methods From The Viewpoint Quality Control
Chapter In future statistician mass production must simply study discover measure effect existing chance cause system must devise mean modifying cause system bring result desirable efficient use material
He must satisfied simply measure demand good must help change demand showing among thing close tolerance range improve quality good
He must content simply measure production cost must help decrease You also find another friend Taguchi demonstrated minimizing variation minimize economic cost
Interesting Shewhart mentioned tolerance wonder meant thing
My group defines stability absent special cause
That using control chart process question guide special cause present
There several boundary define special cause point excess control limit seven row mean etc
etc
We recommend using four constraint time reacting increase risk tampering
Once special cause identified explained removed process stable
With regard capability group defines use index follows ppk used process mean centered process spec
cpk used whether process mean centered process spec
This cpk equal lesser cp upper cp lower calculated independently
I hope prof helpful work u

Actually I really complaining real Ken Allen character I think sometimes responds message agreeing adamantly course using name Ken
In case important
With regard special cause typically stick basic set test special cause bound test number run test length run test trend test
We realize validity test opposed use advocate applying four test data set
Minitab I believe offer eight different test checkk special cause
Applying nine increase alpha risk
With regard capability measurement black belt work process key measure specification limit case lieu coming spec sake coming disregard capability index measure improvement effort
In case viable specification limit exist used capability calculation monitored applied measure project success periodically assessed ensure continued relevance

Use nine sigma instead six sigma
Bob Interesting comment group us various index computing Do basis Grant ur I mean Bob using index fashion
You look one earlier post thread
I derived capability distribution using Chebychev inequality sigma modification inequality sigma
Absolutely next last paragraph Chapter I I turn page Chapter II say Grant stupid look face
Obviously chapter chapter II chapter right
Really glad next chapter would looking chapter LOL Sorry error
Sounds like description part Six Sigma movement
Perhaps Shewhart well ahead Admirable comeback

I teaching test plus one one ever heard another story
I thinking changing approach
I running reference say point trend rule dangerous
BTW Will also glad post risk associated run rule anyone interested
Recently need look Western Electric Handbook
I recently read good definition along case study may clarify situation
This information taken STATISTICAL THINKING IMPROVING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE Roger Hoerl Ronald Snee Duxbury Press
I paraphrase comment distinction stable unstable process typically done Run Charts Control Charts
Stability genberal implies lack special cause case improve process fundamental change change made process
A system Common Causes typically characterize stable process
In contrast instability implies presence special cause
To improve unstable process need identify eliminate root cause instability
A system Special Causes typically characterize unstale process
Finally finished thinking Shewhart comment narrowing tolerance think shake tree little
One biggest problem one product line definition tolerance
Whenever started process definition customer requirement quite simple
Determine process sigma control chart
Multiply process sigma Customer Tolerance

Cp Cpk always acceptable
Although may seem stupid today beat heck old way send product customer said range individual value initial run became customer tolerance
sigma lucky Now hardest part getting EVERYONE STOP
recalculating specification improve process INCLUDING THE CUSTOMER
This also make thing tough company sigma sigma capability target
Problem Deming Disciple learn exceed customer requirement delight customer

Personally I think also follows Taguchi loss function
Accordingly later week I post two derivation Taguchi function panic simple need math understand
At extreme another product line fantastic job determining customer requirement deliberately tweaking pilot plant process determining customer response
Only downside product line real knack manager could creative determing customer Cpk needed could get
This one reason I caution everyone plant manager target Cpk

Several response subject seem confusing stability capability
Stability simply absence assignable cause variation including conformance Western Electric rule established Walter Shewart
It voice process entirely independent specification
Commom cause variation inherent process currenlty exists random thus virtually impossible know component type variation
Assignable cause variation name implies variation identified
Once identified cause assigned eliminated achieve process stability
Capability specification come picture
Capability measure well process operating term meeting customer requirement
It obvious one must sure stability process prior using capability index
A process display statistical control still meet customer spec
In case process change order
This change could shift mean reduction common cause variation depending exactly process meeting requirement
Taguchi famous loss function good treatment subject
We need reinvent wheel concept well defined Deming Shewhart Taguchi
Another extremely good reference subject Donald Wheeler Understanding Statistical Process Control
Stability mean predictability
In word based today data I predict process tomorrow degee confidence
Each every process characteristic within process need considered individually
Questions need asked What shape distribution How critical characteristic Am I concerned small process shift large one Is serial correlation data others
Such question asked answered buy team working guidance someone understands important ask question
I enjoyed following discussion train see previous posting
What disturbs fighting position seems going
I think question raised much important answer
I hope keep asking question
I remember someone saying scientific method quest prove wrong
If keep asking question get closer Deming state profound knowledge

This derivation require draw thing go along
First easy matter classroom demonstrate perfectly stable give someone dice single die let roll
Demonstrates property stable process
I easily create control chart Range I take group sample
It work forever

It unpredictable
If try make adjustment based last roll make thing worse
I standing offer trip Los Vegas anyone prove wrong
This also applies run within limit
Too many I get suspicious change die

Special cause predictable
We use die determine long cut piece standard paper
Then I casually switch legal paper
Next I switch die
Control chart ALWAYS tell something wrong

If plot distribution rectangular start drawing
Now take average report customer could say sound good After getting shock agree
Problem got either scrap rework reject

It improved
Just replace die poker chip one side
Improve even chip either side like coin
That good met measurement capability
Now people think process run like real life goalpost mentality Product either awful outside spec perfect inside spec
Doesn take long someone figure learn awful prodict made perfect remeasuring resampling
You show chart drew labeling vertical scale Taguchi disagreed proved everyone else already knew Product go like vertical scale awful poor fair good better perfect
If draw spec curve peak exact center look familiar
Where spec come
Taguchi said POINT AT WHICH CUSTOMER COST became unacceptable
flip curve upside label vertical scale There still cost customer inside spec minimum make perfect product
Now IMPORTANT PROPERTY normal I First I wanted say purpose post agree Mike case someone misunderstood
Secondly add part derivation got cut last message
In case minimum cost lie center distribution normal distribution provides perfect solution problem producing perfect product important property normal distribution MOST distribution lie mean
You look God derivation Taguchi loss function say I When normal distribution God side
MOST product perfect long I stay target
This second derivation Taguchi loss function
It applies specification based trick good salesman know instinctively
Let suppose I salesman trying convince one customer need buy IDENTICAL product
All I get customer comparison get business
Here work Draw two identical normal distribution labeled MY PRODUCT YOUR PRODUCT
Now draw line center label side
There four possibility customer make comparison My product average product sale My Product average product sale My product average product sale My product average product
got business
Now suppose I learn enough process REDUCE common cause variation I well product PERFECTLY target
Erase MY PRODUCT distribution leave center line This leaf two possibilites My Product average product sale My Product average product
got business
In orther word I reduce variation I take business
Now I learned enough process reducing variation I also able MOVE product centerline normal move much pick LOT sale sigma unit give old process already naturally capable making occasional part level This theoretical case actually happened Ford subcontracted transaxles Mazda noticed Mazda transaxles significantly fewer customer complaint
I privy great line discussion terminology posting guideline conversational direction pointing Ken Bob Grant I like highlight order maintain course progress towards goal saving future science heated debate stable process
First string summarized Kerri Simon Directional topic explore follows
What economic property stable process

What property unstable process

How would define measurement capability

What experience supporting capability measurement process
Here highlight post guideline discussion
The discussion limited topic involve exchange negative remark kind

Let try keep discussion based known understanding hearsay

When applied statistical method various technique provided accompanied supporting reference includes author title page number

Any method suggested without reference considered personal opinion unless derivation made known reference

Personal opinion experience considered theory

We keep mind primary goal discussion come common understanding language topic
Any discussion point line central topic add confusion misunderstanding
I hope start fresh idea
KN Thanks direction forward
You look around little derivation I refer thread
Note proof Taguchi loss function depend upon making perfect product
Question ideal really possible
This really possible define PERFECT product INDISTINGUISHABLE measured product appear IDENTICAL measured used customer
Now basis defining CAPABLE process Definition A capable process approach limit perfect product
Please note NOT enter definition
Tolerances We assume customer expectation set tolerance regardless much improve process
Measurement capability limit improve measured

Cp Cpk Sigma Just historical way keeping score
Stable Process A stable process necessarily capable
We still searching definition
Now I previously defined process stability term Cpk requirement Stable process require Cpk Cpk
The next challenge see stable process defined without invoking Cpk
Kim I glad see suggested guideline discussion topic I emailed discussion board
I would suggest open new central topic suggestion follow question topic item
Perhaps could convince folk iSixSigma post discussion guideline Articles Area site
Then would need point link introducing new topic
Do think reasonable suggestion
Ken Dear Ken Yes idea page guideline copied email thread incl paranoia sound like something I would I charge site
However I pleased far management site optimistic iSixSigma continue grow maintain well respected status without guideline slightly additional information
KN Excellent point Grant would use Cpk define stability stated independent customer requirement
A process control measure tracked form stable distribution time
A simple control chart serf purpose
Customer requirement needed make determination process stability
Cpk measure goodness process term ability satisfy customer
In word much aforementioned stable distribution fit within customer specification
It understanding Taguchi went one step explain must stabilize process improve ability meet customer expectation false assume incur loss fall within specification
As demonstrated earlier message process miss target loss occurs even product acceptable customer

Great discussion
You guy shaking rust neurotransmitter
I earlier post I provided definition stable process pretty similar way characterized give someone dice single die let roll
Demonstrates property stable process
I easily create control chart Range I take group sample
It work forever

It unpredictable
If try make adjustment based last roll make thing worse
I standing offer trip Los Vegas anyone prove wrong
This also applies run within limit
Too many I get suspicious change die

Special cause predictable
In class I use die determine long cut piece standard paper
Then I casually switch legal paper
Next I switch die
Control chart ALWAYS tell something wrong

If plot distribution rectangular
Now take average report customer could say sound good After getting shock agree
Problem got either scrap rework reject even though process stable improved
Now real life I also look
About point showing special cause
Statistically I expect see many false alarm
Also I learned accumulating alarm time applying Pareto principle provide important clue source common cause variation
Accordingly first working defintion stable process Predictable limit time completely random within limit percent special cause indicated
The variable defined length time process need stable answered leaving process alone seeing long output remains rule week I think work every process
Another Thought
Most would seem agree capable process one high CpK value better dictionary definition capable process would capable produce one good part consistently
If produce one part tweaking capable producing good part etc
With mind Grant I reached agreement stable process necessarily capable capable process necessarily I got headache KN We need remember advantage stable process variable measurement predictable
An unstable process allow reliable hypothesis testing common variation root cause diagnosis process mean median standard deviation shifting one measurement next meaning unaccounted variable model
I always used standard test special cause variation
As listed previous posting
Can give Section name reference Montgomery
I Edition would like try find clearly page numbering different
true
The purpose whole thing called stability make sure process remains within control limit
I would say please correct I If consecutive datapoints fall within control limit I say confidence process control First variation factor defined carefully calculating trying calculate stability process This simple task
For ex
certain type experiment accept operator variation factor check assumption regularly
Second known variation factor noise factor must defined
You decide factor control simply pareto analysis
You expect prose stable make prose stable
Many statistical assumption fit process control problem
Briefly process control stable
A stable process one contain common cause variation
Hello I would like know AIAG definition process stability one within sigma regardless distribution shape process mean shifting
Where I GET Sigma process control
Anilkumar Any data outside control limit classifies process unstable Aush That definition eliminate process ever stable
Mike stable free variation due special cause
Stop
This definition also eliminate process stable one allways variation due special cause
A proces time time go control propper action followed small amount small special variation get detected control chart stable one may acceptably close stable
A perfect state control never attainable
The goal perfection reasonable economical state control
For practical purpose controlled process one chart never go control
If would seriously question whether operation charted
For shop purpose controlled process considered one small percentage poins go uot control point followed proper action Western Electric Co Inc Statistical Quality Control Handbook
Sorry Unable process request time error error Hello friend I think I give example live situation never take example
I unknown person certainly interest verify sure credential reliability feature
That whether I person whose information could relied upon
In term process characteristic whether I centered behaviour reliability trust
Once done take information seriously
Is
If much understood proceed situation arrived starting trusting word
But situation wiser continue believing word rest life
If could cheated face negative situation one time
Agree Now done
It would fair perform sample check time time ensure duped
This type check fall cpk take subgroup averaging check sample size say
This check tell though Mr Anand stable process time lying ie say process capability index time check centred thas giving low reliability Please remember ppk study piece piece taken consideration whereas cpk study consecutive subgroup pc taken consideration
Hence ppk study comprehensive thorough
This reason customer ask first carry ppk study prove stability process ask switch cpk cpk talked manufacturing servicing process mean part checked population falling outside USL another example intelligent smart person behaves perfect Ppk right time check might influence liquour behavior may cpk gone conclude might say whenever introduced brand new process New Product Development need perform ppk Process Performance Check process confirmed centred behaving perfectly normal time switch cpk studiesIf I able make understand extent please revert back email ID anandqgp
I shall yoursHS Anand Actually exact quantifying value varies process process set specification example different semiconductor process automobile process
Whatever process variable within specification limit process capability Cpk considered stable But wait minute Boeing us phrase control stable process obviously consider control one requirement stable process
What else
Also I using individual X chart Boeing want calculate Cpk using minimum jof data point
Can process considered stable data point
How many point necessary
Is documentation back
Thanks alan WOW
Folks winner
The new posting response record SIX YEARS
I salute It sound like Boeing trying tell want use chart sample subgroup instead chart currently using
The reason shifting chart get much better estimate cause chart chart
With chart take point calculate capability analysis Cp Cpk Pp Ppk confidence
With chart take point capability analysis made confidence
There hundred reference talk
Look left side screen an select Statistics Analysis Quality Directory
Also talk representative Boeing ask I said want
I think find
I would love use chart fjive piece subgroup manufacturing system fairly unique many part production rate part per month
If I wait month data So Individual X chart
I thinking Stability calibration MSA mean consistency time
So process control sufficient data point indication process shift considered stable
Alan If making one part per month undoubtedly inspection
Why need capability analysis condition
Even chart need year data sufficient number point adequate capability analysis
Are part Boeing want capability analysis
Control charting capability analysis designed give confidence part inspect likely specification
Since inspection trying find analysis
Doing control charting capability analysis part produce month useless exercise tell nothing given take year get anything preliminary answer
It hard believe Boeing actually want
You correct
You know I know auditor Boeing Internal boss want please auditor
I mind recording plotting data internal value toBoeing Advanced Qualtiy System requirement I required gage R R costly investigation calculated Cpk le Cpk based five data point process control stable The relief I see determine proff process stable
Therefore I need documented official
definition process stability back judgement process stable data point
A process must control conduct capability analysis
A stable process process control common cause variation
The last thing want prove process unstable
To say process unstable make unpredictable
You Boeing telling control limit marked PRELIMINARY report include fact control limit based le point misleading conclusion drawn control limit may lead incorrect action
That said must decide whether want put statement report
If boss really want bend auditor action could career limiting
Now let talk MSAs
I got impression already making part already delivering Boeing
If MSA using part measuring system prior final inspection really know shipped good part
Without MSA determine measurement system capable discriminating good part bad part
Since make month getting MSA done difficult need least perferably part perform useful MSA
The question make month customer need take month make one
You take account much part cost need set MSA
I hope help little
Now I bit confused comment
I always thought process stable special cause variation removed left common cause
Thus process stable predictable time
I also thought stable nothing spec limit used chart
You talk spec limit start discussing Outside academic setting I see value debating nuance idea forever grounded practicality varying assumption What measure method device sampling plan subgroup strategy sample frame etc inexact calculation made investigator much greater relevence toward reducing uncertainty process debating ad nauseum detail arent operationally relevent
Work build theory knowledge process business
PDCA
Are better today yesterday
Now
I got ta get back work
But I know
The name say
The fact responded year old post say even
Keep working unless actually contribute timely manner
Darth Actually responded yr old
make even le useful
I suppose could look responding year old post
However could also viewed nothing continuation tradition
Other outlier Anikumr Aush Carnell Gabriel Emre RR Suhail post odd numbered year
Since coming close perhaps recent poster wanted make sure would go unrepresented
Holy cow I thought I much time I still convinced Katie post one two day get u going posting volume
She one morning plain idiotic posted name containing consonents
Then post one afternoon relating oldest thread find moment
And keep falling
Then long see another post asking Lt sigma shift

Worse I often giving tidbit advice noticed overall picture speak lacking
My advice sometimes misunderstood neglected otherwise ignored I often wondered I could nail

Process stability one important concept Six Sigma methodology quality improvement methodology matter
Stability involves achieving consistent ultimately higher process yield application improvement methodology
Does process need stable order black belt improve
Try educating child fit joy emotional distress time many youngster
To help understand process stability also known variation reduction important illustrative concept Montgomery state book Montgomery Douglas
Introduction Statistical Quality Control
Wiley Sons New York

ed
Pg Automotive Industry Action Group AIAG formed one objective standardize industry reporting requirement
He say recommend Cpk process control Ppk
Montgomery go get really personal emotional unique page book book I
He think Ppk baloney state Ppk actually step backwards
They waste engineering management effort tell nothing While Montgomery get frustrated use Ppk poor job explaining stable process
I respect work alone even attempted try explain difference stable process one
This argument well numerous others find site regarding use Cpk Ppk metric validity Six Sigma shift process capability SPC etc
reflect lack definition process control
So define process stability process control
Perhaps agree given amount process shifting sigma
Perhaps agree stable process Cpk value
Perhaps combination event need take place three consecutive Cpk sample etc
Until define stable process doomed argue forever use statistical metric
For love science please help Posted Ken A stable process simple term process cause variation known acted upon process governed common cause variation output process fairly predictable
management decision requires increase capability Posted Samir Mistry I think process considered stable given level subgroup point randomly distributed within control limit
Example level significance possible long run one point average may go limit without u jumping conclusion process OOC unless randomness hypothesis violated previous point show pattern
The Capability Coefficients statistic measure long term capability
I think two measure capability significantly different certain period time conclude process also stable period Posted Dragos Bandur So
The problem I see help looking third order problem first second order thinking
There obviously many different way convince many different people process stability depending upon many different type situation
We either need universally acceptable solution supported respectable organization obvious third order solution via breakthrough fit type situation
For example ASQ ASA could state support AIAG definition process stability one within sigma regardless distribution shape process mean shifting
One example could descriptive formula allows anyone read fully understand process described comparison process
For example phase xx process measured xx capability xx stable xx time given xx number xx type distribution assumption
Any idea Posted Kim Niles And usual test process stability
Several type condition exist indicate process control
We become familiar following control chart test answer yes process unstable Process stability need operational definition
Luckily least two No signal appropriate process behavior chart
control chart Ppk Cpk Pp Cp Of course signal process behavior chart necessarily mean process control
false signal possible sure process stability signal
Whether process economical
Cp Pp high enough question completely separate stability
Why I need answer Yes rule Stability
Can I minimum rule answered Yes go ahead process improvement

submitted I reading article speaking English major I saw quote caught guard In fall English major among
undergraduate
That nearly equal total computer science major
Five year later computer science total doubled
The total English fallen percent
Is Computer Science getting flooded enough demand keep increased amount CS Majors
Post comment
Let say yr CS engineering longer lucrative
What available today would pick instead
It going weird time computer sort technology longer needed
But personally I go English Lit Zoology thing I would picked I wanted degree land stable job
Life dumb
I wish time thing really feel like
It going weird time computer sort technology longer needed We continue use next year
I put prediction
I think software field formally fork CS SE
SE CS electrical engineering Physics
Salaries peak level somewhere around electrical computer engineer earns
Total software job least million BLS say currently million
All take place next year
The industry I see transforming time period healthcare transportation energy entertainment
To oversimplify large amount stuff need made efficient eg
better analysis medical history efficient mass transportation system efficient electricity made accessible user system adaptable quick change eg
traffic management vehicle crash
There even automation
Imagine world car train airplane ship little terrible
Software engineer mechanic automated world
This automated world barely fetus
More icing cake
I believe thanks recent collapse law market shortage technically trained law professional next year
With increased automation expect legal concern come front
A CS person JD may hot commodity year
Finance statistic field also offer opportunity
The name game next year adaptability flexibility
Personally I see CS one best field best offer two trait schooling directly feed industry academia
Low barrier entrepreneurship
Excellent leverage bachelor level limited current need terminal master
Yes please
I late I betting big CS I know pay well even I still leverage career
new BA
Law finance professional service like accounting consulting still undergone recognisable software transformation
The amount stuff still get worked vast number human operating basic Word Powerpoint industry
Law beginning undergo transformation
There startup space popping ediscovery
Yeah ediscovery around really lowest hanging fruit sorting literally million email
It really cutting paralegal grunt attacking main area lawyer proliferate
I lawyer I tell every page deal still done dozen people typing Word doc
What sort legal technology would like see future
Let say I spent huge amount time thinking partly even I could come answer I never invest trying make business barrier entry
But I think twofold following premise deal boilerplate really hard really susceptible fuck ups
Like number deal fell piece court looked went court Lehman went BK fertile ground LOTS argument abt holding pot multiply dealsQuatity dealsValue well huge number fall apart language drafting incredibly difficult
There JSHint lawyer
The dream would computer assisted drafting better copy paste fashion
That would also help enormously doc
Every deal I sent came year old doc spend day reading even though standard doc find greamlins
Imagine computer program could read print result array tabulate
The big issue really barrier entry
guy hell guy
could probably solve weekend
But barrier entry industry really powerful first classic old standard war penicious enough b actual economics lawfirms junior monkey working deal lucrative firm
It big big problem I think pileup dead body hopeful startup founder ventured dark valley
If deep exposure inside finance law beast dense read perfect nutshell lumpiness go system find anywhere
We continue use go extinct stupid religion win ban everything
Hey guy question
What BA
Business administration
Bachelor Art degree focused liberal art
Software eating world consider lucky english major useless eater far I concerned
Consider lucky someone poured resource keeping idiocy alive Go ahead switch major english communication jackass
Lol
I seen people shred maturity kind mindset
Maybe grow learn useful diversity world
lol
I rest case Damn dude youtube video random website come Google
I rest case year old would believe thing indicate worth career degree
Grow bud
Wrong
Liberals art humanity rapidly becoming obsolete appear economic growth inhibitor western society
Plumbing carpentry city work Plumbing good choice tradeoff trade try become skilled
From EMT electrician friend quickly rose rank level close Master tell thing You cost much local city department union office demand little like master per dept union local level
The newbie get brought apprentice make great money learning trade awesome side coin
Once apprenticeship end become junior journeyman sure exact rank level hold whatever job get shit ton experience ultimately try luck business amiable personable enough
City contract somehow become really inflated I guessing labor law legislation sort overhead
A skilled craftsman come home job work leaf possibly another job mess around
Construction attracts lot people mess around though
They might hard work lot work much back little brain
Not mention fact construction worker standing around stuff actually happen
The lack coordination I seen city project would completely unacceptable guy taught
There shortage blue collar work
I would recommend anyone pick vocational skill side
Helps save money well build alternative skill
Prostitution
I see many option someone skill set
deleted Damn I screwed
Maybe people pay real boob luxury item
LMAO
I know saying still messed
Uhmm ehmm need pimp
Uhmm ehmm need pimp
Wow even sound like one
What sad I actually pretty good lot stuff anything anyone would pay
Except skill
Those gold
Actually I probably make decent I fell right opportunity
Not sure worse
Medicine
I actually genuinely interested med school left I young know I really wanted doctor I liked science care aspect
I also found programming similar time figured I fuck CS I year wasted grumpy medicine would set back least year also say doctor always doctor I shiver thought thing decade
Current aspiration combine CS I still undecided medicine
Maybe I able get away working scientific health industry CS work
Sometimes I think right major would biochemistry learning programming side I also shiver thought almost mandatory PhD postdoc I chose CS place bargain ability learn enough biological science spare time get something interesting
Machines replace percent doctor healthcare future driven entrepreneur medical professional according Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla
There thing like IBM Watson Apple Health Xprize tricoder working towards If low pay hospital work automated high pay safe This could long way something bear mind I knew IBM Watson
We president innovation IBM boasted
They correct diagnosis almost instantly even complicated case doctor lucky nowadays
I consideration maybe doctor program well someone must medical knowledge equipment program I see programming device well thorough grounding physiology etc
But overall people expressed way two kind people program robot thing weigh everything carefully right side history
I go dentistry
It long journey I take bunch undergraduate course
However I think worth long run exactly emergency situation like I try save much money
I basically prepared anything life throw right
That said I really think top developer suddenly get laid become underpaid
I expect case see situation like law experienced lawyer still much enough room horde inexperienced fresh graduate
probably learn modeling
Still CS
Computer science
This I want
Just like art major willing job I willing take pay drop I want
deleted Sure
The question mostly option longer good option etc
coming list help decision making process
deleted I would throw finance
deleted Yeah I thinking along line job pay well kinda totally realm c
Like finance go ib move private equity example
Although may require ton work terrible hour path towards high paying career
deleted Haha I agree
Even ib extremely hard get
Both quite competitive due compensation
That good personal list
Mine would Physician Assistant Finance instead
Any engineering instead ISyst probably trade two
deleted It feed directly job schooling sometimes extra cert
deleted I would problem
Only concern may flexible
deleted deleted If believe report people running hiring interview CS position huge fraction applicant still ca code way paper bag
deleted mind asking threshold
I know lot people say ca code way bag exactly mean
This thread
Oh stirring pot lol Well hopefully mean FizzBuzz ca logical extension aka interview code question
I studied as interview I NYC early year got asked level code question merge array could
Normally I homework assignment extra project go well beyond posted requirement crazy interview pressure follow natural curiosity
Add extra interview ingredient nerve brain mental loop find chief excuse
SINCE THEN I pushed learn new tech desired field better skill instead
The deeper I dig I remind I got field
And git best friend
D No really mean ca even FizzBuzz
deleted I taken intro programming course I FizzBuzz minute without looking answer
How challenging simple loop properly formed statement
I agree I sophomore CS student close reason FizzBuzz took longer minute I thought right answer simple famous question
Because either got school paying someone work stole lot code understand
Just wait end working offshore programming company make million yet single employee could FizzBuzz whiteboard
And weep maintain code
I find hard believe due lack evidence
If graduate bad popularly claimed kind cheating pervasive would nearly impossible hide
Where
The hard part getting order conditionals correct
You see poster thread got wrong I seen smart people real life get wrong well
They generally immediately see mistake though
Make sure actually tested implementation ensure got order correct
It hard elegantly P This third stupid
Edit Fixed code get Your solution also wrong
FYI third statement never get hit condition already covered first two condition meaning FizzBuzz never get printed
hahahahahahahaha oh god thread talking people ca FizzBuzz
someone This course based resume
No one time fact check resume looking
I assume people lying
It baffle
I hard time believing anyone ca fizzbuzz I fuck personal project awful GPA I find easy
That unbelievable
My CS even student FizzBuzz month
But nevertheless every thread FizzBuzz always someone post incorrect solution
That sufficient proof personally whole thing farfetched sound
FizzBuzz surprisingly complicated easy problem get right order loop index right
I actually understand someone could figure fizzbuzz took programming class like loop conditionals really fundamental programming concept could understand I ca imagine passing programming test school even failing class Why get field
Lol guy could code way bag I mean I asked like write process scheduler would compute set task run parallel given dependency graph lmao got topological sort five minute typo loser
And even go Stanford like hell
No matter low think threshold lower still find people ca meet
I interviewed someone could come syntax define empty function
Language choice
I assume resume le honest
I totally agree I mean good programmer sometimes take work I going solve problem using code
Very rarely I think spot done
I software engineering
It entirely possible graduate excellent GPA typing report
Are accounting people interview well
I tend get lot anxiety freeze sometimes result blanking really basic algorithm stuff I know
I surprised multiple occasion student top university ca program way bag
I ca say I surprised
Few CS program teach code let alone code well focus theory mathematical logic
Most algorithm class instance done paper pencil implementation component
The course programming class project component usually provide incubated setting rarely address realistic constraint
You easily go top college program without learning important skill
The new grad perform well graduate one attained skill whether work experience internship personal project etc
I saying learn important stuff school
Or student terrible programmer fact I know excellent one
However even course I felt expanded programming knowledge gain based largely interest exploring subject beyond class requirement
Few CS program teach code let alone code well Is really rare
I mean well sure pretty hard teach academic setting
But would essentially impossible get CS program without able code
There dozen programming project scattered across required class
In one class one test previous project scratch internet access hour know project ahead time second test TAs putting bug code project written find fix time limit hour
deleted Except fact lot competition internship even
When I school I turned internship lack experience Silly impression point internship I imagine gotten harder
How long ago
Currently every tech company several internship slot open hard find something read Cracking Coding Interview book
About year ago
I think maybe difference ton startup open ton intern theory though
The difference person anecdotal experience
What experienced may necessarily majority CS student experienced year ago
If internship thought prerequisite career software people looking internship intern application lot people fucked
deleted I think also going see trend towards hiring experienced people pigeonhole increase
Right web mobile company happy consider candidate related stack realize language framework skill somewhat fungible
As good developer currently graduating acquire experience market loosens I think company start get pickier candidate making experience specific language framework hard requirement like many system embedded company already
Agreed feel finding work tolerate enjoy much work keep roof head
I think tipping point huge growth explosion CS industry
Consider thing decade ago fully electronic purview software developer
I much worried professional driver factory worker countless number position soon automated
Their one truly risk
Remember predicted
Those likely happen ever
Ha
Love Simpson wisdom
A lot people enrolling
Dropout rate high CS major
Also skyrocketing affect bit fact internet bust enrollment rate crashed hard
Overall CS major uptrend handful engineering major
STEM major general seeing overall uptrend
I see graduating rate CS skyrocketing definition skyrocketing anyway
Where draw line increase rate versus skyrocketing
Would healthy CS related major career rate
As far job prospect source project good job growth field
US Bureau Labor Statistics project CS related career project positively
In nutshell continue many company give good paying job student combination decent grade relevant experience cool project worked
And careered people still plenty mobility senior developer architect lead management role fancy
I like argument well else going study accounting
relative job prospect another field primary factor choosing CS
Do CS interested
And ARE interested CS work hard get decent project worry get decent job
But IF really start ranking major best prospect future bet still CS
Is like hipster thing think negatively CS gotten popular
More student enrolling CS
That good thing mean meeting classmate idea shared research work done CS
You get meet student increase chance someone network get job may help YOU get job
That GOOD thing
Companies paying good salary even entry position going change foreseeable future
You grossly overestimating ability graduating class CS student
If right people apply actual skill company want future might
You wo suddenly see people applying amazing job
Therefore company going suddenly deflate salary
Despite popular belief many good company WANT pay decent salary invested
They ca afford lose year cheap left company pay decent market rate
And market rate going deflate candidate amazing fit job
It still amazing company STILL throwing money guy hoping sign stay company
So saying CS grad wo job future
No job decent number wo sought like
It bit like NBA
Everyone would love Lebron team plenty good player play lesser role NBA
I using made number example
I saying grad probably hard time finding job student bothered decent gpa internship experience personal project
In future going student unprepared
I saying figure accurate I say majority grad nearly prepared
My point majority grad grossly unprepared
This case future well
If prepared wo worry CS student graduating future competition decent gpa experience project
Just add lot university tend limit amount student enroll given major
So even many people enroll CS school might mean half weeded got C Calc example
Though CS major
People sort STEM field migrating software engineering fill demand
I think CS graduate part equation
The EE grad example become software engineer according alumnus survey I seen
What think Math Physics major typically end
Software engineering one Do hear everybody freaking job going automated
Fast food worker
Restaurants become giant vending machine
Transportation
Humans killing mindless violence
Traffic pattern highly inefficient
Shipping
See transportation
Chain retail
Kaboom
For indie shop may survive
Military operation
Drones pull trigger reliant AI
Medical surgery
Robot surgeon guarantee better patient outcome insurance preferred
Marketing
All done digitally application data analytics
Government court
A piece software vastly cheaper clerk
And factory assembly line etc
All automation primarily system design engineered STEM guy put motion programmer
So yeah everybody else collecting unemployment check software one issuing
And happy thought pleasant evening
deleted Tyler Cowen economist written lot possible change coming increased automation West
I recommend anyone check book blog post subject discussion economist issue
I hope result
One increased profit gain efficiency result investment towards new thing unemployed hired help work
Also income gain top result higher demand personal service unemployed maybe become nanny dog walker personal assistant And increased profit hopefully result increased government revenue could help ease pain possible large scale unemployment
Medicaid cover medical expense EBT cover food cost lot potential reduce individual housing cost Americans paid much square footage per person people almost everywhere else world
Cheap entertainment internet access keep poor occupied distracted
Those company potential customer
When run money wo job either
worry thing even human devs get automated Yeah look like trend
Us electrical engineer seem brightest future
We need basic income majority
Computer Engineers Supposedly Do forget mechanical engineer design automaton use meatspace
I blame trigonometric function
For reason chosen one get
So everyone unemployed except programmer
And buy product service produced company programmer work
My post grim take account humanity figure something
I hope
I automation produce greater economy scale
In word dramatically reduces COL next generation buy new car price P Otherwise economic benefit settle well consumer choke point somewhere economy something give entire thing collapse
Except computer write code
They already
Not degree replace programmer electrical engineer
Will Computer Science continue good job prospect future
Yes Is Computer Science getting flooded No
See graduation rate enrolment rate
Take look pdf case interested data enrolment graduation
There nowhere near many CS degree granted US people think attrition rate high
enough demand keep increased amount CS Majors Yes world getting le reliant computing
I skimmed pdf could find
What graduation rate c degree
It around middle pdf
After show Phd Masters rate
Thank narrowing
In people enrolled US Canada c degree
The projected number graduate
Assuming projection correct graduation rate
Edit Some accurate number
In people enrolled c degree
In people graduated
Making graduation rate
Holy fuck
CS hard hard
To get accurate numers would need enrollment number order compare graduation number
However people enrolled similar
We still looking graduation rate around
When I look back c program started around student second year fourth year roughly remaining
So number surprising
It even difficulty
Lots kid starting uni hear make fresh grad c degree
For hard good majority get money quickly realize truth get
What truth That need good go place That lot hard work need genuine passion keep succeed
Is hard work
Yes
Do need genuine passion
Absolutely
I think passion required meme circulates around toxic probably anything else dissuade people particularly underrepresented group joining industry
I agree
I mean job suck probably end hating whatever
Just choose something hate much
Yep
get ton people CS class barely know computer drop almost immediately realize cakewalk
even class prereqs ca believe made let alone discrete math
I know I talk though shit super hard grade reflect quitter I enjoy actual programming
I think u realize average unrealistic even NY CALI I think unrealistic
I far talented programmer I got offer Boston average area
If head SF average
GlassDoor
I sure depends living least software engineer probably impossible find something around
I mean look Seattle average like year something
unrealistic
really average expect unless indeed quite average good interviewing
mention cost living
I sure I would consider good wage San Francisco I live
I could probably go AZ get paid like half still higher take home super low property price low tax etc
maybe bit exaggeration I run number really big one
But switching
Its still best degree far money go far I know
Not many degree get job straight college
It lot enrolling hear tech hot
I school right DotCom bust
We lost class one semester
Call think smart techie type population slow change I agree say attrition rate curious yet unworthy high
It relative ave IQ hot
When ave
I meet many high schoolers middlers text bash touchscreen UI super quick kinda clueless magic behind scene
Of course I meet super smarties give hope temper cynicism
I know much talent effort programmer
want really great programmer maybe need brain tick right way ample creativity people I see failing class I try
I see relevant experience jump even super beginner stuff I bet could get started little easier worked harder
Do forget graduation rate general
I wonder overall dropped degree combined
My class went student CS major graduating class
I class one person
There lot people think ca
A lot people went major though testing water see CS
EDIT I noticed huge dropout rate university freshman sophomore year general I went though
About people lived dorm make second year
Hell make second semester
Oddly low
For example Germany graduated CS degree population US
Is reason wage programmer US highest world
If look data enrolment You find total people enrolled undergrad degree
The number probably match exactly seems symptom explosion CS enrolment recent year low graduation rate
I read people enrolled c major table
I think got number table
It amount new undergraduate student
people enrolled graduate minimum extend spring even fall
You cant project actually graduate
I think eventually surprlus programmer long way
Eventually surplus v job general
Automation going take lot job away
There lot talk society eventually transition everyone get paid stipend people type situation
When automation put large percentage people work fault something change
So eventually many programmer enough programming job
But I think long thing happened retail job transportation job etc society already adapted accordingly
By nature STEM job probably last job hold
See I think much evidence say surplus programmer
Perhaps year could much much programming work space flight something
Only certain percentage population trait skill interest programming I doubt explosion CS people
I think Taylor necessarily saying explosion CS people demand likely drop v supply
Lots job automated programming
For example web development fine right massive demand already started automating job
People put together complex template let random user drag drop website exactly want
This vastly reduces need simple Web development position small business
Coding probably going lose job tried year
Web one field good platform cut lot grunt work I believe
CS Engineering probably going completely dead need someone design architecture algorithm
It like get true AIs time soon
So one aim part easy simple automate need expertise Well I mean even going dead definitely le job easier programming job get automated
There eventually point wo heavy demand anybody high level expertise programmer everybody one
I think space exploration grow rapidly business coming decade
There advance three technology I think work together make happen rocket robotics printing
A bigger question ask How I keep relevant
The industry going anywhere specific technology go favor place new one
As new programmer bigger threat generalized industry collapse
In nutshell best thing avoid kind stuff brings pretty good point talk issue programmer face namely age discrimination becoming deprecated programmer
There probably wo generalized industry collapse anytime soon always good keep ear open change
The real question many people second third fourth year
Computers fad
The internet
Is thing still around
Homer Simpson Oh internet computer
Homer Simpson deleted deleted I would say advice good anyone everyone right
Yes mean freshman
For forseeable future yes
The next great Facebook going write
So might well
In regard major Computer Science fairly high dropout rate
The math requirement pretty big filter
Do look many majoring look many graduating
I went one largest college USA CS class around graduate
Well lot people computer science
Not nearly many graduate
Five year later computer science total doubled That nothing compared ongoing development world wide
world wide even regular internet access right
Outsourcing even bigger deal future country spit huge amount programmer way india romania vietnam
Entry level job much flooded think happened web devs
On side future We still lucky get le good paying job internship
One biggest argument I heard last year outsourcing exists barrier cheapo outsource laborer company using
This barrier composed language
Right language part becoming negligible thanks great teaching tool online still annoying enough remain part barrier entry business
Personally I get nervous barrier reason drive sharpening
The pessimist know time come part barrier converges majority business decision say fuck good enough nation I think good year
Tools make task easier becoming much common offer turnkey solution tech newbie
This good drive future development field I still wonder end plateauing
back homework
I curious web dev subreddit mean
Are referring markup language even including javascript server side language
I looking stack overflow survey full stack developer
response
That indicate web dev popular perhaps saturated though
However could also mean web development field development
think happened web devs What happened web devs
I know bunch making
Entry level web devs make
I experienced opposite
Unless RoR devs
Yep
Many webbies deal entire framework backend stuff
The application make company big buck large scale may take team keep running
But webdev conjurs old iconic American cowboy alone prairie rebel society never understand rastling javascript cattle okay I done No
The demand computer software declining past year software created becoming le le complex requiring fewer fewer people build maintain
Quite frankly dying market wise go something much lucrative heated beef disc inversion
Oooo heated beef
I mean Moooo
I think demand computer science undergraduate continue grow perhaps even outpace people entering market foreseeable future
But cause competition especially
I think likely situation salary start getting compressed
I sure still better major high Well context like many actually stick whole program end
I think I read school major enroll like graduate year
A lot drop even drop Comp Org last straw usually Algorithms Data Structures
This question get asked every day
I question well given I planning majoring field
I feel still surplus countless new position created large company
I never heard shortage I much experience field
In city shortage
It hard find someone good
And someone specializes front end Web specifically Angular forget
We go town find people willing move What city mind asking
Rochester NY
Not top technology hub always lot going
Would probably lot NY didnt ridiculous tax policy
Yes
Go interested
That best advice
If basing job prospect always computer science job future
Salaries definitely going drop respect cost living abour year talented I imagine salary easily within reach new grad
The field flooded people CS degree people employable
The variety computer produced program need written increasing far faster human race ability program
I would worry computer science major doubling year
The number computer science major required increasing much faster rate
Tagging thread I imagine field Computer Science going others
Things like cyber security digital forensics guy think phased CS think grow bigger
To echo already said Computer Science probably always solid job prospect say least
Qolx made probably best response end
I pursuing BS Computer Science I taken research based undergraduate experience
I actually work Astrophysics department school I think work shown diverse job opportunity CS major
In many field automation computation two major growing aspect CS specializes
So long world continues consuming technology rate CS job abundant
Most essential nowadays given business politics security like become
I also wonder
plenty room top every field
crowded everywhere else
I think seems industry flooded industry need grow USA assuming country grow larger due fact people joining
I think worry finding job maybe lower pay
Hopefully Use site constitutes acceptance

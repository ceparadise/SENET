process idea object recognized differentiated understood
Categorization implies object grouped category usually specific purpose
Ideally category illuminates knowledge
Categorization fundamental language prediction decision making kind environmental interaction
It indicated categorization play major role
There many categorization theory technique
In broader historical view however three general approach categorization may identified first appears context work dialogue introduces approach grouping object based similar
This approach explored systematized treatise analyzes difference
Aristotle also applied intensively classical categorization scheme approach classification living being us technique applying successive narrowing question Is animal vegetable
How many foot
Does fur feather
Can fly
establishing way basis
The classical view claim category discrete entity characterized set property shared member
In property assumed establish condition capture meaning
According classical view category clearly defined mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive
This way entity given classification universe belongs unequivocally one one proposed category
modern variation classical approach derives attempt explain knowledge represented
In approach cluster entity generated first formulating conceptual description classifying entity according description
Conceptual clustering developed mainly paradigm
It distinguished ordinary generating concept description generated category
Categorization task category label provided learner certain object referred supervised classification
Categorization task label supplied referred unsupervised classification
The task supervised classification involves extracting information labeled example allows accurate prediction class label future example
This may involve rule concept relating observed object feature category label may involve abstraction
The task clustering involves recognizing inherent structure data set grouping object together similarity class
It thus process classification structure
Conceptual clustering closely related theory object may belong one group varying degree fitness
Since research categorization also viewed process grouping thing based idea necessary sufficient condition almost never met category naturally occurring thing
It also suggested categorization based prototype basis human development learning relies learning world via
A approach accepts natural category graded tend boundary inconsistent status constituent member
Systems category objectively world rooted people experience
Conceptual category identical different culture indeed every individual culture
Categories form part hierarchical structure applied subject higher level level middle level generic level lower level level
These distinguished certain trait put item distinctive category
But even arbitrary subject revision
Categories middle level perceptually conceptually salient
The generic level category tends elicit response richest image seems psychologically basic level
Typical taxonomy zoology example exhibit categorization level similarity leading formulation higher category difference leading differentiation within category
Miscategorization diverse dissimilar object concept entity etc
grouped together based upon illogical common denominator common denominator virtually concept object entity common
A common way miscategorization occurs concept object entity miscategorization based upon character virtually thing common

Theories categorization artificial intelligence information retrieval data mining computational field different kind theory predate modern computer
The computer however introduces two important element enables theory tested large amount data enforces precision since program running digital computer ever vague ambiguous
Both element helpful formulating testing theory neither guarantee truth relevance usefulness
Sometimes Lord Kelvin observed precision distraction Better rough answer right question exact answer wrong question
To avoid bias toward answer easy program important consider question posed computer invented
This paper survey variety computational method applied categorization related method reasoning category
These method used three different purpose Neural network illustrate way theory introduced modern computer contributed technique
In study learning Thorndike developed theory called reward strengthen connection punishment weaken
Meanwhile McCulloch Pitts neurophysiologist collaborating logician designed theoretical model capable learning computing Boolean function input
To implement model Rosenblatt built machine called simulated node link neural net
Later version combined connectionism neural net simulated digital computer instead implemented directly hardware
Figure show typical neural net stimulus entering layer node left link propagate signal node one middle finally response appear layer node right
The node represent neuron link represent dendrite pas signal one neuron another
In computer simulation link associated increase decrease strength signal pass link
Each node combine strength input determine value output
Behaviorist method suggested method learning
Whenever network generates incorrect response given stimulus effect punished adjusting weight link starting response layer propagating adjustment backwards toward stimulus layer
Over year many variation proposed function combine input determine output method backpropagation algorithm use change weight number node hidden layer possible feedback response layer earlier stimulus layer
All variation incremental modification older theoretical foundation
The example neural net interesting right also show theory used different purpose aspect may sometimes advantage disadvantage The remainder paper examines various idea theme theory cognitive science adapted applied computer system
In case idea originated long modern computer ability process large volume data great precision led depth sophistication previously unattainable
Aristotle invented two dominant method classification different variation used branch cognitive science
In logical work presented method defining concept based supertype one distinguish new type others genus
But biological work criticized limitation approach recommended approach beginning detailed description individual classifying specie grouping specie genus
He considered method appropriate presenting result analysis reasoning recommended method better discovery procedure investigating new subject
In third century AD philosopher Porphyry wrote commentary Aristotle category contained first recorded tree diagram
The version Figure illustrates category relationship rule reasoning type subtypes
With differentia material supreme genus Substance becomes subtype Body differentia immaterial becomes Spirit
The technique process merging differentia along path category LivingThing defined animate material Substance Human rational sensitive animate material Substance
The goal mechanically relating concept primitive first proposed Ramon Lull thirteenth century
His system disk inscribed primitive concept could combined various way rotating disk
Lull system inspired Leibniz develop represented primitive concept prime number compound concept product prime
Then statement form verified checking whether number divisible number
If Plant represented Deciduous product would represent DeciduousPlant
If Vine represented statement judged true divisible
Leibniz envisioned universal dictionary mapping concept number calculus reasoning would automate syllogism
To simplify computation invented first calculating machine could multiplication division
With advent electronic computer computational linguist set implement Leibniz universal dictionary
For machine translation system Masterman former student Wittgenstein defined word organized lattice based primitive concept Folk Stuff Change Go Talk
For sentence system would generate representation Modern dictionary analyze thousand word primitive one limited fixed set category
They also allow circular definition defining characteristic attribute
In linguistics Katz Fodor introduced primitive called combining
Many linguist adopted variation method even used raised serious criticism All method ranging Tree Porphyry latest example Aristotelian approach Aristotle recommended method analyzing empirical data
Whewell went claiming definition useless biology Though Natural group object definition longer use regulative principle class therefore left quite loose without certain standard guide
The class steadily fixed though precisely limited given though circumscribed determined boundary line without central point within strictly excludes eminently includes example precept short instead Definition Type director
In later philosophy Wittgenstein repudiated earlier approach showing ordinary word like defined necessary sufficient condition
Competition present ball game absent solitaire ring around rosy organized sport follows strict rule spontaneous play serious game life war lack aspect leisure enjoyment
Instead differentia distinguish activity game share baseball game resembles family activity people call game
Except technical term mathematics Wittgenstein maintained word defined family resemblance meaning word use within language
A word said like chess piece whose meaning determined physical shape rule using game
All three method definition refined implemented modern computer system After two millennium philosophical debate fifty year computer implementation modern consensus much different Kant Local feature useful method classification criterion determining feature significant depends purpose prominent superficial detail
A rug sofa example might similar color texture size shape function
A bird bat might similar flying ability anatomical detail bat similar mouse bird
The criterion determine feature select evaluate depend global consideration structure context purpose
Following summary kind criterion computational method used proposed handling As list show criterion recognizing classifying interpreting thing event complex varied
A classifier might useful first stage perception context purpose essential focusing attention observe determining relevance relating background knowledge
In sentence Yojo batted eraser across desk word occur
With background knowledge Yojo cat cat playful creature eraser object one might interpret action playing eraser toy
This issue limited natural language understanding since interpreting movie photograph would require kind analysis
Such interpretation necessary reporting classifying observation
Luria wrote book Shereshevskii man phenomenal memory exact word image observed
Because memory Shereshevskii got job newspaper reporter totally unsuited
His memory detail perfect could interpret detail determine relevance produce meaningful summary
In effect Shereshevskii behaved like perceiver attached vast database stored everything saw heard could interpret relevance anything
Every classifier logical fuzzy structural depends model relating instance category
Figure example illustrates underlying model neural net Figure illustrates model system
incorporate general assumption pattern typically found data popular curve example called normal
neural net based assumption mechanism occur natural process
Breiman statistician designed used wide range model emphasized need model accurately reflect nature subject Features represent local information could treated independent variable could organized global pattern schema Gestalt
In original paper chunk frame Newell Simon Minsky tried incorporate full richness psychological model
In later implementation however word applied data structure little package pointer
Those package useful model Selz schematic anticipation Bartlett active organization Wertheimer structural law
Minsky continued argue globally organized Newell proposed called SOAR
The pioneer AI realized beginning human intelligence depends global mechanism challenge bridging gap local feature global structure met
Chess playing illustrates importance Gestalt effect
In applying Selz method chess de Groot chessplayers study position select move saying whatever came mind move line play considering
He found significant difference master expert number move considered depth analysis time spent
The significant difference master would usually focus best move first glance nonmasters distracted move would dissipate advantage
Former world champion Emanuel Lasker said chess highly stereotyped game
Instead exhaustively analyzing option master simply look board see move worth considering
After year chess programming computer finally able defeat world champion search
To discover human could see glance computer analyze detail billion chess position
The Gestalt effect significant chess board maximum piece becomes even pronounced oriental game Go stone scattered around board
The number possible pattern Go many order magnitude greater chess search overcome human advantage seeing pattern
As result program today play Go beyond novice level
The schema Gestalt theory appear two different form sometimes used combination discrete version use pattern graph continuous version based geometric model
The Gestalt psychologist emphasized geometric pattern Selz graph pattern easier implement
The term Lakoff Johnson Oakley used geometric model mapped pattern discrete word expressed natural language
The psychological linguistic evidence pattern strong Gärdenfors promising geometrical model designed represent abstract concept well physical image
Categorization reasoning interdependent cognitive process every multistep reasoning process depends categorization step every reasoning process also categorization process every multistep categorization process involves multiple reasoning step
As example consider rule deduction called Deduction one Peirce three method reasoning corresponding method categorization
The following example show three method reasoning proposition corresponding method dealing category
For example word used informal synonym fact considered specialized principle either one could arbitrarily complex
The method categorization reasoning used AI related branch computer science grouped three broad area development since John McCarthy coined term
Most new development may considered incremental improvement even though many increment sufficiently radical important breakthrough
Each three area characterized primary form knowledge representation feature structure rule
The result classification may static category dynamic control structure
system example often used robot learn quickly generate decision tree compiled efficient control mechanism
To train robot teacher take hand guide task
At step system record vector feature represents current state robot together response would take next step
After training pas system build decision tree determines response combination feature
If robot make mistake subsequent trial teacher stop back point mistake occurred guide next step
Then system would modify decision tree prevent robot making mistake twice
It might however make similar mistake slightly changed condition
Since early day Hunt incremental improvement algorithm enabled system generalize quickly reduce number similar mistake
The boundary three group AI system blurred feature may defined term structure structure may effect
As example neural net optical character recognition OCR might use feature defined acute angle top
That feature encoded single bit derived information angle geometrical structure isTopOf dyadic relation
As another example analogical reasoning based structure mapping used derive kind conclusion system us induction derive rule followed deduction apply rule
That approach foundation Riesbeck Schank principle first stated Ibn Taymiyya comparison Aristotle logic analogy used legal reasoning Hallaq
Ibn Taymiyya admitted deduction mathematics certain
But empirical subject universal proposition derived induction induction must guided principle evidence relevance used analogy
Figure illustrates argument Deduction proceeds containing universal proposition
But proposition must earlier derived induction criterion used analogy
The difference induction produce theory intermediate result used subsequent process deduction
By using analogy directly legal reasoning dispenses intermediate theory go straight case conclusion
If theory analogy based evidence must lead conclusion
The question Figure asks information Q case Answering question deduction requires theory contains rule combination rule form theory generalization P given case
By version structure mapping called theory specialized match The specialization applied produce answer Q
If question Q one unknown Selz method unknown trigger search find missing information
That search may take many step may apply different rule theory even rule different theory
But theory applied must derived induction analyze evidence apply reliable methodology determining commonality indicate significant causal connection state connection rule
In analogical reasoning question Q lead schematic anticipation instead triggering rule theory unknown aspect Q lead case theory could derived
The case give best match given case P may assumed best source evidence estimating unknown aspect Q case show possible alternative
For new case principle evidence relevance significance must used
The kind operation used induction deduction used relate question Q corresponding part case
The closer agreement among alternative Q stronger evidence conclusion
In effect process induction creates theory used solve many related problem deduction
reasoning however method bespoke tailoring problem yet operation stitching proposition
Creating new theory cover multiple case typically requires new category type hierarchy
To characterize effect analogy metaphor Way proposed two analogous case generalized abstract type T subsumes
The new type T also subsumes possibility may combine aspect original case novel arrangement
Sowa embedded hierarchy infinite lattice possible theory
Some theory highly specialized description single case others general
The general theory top lattice contains tautology true everything
At bottom contradictory theory true nothing
The theory related four operator operator Alchourrón et al

These four operator define pathway lattice Figure determine possible way deriving new theory old one
To illustrate move lattice suppose A Newton theory gravitation applied earth revolving around sun F Niels Bohr theory electron revolving around nucleus hydrogen atom
The path A F transformation old theory new one
The contraction step A B deletes axiom gravitation expansion step B C add axiom electrical force
The result move equivalent revision step A C substitute electrical axiom gravitational axiom
Unlike contraction expansion move nearby theory lattice analogy jump remote theory C E systematically renaming type relation individual earth renamed electron sun renamed nucleus solar system renamed atom
Finally revision step E F us contraction step discard detail earth sun become irrelevant followed expansion step add new axiom quantum effect
One revision step replace two step contraction expansion one analogy step transfer complete theory one domain another relabeling symbol
Different method walking lattice produce result induction deduction abduction learning reasoning nonmonotonic reasoning
As method creative discovery Fauconnier Turner defined also corresponds walk lattice given two case A B derive generic case T corresponds least common supertype lattice Way method use expansion operator specialize T B
Although possible form reasoning learning discovery reduced walk lattice challenge find correct path infinite lattice
In AI search method guided estimate distance given point desired goal
The term Fauconnier Turner adopted used linguistics psychology constraint characterize desirable goal computable definition constraint could programmed heuristic function
The method studying modeling cognition differ one branch cognitive science another abstraction nature
As Breiman cautioned conclusion derived model model mechanism nature mechanism
Furthermore none model yet proposed branch cognitive science explain full range phenomenon observed human animal natural environment
Figure show model postulated animal various level evolution
The cognitive system animal level Figure build extend capability earlier level
The worm top rudimentary sensory motor mechanism connected ganglion small number neuron
A neural net connects stimulus response intermediate layer might adequate model
The fish brain tiny compared mammal already complex structure receives input highly differentiated sensory mechanism sends output differentiated muscular mechanism support delicate control propulsion
Exactly mechanism work known neural evidence suggests division perceptual mechanism interpreting input motor mechanism controlling action
There must also significant amount interaction perceptual motor mechanism simple neural net probably inadequate model
At next level mammal cerebral cortex distinct sensory motor system
If fish brain already capable sophisticated interpretation control larger cortex must add something
Figure label symbolizes cat playing ball yarn serf mouse analog
Whether mechanism computer analogy explain rich range mammalian behavior known whatever happening must least complex probably much
The human level illustrated typical human Sherlock Holmes whose famous skill induction abduction deduction
Those reasoning skill may characterized specialized way using analogy work seamlessly primitive ability
Whatever neural mechanism may function human intelligence operate multiple level
The instant reaction touching hot stove controlled wormlike ganglion well brain perceives happened
Although muscle controlled conscious attention operate efficiently detail left fishlike part brain
In mobile robot Brooks distinguished eight increasingly sophisticated kind processing The competence level mapped six level defined Aristotle Hamlyn nutrition perception desire locomotion imagery thought
These level help clarify kind computation required robot parallel animal cognition
Nutrition desire example two important level missing Brooks hierarchy
In AI system deduction developed much greater depth method reasoning
Although method learning studied year comparable level success achieved
As example following sentence spoken child named Laura month age Limber Chomsky follower Jackendoff maintain child learn language rapidly human brain innate module facilitates acquisition syntax
After studying human evolution Deacon agreed brain predisposition language evidence show slow evolution brain vocal tract toward modern form
It suggests early hominid already rudimentary language gave individual larger brain better speaking ability competitive advantage
To analyze human animal communication Deacon used Peirce semiotic category classify kind sign could recognize produce
He found higher mammal easily recognize first two kind icon index lengthy training could talented chimpanzee learn recognize symbolic expression
Deacon concluded chimpanzee could make semiotic transition index symbol early hominid could
Once transition made language possible use language would promoted language brain
Although Jackendoff diverged Chomsky assuming conceptual structure replied Deacon repeating claim innate syntax
But language depended innate syntactic module simulation module might enable computer learn understand language easily child
Yet syntax make language difficult computer essential human understanding
People speaking foreign language make understood even badly fractured syntax notoriously difficult computer parse
That support Deacon hypothesis symbol important syntax first child learn word symbol thing predisposition mimic adult speech enables learn pattern word syntax result learning map speech pattern cognitive pattern
Contrary Chomsky prerequisite result many generation child preferring pattern easy learn
Further research semiotics may clarify issue promising technique include Goguen Deacon combination Peirce semiotics conceptual structure Sowa
In summary computer cognition give u better appreciation full range human ability
The greatest challenge cognitive science integrate thousand separate study working model brain
In AI Newell Minsky integrated thirty year research model cognition shown promise successful overall Lenat Cyc
Although AI yet able simulate aspect human intelligence contributed many valuable method enhancing intelligence testing hypothesis intelligence

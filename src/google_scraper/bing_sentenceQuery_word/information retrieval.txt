activity obtaining resource relevant information need collection information resource
Searches based indexing
Information retrieval science searching information document searching document also searching describe data database text image sound
Automated information retrieval system used reduce called
Many use IR system provide access book journal document
visible
An information retrieval process begin user enters query system
Queries formal statement information need example search string web search engine
In information retrieval query uniquely identify single object collection
Instead several object may match query perhaps different degree
An object entity represented information content collection
User query matched database information
However opposed classical SQL query database information retrieval result returned may may match query result typically ranked
This ranking result key difference information retrieval searching compared database searching
Depending data object may example text document image audio video
Often document kept stored directly IR system instead represented system document surrogate
Most IR system compute numeric score well object database match query rank object according value
The top ranking object shown user
The process may iterated user wish refine query
The idea using computer search relevant piece information popularized article
It would appear Bush inspired patent machine filed searched document stored film
The first description computer searching information described Holmstrom detailing early mention computer
Automated information retrieval system introduced one even featured romantic comedy
In first large information retrieval research group formed Cornell
By several different retrieval technique shown perform well small Cranfield collection several thousand document
retrieval system Lockheed Dialog system came use early
In US Department Defense along NIST cosponsored TREC part TIPSTER text program
The aim look information retrieval community supplying infrastructure needed evaluation text retrieval methodology large text collection
This catalyzed research method huge corpus
The introduction boosted need large scale retrieval system even
For effectively retrieving relevant document IR strategy document typically transformed suitable representation
Each retrieval strategy incorporates specific model document representation purpose
The picture right illustrates relationship common model
In picture model categorized according two dimension mathematical basis property model
The process assessing well system meet information need user
Traditional evaluation metric designed retrieval include
Many measure evaluating performance information retrieval system also proposed
In general measurement considers collection document searched search query
All common measure described assume notion relevancy every document known either relevant particular query
In practice query may may different shade relevancy
Virtually modern evaluation metric designed without explicit rank cutoff taking account relative order document retrieved search engine giving weight document returned higher rank
The mathematical symbol used formula mean Precision fraction document retrieved user information need
In precision analogous
Precision take retrieved document account
It also evaluated given rank considering topmost result returned system
This measure called
Note meaning usage precision field information retrieval differs definition within branch science
Recall fraction document relevant query successfully retrieved
In binary classification recall often called
So looked
It trivial achieve recall returning document response query
Therefore recall alone enough one need measure number document also example computing precision
The proportion document retrieved document available In binary classification closely related equal
It looked
It trivial achieve returning zero document response query
The weighted precision recall traditional balanced This also known measure recall precision evenly weighted
The general formula real Two commonly used F measure measure weight recall twice much precision measure weight precision twice much recall
The derived van Rijsbergen measure effectiveness retrieval respect user attache time much importance recall precision
It based van Rijsbergen effectiveness measure
Their relationship better single metric compared precision recall precision recall give different information complement combined
If one excels reflect
Precision recall metric based whole list document returned system
For system return ranked sequence document desirable also consider order returned document presented
By computing precision recall every position ranked sequence document one plot curve plotting precision function recall
Average precision computes average value interval That area curve
This integral practice replaced finite sum every position ranked sequence document rank sequence retrieved document number retrieved document precision list change recall item
This finite sum equivalent indicator function equaling item rank relevant document zero otherwise
Note average relevant document relevant document retrieved get precision score zero
Some author choose interpolate function reduce impact wiggle curve
For example PASCAL Visual Object Classes challenge prior benchmark computer vision object detection evaluation metric changed effectively sample curve unique recall value
computes average precision averaging precision set evenly spaced recall level interpolated precision take maximum precision recall greater An alternative derive analytical function assuming particular parametric distribution underlying decision value
For example obtained assuming decision value class follow Gaussian distribution
When output classifier ordered
confidence measure consider top k result compute precision
This known Precision k P For modern information retrieval instance recall longer meaningful metric many query thousand relevant document user interested reading
k document P k still useful metric P Precision corresponds number relevant result first search result page fails take account position relevant document among top Another shortcoming query fewer relevant result k even perfect system score le
It easier score manually since top k result need examined determine relevant
requires knowing document relevant query
The number relevant document used cutoff calculation varies query query
For example document relevant red corpus red look top document returned count number relevant turn relevancy fraction
Precision equal recall position
Empirically measure often highly correlated mean average precision
Mean average precision set query mean average precision score query
number query
DCG us graded relevance scale document result set evaluate usefulness gain document based position result list
The premise DCG highly relevant document appearing lower search result list penalized graded relevance value reduced logarithmically proportional position result
The DCG accumulated particular rank position defined Since result set may vary size among different query system compare performance normalised version DCG us ideal DCG
To end sort document result list relevance producing ideal DCG position p normalizes score The nDCG value query averaged obtain measure average performance ranking algorithm
Note perfect ranking algorithm producing nDCG
All nDCG calculation relative value interval comparable

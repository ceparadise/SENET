Contents The developed scratch solve difficult social problem especially problem
The provides problem solver fill blank framework make work much focused efficient
The process summarized diagram SIP incorporates
Each subproblem analyzed using Social Force Diagram plus feedback loop simulation model necessary
solving problem area unfamiliar
How separate wheat chaff
How find apply
If ca determine matter study ca solve problem
SIP guiding framework
It asks three strategic question
What critical
What subproblem

What resolving root cause
Everything else follows question
Each find matter question build question
When answered three question done analysis
You found matter
After converging solution push high leverage point relatively easy
Next give brief introduction SIP
For full description process example applied collection sample solution element produced process see
The top framework matrix look like First one big problem defined Problem Definition
Then one big problem decomposed three subproblems present difficult social problem Presently human system strongly resisting changing unsustainable sustainable behavior
Presently human system improperly coupled environment
The feedback loop necessary sustainable environmental impact simply
The model government use run incapable solving sustainability problem
It drifted far needed broken
trying simultaneously solve three subproblems time without realizing
That one reason environmental movement unable solve sustainability problem
Environmentalists blind need treat How overcome change resistance separate problem solve first
Once change resistance overcome system want sustainable
It eagerly adopt proper coupling solution like carbon tax strict pollution law sustainable product life cycle design
Each subproblem go step analysis solution convergence implementation shown
Lets compare four main step SIP four main step problem solving process used environmentalist today
Identify problem
Find proper practice
Tell people truth
If fails inspire exhort bargain
Problem Definition
Solution Convergence
Implementation In step Classic Activism practice required live sustainably like renewable energy le pollution supporting Kyoto Protocol climate change
Not Classic Activism fail use proper decomposition
This huge flaw second reason world unable solve sustainability problem
Without deep analysis possibly solve difficult problem
The heart analysis step SIP
This powerful tool allows u implement Our Fundamental Principle The way solve difficult problem resolve root cause
In order necessary add These listed
Note substeps use modeling find root cause high leverage point resolving root cause
The analysis step difficult crucial spend time
If root cause high leverage point reasonably correct step relatively easy
But analysis wrong amount brilliant hard work step solve problem

Find immediate cause subproblem symptom term system dominant

Find intermediate cause low leverage point superficial symptomatic solution

Find intermediate cause

Find dominant resolve root cause

Find make loop go dominant
Once grasp SIP work see contains minimum step required solve problem
All three subproblems required
Root cause must found subproblem
So must high leverage point
Then analysis complete solution convergence implementation step follow
This raise question many step SIP environmental movement performed
The answer shown As SIP see problem solver completed step
Both admirably done
But super sleuth world since
Where result rest process one something like
I searched year nowhere found
Instead find artifact Classic Activism like done please let
Still Jay Forrester Club Rome Dennis Donella Meadows Jorgen Randers rest person Limits Growth team pulled precocious miracle
They spotted problem noticed wrestled form allowed complete first two step
Over seven year period developed SIP applied sustainability problem
The result shown For discussion table please see
For detailed description SIP please see
For full description see chapter
We describing SIP work
After try one recent paper one
Every difficult problem requires type process solve
If solve problem problem solving process valuable asset
It even important people without stellar process even stellar people solve truly difficult problem
This fact escaped attention science business
Here prominent process depend five step process form foundation science
natural process identified Charles Darwin
For see
process tracking understanding flow money business
Without business would unable calculate profitability decision
Profits could calculated mean dividend could paid
complex process determining makeup molecule DNA
This process become core genetic engineering offer map want go
quality improvement process
According General Electric one successful company implementing Six Sigma estimated benefit order billion first five year implementation
first perfected Henry Ford production Model T automobile
The new process allowed production world first affordable car one could widely purchased middle class
Are concerned rise populust authoritarian like
Have noticed democracy unable solve important problem like war poverty
If film series
One intermediate cause weakened
Powerful root cause force working weaken loop
These average minute
They give quick introduction Dueling Loops model explains tremendous change resistance solving sustainability problem
The article site since written December
More people contacted u easy read paper related Dueling Loops video anything else site
Do every wonder sustainability problem impossibly hard solve
It phenomenon change resistance
Why root cause several potential solution presented
The astonishing short read page site never heard
The memo written breaking problem smaller easier solve problem
Exactly done determines strength analysis
You see powerful technique used analysis missing mainstream environmentalism tried
This explains different outcome expected
The key technique
The analysis performed seven year period
The result summarized top shown Click table full table high level discussion analysis result
Popular approach solving sustainability problem see obvious black arrow
This lead using push resolve
Popular solution superficial fail see fundamental layer complete causal chain run
intuitively seems popular solution like renewable energy strong regulation solve sustainability problem
But ca resolve root cause
In analytical approach penetrates fundamental layer find well hidden Further analysis find developed create solves problem
For see glossary
First analysis divided sustainability problem Then subproblem individually analyzed
For overview see
This different ancient Romans
Subproblems like several order magnitude easier solve longer trying vain solve simultaneously without realizing
This strategy changed million problem insolvable solvable work
For example u impossible
But paper decomposing problem nine case time adding result change problem insolvable solvable
tendency system resist change even surprisingly large amount force applied
system resisting change none subproblems solvable
Therefore subproblem must solved first
Until solved effort solve three subproblems largely wasted effort
The successful change resistance appears Too many voter politician deceived thinking sustainability low priority need solved
The resolving root cause We need inoculate people deceptive false meme people infected falsehood hard change mind see truth
occurs two social life form working together harmony
In sustainability problem cooperating smoothly people
Instead many corporation dominating political decision making advantage shown strenuous opposition solving environmental sustainability problem
The appears The goal corporate life form maximization profit goal human life form optimization quality life living descendent
These two goal achieved system
One side win side lose
Guess side losing
The resolving root cause follows easily
If root cause corporation wrong goal high leverage point occurs problem evolves solution model keep
The model away needed keep problem solved
The solution model solving important problem like sustainability recurring war recurring recession excessive economic inequality institutional poverty drifted far unable solve problem
The appears Various step decision making process working properly resulting inability proactively solve many difficult problem
This indicates low decision making process maturity
The resolving root cause In subproblem economic system improperly coupled environment
Environmental impact economic system growth exceeded capacity environment recycle impact
This subproblem world see The analysis show false assumption however
The change resistance subproblem must solved first
The appears like air breath
This mean presently way manage common property efficiently enough sustainably
The resolving root cause order radically lower transaction cost
There must reason popular solution working
Given principle reason popular solution working year million people trying This fundamental insight
Using result analysis input Each resolve specific root cause thus solves one four subproblems shown Click table high level discussion solution element The solution see differ radically popular solution The right subproblems found earlier analysis step decomposed one big Gordian Knot problem
Everything change root cause resolution approach
Once analysis build model problem find root cause high leverage point solution developed push leverage point
Because solution aimed resolving specific known root cause ca miss
It like shooting target ten foot away
The bullseye root cause
That Root Cause Analysis fantastically powerful
Nine Sample Solution Elements The high leverage point overcoming change resistance We somehow fooled easily deceptive politician
This easy
Overcoming change resistance crux problem take nine solution element solve subproblem
The first key
In subproblem analysis found two social life form large corporation people conflicting goal
The high leverage point Since one causing problem right mean reengineer modern corporation right goal
Corporations never designed comprehensive manner serve people
They evolved
What today called It serf
What need instead This life form designed serve people rather
Its new role trusted servant whose goal providing good service needed optimize quality life people sustainable manner
Solution element drifted far decision making model government use decide
incapable solving sustainability problem
The high leverage point Like Corporation process never designed
It evolved
thus quite want
The solution work like Imagine would like politician rated quality decision
They would start competing see could improve quality life common good
That would lead pleasant world ever seen
Solution element Presently economic system improperly coupled environment
The high leverage point radically reduce cost managing sustainability problem
This done Each steward would goal sustainably managing portion sustainability problem
Like way corporation charge good service steward would charge ecosystem service use
The income go solving problem
Corporations gave u Industrial Revolution
That revolution incomplete steward give u Solution element This summarizes past ten year research
Twelve sample solution element analysis behind presented
This analyzes standard political system explains operating benefit special interest instead common good
Several sample solution presented help get thwinking

One way get started
This done switching lead

Good public health practice requires strong objective order monitor progress toward achieving goal outcome
Many program service funded grant require developing implementing completing objective prove success continued funding
Organizations often struggle create objective accurately measure progress toward goal meaningful team member stakeholder
Why use SMART objective
Devoting time resource early intentionally writing SMART objective investment future plan program service
By starting SMART objective program plan systematically meaningfully measure progress show achievement identify opportunity improvement
In order understand part SMART objective flow together order SMART component listed go
This Specific Measurable part clearly visible standard written format objective
The Achievable Relevant piece abstract require reflection
Each part include example objective SMART
SMART objective Objectives clear team member stakeholder also understand program plan
Consider prompt Note question apply every objective
This involves selecting measured show improvement impact success
There may existing measure target required specific program grant
Try pick measure meaningful
The easiest thing measure may meaningful
Consider prompt Show success impact time
It number percent standard unit express achieving goal outcome
The desired level performance want see represents success
Objectives achievable within specific time frame soon prevent success far away encourage procrastination
Consider prompt Objectives within reach team program considering available resource knowledge time
Consider prompt Objectives align corresponding goal
Consider successfully completing objective relevant achieving goal
Consider objective relates larger program plan organization mission vision goal
It also considered whether objective relevant important team stakeholder
Objectives related organization mission guiding principle likely approved organizational leadership objective supported stakeholder lead greater level
Consider prompt There multiple approach way explain write SMART objective

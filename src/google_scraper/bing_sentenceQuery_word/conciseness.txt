You may time received corrected paper word written red ink margin
But conciseness teacher think important
extent piece writing communicates clear information word possible
One good way think conciseness think auto mechanic called ratio
horsepower car divided curb weight word higher ratio powerful car
But achieve good ratio must powerful engine must also limit weight car
Likewise writing enough intelligent thing say
You must find way saying using fewer clearer word
Let review paragraph need work conciseness
While may deliver great message idea paragraph weighted inefficient word use
While listening paragraph ask question find struggling language
If rewrite paragraph could make clearer direct
How
For Whom Bell Tolls When revising conciseness want ask two question every sentence written
First information sentence necessary communicate trying communicate
If simply delete
If information necessary ask second question I state information fewer clearer word
Then try
Count word sentence rewrite fewer
Repeat process one two time looking especially redundant information
Gradually sentence shrink conciseness improve
Using strategy let revise passage heard earlier Get FREE access day create account
For Whom Bell Tolls With revision total word saved reduction
Beyond reduction word count notice much clearer read
None necessary information original paragraph sacrificed presented much clearly
Polished writing kind always exhibit quality direct efficient
While necessary worry conciseness first draft essential revision process
When revising conciseness ask two question
First information included essential trying communicate
If delete
If ask say fewer direct word
Over course document hone sentence fashion cut word count drastically end direct efficient writing

One driving force behind writing conditionals need vary program behavior based certain condition
When writing comprehensive conditionals often want program something specifically particular statement evaluated false
This becomes useful
Think else statement otherwise conditional
Consider following pseudocode alarm clock function The otherwise clause allows u account possible scenario
In example could executed logic using two statement follows However writing comprehensive program may practical account every possible scenario
Suppose want alarm go AM Tuesday Thursday AM day
Using otherwise clause logic follows Without using otherwise clause logic follows It clear former concise pragmatic
Suppose want Karel move turn left otherwise
Keep mind following rule thumb writing statement Your code look like Note stylistically else statement may begin line statement closing bracket following line
It recommended stay consistent whichever method prefer
The code may also written In general else statement required
You usually achieve effect else statement using series statement
While valid preferred use else statement clarity conciseness
may later faced scenario else statement required writing helper function return value

Hello everyone So college starting month I getting ready purchase new laptop master c
I want laptop powerful good cpu good ram fast ssd ect
One largest thing I want laptop able use throughout day note paper ect
I want laptop heavy lugging around day
Battery life tremendous probably time class sneak charge
I dont want laptop loud annoying fan distract fellow classmate
Thanks advance Nick What budget
Probably What size notebook would prefer
Mainstream screen Where buying notebook
You select flag country indicator
Probably online could purchase store needed
Are brand prefer really like

Like Dislike Would consider laptop
No I want something new
What primary task performing notebook
coding compiling class note paper possibly little gaming Will taking notebook different place leaving desk
Both taking class daily night may place desk
Will playing game notebook
If please state game type game
possibly Minecraft How many hour battery life need
Minimum four hour heavy use
Would prefer see notebook considering purchasing buying notebook without seeing OK
I would research buying online would fine
What OS prefer
Windows Windows Mac OS Linux etc
I using Windows life im fast learner I could learn OS
Screen Specifics From choice screen resolution would prefer
Keep mind screen size conjunction resolution play large role overall viewing comfort level
Everyone different
Some like really small text others like text big easy read
Click Screen resolution information
I would enjoy I would fine FHD screen
Do want screen screen
I would perfectly fine either
Build Quality Design Are notebook look stylishness important
Not large factor I want huge bulky laptop
I enjoy look macbook pro really apple fan
When buying laptop
In next month two
How long want laptop last
Hoping Laptop last year start get slow I could always upgrade
Notebook Components How much hard drive space need
Do want SSD drive
I would like ssd ssd I thinking I could instead purchasing laptop
Do need optical drive
If yes DVD Burner Reader Burner
I would like space case need insert disk class could always buy external usb od
How much RAM would like
Yes I added question
I talked professor said minimum would best

I looking lenovo ram I would upgrading ssd
What guy think
Thank spending time read help
Have nice day
Nick If asking technical help please sure include system info including operating system model number specific related problem
Also please exercise best judgment posting forum revealing personal information address telephone number address recommended
I start asking university need also OS offer example student reduction recommended shop local support software need need first year already included package
I buy laptop SSD already built
It cheaper risk voiding warranty opening save cloning hard disk
would fine GB probably also
GB certainly overkill
Buf university advises
Forget update
Buy need
Any laptop SSD CPU RAM specify would fine
look configure one get idea
Kees First I like thank response
I talked university said OS totally
With said I talked current CS student said time use linux
He found best dual boot Windows Linux laptop I thinking I probably going
The reason I thinking putting SSD Lenovo charge upgrade SSD SSD
If I purchased SSD newegg installed would
Although I believe I would reinstall window making like
I think I going go instead
Do think ram waste money I go
Do think I notice difference
I looked dell machine caught eye thing good amount poor review laptop
Any suggestion
I big apple fan I bad experience product I trying stay away Macbook pro
If people think would best I would mind giving shot
Indeed laptop far le configurable desktop
Why think need TB disk study
Would GB enough
Downloading movie external disk might fine
No need reinstall Windows clone original SSD new bigger SSD
I really think GB enough even enough
Only go sure experience fellow student would make noticeable difference
Check task manager see actually use study thing
Dual boot Windows Linux fine
Running one virtual machine fine also faster swich somewhat slower run
Kees The reason I planning one professor suggested get using school
He said going thing look
Ok I look cloning SSD I end
I going get I go
Maybe I end running one virtual machine
Thanks help
Nick Most friend computer science barebones laptop
They best customisability
They also cheaper upgradible future
Sagar good barebone laptop look
One best French door fridge tested A fridge useful feature like water pitcher FlexZone drawer
It performer cooling test

Example Notebook Android SSD hard drive Copyright Group All Rights Reserved
Ad choice

I go type laptop looking end I give suggestion I pick I buying laptop today
Without ado let dive
Powerful processor As computer science student probably code several language In case laptop performance limit execution code
Yes might take second longer compile second longer start Java server good enough reason stretch budget better processor
Even though basic core processor suffice compiling code
So I edging towards fast processor
There one important reason aim CPU possible
Responsive snappy workflow actually make better happier
Get code crash work improperly time day consider PC taking extra second every time verge experiencing major nerd rage
On serious note I generally happy program I written work I need wait long know fix go
Which processor I mind
Right see processor often
Do forget getting faster processor also chipping away battery runtime
That I OK processor smaller laptop used primarily lecture coding go
Suitable amount RAM Right I using GB GB installed laptop
I sure I update GB near future due work habit
I like keep stack open
At moment I running I multitask I switch work context several time day various task If resembles way like work I heavily recommend getting least GB RAM
But rarely go tab Chrome budget necessary go GB
Solid State Drive Affordable SSDs best thing happen computer past year
They lot faster lighter reliable end consuming le power
Their price still main reason cling spinning hard drive
If spend laptop computer science course SSD system partition basically mandatory
And around mark large storage would best
Right I rocking GB SSD system application GB HDD store downloads image archive etc
I think least GB ideally GB storage minimal GB SSD
For computer science student speed workflow quite bit especially I need search file particular piece code
It also tremendously speed work heavyweight IDEs like Eclipse NetBeans
Linux Compatibility Unless buying MacBook viable option need laptop run Linux distro Ubuntu Mint Arch Debian
Though big problem case
Most laptop work either flawlessly LED issue often solved cup coffee
Of course applying patch kernel I recommend someone yet learned code
Most people still come Windows environment might want setup
In case I recommend getting laptop GB SSD storage least
Long Battery Runtime Long battery time amazing allows quickly start end work session whether home university computer lab coffee shop campus
Best battery offer enough juice whole day uni
What ability finally ditch big black block charger make taking laptop seamless task
I seen type inconvenience discourage many student taking laptop altogether
For example course quite often bring laptop try code sample middle lecture lecturer demonstrates laptop
In practice student course
I absolutely certain would everyone lightweight laptop heavyweight battery
I see lightweight laptop lecture lot heavy laptop HAD heavily encouraged bring laptop various collaborative project
Having laptop come handy making project presentation meeting coursework teammate outside computer lab etc
Now page
But long battery runtime actually mean
Where I look I judge
As best case scenario look independent test battery life browsing internet
They still tend overshoot actual battery time tend run screen brightness
Usually using even sunny day
Also test result brand new laptop good ever
Even couple month battery start perform worse mine sure
Here quick reading battery time roughly convert realistic battery runtime
Lightweight Having light laptop go long battery life
I recommend looking light laptop especially see spending lot time campus lecture
At time light laptop sunshine rainbow people tend overlook
Small lightweight laptop usually suffer restrictive airflow make problematic clean done year purchase difficult upgrade
suffer
They slot upgrade opened easy navigate minified
Kappa
Dedicated graphic card If PC gamer wait get hand newest gaming title need look
For casual gamer Nvidia GTX chip work well
As amount dedicated memory GB enough benefit GB want use Very texture game
If willing make compromise even enough latest game play setting resolution
Under restriction easy enough casual game competitive title many release
But want best laptop graphic card offer good option
Yes could go crazy look laptop use desktop reading wrong article mate
In case looking gaming rig
I compared laptop select best laptop computer science course satisfy requirement least make reasonable compromise based price
laptop suited mediocre computer science task
Price spec nice laptop come feature many laptop higher price tag
If fan laptop one really good option
Acer Predator great laptop
It come CPU GPU retaining great battery life
Great choice people want
MacBook sufficient run Computer Science task without hassle
It come spacious SSD storage decent specification display
Macbook fan disappointed portability performance laptop
Finally stress laptop make sure intuitively match way planning use always go buy powerhouse
And need gaming rig squeezed laptop body think laptop
unless want spend Razer laptop
This great amount detail thanks
I planning going computer science major year looking laptop
You explanation everything really help
I wanted say thank good job
Thank Thanks helpful blogpost
I considering getting another laptop called Lenovo Ideapad seems specification around le
I seem find much online actual difference computer
I hoping might know difference important I would losing going cheaper laptop
I would need know model talking exactly plenty variation Ideapad
But general compare model spec better speaker backlit keyboard bit better cooling system Ideapad general use laptop
If gamer care bell whistle come reason pas Ideapad good deal
Have looked Lenovo ThinkPads
I currently leaning toward one CS laptop
I see gaming bit expensive task meet biggest requirement laid
X T P series especially
Yes I
Thinkpad X laptop used popular exemplary Linux support
But part T series extent bit expensive compared similar laptop brand
Thinkpad P might bit much computer science student least within student budget
But spend bit extra workstation yes go Thinkpad I usually recommend
Overall brought good point
I revise recommendation list check room Lenovo model especially X T series
I aware Thinkpad P series workstation overkill currently
But laptop last year
Will buying yoga even better prepare future
I like trying new thing I switching new one old one unfixable expensive fix I want something last year least maybe year
What would recommend data science student
I looking stay around Great advice spec
Ive got question though
I enough money either RAM RAM
I already external HDD store medium
The processor variant somewhat
variant higher clockspeed
The internet saying get RAM variant I afraid utilise
Cheers keep good work
It depends able upgrade RAM future
If upgrade road lot better going
If stuck RAM forever go RAM
Hi samuel upcoming computer scientist studying computer science school I would like get contact could instructor help thank good explanation
Thanks detail
Nice one dude
But I wondering whether MacBook consideration
I finishing second year also may I currently attend local community college I gotten quite well core ram ssd
Granted amount code I write minimal class challengeing enough recompile time day
My Biggest Recommendation Buy laptop fast processor good instructional guide upgrade
Ram SSD usually replaceable cheaper laptop willing pry open case save alot money allow get top line spec ram ssd etc mid tier price
I ssd upgrade ram laptop pretty fast even core You forgot important criterion operating system
In professional environment programming C maybe Java likely using Windows machine
Otherwise using Mac
There always exception generally case
Why developer writing code would want Windows machine beyond
Windows major OS even close
Most devs I know use MacBook work many use linux machine home
Can anyone give one compelling reason use anything Mac Linux unless writing code
considering acquire hp folio hp laptop CS major think
I appreciate writing helpful article good people try share experience student going start started uni course
As computer science student I think add one thing display quality
As gaze long time laptop screen investing good screen would worth
Screens like antiglare one IPS panel wide viewing angle
Required field marked

It easy feel though need expensive laptop college often far case
student would probably totally fine almost laptop mostly engineering student need little horsepower
Here find exactly need
Engineering professional go often need incredibly powerful PC hardware
Needless say need compromise power affordability mobility fly window
While someone like perfect pick might student like would hard pressed hand cash could use purchase car book food mounting college debt
Fortunately hope
Engineering student like often run problem heading college
Many opinion Macbook right choice simply throw base model Macbook Air
Where major get anything certain engineering profession require use laptop meet specific requirement
With mind I decided take look requirement befit STEM student term usability preference need run common software
I personally shop laptop ME student I felt I share option I considered along deal available
I arranged guide three category Computer Science Engineering Mechanical Engineering
I put order increasingly powerful computing need
Those expensive option list like Inspiron perfect content creation need graphic design video editing plus CAD modelling work even light gaming
I also created link proper search filter Amazon said laptop picked option I feel stand
Usually especially good deal included hardware model
I also filled price range I feel fair meet exceed presented requirement
Specs Computer Science laptop based computer run commonly used editing platform
Eclipse rather meager list spec proof even laptop problem coding
Based specification list laptop might work CS need This le bargain basement option
This Windows machine solid review
The performs well us le energy idling little power efficient
The tradeoff soldered permanently
The Vivobook basically budget Ultrabook
ASUS known quality certainly delivers look premium laptop
The difference price Acer Chromebook get CPU twice powerful four time storage display Windows
A pretty great deal altogether opinion
This may seem bad deal next Vivobook hidden gem
It outpaces Vivobook Pentium quad core every benchmark thanks hyperthreading four thread two physical core
If need compiling powerhouse look sixth generation laptop EE list
Side note Many CS buddy look backlit keyboard machine typically premium feature
However since likely need one room consider buying external backlit keyboard
Coders use lot anyhow super cheap
I personally used
These spec laptop based laptop run
This demanding PCB design software I could find still demanding
people coding need CS folk plus need use light graphical tool designing board
Based list laptop might work best electrical computer engineering This repeat CS list deserves spot list well
This HP pretty generic modern look pack far power Vivobook far larger body near price point
This likely considerably power need EE
If sale like I researching great deal
The discrete graphic card really needed EE need graphical work certainly help
Computer engineer appreciate
This laptop model one better GPU SSD little extra cash
This one give better hardware per dollar
And one time Acer Aspire E another price hike give even better value
This almost fast Quad core HQ four core four thread two core four thread
In fact laptop faster processor far better graphic Macbook Air cost half much
These spec ME laptop based needed run program free student
I plenty experience design tool
Solidworks commonly used alternative heavier system requirement unspecific graphic hardware work I assume least
Note The recommended spec desktop workstation
VidRAM typical
Based spec laptop might best suit ME need See section detail since
Though relatively weak GPU still dedicated one
The quad core GTX considerably better previous Acer model plus includes backlit keyboard
While model may seem overpriced compared V especially worse CPU look way better opinion
Also Acer model stuff lot hardware cheap chassis Asus generally better quality look feel
It also lighter thinner
It come empty bay extra storage
Now proper rig editing graphic work even moderate gaming
While computing power marginally better sport twice CAD work often eats
Personally I big fan typical red n black gaming aesthetic laptop
It look le I prefer professional gaming laptop
This ultimately I got
Ultimately I chose based holiday sale offered time
I would recommend pursuing option condition nice sale
If uncompromised processing power machine back
The quad core beast
This option definitely powerful processor
You always
Keep mind Google search gaming laptop net plenty machine ME student need common get two class
Visit manufacturer webpage check pack capacity Wh specific model
You want beefy graphic power hungry
You typically run anything required engineering student campus desktop
So instance ME student afford laptop could always fall back campus resource get cheaper laptop
It also pay upgrade rather look fo whole new model come wanting
Online guide place Simply look laptop model look YouTube video tutorial
There chance done minute prior experience well longer count cloning time SSD swap
Remember Try spend le
Once cross line may well get desktop spend money saved good laptop
The performance desktop handily beat even mobile CPU desktop GTX ti edge mobile GTX
Together desktop component laptop spec would run easily
Good luck
go school see strong majority
student using mac
window preferred development environment amongst newer generation
sound much like advertisement window based I think sell MacBooks short based get money PDFs Movie Photo editing video codecs read write Microsoft office product plus plethora program ported Unix resale value longevity MacBook exceeds Windows laptop
Oh yeah run Windows natively
Excellent battery life
As senior IT support member major engineering university I tell used software run MACs user choose try problem child
Matlab autocad siemons ansys soldworks cmg abacus etc none work well mac please talk virtual machine running
We maybe Mac user mostly CS nobody Aero Me get Mac
Its preference way
Personally I happy junk window system Linux I get make decision market
This definitely true hardware engineering CS silicon valley least almost CS developer startup OS X
Of course future may change Ubuntu starting make dent least eye see
You almost use metric determine area person work
If carry around Mac engineer work software
If carry around Windows laptop hardware developer engineer
Don take wrong way I never intended article student silicon valley
The idea stretching dollar meet basic need student
Of course always get Mac ultrabook matter greatly exceed hardware need required student
I include Mac laptop list inadequate idea avoid overspending still capable machine
In word spend plenty
Because need
If article
I guess I reply followup I referring student
I talking location real job
I student I believe student become familiar relates profession training
If I professional EE I expect I hire comfortable tool industry generally expects used
If hand profession involves developing software run server likewise I expect I hire familiar tool used industry
I happen come latter industry prospective candidate know develop UNIX system preferably without IDEs I hire
Now statement general course exception center bell software developer position alike current dominant one software least location
As EE student I use Windows cause Circuit Simulation software available specifically use MultiSim I think lot CS major like Macs better programming environment offer
Also I disagree comment needing portability
Engineering student often need portability homework lab project require computer normally travel campus meet group member work friend
A lot EE friend I went ultrabooks light portable like Macbook Pros software need Windows pretty powerful EEs need much GPU rendering like MEs might CAD discrete graphic fine
Just curiosity get Acer Chromebook Chromebook run Eclipse
I impression run apps
I never owned one I really ignorant regard I think owning one time time always stop short I see severe limitation
Can anyone comment subject
Eclipse run Chrome OS confusion well warranted
You would need install Linux Windows like half price many Chromebooks Chromebook run Eclipse plenty Chrome OS programming environment
One great one I know Codeshare exactly replacement Eclipse still let code ton language color coded syntax save cloud storage free
My older brother said know several CS major university use Chromebooks main laptop I clue exact program use evidently substitute Eclipse I know
OK sound like I I known anyone actually one
I running Linux year usually use older used computer
I much budget new tend consider Chromebooks time time I seem hand hard earned cash
I hand noticing price dropping


way thank reply helpful
As Computer Science student I would find pick selection
important topic talking neural network application
If want high performance computing GPU must
Make sure nVidia GPU capable running CUDA DirectX higher new GPU
AMD might closing gap nVidia make life easier
Have considered ASUS ZenBook Pro computer Science Student
Will buying one laptop recommend provide low fps long time get response software
I still high school senior school laptop HP EliteBook folio integrated GPU includes processor ram While coding eclipse I get lagging using autocorrect option correct code wait long eclipse open
While modeling I find chrome IE explore always laggy sometimes crash I use tinker cad even run installation inventor
My laptop ASUS dual core ram integrated GPU difficult time installing Inventor Autodesk spends year minute open Inventor
My ASUS handle Inventor sure using draw model complete torture
Thus I worry ability recommended laptop consider buying mobile workstation
Workstations might overkill may I know performance laptop suggest
especially mechanical engineering category please regardless grammar spelling issue English first language I America year If pick one I recommend Mechanical Engineers specifically one discrete graphic handle Inventor fine
My current laptop nearly identical spec Inspiron handle problem even play modern game
I never issue speed using HP SSD main drive true laptop SSD demanding application

submitted I headed college soon parent offered buy laptop
If anyone CS kind spec I looking
Post comment
Check Currently CS uni
You really need good spec CS As far whilst get bang buck desktop ca beat portability laptop
You ca take desktop lecture take note wo wan na lug home holiday
Gon na get downvoted
But get macbook gaming
You going stuck compiling computer
Atleast I never use lab computer
Mac also let use Xcode neat ever develop io
Edit second monitor must
Trust I homebuilt desktop pc gaming recently got macbook pro college computer science love added winows using parallel window program Are fine would prefer
I prefer larger screen fairly cumbersome time
If value portability using class small desk maybe better
Its month since made comment honestly kinda wish went cheaper window laptop ecspecially
The macbook phenomenal trackpad really isnt worth cost fact thing dont sync easily macbook pc sometimes annoying
College freshman CS would recommend Windows Mac
Either would fine get make happy
Ah okay
One final question
Would better purchase desktop laptop
Your best bet would start taking class first option get laptop need arises
The professor tell exactly need
A desktop great gaming upgrading later laptop may better class
Some class thay require computer lab computer needed
I heading field planning buying surface pro come
Any thought would good CS
EDIT I desktop room surface note
I actually thing heading CS I desktop pretty well equipped I thinking
I worked well dell inspiron
It ram hdd
The merrier look quad core Avoid laptop dual core least RAM
Perhaps Lenovo Y series MSI series Laptop bad good
At
Source By I meant quad core laptop
Even watch make sure Q name dual core laptop typically branded Yeah friend dual core laptop
Depends programming
probably want something higher end want wait day code compile
Systems Design
Probably something decent sized screen copy Visio
Computer Science kind broad brush
Specific area
My son studying Engineering Lenovo Thinkpad great laptop plenty powerful run MATLAB different graphical apps run
I worked IT year
I Macbook laptop Dell Precision desktop
It also I game workhorse
Dual processor ram mean I compiling code I actually thing run
deleted Some people want wait
The developer I know rather talked office agreement macbook description would serve well
For Computer Science need normal laptop
If open word fine
For tech savvy
one NOT going computer science A Normal Laptop would appropriate
However I nearly done degree certificate I MUST say I needed pretty good laptop order everything required
That said
I extra laptop AMD RAM Hard drive LED x display AMD Radeon HD graphic
This type laptop give quite bit breathing room come CompSci
I hope serious said normal laptop sufficient Well telling monitor LED It tell tech savvy fine
Anyway I also study computer science would write code computer science standered laptop easy
I saying get terrible one I saying get standered one
When come work application word visual studio dont require must power computer science student anyway
At would require better storage
In case pretty standard
You might thinking CPU quad core matter
It IPC
Telling graphic make difference
I copied
I made sure miss obvious text savvy slightest
normal laptop LOL
I must hold rest reddit life
I tag RES Normal Laptop Guy In case Standered word definitely thing Standard come laptop even desktop
You would need fair amount RAM sufficient
You also need good processor LOT programming require
I usually I open time
Sometimes I like take break game two well
Just personal preference Also IPC used CompSci
At least PERSONAL computer
The class computer using IPC data server like uploading file teacher downloading file work homework
This NOT done personal computer
The thing I agree statement telling graphic make difference
I said sometimes want animation gaming
It run skyrim pretty nicely
I cant belive stupid post
I said sometimes want animation gaming
It run skyrim pretty nicely
We talking laptop Computer Science gaming
If wanted gaming laptop OP said
Also IPC used CompSci
At least PERSONAL computer
The class computer using IPC data server like uploading file teacher downloading file work homework
This NOT done personal computer
IPC Instructions per cycle
All CPU
You need googling
If dont understand dont talk crap lol
When I mean Standered I mean computer store offer typically
In day age sell laptop ram
But got Also IPC used CompSci
lmao
Ok
The Uni went must fail explain IPC
IPC used data server IPC communication activity sharing data across multiple commonly specialized process using communication protocol The time need share data across multiple process data server
I never share data across process
I yet class required anything like
Let alone teach IPC first place
waste time
Instructions per cycle done processor
You abbreviate something mean something else
IPC v Instructions per cycle
Totally different meaning
GHz minimum come instruction per cycle
I feel anything le slow work
Yes guy MIGHT end animation graphic card would help priority
Although bonus able game OP felt like
You seem think know bunch I think year old Googling information hoping know going college
I cant belive stupid
You might thinking CPU quad core matter
It IPC I wrote mean I clearly speaking Instruction per cycle
Dont try act smart lol You ignorant lol
But got laughing Yes guy MIGHT end animation graphic card would help priority
We talking computer science
Ram decent battery Screen processor afford quicker
Friends mine get old Lenovo Asus Transformer
I got Gigabyte want compact light gaming notebook travelling I really recommend
I computer science university get desktop possible
One monitor programming make want kill week
I three I still full two window per screen
Depends much money parent willing pay really
If lot go spec something
CS student special requirement except good Linux driver support
Old ThinkPads great value new one considerably le
Dell Latitudes bad either
stuff usually pretty safe bet
kind spec I looking
The screen top priority
Ideally better fine
garbage always dealbreaker
You need powerful CPU humble mobile fine
The quadcore CPUs nice certainly cheap
Avoid discrete GPUs add bulkiness cost
Unless planning pursuing game design something stick integrated graphic gaming home desktop
Get least RAM empty slot
ideal icing
An SSD essential feature sweat come HDD standard swap SSD later
Some ThinkPads swap optical drive HDD adapter UltraBay run SSD HDD machine best world
Battery life also concern kind battery life need
Just food thought
I usually work lab university I run remote session home
So compiling done university computer
But comp sci student probably wo write anything line compile second almost modern system
If possible suggestion get macbook solid get osx window linux running
This give access xcode crazy prof want use
And linux still popukar c assignment
course window useful c
Buy mac Loljk Use site constitutes acceptance

CNET forum help best source finding solution computer problem
You find discussion fixing problem computer hardware computer software Windows well network
I really looking thin lightweight computer
I looked MacBook Air I love everything except price processor speed OS
I know change Windows BootCamp slows computer little hastle
But computer could I
Here prospect spec Under pound Thickness Processor Speed higher preferably Intel Under Preferably Solid State Drive Also I completely wrong computer I looking towards please let know simply What would good computer Computer Science college
If asking technical help please sure include system info including operating system model number specific related problem
Also please exercise best judgment posting forum revealing personal information address telephone number address recommended
Most student want longer life span SSD advanced still finite life span device
The spec suspect Computer Science student would quibble inch versus LB versus
Your money something sound right
Bob If ask question like I question whether computer science degree going good fit
I run many computer science graduate might virtuoso Java come actually using program develop completely utterly lost
For example comment Boot Camp slows computer show little understanding Boot Camp
It collection Windows driver boot loader
So unless making broad sweeping generalization choose either Windows OS X every boot Boot Camp wo impact performance one way
Someone going succeed software development able discern observing program work
Also incoming freshman college even bother thinking laptop probably least two year
Once declared major actually get class major think thing
However people first two year college basically accelerated repeat high school
You spending first two year english class prereqs
You wo get anywhere near hardcore coding theory class
Also SSD software development would bad idea
You wear much faster average person temporary file compiler generate
Not mention larger project need lot storage space
You source file compiled version individual source file top executable support library built
These thing someone interested software development already aware considered hope much chance profession
Note This post edited forum moderator remove unnecessary paragraph life lesson
AM PT Not sure moderator would want remove valuable information like student loan debt survive declaring bankruptcy
It widely known fact many people end finding hard way
With tuition rate going double digit every semester taking time really think degree want pursue save LOT money whatever debt rack hound wherever go
It may something OP want hear moment final analysis probably agree something needed hear
That several indicator post suggest would making costly mistake going CS career
The CS field cutthroat one
You company like Microsoft swearing visa enough people graduating US university fill open job
Study study shown anything glut people coming US university company essentially bought enough politician keep getting increase number visa issued every year
A lot larger US based company come mind think software development simply interested hiring US citizen
That really tip iceberg labor abuse go pretty much standard practice much tech industry
Software developer one openly discriminated lot legal case
Like I tell someone looking major English Century Russian Poetry
Even burning passion consumes waking hour way going able make living
To work software developer generally invite treated like garbage
And good day
Things college telling student never college business quite happy let flush money proverbial toilet useless degree
Thank great information
I simply asked question computer judge book cover
But I greatly appreciate advice
I questioned whether go computer science
I really enjoy programming really want get better pretty much using computer
If computer science major propose
I going business I successful I want something I enjoy
Something along working computer programming
Do recommend Game Design
IT
Thank given great insight
If like programming plenty opportunity without get degree
You could get started open source project example
There plenty Windows even Linux
You involved free time hobby
Game design probably bad choice well
It sound great read story people work industry work insane hour
Based story I seen hour workweek uncommon week making final push get game door
It also become formulaic day one wanting take chance trying something new
So like cranking like Grand Theft Auto clone time time time much social life knock
IT bad either crazy good knowledge specific program platform people
People know thing like program custom SAP module example practically write check
The catch wo find SAP anywhere outside enterprise government
It big expensive
Database admins make decent money current love affair business cloud dwindling demand
My personal advice would get minor even double major something completely unrelated computer still enjoy
Just long something like Psychology need Masters someone research assistant
The IT world brutal
There plenty company simply want hire US citizen like constantly lobbying increase visa
Then also get company like ASUS discriminate unless specific race ethnicity
At least based experience friend mine corroborating comment people
ASUS employee give take friend saying number employee single digit
Not Asian employee seemed ethnically Chinese Taiwanese guess ASUS headquartered manufacturing
The math difficult one
From I heard Asian friend mine Asian tech company incredibly abusive even Asian employee Asian everyone else company basically descend upon like pack hyena basically
The simple truth unless luck working company treat employee like people instead cattle becoming increasingly rare burn quickly IT
You discriminated based age well IT
That work new college grad every month fresh group new college grad work lot le established life like
A maybe spouse kid pet car etc
Sooner later company looking lay staff raise promotion racked year make look like appealing candidate chopping block
So make sure fallback option age anything IT umbrella start become increasingly unemployable
It right fair reality getting worse
All politician get office come new interesting way defang agency like EEOC charged preventing sort thing millionaire billionaire benefactor make even money expense rest u
I ca stress enough important fallback option
Anyway rant going go IT advice would make sure skill set diverse possible
Do expect college course teach anything
Buy cheap older computer install Linux
Make sure know way around command line graphical environment like GNOME KDE
Just try thing heck worry break something
Learning fix broke valuable experience
Linux also wealth development tool opportunity get head start learning write code
Expose many different thing possibly make sure focus thing
The best way I think explaining spend time memorizing every single feature MS Word located
Spend time learning word processor work
So matter using WordPerfect anything else le equally proficient
Or put programming term every language basic construct variable loop keywords etc
A loop C work pretty much way loop
The syntax little different basic construct
Once learn pick almost language day since learning new key word slightly different structure
It like went England Australia speak English able understand everyone part sometimes word phrase unique particular dialect need learn
Focus thing different
And part ca stressed enough expose many different thing possible
If put experience program resume person interviewing ask right
Even better person interview familiar relatively obscure program impressed also know
Wow
That amazing
So thoroughly impressed thank much great information
It hard think response perfectly described situation really opened eye
I think I go computer science I eye set said look backup major even major separate programmer
Maybe business major I could take knowledge make business
Obviously I need thinking info gave going archive one great great advice
LOL remembring Charlie Chan show
She graduated Civil Engineer majored concrete structure currently work Maryland SHA
The one thing always complained using laptop school battery life
The second pain weak internal wireless
For switched using USB wifi device USB cord could move around best reception
Of course battery life past hour considered almost miracle
Since time charge issue college consider laptop economical low power squeeze every possible minute needing recharge
Another complaint fan making hot spot lap heat output factor consider
All point le speed economy use conveniently also mean economical price high powered laptop
Less spent computer battery power extra RAM advantage
As Robert pointed RAM may let run without pagefile save future writes SSD drive may installed laptop
You also turn lot logging activity save writes SSD add back bit speed
half price get hour cell battery
You also might consider running Linux later virtual box dual boot need power hog
That especially true go computer science programming
For instance info computer I using type time running Mint Linux day
I typically leave time since low power chip
Tonight I hour usual still using le MB GB RAM available
What looking utility use le power
I check college recommends preferred supplier
A remark You might prefer model serviced local repair shop case trouble model must send central service center state even worse country get back week later
Having working laptop might essential student Computer Science
If curriculum includes Game design might specific requirement graphic
If curriculum includes Linux consider ascertan install Linux separate partition
That somewhat easier running virtual machine
If curriculum includes lot graphic design might even recommend Macbook
Kees That great advice I thinking getting MacBook Pro seem powerful lot RAM SSD I put Windows BootCamp I switch OS whenever I want
What think
One best French door fridge tested A fridge useful feature like water pitcher FlexZone drawer
It performer cooling test

An extremely lightweight
Notebook typically weigh le pound small enough fit easily briefcase
Aside size principal difference notebook computer personal computer
Notebook computer use variety technique known produce lightweight display screen
The quality notebook display screen varies considerably
Many notebook display screen limited
screen produce sharp image rapidly
In term computing power modern notebook computer nearly equivalent personal computer
They capacity
However power small package expensive
Notebook computer come enable without plugging
However battery need recharged every hour

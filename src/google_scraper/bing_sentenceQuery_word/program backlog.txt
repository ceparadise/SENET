Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time
IBM short International Business Machines released IBM later IBM computer widely used exploration period device
Still working IBM computer frustrating misplaced much one letter one instruction program would crash would start whole process
During late computer science discipline much developmental stage issue commonplace
Time seen significant improvement usability effectiveness
Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base

Software engineering study designing implementing modifying software order ensure high quality affordable maintainable fast build
It systematic approach software design involving application engineering practice software
Software engineering deal organizing analyzing deal creation manufacture new software internal maintenance arrangement
Both computer application software engineer computer system software engineer projected among fastest growing occupation
The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

Below see python program act server listening connection request port The question function parameter method

Based tutorial around internet The backlog argument specifies maximum number queued connection least maximum value usually minimum value forced
But What queued connection
In simple word equal many pending connection queue hold
When multiple client would like connect server server hold incoming request queue
The client arranged queue server process request one one proceeds
This nature connection called queued connection
Does make change client request
I mean server running different server running accepting connection request receiving data
Yes case different
The first case would allow client arranged queue whereas case connection hold queue thereby resulting dropping connection request
Why minimum value zero
Should least
I idea Python C backlog argument may allow socket accept connection case length listen queue may set minimum value
Which value preferred
This question answer
I say depends nature application well hardware configuration software configuration
Again per source silently limited inclusive per C
Is backlog defined TCP connection UDP protocol
NO
Please note need listen accept unconnected datagram socket UDP
This one perk using unconnected datagram socket
But keep mind called TCPDatagramSocket backlog parameter
When TCP connection established called handshake performed
Both side exchanging packet connection called complete ready used application
However handshake take time
And time connection queued backlog
So set maximum amount incomplete parallel connection
If someone try establish connection backlog limit side refuse
So backlog limit pending connection established
Now higher backlog limit better case
Note maximum limit OS dependent
give Ubuntu

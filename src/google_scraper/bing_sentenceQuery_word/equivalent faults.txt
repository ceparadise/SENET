The major
It asks whether every problem whose solution quickly verified technically verified also solved quickly polynomial time
The underlying issue first discussed letter
The precise statement P versus NP problem introduced seminal paper The complexity theorem proving procedure considered many important open problem
It one seven selected carry US prize first correct solution
The informal term used mean existence algorithm solving task run time complete task varies polynomial function size input algorithm opposed say
The general class question algorithm provide answer polynomial time called class
For question known way find answer quickly one provided information showing answer possible verify answer quickly
The class question answer polynomial time called stand nondeterministic polynomial time
Consider example problem easy verify whose answer may difficult compute
Given partially Sudoku grid size least one legal solution
A proposed solution easily verified time check solution grows slowly polynomially grid get bigger
However known algorithm finding solution take difficult example time grows grid get bigger
So Sudoku quickly checkable seem quickly solvable
Thousands problem seem similar fast check slow solve
Researchers shown fast solution one problem could used build quick solution others property called
Decades searching yielded fast solution problem scientist suspect none problem solved quickly
However never proven
An answer question would determine whether problem verified polynomial time like Sudoku also solved polynomial time
If turned would mean problem harder compute verify could solved polynomial time answer could verified polynomial time
Aside important problem computational theory proof either way would profound implication mathematics cryptography algorithm research multimedia processing many field
Although versus problem formally defined previous inkling problem involved difficulty proof potential consequence
In mathematician John Nash wrote letter NSA speculated cracking sufficiently complex code would require time exponential length key
If proved Nash suitably skeptical would imply today would call since proposed key easily verified polynomial time
Another mention underlying problem occurred letter written
Gödel asked whether known could solved pointed one important discovery mathematical proof could automated
The relation studied part dealing resource required computation solve given problem
The common resource time many step take solve problem space much memory take solve problem
In analysis model computer time must analyzed required
Typically model assume computer given computer present state input one possible action computer might take performs action one
In theory class consists defined solved deterministic sequential machine amount time size input class consists decision problem whose positive solution verified given right information equivalently whose solution found polynomial time machine
Clearly
Arguably biggest open question concern relationship two class In poll researcher believed answer believed answer yes unsure believed question may currently accepted axiom therefore impossible prove disprove
In year later poll repeated
The number researcher answered believed answer believed answer yes believed question may currently accepted axiom therefore impossible prove disprove said either know care want answer yes problem resolved
To attack question concept useful
problem set problem reduced polynomial time whose solution may still verified polynomial time
That problem transformed problem
Informally problem problem least tough problem
problem least hard problem problem reduced polynomial time
problem need need solution verifiable polynomial time
For instance instance problem transformed mechanically instance Boolean satisfiability problem polynomial time
The Boolean satisfiability problem one many problem
If problem would follow
However many important problem shown fast algorithm known
Based definition alone obvious problem exist however trivial contrived problem formulated follows given description M guaranteed halt polynomial time exist input M accept
It given input simple check whether M accepts input simulating M verifier particular instance problem encoded machine M take solution verified input
Then question whether instance yes instance determined whether valid input exists
The first natural problem proven
As noted proof satisfiability contains technical detail Turing machine relate definition
However problem proved provided simpler way show many problem also including discussed earlier
In case proof show could solve Sudoku polynomial time could use complete polynomial time
This turn give solution problem partitioning triangle could used find solution provides solution general boolean satisfiability
So polynomial time solution Sudoku lead series mechanical transformation polynomial time solution satisfiability turn used solve problem polynomial time
Using transformation like vast class seemingly unrelated problem reducible one another sense problem
Although unknown whether problem outside known
A number succinct problem problem operate normal input computational description input known
Because shown problem outside require polynomial time
In fact solved significantly le exponential time
Examples include finding perfect strategy chess board board game
The problem deciding truth statement requires even time
Fischer proved every algorithm decides truth Presburger statement length runtime least constant
Hence problem known need exponential run time
Even difficult
They completely solved algorithm sense particular algorithm least one input algorithm produce right answer either produce wrong answer finish without giving conclusive answer otherwise run forever without producing answer
It also possible consider question decision problem
One class consisting counting problem called whereas problem asks Are solution
corresponding problem asks How many solution
Clearly problem must least hard corresponding problem since count possible solution immediately tell least one solution exists count greater zero
Surprisingly problem believed difficult correspond easy example problem
For problem easy tell whether solution exist thought hard tell many
Many problem hence among hardest problem since polynomial time solution would allow polynomial time solution problem
It shown Ladner exist problem neither
Such problem called problem
The example problem believed
They problem known
The computational problem determining whether two finite
An important unsolved problem complexity theory whether graph isomorphism problem
The answer known believed problem least
If graph isomorphism collapse second level
Since widely believed polynomial hierarchy collapse finite level believed graph isomorphism
The best algorithm problem due run time graph vertex
The computational problem determining given integer
Phrased decision problem problem deciding whether input factor le
No efficient integer factorization algorithm known fact form basis several modern cryptographic system algorithm
The integer factorization problem even
If problem polynomial time hierarchy collapse first level
The best known algorithm integer factorization take expected time factor integer
However best known problem run polynomial time although indicate problem lie respect complexity class
All discussion assumed mean easy mean hard assumption known
It common reasonably accurate assumption complexity theory however caveat
First always true practice
A theoretical polynomial algorithm may extremely large constant factor exponent thus rendering impractical
On hand even problem shown even may still effective approach tackling problem practice
There algorithm many problem solve optimality many instance reasonable time
The empirical time problem size algorithm surprisingly low
An example work surprisingly well practice despite exponential run par best known algorithm
Second type computation conform Turing machine model defined
According poll computer scientist believe
A key reason belief decade studying problem one able find algorithm important known problem see
These algorithm sought long concept even defined among first found existing problem time shown
Furthermore result would imply many startling result currently believed false
It also intuitively argued existence problem hard solve solution easy verify match experience
If world would profoundly different place usually assume
There would special value creative leap fundamental gap solving problem recognizing solution found
On hand researcher believe overconfidence believing researcher explore proof well
For example statement made The main argument favor total lack fundamental progress area exhaustive search
This opinion weak argument
The space algorithm large beginning exploration
The resolution also show simple question may settled deep theory
Being attached speculation good guide research planning
One always try direction every problem
Prejudice caused famous mathematician fail solve famous problem whose solution opposite expectation even though developed method required
One reason problem attracts much attention consequence answer
Either direction resolution would advance theory enormously perhaps huge practical consequence well
A proof could stunning practical consequence proof lead efficient method solving important problem
It also possible proof would lead directly efficient method perhaps proof size bounding polynomial big efficient practice
The consequence positive negative arise since various problem fundamental many field
Cryptography example relies certain problem difficult
A constructive efficient solution problem would break existing cryptosystems including These would need modified replaced solution inherently based equivalence
On hand enormous positive consequence would follow rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problem
For instance many problem type
Efficient solution problem would enormous implication logistics
Many important problem problem also problem efficiently solvable could spur considerable advance life science biotechnology
But change may pale significance compared revolution efficient method solving problem would cause mathematics
Gödel early thought computational complexity noted mechanical method could solve problem would revolutionize mathematics If really machine φ n k n even k n would consequence greatest importance
Namely would obviously mean spite undecidability mental work mathematician concerning question could completely replaced machine
After one would simply choose natural number n large machine deliver result make sense think problem
Similarly say would transform mathematics allowing computer find formal proof theorem proof reasonable length since formal proof easily recognized polynomial time
Example problem may well include
Research mathematician spend career trying prove theorem proof taken decade even century find problem instance took three century prove
A method guaranteed find proof theorem one exist reasonable size would essentially end struggle
stated come believe P NP reserved impact possible proof I believe equality P NP turn helpful even proved proof almost surely nonconstructive
A proof showed would lack practical computational benefit proof would nevertheless represent significant advance computational complexity theory provide guidance future research
It would allow one show formal way many common problem solved efficiently attention researcher focused partial solution solution problem
Due widespread belief much focusing research already taken place
Also still leaf open hard problem
For example possible SAT requires exponential time worst case almost randomly selected instance efficiently solvable
described five hypothetical world could result different possible resolution complexity question
These range Algorithmica problem like SAT solved efficiently instance Cryptomania generating hard instance problem outside easy three intermediate possibility reflecting different possible distribution difficulty instance problem
The world problem tractable average case called Heuristica paper
A workshop studied status five world
Although problem remains open despite prize huge amount dedicated research effort solve problem led several new technique
In particular fruitful research related problem showing existing proof technique powerful enough answer question thus suggesting novel technical approach required
As additional evidence difficulty problem essentially known proof technique fall one following classification known insufficient prove These barrier another reason problem useful algorithm demonstrated problem would solve problem way excluded result
These barrier also led computer scientist suggest versus problem may standard axiom system like proved disproved within
The interpretation independence result could either algorithm exists problem proof constructed
ZFC algorithm problem may exist impossible prove ZFC algorithm correct
However shown using technique sort currently known applicable problem decided even much weaker assumption extending PA integer arithmetic would necessarily exist algorithm every problem
Therefore one belief complexity theorist problem efficient algorithm would follow proof independence using technique possible
Additionally result implies proving independence PA ZFC using currently known technique easier proving existence efficient algorithm problem
While versus problem generally considered unsolved many amateur professional researcher claimed solution
comprehensive list
As list contained purported proof
An August claim proof Vinay Deolalikar researcher received heavy Internet press attention initially described relatively serious attempt two leading specialist
The proof reviewed publicly academic expert field pointed two possibly fatal error proof
In September Deolalikar reported working detailed expansion attempted proof
However opinion expressed several notable theoretical computer scientist indicate attempted proof neither correct significant advancement understanding problem
This assessment prompted May article call proof attempt thoroughly discredited
The problem restated term expressible certain class logical statement result work
Consider language finite structure fixed including relation
Then language expressed addition suitable least
Effectively combination order allows definition recursive function
As long signature contains least one predicate function addition distinguished order relation amount space taken store finite structure actually polynomial number element structure precisely characterizes
Similarly set language expressible existential logic restricted exclude relation function subset
The language correspond logic
Thus question proper subset reformulated existential logic able describe language finite linearly ordered structure nontrivial signature logic least fixed point
The word existential even dropped previous characterization since former would establish turn implies
No algorithm problem known run polynomial time
However algorithm known problem property algorithm run polynomial time accepting instance although enormous constant making algorithm impractical
However algorithm qualify polynomial time running time rejecting instance polynomial
The following algorithm due without citation example
It correctly accepts language
It run polynomial time input If algorithm accepting language
Accepting mean give yes answer polynomial time allowed run forever answer also known
This algorithm enormously impractical even
If shortest program solve polynomial time bit long algorithm try least program first
Conceptually speaking problem take input alphabet Σ output yes
If say unbounded memory produce correct answer input string length step constant independent input string say problem solved place class
Formally defined set language decided deterministic Turing machine
That deterministic Turing machine deterministic Turing machine satisfies following two condition defined similarly using nondeterministic Turing machine traditional way
However modern approach define use concept
Formally defined set language finite alphabet verifier run polynomial time notion verifier defined follows
Let language finite alphabet Σ
exists binary relation positive integer following two condition satisfied A Turing machine decides called called
In general verifier
However must verifier run polynomial time
Let Clearly question whether given equivalent question whether member COMPOSITE
It shown COMPOSITE verifying satisfies definition identify natural number binary representation
COMPOSITE also happens
There many equivalent way describing
Let language finite alphabet following two condition satisfied Alternatively another problem reduced
This common way proving new problem

The question whether perhaps famous Computer Science
What mean
And interesting
Oh extra credit please post proof statement truth falsehood
Questions Stack Overflow expected relate programming within scope
Consider editing question leaving comment improvement believe question reworded fit within scope
Read
P stand polynomial time
NP stand polynomial time
Definitions mean complexity algorithm O n size data number element list sorted k constant
time measured number operation would take function number data item
whatever make sense basic operation particular task
For sorting basic operation comparison
For matrix multiplication basic operation multiplication two number
Now question deterministic mean
There abstract computational model imaginary computer called Turing machine TM
This machine finite number state infinite tape discrete cell finite set symbol written read
At given time TM one state looking particular cell tape
Depending read cell write new symbol cell move tape one cell forward backward go different state
This called state transition
Amazingly enough carefully constructing state transition design TM equivalent computer program written
This used theoretical model proving thing computer
There two kind TM concern u deterministic
A deterministic TM one transition state symbol reading tape
A TM may several transition able check several possibility simultaneously
This sort like spawning multiple thread
The difference TM spawn many thread want real computer specific number thread executed time equal number CPUs
In reality computer basically deterministic TMs finite tape
On hand TM physically realized except maybe quantum computer
It proven problem solved TM solved deterministic TM
However clear much time take
The statement mean problem take polynomial time TM one build deterministic TM would solve problem also polynomial time
So far nobody able show done nobody able prove done either
problem mean NP problem X NP problem Y reduced X polynomial reduction
That implies anyone ever come solution problem also give solution NP problem
Thus would prove
Conversely anyone prove P would certain way solve NP problem polynomial time conventional computer
An example problem problem finding truth assignment would make boolean expression containing n variable true
For moment practice problem take polynomial time TM done exponential time deterministic TM conventional computer
For example way solve truth assignment problem try possibility
Intuitively see problem
Given potential answer problem verify answer simply recalculating answer
Less obvious much difficult answer whether problem
Does fact verify answer polynomial time mean compute answer polynomial time
There large number important problem known basically problem proven problem proven
If problem proven efficient polynomial time solution
Most scientist believe
However proof yet established either
If anyone provides proof either conjecture
To give simplest answer I think Suppose problem take certain number input various potential solution may may solve problem given input
A logic puzzle puzzle magazine would good example input condition George live blue green house potential solution list statement George life yellow house grows pea owns dog
A famous example Traveling Salesman problem given list city time get city time limit potential solution would list city order salesman visit would work sum travel time le time limit
Such problem NP efficiently check potential solution see work
For example given list city salesman visit order add time trip city easily see time limit
A problem P efficiently find solution one exists
Efficiently precise mathematical meaning
Practically mean large problem unreasonably difficult solve
When searching possible solution inefficient way would list possible potential solution something close efficient way would require searching much limited set
Therefore problem expressed way If verify solution problem sort described efficiently find solution prove none efficiently
The obvious answer Why able
pretty much matter stand today
Nobody able prove one way another bother lot mathematician computer scientist
That anybody prove solution million dollar Claypool Foundation
We generally assume P equal NP general way find solution
If turned lot thing would change
For example cryptography would become impossible sort privacy verifiability Internet
After efficiently take encrypted text key produce original text could efficiently find key without knowing beforehand
Password cracking would become trivial
On hand whole class planning problem resource allocation problem could solve effectively
You may heard description
An problem one NP course interesting property P every NP problem
If could find way efficiently solve Traveling Salesman problem logic puzzle puzzle magazine could efficiently solve anything NP
An problem way hardest sort NP problem
So find efficient general solution technique problem prove exists fame fortune
A short summary humble knowledge There easy computational problem like finding shortest path two point graph calculated pretty fast O n size input k constant case graph number vertex edge
Other problem like finding path cross every vertex graph getting RSA private key public key harder O
But CS speak tell problem deterministic one however transform finine automaton like regex parser deterministic one well machine take long
That try every possible path usually smart CS professor exclude one
It interresting nobody even idea sollution
Some say true say false consensus
Another interresting thing sollution would harmfull key encriptions like RSA
You could break easily generating RSA key
And pretty inspiring problem
There much I add NP part question regard proof
Not would proof worth extra credit would solve one
An interesting poll recently conducted definitely worth reading regard subject proof
First definition A particular problem P compute solution time le size input
For instance sorting done le sorting polynomial time
A problem NP exists exists solution size verify time
Take graph given graph list vertex color pair size verify time whether neighbor different color
So graph short readily verifiable solution
An equivalent definition NP problem solvable ondeterministic Turing machine olynomial time
While tell name come give intuitive feel NP problem like
Note P subset NP find solution polynomial time solution verified polynomial time check given solution equal one find
Why question interesting
To answer one first need see problem
Put simply Note instance L must computable polynomial size size L way solving problem polynomial time give u polynomial time solution NP problem
Here example suppose know graph problem
We want prove deciding satisfiability boolean formula problem well
For vertex v two boolean variable requirement pair value think color
For edge u v requirement
That enumerating equal configuration stipulation neither case
together constraint give boolean formula polynomial size
You check take polynomial time compute well straightforward stuff per vertex per edge
If solve boolean formula I made also solve graph coloring pair variable let color v one matching value variable
By construction formula neighbor wo equal color
Hence graph
We know graph however historically come know first showing reducing instead way around

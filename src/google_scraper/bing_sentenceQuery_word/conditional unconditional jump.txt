A instruction cause computer begin executing different instruction sequence thus deviate default behavior executing instruction order
may also refer act switching execution different instruction sequence result executing branch instruction
A branch instruction either always result branching may may cause branching depending condition
Branch instruction used implement program loop conditionals executing particular sequence instruction certain condition satisfied
Mechanically branch instruction change PC
The program counter memory address next instruction
Therefore branch cause CPU begin fetching instruction different sequence memory cell
When branch CPU program counter set jump instruction
So next instruction becomes instruction address
Therefore flow control change
When branch CPU program counter unchanged
Therefore next instruction executed instruction branch instruction
Therefore flow control unchanged
The term used referring program high level language well program written
In branch usually take form various form encapsulate instruction sequence executed condition satisfied
Unconditional branch instruction used unconditionally jump begin execution different instruction sequence
Machine level branch instruction sometimes called instruction
Machine level jump instruction typically form latter may depending condition
Usually distinct form jump often called subroutine invokations known automatically save originating address return address stack allowing single subroutine invoked multiple location code
In CPUs earlier instruction set condition flag register
The earlier instruction may instruction
It often close branch though necessarily instruction branch
The stored condition used branch
This temporary information often stored flag register may also located elsewhere
A flag register design simple slower simple computer
In fast computer flag register place bottleneck speed instruction could otherwise operate parallel several need set flag bit particular sequence
There also machine particular instruction condition may checked jump instruction
In simple computer design comparison branch execute arithmetic use power flag register branch
In fast computer design comparison branch run faster flag register branch comparison branch access register parallelism using CPU mechanism calculation
Some early simple CPU architecture still found microcontrollers may implement conditional jump rather conditional skip next instruction operation
A conditional jump call thus implemented conditional skip unconditional jump call instruction
Depending jump instruction typically shortened form word word often along informative letter extra parameter representing condition
Sometimes detail included well range jump offset size special addressing mode used locate actual effective offset
This table list machine level branch jump instruction found several architecture VAX others set signal clear signal
ARM PIC others opposite subtractive operation
This inverted function carry flag certain instruction marked part table otherwise noted
However carry additive operation handled way architecture
To achieve high performance modern processor
They consist multiple part partially process instruction feed result next stage pipeline start working next instruction program
This design expects instruction execute particular unchanging sequence
Conditional branch instruction make impossible know sequence
So conditional branch cause stall pipeline restarted different part program
Several technique improve speed reducing stall conditional branch
Historically branch prediction took statistic used result optimize code
A programmer would compile test version program run test data
The test code counted branch actually taken
The statistic test code used compiler optimize branch released code
The optimization would arrange fastest branch direction taken would always frequently taken control flow path
To permit CPUs must designed least predictable branch timing
Some CPUs even instruction set designed branch hint compiler tell CPU branch taken
The problem software branch prediction requires complex software development process
To run software hardware moved statistic electronics
Branch predictor part processor guess outcome conditional branch
Then processor logic gamble guess beginning execute expected instruction flow
An example simple hardware branch prediction scheme assume backward branch
smaller program counter taken part loop forward branch larger program counter taken leave loop
Better branch predictor developed validated statistically running simulation variety test program
Good predictor usually count outcome previous execution branch
Faster expensive computer run faster investing better branch prediction electronics
In CPU hardware branch prediction branch hint let compiler presumably superior branch prediction override hardware simplistic branch prediction
Some logic written without branch fewer branch
It often possible use instead branch
Another technique
In approach one instruction branch always executed
Therefore computer use instruction useful work whether pipeline stall
This approach historically popular computer
In family compatible CPUs complicates multicycle CPUs pipeline faster CPUs pipeline superscalar CPUs execute instruction order

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I fill documentation regarding C project worked
One topic whether I used unconditional jump
As far I know break statement count jump
And I fire condition loop met
Does make conditional jump
Another example standard break statement switch case conditional unconditional
Basically constitutes unconditional jump C
It matter terminology
IMHO body inconditional jump
So obviously conditional jump
In I would believe conditional
Some people might object previous statement entire block conditional BTW I heard speaking machine code everything else
Read also I believe bureaucracy asking used could ask management client really meant
I feel sorry lose time IMHO stupid useless question
Conditional mean may followed depending condition
Unconditional mean program flow reach point always continue target
A conditional jump
At end clause unconditional jump clause
switch also unconditional

You code instruction
However high level language must able handle conditional statement loop
ISAs support block programming support traditional loop
Instead support conditional unconditional jump essentially statement
This probably demonstrated pointing code board power point slide perhaps using debugger
However jump implemented jumping abstract concept
Here happens
At point time executing instruction
This instruction appears memory address
The hidden register program counter store address instruction currently executed
When conditional jump occurs condition checked
If condition true jump occurs
A jump mean updating PC instruction execute turn cause instruction fetched run
If condition false instruction PC executed
PC address next instruction
We add instead address memory store one byte MIPS instruction requires four byte memory
An unconditional jump always occurs
There condition check
A conditional jump called MIPS
There list instruction look
The offset value except bit UB
instruction branch instruction
Notice instruction format format
Just instruction used jumping mean instruction
It format matter
How value used compute address jump condition true
You want use bit immediate value address jump limit jump
MIPS bit address
If use bit using small fraction possible address
To think reasonable solution ask branch occurs program
They occur loop conditional statement
Most loop conditional statement occur within statement code
Even expect C statement may translate MIPS instruction jump expected jump within several thousand instruction jump instruction
Therefore make sense jump relative current instruction
This kind jumping called add offset program counter
If naively jump anywhere PC PC range value bit
However naive
Instructions bit long
Thus quantity
In MIPS quantity must stored address mean address must divisible
This mean never jump address divisible
Thus immediate value would useless immediate value end end
The better idea realize want jump address divisible store immediate value
This similar idea hidden used floating point
Just think hidden
In effect immediate value tell many instruction jump forward backwards
To compute address branch instruction take bit immediate value
Then shift left bit fill low bit
The result allows jump four time far
You jump anywhere PC PC
Notice subtract multiplied limit value limit value
This semantics instruction
The new address computed taking upper bit PC concatenated bit immediate value lower two bit address created remains
This called
Direct addressing would specify bit
It called bit PC used compute address
allows access possible address
In subroutine call jump subroutine basically function call
When done subroutine jump back instruction
In MIPS used subroutine call
How get back subroutine call
You need store
This return address PC stored
When subroutine call finished run instruction cause PC assigned address
That cause control flow return instruction return call
CISC processor often register
Instead storing return address register return address often stored stack memory
Storing register advantage quick
Memory much slower comparison
Of course may wonder happens call made subroutine
Wo return address overwritten new return address
That true
In case must place return address onto stack
Using register help delay use stack somewhat
If many call subroutine saving return address register offer speed improvement
Since register specified instruction
They
This unusual could
However making use function bit
The semantics The semantics Labels make easier ISA programmer write program
That way compute offset
The assembler computes offset following way
Instead using current instruction computes
For example let instruction parenthesis comment
The target instruction appears
It instruction
So subtract
The offset
The rule applies even branch backwards
In case branch instruction instruction
The target instruction instruction
So
The offset
This would converted bit stored immediate part instruction
You might wonder compute
Why
Once instruction fetched PC often incremented PC next instruction memory anticipation next instruction fetched
So easier computation PC
You may also wonder I numbered instruction
How I decide certain instruction instruction
It turn matter
Pick number want Instead making first instruction instruction I made instruction
If computation get
Recall computation compute long instruction numbered ascending order get result regardless instruction number start
This kind address computation called since computed based value PC program counter
addressing one disadvantage compared addressing
It harder relocate code
Relocating code mean place code different address memory
Typically program would rewrite instruction use direct addressing instruction jump might particular location memory since program
This similar informing various institution moved
You tell new address mail stuff old address
Similarly program loaded different address assembler expected instruction like may need updated
like need since relative addressing work location memory
These day virtual memory necessary relocate code
Virtual memory covered future set note
The dash encoding register number UB
For example encoded
The offset represented
If look unusual
For example instruction bit normally used otherwise instruction invalid
use special opcode
For unsual use instruction bit bit normally used used like function bit instruction
instruction
You notice bit set refers register
As turn take optional second argument specify return address register
When specified assembler fill bit
This option available since return address used
Finally instruction
The dash target us addressing

transfer also known conditional branching whereby would able jump different instruction depending value data
This extremely powerful feature missing many early computer century
transfer also known conditional branching whereby would able jump different instruction depending value data
This extremely powerful feature missing many early computer century

The conditional control structure allows program follow alternative path execution
Iteration looping give computer much power
They repeat sequence step often necessary appropriate repetition quite simple step solve computer Colossus conditional ability execute different instruction alter order execution instruction based value data
For instance IF X THEN GO TO LINE
This gave ENIAC lot flexibility machine conditional ability execute different instruction alter order execution instruction based value data
For instance IF X THEN GO TO LINE
This gave ENIAC lot

Doing compiler design course What meant conditional jump instruction
I based programmer code sample paradigm could share help understand better
What mean unlimited conditional jump instruction
An example statement book Many processor conditional jump instruction conditional jump limited range
For example target jump may byte away current program counter
Sometimes assembler processor still allows unlimited conditional jump
Would I know assembler programming understand
I love link reference material reading
Many processor conditional jump instruction conditional jump limited range
For example target jump may byte away current program counter
Take conditional jump like example mean jump processor Zero flag set would set cleared previous arithmetic operation
The opcode operand say far jump
For opcode operand encoded using single byte
first byte opcode interpreted operand next byte begining next opcode specify jump plus minus byte
It us short operand short jump common case optimization common case help make overall code smaller
Sometimes assembler processor still allows unlimited conditional jump
This mean write assembly write even distant label byte away
How CPU support short conditional jump
Probably assembler assembly language like compiler automatically insert extra necessary opcodes actually end emitted something like I think address question Microchip series example branch command command
They effectively difference command jump location word location us one word program memory
A command jump program memory requires two word program memory allow jumping anywhere
If incorrectly try branching label far away compiler give error
Those extra word make difference say word program memory course
unconditional jump however several conditional branch command branch carry branch zero branch zero etc check status register last arithmetic operation perform branch specified condition true
If need conditional would something like Where perform two sleep moment decrement variable named zero unconditionally jump code labeled zero jump back label
mean Decrement skip zero Regarding start definition There two usual form branch instruction conditional branch either taken taken depending condition CPU flag unconditional branch always taken
The C statement compiled conditional jump assembly operator
While statement compiled unconditional jump operator
Regarding jump The range distance memory address jump instruction address jumping
The article wikipedia give information matter
You know assembler programming order understand subject I recommend learn basic CPU architecture
A conditional jump would logically turn statement The line would turn assembly command Now unlimited conditional jump I assume mean far jump
A conditional jump like An unconditional jump like I know unlimited mean though
It could specific particular processor discussion
In short term Conditional mean something like That mean program flow changed depending ot conditional expression
Unconditional jump typical compiler implementation goto statement function call

What come mind hear term punch list
No list people would like hit
But good guess
A written inventory detail task must completed construction project considered done
It part specific process often official document
During long construction project might take month several year think building skyscraper small detail sometimes missed like individual electrical figure fine finish door handle
These might seem like trivial thing someone paying new building want everything corrected finished completely
A punch list mean ensuring nothing left undone
The term often used building construction trade although also used general project management
It created form itemized list checked thorough review near end construction project
Compiling punch list almost always involves building site construction party involved
Such meeting include number people architect builder contractor subcontractor property owner
As examine every inch site discus detail need done list may include everything paint finish hardware detail redoing edge siding clearing removing debris property
Nothing small final part process everyone get paid project considered completed
While creating itemized list common form builder use compile punch list way organizing process documenting required task
Sometimes builder use floor plan carefully numbering item room must done organizing task copy plan
A punch list also done using room plan room printed page along specific numbered element addressed corrected completed
Whatever method used goal careful methodical completion last minute error unfinished detail
Get FREE access day create account
Some company use idea meaning list thing constantly review project underway
They periodic inspection phase construction goal avoiding last minute issue error correction
The goal nothing list meaning problem addressed end construction
A final inspection required punch list considered completed involves signature party involved
Sometimes final percentage payment withheld last step process done
A written inventory task completed building project considered finished
While typically form itemized list punch list also found directly copy floor plan even basis
Punch list tool often used construction building trade helpful focusing work end project
In fact project considered complete final payment made item punch list completed

In represents countable number ordered value may occur
An instance list computer representation concept finite potentially infinite analog list
Lists basic example contain value
If value occurs multiple time occurrence considered distinct item
The name also used several concrete used implement abstract list especially
Many provide support special syntax semantics list list operation
A list often constructed writing item sequence separated within pair delimiters
Some language may allow list type like case data type accurately described array
In list usually provided subclass generic list class traversed via separate
List data type often implemented using linked list sort may appropriate application
In context programming term list may refer specifically linked list rather array
In abstract list usually defined two operation yield empty list add item beginning list
Implementation list data structure may provide following Lists typically implemented either either singly doubly linked usually variable length
The standard way implementing list originating programming language element list contain value pointer indicating location next element list
This result either depending whether list nested sublists
Some older Lisp implementation Lisp implementation also supported compressed list using special internal representation invisible user
Lists manipulated using
The former often preferred latter norm
Lists implemented holding pair providing access element
residing fringe internal node storing child index used guide search taking time logarithmic list size long change much provide illusion enable swap prefix append operation logarithmic time well
Some language offer list offer use kind table emulate list
For example provides table
Although Lua store list numerical index array internally still appear dictionary
In list fundamental data type represent program code data
In dialect list first three prime number could written
In several dialect Lisp including list collection pair consisting value pointer next pair null value making singly linked list
As name implies list used store list element
However unlike traditional list expand shrink stored dynamically memory
In computing list easier implement set
A finite mathematical sense realized list additional restriction duplicate element disallowed order irrelevant
Sorting list speed determining given item already set order ensure order requires time add new entry list
In efficient implementation however set implemented using rather list
Lists also form basis including variation
The abstract list type element type list defined following function axiom element list
It implicit Note first nil rest nil defined
These axiom equivalent abstract data type
In definition simply regarded defined term constructor
In algebraic term represented transformation
obtained constructor separately handling case
The list type form following function using rather represent monomorphic list element type defined Alternatively monad may defined term operation Note since applied progressively deeper argument recursive call
The list type additive monad monadic zero monadic sum
Lists form operation
The identity element monoid empty list
In fact set list element

Written
Posted All across internet punch list considered document list item define work conform contract specification substantial completion project
Where true see punch list item conform contract specification
A good punch list define item need addressed final occupancy include plan completion
The list include minor repair finish cleanup outstanding installation remaining
In case punch list also include final addition scope new last minute detail
By preparing complete accurate punch list entire construction team clear understanding detail remaining everyone leave happy
Typically contractor set meeting client punch list walk
As client prepared walk
Visit site meeting good understanding work taken place look left
Don use walk contractor discovery session
By prior preparation ask better question contractor case tradesman completing punch
At time critical make sure expectation clearly communicated everyone know want see
Construction long process punch almost complete
The general contractor prepared walk client point remaining item list
They use meeting show work give eye detail
Good contractor able show client item punch list
However contractor represents client consult assist client thing feel client would like see
The subcontractor responsibility ensure actual punch list task get completed completed high level workmanship
The expectation always task completed efficiently timely manner
However often item come end project add scope work
The subcontractor know change outside original scope work communicate extra cost schedule
Following following biggest responsibility subcontractor
Architects designer often attend punch list walk ensure drawing fact built
They responsible point anything built specified drawing
However case field engineering design change may accurate drawing rather client requested
In case architect designer need okay change even though original design
They lead conversation ensure client got design intended
Now role responsibility defined left get done
The Punch list critical step construction process
It truly final task delivering successful construction project item conform contract It entire team working together delivering project proud
If end project ask general contractor set Punch list walk
However started project yet check
Ensuring partner general contractor help make punch list shorter importantly entire construction experience better

I familiar concept vector magnitude direction I also keep coming across reference vector context programming example seems stl library come fairly frequently SO
My intuition context fairly primitive construct often used represent something along line variable length array storing size magnitude I presume would really helpful somebody could provide complete explanation preferably including used practice
From Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Furthermore vector typically hold object make class hold information vehicle store fleet vector
Nice thing vector aside resizing still allow access constant time individual element via index like array
The tradeoff resizing hit current capacity reallocate sometimes copy memory
However capacity increasing algorithm double capacity time hit barrier never hit heap available turn perhaps dozen time worst case throughout program operation
In mathematics vector thought combination direction magnitude
However also thought coordinate
For example vector magnitude angle degree horizontal represents point plane
This point also represented Cartesian coordinate pair
This pair also mathematical vector
In programming name vector originally used describe sequence scalar number
A vector length represents point plane vector length represents point space
A vector length represents point space mathematician trouble thinking thing
In modern programming library name vector come generally mean sized sequence value necessarily number
Changing size length dimensionality mathematical vector something would normally unless kind projection operation
But changing length programming vector contains sequence string might common operation
The mathematical vector used data structure computer science necessarily obey tensor transformation rule
They array expand contract noted earlier
Vector container implemented dynamic array Just regular array vector container element stored contiguous storage location mean element accessed using iterators also using offset regular pointer element
But unlike regular array storage vector handled automatically allowing expanded contracted needed
Vectors good Since least two answer pasted might also want read rest description I understand confusion name I used confused
It helped idea Vector graphic programming closer mathematical definition
In math Vector thought matrix arbitrary length length number dimension coordinate system
In OO language vector essentially matrix array hence name
They anything coordinate unless programmer decides use task rare I never seen
They also usually mathematical operator matrix multiplication similar operation
So nature similarity end
I leave answer explain feature us OO container already handle
From To model computer memory use new kind data structure called vector
Abstractly vector compound data object whose individual element accessed mean integer index amount time independent index
Vectors programming basically dynamic array storage handled automatically allowing expanded contracted best thing also allow access constant time individual element via index like regular array
lot information need understand surround question
It contrast vector array
Also Stroustrup chapter Most computing involves creating collection
A class main purpose holding object called
The useful container
A sequence element given type
The element stored contiguously memory
So STL vector collection value way like mathematical meaning
Besides data structure vector also term pointer code

interrupt vector point interrupt code invoked
To help remember CS meaning word may helpful refer Latin root vehere mean convey carry
Thus vector carry contains thing generally speaking

A document prepared near end construction project listing work conforming contract specification must complete prior final payment
The work may include incomplete incorrect installation incidental damage existing finish material structure
In United States industry contract agreement usually written allow owner withhold retain final payment
The contractor bound contract complete list contract item called punch list order receive final payment owner
The designer typically licensed Professional usually also incorporated contract owner design representative verify completed contract work complied design
In contract General Conditions Contract requires Contractor belief declare reached substantial completion request
According General Conditions Section Contractor prepares submits comprehensive list item completed corrected
This snag list generated Contractor known punch list
Upon receipt Contractor list Architect inspects work determine Work substantially complete
Final contractor payment made punch list item completed meet project design required contract mutually agreed resolution item reached
Examples punch list item include damaged building component
repair broken window replace stained wallboard repair cracked paving etc
problem final installation building material equipment
reinstall peeling carpet replace missing roof shingle fire pressure test boiler obtain elevator use permit activate security system etc
The phrase take name one hypothesis historical process punching hole margin document next one item list
This indicated work completed particular construction task
Two copy list punched time provide identical record architect contractor
Starting mobile software became popular many construction team started using manage punch list
Today variety punch list application ranging simple comprehensive mobile platform

In country punch list part construction contract otherwise used way meet quality term stated
If task punch list completed satisfyingly large final payment withheld punch list completed
A quick Google search teach term punch list take name old process actually punching hole list item need fixing
If located Ireland United Kingdom might know term snag list
Today punch list primarily done electronically ever often supported digital photo documentation
Clearly stated contract document efficient issue management key satisfied owner client teamworkers manager contractor
When contractor proposes work substantially completed also submit snag list
The definition substantial completion clearly defined The American Institute Architects AIA General Conditions Contract Construction Substantial Completion stage progress Work Work designated portion thereof sufficiently complete accordance Contract Documents Owner occupy utilize Work intended In next section AIA condition term punch list defined prerequisite proposing work substantially complete contractor shall prepare submit Architect comprehensive list item completed corrected prior final When reaching deadline substantial completion punch listis great importance
The owner responsible contractor still complete every item punch list
Hence clear digital punch list extremely helpful tool
Both owner contractor able see progress item work finally complete
A digital paperless snag list quickly shared numerous people
Issue management right software app IssMan quickly create documentation even delegate task digitally team member
This mean le time office time site
There huge advantage digital punch list app contractor site manager also property owner punch list great tool systemize issue
Furthermore opportunity follow progress issue snag list priceless

In property true iteration
It sometimes checked within code call
Knowing invariant essential understanding effect loop
In particularly loop invariant expressed formal used prove property loop extension employ loop usually property
The loop invariant true entry loop following iteration exit loop loop invariant loop termination condition guaranteed
From programming methodology viewpoint loop invariant viewed abstract specification loop characterizes deeper purpose loop beyond detail implementation
A survey article cover fundamental algorithm many area computer science searching sorting optimization arithmetic etc
characterizing viewpoint invariant
Because similarity loop program proving partial correctness loop invariant similar proving correctness recursive program via
In fact loop invariant often inductive hypothesis proved recursive program equivalent given loop
involves moving code loop change effect program directly related loop invariant property loop overall
The following return maximum value argument array provided length least
Comments provided line
Each comment make assertion value one variable stage function
The highlighted assertion within loop body beginning end loop line exactly
They thus describe invariant property loop
When line reached invariant still hold known loop condition line become false
Both property together imply equal maximum value correct value returned line
Following paradigm loop condition line better modified order avoid endless looping illegitimate negative value
While change code intuitively make difference reasoning leading correctness becomes somewhat complicated since known line
In order obtain also hold condition included loop invariant
It easy see invariant loop since line obtained modified loop condition line hence hold line incremented line
However loop invariant manually provided formal program verification intuitively obvious property like often overlooked
Specifically governed following rule inference This mean In word The rule deductive step premise
This triple actually machine state
It hold whenever starting state boolean expression true successfully executing code called machine end state true
If relation proven rule allows u conclude successful execution program lead state true state hold
The boolean formula rule known loop invariant
The loop invariant play important role intuitive argument soundness rule loop
The loop invariant true iteration loop body also iteration loop body
Since loop precisely repeated iteration loop body follows invariant true entering loop must also true exiting loop
The following example illustrates rule work
Consider program One prove following Hoare triple The condition loop
A useful loop invariant guessed turn appropriate
Under assumption possible prove following Hoare triple While triple derived formally rule logic governing assignment also intuitively justified Computation start state true mean simply true
The computation add mean still true integer x
Under premise rule loop permit following conclusion However le equal le wanted show
The property another invariant example loop trivial property another one
Applying inference rule former invariant yield
Applying invariant yield slightly expressive
The programming language provides native support loop invariant
A loop invariant expressed syntax used
In sample loop invariant expression must true following loop initialization execution loop body checked runtime
The programming language also provides support loop invariant
Loop invariant expressed using one clause following illustrates The function determines largest element integer array
For defined array must contain least one element
The require returned value smaller element match least one element
The loop invariant defined inductively two clause corresponds clause postcondition
The fundamental difference clause loop invariant identifies result correct current element whilst postconditions identify result correct element
A loop invariant serve one following purpose For natural language comment like example sufficient
For programming language support required library clause Eiffel
Often checking switched debugging run production run compiler runtime option
For tool exist support mathematical proof usually based rule given loop code fact satisfies given set loop invariant
The technique used detect loop invariant given code automatically
However approach limited simple invariant
A loop invariant distinguished note loop invariant noun versus adjective
code consists statement expression moved outside body loop without affecting semantics program transformation called performed compiler program
A code example calculation moved loop resulting equivalent faster program In contrast
property loop invariant original optimized program part code hence make sense speak moving loop
code may induce corresponding property
For example easiest way see consider program loop invariant code computed within loop A property code indicating value computed loop agree computed within except first iteration

In condition relied upon true execution program portion
It held always true certain phase execution
For example condition true beginning end every execution loop
Invariants especially useful reasoning whether computer program correct
The theory methodology determining rely heavily invariant
Programmers often use code make invariant explicit
Some special syntax specifying
The good example logical problem determining invariant useful
The puzzle asks one start word MI transform word MU using step one following transformation rule An example derivation superscript indicating applied rule Is possible convert MI MU using four transformation rule
One could spend many hour applying transformation rule string
However might quicker find invariant rule
changed demonstrates getting MU impossible
Logically looking puzzle way get rid I three consecutive I string
This make following invariant interesting consider This invariant problem transformation rule following hold invariant held applying rule also hold applying
If look net effect applying rule number I U see actually case rule The table show clearly invariant hold possible transformation rule basically mean whichever rule pick whatever state number I multiple three applying rule wo afterwards either
Given single I starting string MI one multiple three impossible go MI MU zero multiple three
tool compute simple invariant given imperative computer program
The kind property found depend used
Typical example property single integer variable range like relation several variable like modulus information like
Academic research prototype also consider simple property pointer structure
Any sophisticated invariant still provided manually
In particular verifying imperative program using Hoare calculus loop invariant provided manually loop program one reason task extremely tedious
In example tool able detect rule derivation MI MU impossible
However abstraction string number I made hand leading
following C program abstract interpretation tool able detect ca hence never terminate

CLRS prof correction algorithm using loop invariant At start iteration loop line subarray A j consists element originally A j sorted order
We use loop invariant help u understand algorithm correct
We must show three thing loop invariant Initialization It true prior first iteration loop
Maintenance If true iteration loop remains true Termination When loop terminates invariant give u useful property help show algorithm correct
In explanation maintenance aspect loop invariant following mentioned Maintenance A formal treatment property would require u state show loop invariant loop line
At point however prefer get bogged formalism rely informal analysis show second property hold outer loop
Why would formal treatment require loop invariant loop
Having one invariant outer loop sufficient prove correctness would formal treatment require loop invariant
The invariant outer loop sufficient first need prove actually invariant
For need provide prove precondition postcondition every statement inside loop
And prove precondition postcondition inner loop need another invariant
To human fairly obvious inner loop correctly find place insert next element thus use informal argument
But formal semantics like boil proof mechanical symbolic manipulation checked machine thus ca

The term mostly used regard kind action
execution program single loop database transaction etc
An invariant logical condition hold execution action afterwards
For example invariant might person database must associated passport
This mean every transaction must passport every person transaction committed must still true
An invariant like rule assumption used dictate logic program
For example suppose software application keep track user account
Suppose also user multiple account whatever reason need differentiate user main account alias account
This could DB record something else let assume user account represented class object
class userAccount private char pUserName private char pParentAccountUserName An invariant might assumption pParentAccountUserName NULL empty object parent account
You use invariant distinguish different type account
There probably better method distinguish different type user account keep mind example show invariant might used
Still question

submitted So I going Intro Algs CLRS mention would loop invariant search algorithm general mention linear search
So implementation python I currently working binary search I see faster
In fact I pretty sure T n O n linear search whereas T n lg n binary search
But I ca figure loop invariant would either one
The thing think loop invariant v
So yeah help
Post comment
For binary search range constantly shrinking range number
So iteration know answer outside range
For linear search result first entry
For binary search expand little
You know range search value know actually
Whoops
edited So binary search saying v
For linear search saying algorithm build subarray value equal v
The invariant linear search every element equal search key
A reasonable invariant binary search might range low high every element low le key every element high greater equal
Note variation binary search slightly different invariant property invariant lower bound binary search return lowest index element equal greater key
It easier actual post condition
Say post condition output v len unchanged ie
v output true
The invariant would similar except current value
And given break thing say v IS thus far else loop would end
Your loop invariant good start also depend turn loop invariant v one one involves
v
No I mean use say v iteration loop say slightly part might
As probably noticed v say enough prove want
You want prove v program find The point loop invariant loop exit fact loop invariant hold condition tell must happened
In case loop condition hold know fallen end array
To prove want also need know mean checked element
So loop invariant step element array element checked
I would recommend writing algorithm specific language make analysis much easier
You search value instead input algorithm
Linear Search An integer v An array integer A positive length indexed zero The index A element value v NULL A element value Thank
Was trying help OP Java programmer I trouble ignoring python syntax
Some part kept wanting say damn semicolon
taking intro algs course uni would I expected turn program pseudo code
pseudo code
algorithm abstract concept want teach
They dont want waste valuable time implementation
I speak university University Calgary
We always used
For example FOR loop would easier analyze eg
unit cost criterion assertion correctness converted simple WHILE loop
Also assertion would easier place
Interesting course emphasised difference bounded unbounded loop
But syntax simplified
I would recommend book interested algorithm design analysis

I reading book using loop invariant induction prove program correctness
Then I came across following program got thinking n natural number
return natural number cube root n return root exists In book proof proceeds finding loop invariant
So example let u define following loop invariant Loop Invariant P either natural number cube root n n
The proof supposed proceed induction
So need prove P true assume P true establish P true P true
P trivial prove true n natural number cube root n otherwise n since n natural number hence n
However problem arises try infer P P
look like cube root n tell anything whether cube root n
So question Has proven program exists loop invariant use induction prove program correct
The loop invariant chosen obviously true loop terminates prof program satisfied
Hence prof partial correctness program
However need use induction prove
Is acceptable proof
If use induction prove correct
Regarding first question correctness every loop without fancy control flow
always proven using loop invariant state possible value variable
In case rather modification loop invariant would n r
Of course invariant particularly helpful though certainly used prove correctness loop
A delicate issue whether actually express invariant formal sense loop always terminates case set possible value variable certainly computable
Regarding second question using loop invariant always reason induction know loop invariant actually maintained
Consider following problem I claim program computes n th Fibonacci number
Here loop invariant used prove
Of course really loop invariant since ca prove maintained loop actual loop invariant x
Your suggested loop invariant like first example simply loop invariant particular clear prove loop terminates hold
It might seem trivial argument constitute formal proof
In contrast use actual loop invariant use induction prove loop invariant maintained throughout loop particular satisfied loop terminates
That formal turned actual formal proof sense program verification axiomatic logic
Whether type proof acceptable depends venue
If question course supposed learn write kind formal proof answer acceptable
In algorithm class might acceptable since proof obvious
Ask professor doubt
We turn problem hand
The idea loop condition true loop
As mention condition describe true loop terminates return statement
Ergo correct condition
First let modify program following way instead returning let variable r initialized n assign r break loop
Throughout loop one following always true assuming n n program fails condition main loop need n instead n The second condition quite usual form usually statement allowed
You correct modifying code follows code also corrects bug mentioned Now loop invariant becomes Now loop termination condition make clear n necessarily r loop invariant r

The word seems get used number context
The best I figure mean variable ca change
Is darn Java

An invariant conceptual variable
In general property program state always true
A function method ensures invariant hold said maintain invariant
For instance binary search tree might invariant every node key node left child le node key
A correctly written insertion function tree maintain invariant
As tell sort thing store variable statement program
By figuring sort invariant program maintain reviewing code make sure actually maintains invariant avoid logical error code
It condition know always true particular place logic check debugging work gone wrong
I usually view term algorithm structure
For example could loop invariant could asserted always true beginning end iteration
That loop supposed process collection object one stack another could say top bottom loop
If invariant check failed would indicate something went wrong
In example could mean forgot push processed element onto final stack etc
The magic wikipedia In computer science predicate true remain true throughout specific sequence operation called invariant sequence
Something change within block code Following invariant quite useful writing clean code since knowing conceptually invariant present code allows easily decide organize code reach aim
As mentioned ealier also useful debugging checking see invariant maintained often good way seeing whatever manipulation attempting perform actually want
The ADT invariant specifes relationship among data field instance variable must always true execution instance method
As line state In computer science predicate true remain true throughout specific sequence operation called invariant sequence
To better understand hope example help
Consider scenario get value get total count variable called add variable called The code would something like Reads input put After one successful read increment Repeat read stop The invariant must True
So initially start code This loop read data standard input store x
Well good
But becomes false first part followed kept true
Simple
increment count
So would good
Now code becomes something like Even concept must TRUE False satisfy second part invariant
So
Add store next time read new value x
Now code becomes something like code Ah
Now loop invariant True code work fine
The example book By posting answer agree

property part
An said referentially transparent corresponding value without changing program behavior
As result referentially transparent function give argument
Such function called
An expression referentially transparent called referentially opaque
In function application referentially definition constitutes
However always case programming term used avoid misleading connotation
In referentially transparent function considered
Some provide mean guarantee referential transparency
Some functional programming language enforce referential transparency function
The importance referential transparency allows reason program behavior
This help proving simplifying assisting modifying code without breaking code mean
As referential transparency requires result given set input point time referentially transparent expression therefore
The concept although term seems originated
It adopted A mode containment φ referentially transparent whenever occurrence singular term purely referential term sentence ψ purely referential also containing term sentence φ ψ
The term appeared contemporary usage discussion seminal set lecture note
The lecture note referenced Quine bibliography
If function involved expression expression referentially transparent
Also impure function included expression value discarded insignificant
Consider function return input source
In pseudocode call function might might identify particular disk file etc
Even identical value successive return value different
Therefore function neither deterministic referentially transparent
A subtle example function depends input explicitly passed parameter
This resolved according rule variable current execution environment variable static binding
Since variable altered without changing value passed parameter result subsequent call function may differ even parameter identical
However pure allowed thus free variable value function still referentially transparent neither variable value change due static binding immutability respectively
Arithmetic operation referentially transparent replaced instance
In fact function mathematical sense referentially transparent transparent since always give result particular
Assignments transparent
For instance expression change value assigned variable
Assuming initially value two consecutive evaluation expression yield respectively
Clearly replacing either give program different meaning expression referentially transparent
However calling function transparent implicitly change input x thus
transparent evaluate replace value say Jan get result run tomorrow
This depends state date
In language like substitute equal equal every value x
This hold language
If substitution expression value valid certain point execution program expression referentially transparent
The definition ordering theoretical foundation part semantics imperative programming language
However referentially transparent expression evaluated time necessary define sequence point guarantee order evaluation
Programming done without consideration called
One advantage writing code referentially transparent style given intelligent compiler easier better possible automatically
For example programming C performance penalty including call expensive function inside loop even function call could moved outside loop without changing result program
The programmer would forced perform manual call possibly expense source code readability
However compiler able determine function call referentially transparent perform transformation automatically
The primary disadvantage language enforce referential transparency make expression operation naturally fit imperative programming style awkward le concise
Such language often incorporate mechanism make task easier retaining purely functional quality language
As example let use two function one referentially opaque referentially transparent The function referentially transparent mean
For instance
However ca say thing us global variable modifies
The referential opacity make reasoning program difficult
For example say wish reason following statement One may tempted simplify statement However work occurrence evaluates different value
Remember return value based global value passed get modified call
This mean mathematical identity longer hold
Such mathematical identity hold referentially transparent function
However sophisticated analysis used simplify statement This take step requires degree insight code infeasible compiler optimization
Therefore referential transparency allows u reason code lead robust program possibility finding bug could hope find testing possibility seeing opportunity

People starting appreciate often look set concrete proclamation use technique respond common situation
There rulebook
One thing make management problem leading research team project laboratory fact problem unique
There pattern though I suspect fully understood system could articulate rule
But course fully understand system made people people provide endless surprise
So write universal rule management
But mean learn others experience
There guiding principle elucidated seem hold true wide range specific situation
One principle transparency
In general project work smoothly participant access much relevant information possible
It tempting project manager try control access good reason attempting prevent misunderstanding bad one attempting achieve political gain almost uniformly mistake
Studies found correlation feeling
It impossible empowered available information
Similarly tempting team leader attempt control flow information good reason protecting team member worry bad limiting team member information opportunity
That almost always backfire
Studies show learning manager withholding information tends decrease engagement
A transparent management style allows people feel comfortable contributing idea improves team morale
It also help manager delegate organizational work excellent way help junior team member prepare future advancement
Watching senior team member make decision open best training available
That work junior member see information went decision
If sold benefit transparency may wondering best achieve
Here thing get messy
There many different way transparent team work best depends personality team culture larger organization work style leader among thing
Here tactic used together separately pursue open management style I seen method done well I seen done poorly
I personally use combination method project I manage
I start examining method required larger organization
For instance common program manager request dashboard kept date
In case I like see I make dashboard useful team
I rather avoid duplicate reporting I
Then I think type work team need complete
I combine consideration work habit personality team member produce proposed plan
I discus plan team together settle approach transparency
That plan understood open change work progress need change
As many management concern perfect solution method lot good team project
Just pick something give try adjust needed

Opacity pronounced describes opaque object
While specific computer terminology term often used software
For example many program include Opacity setting allows adjust transparency image
To understand opacity important understand opaque mean
An opaque object completely impervious light mean see
For example car door completely opaque
The window door however opaque since see
If window tinted partially opaque partially transparent
The le transparent window higher opacity
In word transparency opacity inversely related
Most image opaque
For example open image captured completely opaque
However use image editing adjust opacity image
This especially useful editing image multiple layer
For instance Adobe Photoshop allows adjust opacity layer
completely transparent invisible completely opaque
By sliding opacity layer somewhere overlay multiple layer top creating multilayer image mosaic
When saving image important save file support multiple level opacity
support transparency support fully transparent fully opaque
The format best choice since includes alpha channel store opacity setting pixel

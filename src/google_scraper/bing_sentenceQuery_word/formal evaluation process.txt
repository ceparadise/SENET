In specifically particular kind based technique development system
The use formal method software hardware design motivated expectation engineering discipline performing appropriate mathematical analysis contribute reliability robustness design
Formal method best described application fairly broad variety fundamental particular calculus also problem software hardware specification verification
Formal method used number level may undertaken program developed informally
This dubbed
This may option many case
may used produce program formal manner
For example proof property program may undertaken
This may appropriate system involving
may used undertake fully formal proof
This expensive practically worthwhile cost mistake extremely high critical part microprocessor design
Further information expanded
As style formal method may roughly classified follows Some practitioner believe formal method community overemphasized full formalization specification design
They contend expressiveness language involved well complexity system modelled make full formalization difficult expensive task
As alternative various formal method emphasize partial specification focused application proposed
Examples lightweight approach formal method include object modelling notation Denney synthesis aspect driven development CSK Tools
Formal method applied various point
Formal method may used give description system developed whatever level detail desired
This formal description used guide development activity see following section additionally used verify requirement system developed completely accurately specified
The need formal specification system noted year
In report presented formal notation describing programming language syntax later named renamed BNF
Backus also wrote formal description meaning syntactically valid ALGOL program completed time inclusion report
Therefore formal treatment semantics legal program included subsequent paper
It never appeared
Once formal specification produced specification may used guide concrete system process realized typically software also potentially hardware
For example Once formal specification developed specification may used basis property specification hopefully inference developed system
Sometimes motivation proving system obvious need correctness system desire understand system better
Consequently proof correctness produced style handwritten typeset using using level informality common proof
A good proof one readable understandable human reader
Critics approach point inherent natural language allows error undetected proof often subtle error present detail typically overlooked proof
Additionally work involved producing good proof requires high level mathematical sophistication expertise
In contrast increasing interest producing proof correctness system automated mean
Automated technique fall three general category Some automated theorem provers require guidance property interesting enough pursue others work without human intervention
Model checker quickly get bogged checking million uninteresting state given sufficiently abstract model
Proponents system argue result greater mathematical certainty proof since tedious detail algorithmically verified
The training required use system also le required produce good mathematical proof hand making technique accessible wider variety practitioner
Critics note system like make pronouncement truth yet give explanation truth
There also problem program aid verification unproven may reason doubt soundness produced result
Some modern model checking tool produce proof log detailing step proof making possible perform given suitable tool independent verification
The main feature abstract interpretation approach provides sound analysis
false negative returned
Moreover efficiently scalable tuning abstract domain representing property analyzed applying widening operator get fast convergence
Formal method applied different area hardware software including router Ethernet switch routing protocol security application
There several example used verify functionality hardware software used DCs
IBM used theorem prover AMD processor development process
Intel us method verify hardware firmware permanent software programmed memory
used formal method develop compiler system went become commercial product
There several project NASA formal method applied Unmanned Aircraft System integration National Airspace System Airborne Coordinated Conflict Resolution Detection ACCoRD

There many area hardware Intel used FMs verify working product parameterized verification cache coherent protocol Intel Core processor execution engine validation using theorem proving symbolic evaluation optimization Intel architecture using HOL light theorem prover verification high performance gigabit Ethernet controller support PCI express protocol Intel advance management technology using Cadence
Similarly IBM used formal method verification power gate register functional verification IBM microprocessor
In formal method mathematical approach solving software hardware problem requirement specification design level
Formal method likely applied software system
Software safety assurance standard demand formal method highest level categorization
For sequential software example formal method include specification language used
In allowed mathematical specification testing exhaustive testing expected behaviour individual function
The specialization allowed system formally specified necessarily formally verified
For concurrent software system based see also allow executable software specification used build validate application behavior
Another approach formal method software development write specification form variation FOL directly execute logic though program
The language based DL example
There also work mapping version English another natural language automatically logic executing logic directly
Examples Internet Business Logic seek control vocabulary syntax
A feature system support bidirectional mapping direct execution logic made explain result English business scientific level
There variety formal method notation available

As owner undoubtedly performed enough evaluation business employee process become almost second nature
An evaluation report essentially formal documentation process
If evaluation client organization ask organization related report conducted past
Not report provide information addressed current evaluation also review see client expectation term formatting degree detail

Gather review data used conduct evaluation
While reviewing data idea report say conclusion presented

Identify key stakeholder report
These include read report stake finding
Stakeholders vary often include head organization client supplier financial backer employee
Because stakeholder audience keep question concern mind write report

Make note conclusion become apparent review data
As compile data write report normal new conclusion become apparent
Keep open mind let data shape report rather emphasizing data fit preconception goal stakeholder

Write heading Summary Executive Summary
This first section evaluation report usually written last
Use section summarize important point report completed section

Write Background section detailing reason evaluation performed
Highlight finding recommendation previous evaluation lead report

Write Scope section describing evaluated date evaluation performed

Write Reviewers section listing people organization performed evaluation

Write Evaluation Process section describing step taken evaluation listing tool resource used
If one evaluation performed process described separately

Write Evaluation section evaluation performed

How technology used assessment evaluation curriculum redesign
Modern technology offer educator variety new tool used classroom
Technology help teacher track ass student well performance classroom
It also used facilitate communication student teacher create digital record student growth development easily passed along grade grade
Teachers use technology make work productive teacher use spreadsheet track student work also track teaching plan
If group student performing poorly particular area kind record keeping highlight area teacher need focus teaching
These tool also help administrator ass improve teacher performance
The Internet another tool used communicate assessment evaluation curriculum redesign wider community
This workshop series example idea practice
For information Internet classroom education see What go inside student head often mystery black box say Anthony Petrosino Associate Professor University Texas expert reviewer workshop series
Technology give u way get feedback continually teaching process instead end teaching process end retrospective understanding
How technology assist understanding mind child
You gather lot insight talking child length often practical classroom
Given constraint classroom technology provide another set way ass child understanding learning
It allows continuing evaluation classroom lesson
One example new tool program called Diagnoser developed Jim Minstrell Earl Huntand University Washington
This program designed give teacher insight student conceptual understanding high school science
The program asks series question designed test deep understanding
The goal elicit correct answer understand student arrives answer chosen
Gravity example one module program address
Gravity frequently misunderstood many student often believe heavy object fall rapidly light one
The Diagnoser designed ask series question behavior bowling ball golf ball let go time hit ground first
series question teacher get insight student understanding basic principle behind choice
What miscomprehensions
With clear view class misunderstanding teacher shift emphasis redesign instructional plan
Technology also used production portfolio
There available whole new range device student use producing material evaluation
Students use scanner digital photograph movie part portfolio
Speeches musical performance composition also included appropriate file format allowing documentation athletic dramatic musical activity
One advantage digital portfolio made available variety community
It designed reviewed student teacher classmate
It even placed Web student work made public
This becomes wonderful opportunity parent see react child classroom work
One major advantage digital technology work become part larger broader conversation
Feedback received expanding universe community
Continual feedback teacher student generates way teaching different traditional approach
It becomes like sailing ship teacher constantly adjusting course
The goal set actual path responds need individual student
That model assessment look like occurs continuously instruction
Technology new set tool useful add value learning experience

Difference Between Things Terms Objects Posted Last updated August As name implies formal assessment formal way finding much student learnt improved instructional period
These include exam diagnostic test achievement test screening intelligence test etc
All formal assessment standardized method administering test
They also formal method grading well interpreting grade thereby allowing teacher ass performance level skill student quite succinctly
In text school book end every lesson various kind exercise meant ass whether student learnt concept presented lesson whether student solve problem based upon subject matter
There right wrong answer pattern student graded based upon answer answer sheet
The performance student formal assessment tool enables teacher know instantly student stand comparison also relation instruction given
These kind assessment tool also help motivating student get higher score order rewarded performance reward turn encourage student improve future well
Informal assessment tool tool judge evaluate student performance skill level without making use standardized test scoring pattern
There standardized tool measure evaluate performance assessment tool
The best example informal assessment project experiment presentation given student classroom platform
Some also consider debating peer teaching example informal assessment
One way assessing skill student ask question required answer front student
Formal assessment evaluate performance student basis grade standardized test whereas informal assessment qualitative nature standardized tool evaluation
Sometimes stopping lecture observing student see level involvement way informal assessment whereas test quiz essay lab report etc
remain important tool formal assessment
Formal assessment standardized criterion evaluation informal assessment subjective criterion evaluate performance
Some student become nervous taking formal assessment perform true potential also student become nervous teacher suddenly asks answer
Therefore teacher need healthy mix kind assessment evaluate skill student

Evaluation process examining program process determine working
It determines value learning training program act blueprint judgment improvement
Rossett Sheldon Evaluations normally divided two category
A sometimes referred internal method judging worth program program activity progress
They conducted phase process
This part evaluation focus process
Thus formative evaluation basically done fly
They permit designer learner instructor manager monitor well instructional goal objective met
Its main purpose catch deficiency ASAP proper learning intervention take place allows learner master required skill knowledge
used formative evaluation test particular design aspect using one iteration
A sometimes referred external method judging worth program end program activity summation
The focus outcome
The various instrument used collect data questionnaire survey interview observation testing
The model methodology used gather data specified procedure
It carefully designed executed ensure data accurate valid
Questionnaires least expensive procedure external evaluation used collect large sample graduate information
The questionnaire trialed tested using ensure recipient understand operation way designer intended
When designing questionnaire keep mind important feature guidance given completion
All instruction clearly stated


let nothing taken granted
Scriven first suggested distinction
Formative evaluation intended foster development improvement within ongoing activity person product program etc
Summative evaluation contrast used ass whether result object evaluated program intervention person etc
met stated goal
Scriven saw need distinguish formative summative role curriculum evaluation
While Scriven preferred summative evaluation performing final evaluation project person come acknowledge Cronbach merit formative evaluation part process curriculum development used improve course still fluid believed contributes improvement education evaluation used appraise product
Later Misanchuk delivered paper need tighten definition order get measurement accurate
The one seems cause greatest disagreement keeping fluid movement change strictly prerelease version hit target population
In Paul Saettler history instructional technology describes two evaluation context used developing Sesame Street The Electric Company Children Television Workshop
CTW used formative evaluation identify defining program design could provide reliable predictor learning particular learner
They later used summative evaluation prove effort quite good effect I might add
While Saettler praise CTW significant landmark technology instructional design warns still tentative seen point departure rather fixed formula
Saettler defines two type evaluation formative used refine goal evolve strategy achieving goal summative undertaken test validity theory determine impact educational practice future effort may improved modified
Thus using Misanchuk defining term normally achieve accurate measurement however cost higher highly resource intensive particularly time performed design phase create trial redo trial redo trial redo etc
preferably without using target population
However organization demanding shorter design time
Thus formative part moved method use rapid prototyping using testing evaluation method improve one move
Which course accurate appropriate organization really interested accurate measurement content rather end product skilled knowledgeable worker
Misanchuk defining term put water container accurate measurement typical organization estimate volume water running stream
Thus vendor researcher need highly accurate measurement probably define two evaluation manner Misanchuk
If need push faster worried highly accurate measurement define closer organization Saettler describes CTW example

The industry growing rapidly
Globalization continues introduce new opportunity increase competition
Manufacturers faced day rapid globalization market delocalization supplier context company show change capital concern physical capital plant equipment also intellectual capital global knowledge product process
Companies trying globally secure best talent available reasonable cost serve market demanding innovation supplier cutting price
Suppliers asking better working relationship guarantee justify higher R D expense
Dealers want better extended option product range sell customer better training tool technician
In increasing complexity also expectation customer increased forcing manufacturer supplier develop new product frequently new product must technological complex also reliable safer previous product personalized high quality reasonable low cost value money
As result new organizational approach new business model required handle increased complexity simultaneously managing knowledge product geography customer
Traditional bureaucratic design built around vertical control lateral segmentation replaced organizational model admitting work occur process run across organization
In transnational company dynamic configuration team carry development product process lateral linkage coordinate integrate diverse knowledge across dispersed knowledge center
In word global new product development production complex system simply aggregation multiple virtual team
Besides another consideration accelerating technology development
The rapid evolution computing technology changed automotive product development process many digital information format internet pervasive computing wireless communication shaping business landscape
The company also stating need value proposition differentiate competitor
They focusing resource core capability realize competitive advantage leveraging business partner rest
Areas company striving differentiate include product development innovation cycle time
This involves process associated research design product service sold customer
Innovation development desirable product key business goal
This entail integration collaboration business partner respond emerging opportunity customer need competitive threat
Goals include developing collaborative working relationship across value net integrated process system dynamic linkage engage disengage member value net formalize knowledge

Today manufacturing moving towards proactive production
Shorter product life cycle lead increased complexity area product process design factory deployment production operation
To handle complexity new method technology needed model simulate optimize monitor manufacturing system
Product lifecycle management research tends focus situation responsive formal analysis modelling
However several domain knowledge intensive collaborative environment possible model process using formal notation
Knowledge based collaborative process management involves combination structured process
Structured process management reduced set rule leading high efficiency also low flexibility whereas management process prone full formalization
A combination structured unstructured management approach required order achieve successful efficiency flexibility controllability
We call process contains structured leading flexible efficient hybrid approach
Large enterprise information system impose structured predictable workflow knowledge based collaborative process unpredictable extent involving high amount
Moreover large enterprise information system able manage daily ad hoc communication inherent process
This paper introduces set concept method tool innovative Hybrid Process Management approach validated real world business case automotive industry

Organizations like living organism life cycle
The hold true collaborative team
They born established learn walk talk learn grow develop team reach maturity work project team become senior citizen work slows reason group completed finally death team dissolved since mission complete
Now generalized life cycle collaborative team since set criterion developing team
Teams like organization unique designed intended work
Each team development skill characteristic motivation success determined individual make group
For reason life cycle collaborative team never truly studied analyzed synthesized materialized
This step collaborative team process fallen gray area business better known military realm Black Ops
What expert agree collaborative team predictable pattern emerge observing group
Their pattern generally identified development stage occur set pattern reversed jumbled even skipped
If group would function team would collection individual assigned task
The organization would bunch highly trained overly qualified individual complete project goal one person accomplish
Some expert identified many stage given group condensed three
Most model develop stage four five category
With mind article explores new territory time tread lightly disturb hidden booby trap
What known collaborative group called together article identifies The Seduction Awareness phase
The next phase people get know test water see get along stage known The Date stage
Okay group getting know starting get along decided time Go Steady
This plan action determined get project accomplished
The Engagement occurs time implement plan action time work
The final stage group fittingly called The
It time reveal final product bask glory
Collaboration allows people work together given project
Naturally leadership must ensure people selected team able participate
The group office building scattered around world linked together via Internet
In either case group usually formed organization leadership work together toward predetermined goal
There many reason various individual chosen part group
Some common reason include Needed job skill task Specific needed talent Leadership ability Organizational prowess Motivational expertise ability When organizing collaboration team leadership concerned individual know capable working together
What generally look individual ability
It usually job appointed group leader find common ground group function together
It also fall leader shoulder motivate team reach appointed goal
This usually problem since generally speaking collaborative team usually best best organization anything problem leader usually face reining ego
For Linus Torvalds started simple email stating starting new project hobby wanted people send idea feature added software
Fast forward year ultimate hobby software open source collaborative effort powerful running percent world super computer many Internet server number consumer device include Androids
Torvalds invented Linux collaborative effort others began developing driver debugging software developed enhancing source code
All accomplished volunteer communicating Internet
The collaborative effort grown foundation train individual use software continues collaborative effort improve system
As see leadership generally problem finding volunteer collaboration team
The approach usually something along line special project corporate headquarters attention need part team
Or leadership approach employee statement We problem fix need part special team putting together
Either way type approach usually enough motivation
With said group leader must realize strict timetable get result must take charge quickly individual within elite group ride roughshod
As saw example software giant collaboration take place everyone common goal work toward
For Jobs Gates two know respect collaboration begin
The true collaboration group must trust safety understanding mutual respect common goal everyone belief
This type collaboration happen group overnight take time
For people work together first thing must take place individual within group get know
To effective within group must willing look mirror understand
You ask others undergo process willing examine
If group gel function full capacity
Before walking room getting know others must first look mirror ask What belief
Do I adhere value
What type attitude I toward others
What story life impact positively
Why
Which story impact negatively
Why
What motivates
Are action reflecting value belief
What criterion I base decision
Author Keith Ferrazzi realized early service others rewarding
He taught pay forward child word taught help others even asked assist
He wrote book felt slightly guilty looked mirror realized life always reflect writing telling others
He set change life story includes founding Meals Wheels service provides delivered meal need
The date phase take little time
It usually take getting away organization socializing
It take group willing share story
The hardest part requires someone step first share
It requires one individual open share complete trust within group
It take one person willing vulnerable overall good group success
When traveling different country expect thing different culture way life different
So tourist must make adjustment expectation timetable
In Philippines must specify timetable negotiating purchasing product Filipino time American time
Filipino time mean complete project anywhere agreed upon time three month said date
American time mean project completed agreed upon time
Naturally price higher American time
The type thing occurs dealing different people within group
You enter project time frame thing need accomplished
Of course everyone else walked room schedule
This important everyone know person take coming account determining project schedule
Not schedule synchronized everyone page also group need organize required activity project accomplishing time
Needed resource must allocated
To get done individual within group must collaborate need reach become group oriented thinking
This leader team collaboration begin emerge
With group collaboration need mediation compromise negotiation general see project completed
For happen open honest discussion must take place everyone treat mutual respect
It time KISS project
It time Keep It Simply Simple
Stick agreed schedule assigned task
If problem come group find simple solution
This area project people complicate matter overthinking trying get fancy project instead giving organization best product asked
It time one person group show complicate thing
It time solid group effort economizes time us best practice procedure produce top quality product
The project complete time bask glory accomplishment
This individual take time sketch taken place reflect happened digest group accomplished
It stage process people begin realize answer question What
If group collaborated answer positive one individual leave great life story
It also time group explores next
This greatly depend organization talent people within group
If team uncovered another issue similar one tackling time bring management group still together
Or maybe team realizes improve another process time ask leadership expand time group together
At least group made great friendship realize talent person
This great asset workload
There need end relationship group disbanded
Instead daily work area know someone collaboration team excelled call ask suggestion get job done
Also set regularly scheduled time get together coffee lunch dinner
Network introduce friend network grows
Growing business network invaluable time pay huge dividend

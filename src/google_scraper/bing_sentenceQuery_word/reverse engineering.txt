also called extracting information product reproducing reproducing anything based extracted information
The process often involves disassembling something computer program biological chemical organic matter analyzing component working detail
The reason goal obtaining information vary widely everyday socially beneficial action criminal action depending upon situation
Often breached person business recollect something done something need reverse engineer work
Reverse engineering also beneficial crime prevention suspected reverse engineered understand allow computer device work together interoperate allow saved file obsolete system used newer system
By contrast reverse engineering also used remove create possibly improved even usually goal
Reverse engineering origin analysis hardware commercial military advantage
However reverse engineering process concerned creating copy changing artifact way order design feature product little additional knowledge procedure involved original production
In case goal reverse engineering process simply
Even product reverse engineered competitor goal may copy perform
Reverse engineering may also used create despite narrowly tailored US EU legislation legality using specific reverse engineering technique purpose hotly contested court worldwide two decade
Reasons reverse engineering As CAD become popular reverse engineering become viable method create virtual model existing physical part use CAD software
The process involves measuring object reconstructing model
The physical object measured using technology like computed tomography
The measured data alone usually represented lack topological information therefore often processed modeled usable format mesh set surface model
Hybrid Modelling commonly used term NURBS implemented together
Using combination geometric freeform surface provide powerful method modelling
Areas freeform data combined exact geometric surface create hybrid model
A typical example would reverse engineering cylinder head includes freeform cast feature water jacket high tolerance machined area
Reverse engineering also used business bring existing physical geometry digital product development environment make digital record product ass competitor product
It used analyse instance product work component consists estimate cost identify potential infringement etc
related activity also used business
It involves analysing product objective find opportunity cost cutting
The term applied software mean different thing different people prompting Chikofsky Cross write paper researching various us defining
From paper state Reverse engineering process analyzing subject system create representation system higher level abstraction
It also seen going backwards development cycle
In model output implementation phase source code form back analysis phase inversion traditional
Another term technique
Reverse engineering process examination software system consideration modified would make
technology like used deter reverse engineering proprietary software system
In practice two main type reverse engineering emerge
In first case source code already available software aspect program perhaps poorly documented documented longer valid discovered
In second case source code available software effort towards discovering one possible source code software regarded reverse engineering
This second usage term one people familiar
Reverse engineering software make use technique avoid copyright infringement
On related note lot common reverse engineering
The tester usually goal find bug undocumented feature bashing product outside
Other purpose reverse engineering include security auditing removal copy protection circumvention access restriction often present customization engine management system repair retrofit enabling additional feature crippled hardware graphic card even mere satisfaction curiosity
This process sometimes termed RCE
As example decompilation binary accomplished using Jad
One famous case reverse engineering first implementation launched historic industry overwhelmingly dominant computer hardware platform many year
Reverse engineering software protected exception
The allows system running system share file system classic example software reverse engineering since Samba project unpublished information Windows file sharing worked computer could emulate
The project thing one party file format
The project even ambitious goal strives provide binary ABI API compatibility current Windows OSes NT branch allowing software driver written Windows run counterpart
allows full content Windows system live memory including graphical reverse engineering running process
Another classic example System originally running Apple could run RISC machine
Reverse engineering software accomplished various method
The three main group software reverse engineering Software classification process identifying similarity different software binary example two different version binary used detect code relation software sample
This task traditionally done manually several reason patch analysis vulnerability detection nowadays done somewhat automatically large number sample
This method used mostly long thorough reverse engineering task complete analysis complex algorithm big piece software
In general considered hard problem also true software classification therefore many handle task well
A number tool refer process importing analysing source code generate UML diagram reverse engineering
See
Although UML one approach providing reverse engineering recent advance international standard activity resulted development KDM
This standard delivers ontology intermediate abstracted representation programming language construct interrelationship
An standard way becoming ISO standard well KDM started take hold industry development tool analysis environment deliver extraction analysis source binary byte code
For source code analysis KDM granular standard architecture enables extraction software system flow data control call map architecture business layer knowledge rule term process
The standard enables use common data format XMI enabling correlation various layer system knowledge either detailed analysis
root cause impact derived analysis
business process extraction
Although effort represent language construct given number language continuous evolution software language development new language standard allow use extension support broad language set well evolution
KDM compatible UML BPMN RDF standard enabling migration environment thus leverage system knowledge effort software system transformation enterprise business layer analysis
set rule describe message format message exchanged protocol
Accordingly problem protocol partitioned two subproblems message format
The message format traditionally tedious manual process involved analysis protocol implementation process message recent research proposed number automatic solution
Typically automatic approach either group observed message cluster using various emulate protocol implementation tracing message processing
There le work protocol
In general protocol learned either process passively observes communication attempt build general accepting observed sequence message allows interactive generation probing sequence message listening response probing sequence
In general offline learning small known online learning done polynomial time
An automatic offline approach demonstrated Comparetti et al
online approach Cho et al
Other component typical protocol like encryption hash function automatically well
Typically automatic approach trace execution protocol implementation try detect buffer memory holding unencrypted packet
Reverse engineering invasive destructive form analyzing smart card
The attacker grind away layer layer smart card take picture
With technique possible reveal complete hardware software part smart card
The major problem attacker bring everything right order find everything work
The maker card try hide key operation mixing memory position example
In case even possible attach probe measure voltage smart card still operational
The maker card employ sensor detect prevent attack
This attack common requires large investment effort special equipment generally available large chip manufacturer
Furthermore payoff attack low since security technique often employed shadow account
It uncertain time whether attack card replicate encryption data consequentially crack PINS would provide cost effective attack multifactor authentication
Reverse engineering often used people order copy nation technology device information obtained regular troop field operation
It often used
example WWII later include Reverse engineering applies primarily gaining understanding process artifact manner construction use internal process made clear creator
studied since essence patent inventor provides detailed public disclosure return involved
However item produced one patent could also include technology patented disclosed
Indeed one common motivation reverse engineering determine whether competitor product contains
In United States even artifact process protected artifact process often lawful long legitimately obtained
Reverse engineering US often fall well relevant law
This end user license agreement specifically prohibit court ruled term present override copyright law expressly permit see
Sec
f say person legal possession program permitted circumvent protection necessary order achieve interoperability term broadly covering device program able interact make use use transfer data useful way
A limited exemption exists allows knowledge thus gained shared used interoperability purpose
The section state f Reverse Notwithstanding provision subsection A person lawfully obtained right use copy computer program may circumvent technological measure effectively control access particular portion program sole purpose identifying analyzing element program necessary achieve interoperability independently created computer program program previously readily available person engaging circumvention extent act identification analysis constitute infringement title
Notwithstanding provision subsection b person may develop employ technological mean circumvent technological measure circumvent protection afforded technological measure order enable identification analysis paragraph purpose enabling interoperability independently created computer program program mean necessary achieve interoperability extent constitute infringement title
The information acquired act permitted paragraph mean permitted paragraph may made available others person referred paragraph case may provides information mean solely purpose enabling interoperability independently created computer program program extent constitute infringement title violate applicable law section
For purpose subsection term mean ability computer program exchange information program mutually use information exchanged
EU Directive legal protection computer program governs reverse engineering
The directive state The unauthorised reproduction translation adaptation transformation form code copy computer program made available constitutes infringement exclusive right author
Nevertheless circumstance may exist reproduction code translation form indispensable obtain necessary information achieve interoperability independently created program program
It therefore considered limited circumstance performance act reproduction translation behalf person right use copy program legitimate compatible fair practice must therefore deemed require authorisation rightholder
An objective exception make possible connect component computer system including different manufacturer work together
Such exception author exclusive right may used way prejudice legitimate interest rightholder conflict normal exploitation program
This superseded earlier Directive

Whether rebuilding car engine diagramming sentence people learn many thing simply taking apart putting back together
That nutshell concept behind something order understand build copy improve
A process originally applied hardware applied software database even human DNA
especially important computer hardware software
Programs written language say Java understandable programmer
But run computer translated another program called compiler one zero machine language
Compiled code incomprehensible programmer way convert machine code back format including software tool called decompiler
used many purpose learning tool way make new compatible product cheaper currently market making software interoperate effectively bridge data different operating system database uncover undocumented feature commercial product
A famous example involves San Phoenix Technologies wanted produce BIOS PCs would compatible IBM PC proprietary BIOS
A BIOS program stored firmware run PC start see June
To protect charge simply illegally copied IBM BIOS Phoenix using called clean room Chinese wall approach
First team engineer studied IBM described everything completely possible without using referencing actual code
Then Phoenix brought second team programmer prior knowledge IBM BIOS never seen code
Working first team functional specification second team wrote new BIOS operated specified
The resulting Phoenix BIOS different IBM code intent purpose operated identically
Using approach even section code happen identical copyright infringement
Phoenix began selling BIOS company used create first PCs
Other company Cyrix Advanced Micro Devices successfully Intel microprocessor make chip
Few operating system
With million line roughly modern would expensive option
But application ripe since software developer publish source code
Technically application programming interface API make easy program work together expert say APIs poorly written software maker little choice program want software work ensure compatibility
also expose security flaw questionable privacy practice
For instance Digital Convergence CueCat scanning device revealed reader unique serial number allows device maker marry scanned code user registration data thus track user habit great previously unpublicized feature
Recent legal move backed many large software hardware maker well entertainment industry eroding company ability
legal two main area seeing threat say Jennifer Granick director law technology clinic Stanford Law School Palo Alto One threat yet untested court come license explicitly prohibit anyone open us software say
The threat Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA prohibits creation dissemination tool information could used break technological safeguard protect software copied
Last July basis law San Adobe Systems asked FBI arrest Dmitry Sklyarov Russian programmer conference
Sklyarov worked software cracked Adobe file encryption
The fact even often requires breaking safeguard DMCA allow compatibility purpose
But allowed see software supposed say Granick look purpose scientific inquiry
She offer analogy You car allowed open hood

For teacher introductory presentation Each group need To share entire class Today learn reverse engineering video I show
In meantime think reverse engineering might mean
The Khan Academy website show process reverse engineering different device watch one tap light
This video six minute long I expect pay close attention
Show class video website address provided Procedure Additional Multimedia Support section
A list part component required create product
Often includes material description manufacturer part number quantity cost sometimes spreadsheet format
A sketch three dimensional object angle projection dimension equal degree sketch show side object
A booklet describes something work something
A sketch three dimensional object view show one side object looking straight typically three view drawn show dimension object
A document describes work person team intends complete project document seek approval team may move forward work project
The process taking apart object fully understand
Before Activity With Students Day From video saw reverse engineering
And important
Listen student explanation idea
Reverse engineering process taking apart object
But engineer use process
way help u fully understand device
We learn product work
It way study device learn detail construction operation
This useful want repair duplicate improve product
Why might want improve product
Improvements might reduce cost increase efficiency reliability adjust suitability specific purpose
For example within Apple company someone idea make iPod smaller aka iPod Nano order make device better people like run prefer smaller lighter
As guess going embark reverse engineering project
As I explain later detail work group one two three student reverse engineer device choose
In context engineering project
Is person proposes marriage someone
Wait student respond
Well different kind proposal
In context research engineering proposal description work someone intends complete project
But
Often proposal project expensive proposal seek approval work begin
For example company manager might required approve proposal project move forward
So I asking write proposal
Because I need sure device meet activity
The object team reverse engineer must either something found home purchased le per person
For example group three may buy device per thrift store
Your proposal document kept within budget device bring school safe appropriate
I also look make sure product going take long completed quickly
I want project good challenge
Use bullet point slide guide preparing proposal due Day
Make sure What project
Describe device cost source
What device
How going take apart
What tool need
How many part think contains
What kind part think find inside
Also make rough sketch overall device
Depending bring device reverse engineer take apart
Think might needed screwdriver plier wrench
Maybe even drill
For safety need using tool
Safety glass
Make sure wear protect eye using tool near others using tool
Be aware surroundings well
What measuring
You need sketch record part measurement
How
Do remember use caliper ruler
Review needed
Your group also need complete What
A team contract describes person role within team
Even though team member jointly responsible every part project contract way clearly communicate person contribution special job
For example maybe Jerry best reading people work final editor Caitlyn great organizing
Look overall task deliverable entire project
Then team member agree mutual specific responsibility sign contract make official
The next thing need create BoM
What
A BoM list part compose device
For example BoM car would include four wheel two four door steering wheel etc
Each part would listed along detail description material quantity dimension function interaction part source cost
So engineer make sketch identifies part number letter looked BoM document much information provided part
Do let slide scare
Yes involved purposeful writing make sense
In addition proposal BoM I need understand device purpose procedure
What think I mean purpose procedure device
I mean Why device invented innovated
The purpose car keep person busy entertained
We could procedure describes operate device assemble device
What another name besides procedure
A
What manual
It essentially document
Everyone appreciates manual
As write manual challenge determine specific describing put together device
In case car need clear enough person knowledge RC car able put together step skipped device work customer
So manual important deliverable project
Make sure everyone team contributes edits agrees final manual
Some As part report include team contract conclusion overall project
Then good understanding device follow step engineering design process figure end use customer manufacturer impact environment
As necessary include drawing better explain suggested change improvement
Please also provide feedback would thing differently future project
I would also like feedback help make reverse engineering project better future student
When manual type device part good include
Draw part orthographically isometrically
Orthogonal sketch engineering drawing show top right front view isometric view sketch part
As necessary draw example classroom board review
It also useful draw device part exploded view help person understand part put together screw go
Remember label sketched part tie identifying label bill material
Let review project
Here expected
Go list slide
What possible object reverse engineering project
This slide show example device product give idea
Examples pictured include fishing pole spinning reel tape dispenser water gun bicycle toy truck toy rocket mechanical pencil car
Since project many deliverable complete helpful plan need create milestone end enough time end
The listed slide suggests plan accomplish every day team make deadline
Working team adjust schedule little bit even get work done earlier without waiting team
Assign team brainstorm proposal Proposal due approved revised draft team contract Team contract completed bring home Take apart device thorough documentation description photo measurement Sketch part prepare bill material manual Write report get feedback come improvement idea prepare conclusion Organize edit Class oral presentation Show student grading rubric written report presentation part
Either show slide bring separate Word PDF file version rubric
Review expectation project success
This circular graphic show step engineering design process
Available show student needed
With Students Days When reviewing team proposal accept device would complex require much time
For example team reverse engineered laptop unable finish time
Optionally provide maximum number part proposed device may
Assessment Verbally quiz student knowledge topic pertaining engineering design process sketching engineering notebook documentation proposal writing team contract bill material
Find know necessary clarify supplement base knowledge
Before presenting showing video lead informal class discussion gauge student understanding reverse engineering
Ask student Activity Embedded Assessment As project happening observe student make sure everyone engaged making progress aware timeline
Consider providing deadline every major project component help team stay task
For example schedule deadline proposal approval one week project assigned require device brought school day proposal approval deadline
Having continuous upcoming deadline even specific help keep student track
Assessment Use evaluate student learning accomplishment reverse engineering project work analysis written report class presentation
For class presentation give team time limit force briefly recap key element project order share everyone learned
To better understand individual contribution team project student use evaluate fellow peer
Incorporate feedback final grade
If student extra time final project due date try put back together see get work
If already included rubric extra credit employ step engineering design process guide making improved device design

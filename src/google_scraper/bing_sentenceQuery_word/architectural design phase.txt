The architectural team expand upon information established requirement document
Using typical atypical scenario provided requirement document performance accomplished well complexity implementation
Obviously action done many time need done correctly efficiently
A seldom used action need implemented correctly obvious level performance required
The requirement document must guide decision process
An example seldom used action must done high performance emergency shutdown nuclear reactor
Analyzing necessary complexity allows many thing remain simple turn eventually lead higher quality product
The architecture team also convert typical scenario test plan
In approach team given complete requirement document must also indicate implementation team
A critical implementation priority lead task done right
If fails product fails
If succeeds product might succeed
At least confidence level team producing successful product increase
This keep implementation team focused
Exactly information conveyed skill based experience science based fundamental foundation
The importance priority setting become evident theory chapter presented later

At De Biasse Seminara Architects PC make mission layout process working u clearly succinctly possible
That way gain understanding operate initial consultation way construction administration
Ideally would prefer work every phase describe ensure smooth completion project carry phase intention keeping project budget within code
That said may decide contract u complete one phase separately see fit
We discus option initial consultation meeting
The initial consultation result proposal service well breakdown fee
At point option either sign contract negotiate particular satisfaction
Once come agreement document existing condition field study gather relevant architectural data initiate first phase architectural design process During phase architectural design process take information gathered field survey create two three design option consideration
We generally present option form sketch visualize different route project could take
We also attach rough cost estimate option aid selecting design meet aesthetic preference budget requirement
You also opportunity request modification like u make preferred design
Once selected design option best suit need begin process refining design Design Development phase
At point take schematic design selected well requested modification revise design necessary
We also update cost estimate provided Schematic Design phase reflect change made initial design
We take client budget seriously continually strive provide accurate estimate throughout early stage design
This phase may require additional give take work finalize detail design moving next phase
By settled final design begin preparing drawing note technical specification necessary bidding construction permit application
This phase many people think picture work architect creation blueprint
Contractors use detailed drawing specification prepare next phase architectural design process
Having architect side bidding phase home construction great advantage
At minimum aid developing list qualified contractor bid list submitting bid package bidder
But also review submitted bid provide analysis help compare cost figure receive bidder
This phase ensure contractor considering construction project reading blueprint correctly providing accurate bid project
Finally selected contractor construction way move fifth phase architectural design process construction administration
During phase administer construction process assure conformance design intent visit site construction address field condition arise
This final phase along others described ensure smooth satisfactory completion home construction renovation project
Our ultimate goal architect help turn dream new renovated home affordable reality
take first step toward new home

refers high level structure discipline creating structure documentation structure
These structure needed reason software system
Each structure comprises software element relation among property element relation
The software system metaphor analogous building
Software architecture making fundamental structural choice costly change implemented
Software architecture choice include specific structural option possibility design software
For example system controlled launch vehicle requirement fast reliable
Therefore appropriate language would need chosen
Additionally satisfy need reliability choice could made multiple redundant independently produced copy program run copy independent hardware result
Documenting software architecture facilitates communication capture early decision design allows reuse design component project
Opinions vary scope software architecture There sharp distinction software architecture versus design requirement engineering see
They part chain intentionality intention detail
Software architecture exhibit following software system cater variety stakeholder business manager owner user operator
These stakeholder concern respect system
Balancing concern demonstrating addressed part designing system
This implies architecture involves dealing broad variety concern stakeholder multidisciplinary nature
established way architect reduce complexity separate concern drive design
Architecture documentation show stakeholder concern addressed modeling describing architecture separate point view associated various stakeholder concern
These separate description called architectural view see example
classic approach
driven required functionality flow data system current insight architecture software system closely related security usability
Stakeholder concern often translate quality attribute variously called requirement behavioral requirement quality attribute requirement
like building architecture software architecture discipline developed standard way address recurring concern
These standard way called various name various level abstraction
Common term recurring solution architectural style tactic
term introduced Fred Brooks denote idea architecture software system represents overall vision
This vision separated implementation
The architect assumes role keeper vision making sure addition system line architecture hence preserving
Software architecture intellectually graspable abstraction complex system
This abstraction provides number benefit The comparison software design civil architecture first drawn late term became prevalent beginning
The field encountered problem associated complexity since formation
Earlier problem complexity solved developer choosing right developing applying concept
Although term software architecture relatively new industry fundamental principle field applied sporadically pioneer since
Early attempt capture explain software architecture system imprecise disorganized often characterized set
Software architecture concept origin research early
These scientist emphasized structure software system matter getting structure right critical
During concerted effort define codify fundamental aspect discipline research work concentrating architectural style
Research institution played prominent role furthering software architecture discipline
David Garlan wrote book titled promoted software architecture concept connector style
The Institute Software Research effort software architecture research directed primarily architectural style architecture description language dynamic architecture
first formal standard area software architecture
It adopted ISO
In November IEEE superseded jointly published IEEE ISO
While software architecture architecture system defined system software contributes essential influence design construction deployment evolution system whole edition go step including definition system embrace hardware software also human process procedure facility material naturally occurring entity
This reflects relationship software architecture
There many activity software architect performs
A software architect typically work project manager discus stakeholder design software architecture evaluates design communicates designer stakeholder document architectural design
There four core activity software architecture design
These core architecture activity performed iteratively different stage initial software development well evolution system
process understanding environment proposed system system operate determining requirement system
The input requirement analysis activity come number stakeholder include item The output analysis activity requirement measurable impact software system architecture called
design process creating architecture
Given determined analysis current state design result evaluation activity design created improved
See discussion various technique improving current design
process determining well current design portion satisfies requirement derived analysis
An evaluation occur whenever architect considering design decision occur portion design completed occur final design completed occur system constructed
Some available software architecture evaluation technique include TARA
Frameworks comparing technique discussed framework SARA Report Architecture review practice experience
process maintaining adapting existing software architecture meet requirement environmental change
As software architecture provides fundamental structure software system evolution maintenance would necessarily impact fundamental structure
As architecture evolution concerned adding new functionality well maintaining existing functionality system behaviour
Architecture requires critical supporting activity
These supporting activity take place throughout core software architecture process
They include knowledge management communication design reasoning decision making documentation
Software architecture supporting activity carried core software architecture activity
These supporting activity assist software architect carry analysis synthesis evaluation evolution
For instance architect gather knowledge make decision document analysis phase
Software architecture description involves principle practice modeling representing architecture using mechanism architecture description language architecture viewpoint architecture framework
An architecture description language ADL mean expression used describe software architecture
Many ADLs developed since including SAE standard developed Carnegie Mellon developed Carnegie Mellon xADL developed UCI developed developed University Málaga developed University Italy
Software architecture description commonly organized analogous different type made building
Each view address set system concern following convention viewpoint specification describes notation modeling analysis technique use view express architecture question perspective given set stakeholder concern
The viewpoint specifies concern framed addressed presentation model kind used convention used consistency correspondence rule keep view consistent view
An architecture framework capture convention principle practice description architecture established within specific domain application community stakeholder
A framework usually implemented term one viewpoint ADLs
An general reusable solution commonly occurring problem software architecture within given context
Architectural pattern often documented software
Following traditional building architecture architectural style specific method construction characterized feature make notable
An architectural style defines family system term pattern structural organization vocabulary component connector constraint combined
Architectural style reusable design decision constraint applied architecture induce chosen desirable quality
There many recognized architectural pattern style among Some treat architectural pattern architectural style treat style specialization pattern
What common pattern style idiom architect use provide common language vocabulary describe class system
There also concern software architecture lead much especially among proponent
A number method developed balance design agility including agile method mandate Foundations phase enough architectural foundation laid
devoted special issue interaction agility architecture
Software architecture erosion decay refers gap observed planned actual architecture software system realized implementation
Software architecture erosion occurs implementation decision either fully achieve otherwise violate constraint principle architecture
The gap planned actual architecture sometimes understood term notion
As example consider strictly system layer use service provided layer immediately
Any source code component observe constraint represents architecture violation
If corrected violation transform architecture monolithic block adverse effect understandability maintainability evolvability
Various approach proposed address erosion
These approach include tool technique process primarily classified three generic category attempt minimise prevent repair architecture erosion
Within broad category approach broken reflecting strategy adopted tackle erosion
These architecture conformance architecture evolution management architecture design enforcement architecture implementation linkage architecture restoration technique consisting recovery discovery reconciliation
There two major technique detect architectural violation reflexion model language
Reflexion model RM technique compare model provided system architect source code implementation
There also focus specifying checking architectural constraint
Software architecture recovery reconstruction includes method technique process uncover software system architecture available information including implementation documentation
Architecture recovery often necessary make informed decision face obsolete documentation implementation maintenance decision diverging envisioned architecture
Architecture design architectural
In practice architect one draw line software architecture architectural design detailed design design
There rule guideline fit case although attempt formalize distinction
According distinction architectural detailed design defined according statement software design architectural program satisfies expanded program
For example style architectural strategic program built principle expanded program example adding node
software architecture seen complementary approach software architecture target requirement engineering address
Requirements engineering entail
Both requirement engineering software architecture revolve around concern need wish
There considerable overlap requirement engineering software architecture evidenced example study five industrial software architecture method concludes
In short choice required behavior given particular problem impact architecture solution address problem time architectural design may impact problem introduce new requirement
Approaches Twin Peaks model aim exploit relation requirement architecture

In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

A computer generally one operating system becomes active take control system turned
Computer hardware wired initially load small set system instruction stored
You likely used least one operating system
The various version Microsoft Windows NT XP Vista popular choice personal computer
UNIX favourite serious programmer year version UNIX called popular personal computer system
Identify resource need managed within computer system
The various role operating system generally revolve around idea sharing nicely
An operating system manages resource resource often shared one way another among various program want use multiple program executing concurrently share use main memory take turn using CPU compete opportunity use input output device
The operating system act playground monitor making sure everyone cooperates get chance play
There various aspect resource require management computer system including primary memory secondary memory processor bandwidth graphic sound network cache
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling policy virtual memory paging interrupt polling
An executing program resides main memory instruction processed one another
Multiprogramming technique keeping multiple program main memory time program compete access CPU work
All modern operating system employ multiprogramming one degree another
An operating system must therefore perform memory management keep track program memory memory reside
Memory continuous set bit referenced specific address
All program stored main memory executed
All data referenced program program also stored main memory accessed
Main memory thought big continuous chuck space divided group bit
Each byte word memory corresponding address simply integer uniquely identifies particular part memory
To right representation memory first memory address
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
Earlier stated multiprogramming environment multiple program data stored main memory time
Thus operating system must employ technique A program filled reference variable part program code
When program compiled reference changed address memory data code resides
But since one know exactly program loaded main memory one know address use anything
The solution use two kind address logical address physical address
A logical address sometimes called virtual relative address value specifies generic location relative program reality main memory
A physical address actual address main memory device shown figure
When program compiled reference identifier variable name changed logical address
When program eventually loaded memory logical address finally corresponds specific physical address
The mapping logical address physical address called address binding
Logical address allow program moved around memory loaded different place different time
As long one keep track program stored one always able determine physical address corresponds given logical address
The following section examine underlying principle main memory management technique
To simplify example calculation performed base
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling policy multitasking paging interrupt polling
The demand paging approach give rise idea virtual memory illusion restriction size program entire program necessarily memory time
In memory management technique examined earlier entire process brought memory continuous whole
Therefore always upper bound process size
Demand paging remove restriction
However virtual memory come lot overhead execution program
With memory management technique program loaded memory ready go
With virtual memory approach one constantly swap page main secondary memory
This overhead usually acceptable one program waiting page swapped another process take control CPU make progress
Excessive page swapping called thrashing seriously degrade system performance
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Limitations resource specific computer system often closely related hardware system capability
Limitations could include The widely used device magnetic disk drive
It includes hard drive found computer main casing disk portable moved easily computer
Storing data onto secondary storage requires mechanism organising electron medium
As use individual file used user point view smallest amount data bet written secondary memory
A file system natural solution managing file logical view operating system provides user manage data collection file
A file system often organized grouping file directory
Additionally file generic concept
Different type file managed different way
A file general contains program form data one type another
Some file rigid format others flexible
The important hardware device used secondary memory magnetic disk drive
File system stored drive must accessed efficient manner
It turn transferring data secondary memory worst bottleneck general computer system
The speed CPU speed main memory much faster speed data transfer secondary memory magnetic disk
That process must perform disk made wait data transferred give another process chance use CPU
Because secondary slowest aspect general computer system technique accessing data disk drive crucial importance file system
As computer deal multiple process period time request access disk accumulate
The technique operating system us determine request satisfy called disk scheduling
A magnetic disk drive organized stack platter platter divided track track divided sector
The set corresponding track platter called cylinder

Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Another important resource operating system must manage use CPU individual process
TO understand operating system manages process one must recognise stage process go computational life understand information must managed keep process working correctly computer system
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
Processes move specific stage managed computer system
That process enters system ready executed executing waiting resource finished
Below flow chart represents process state
In figure box represents state process might arrow indicate process might move one state another
Examining happening process state Note many process may ready state waiting state time one process running state
After process created operating system admits ready state
When CPU scheduling algorithm dictate process dispatched running state
While running process might interrupted operating system allow another process chance CPU
In case process simply return ready state
Alternatively running process might request resource available requires retrieve newly referenced part process case moved waiting state
A running process may finally get enough CPU time complete processing terminate normally otherwise may generate unrecoverable error terminate abnormally
When waiting process get resource waiting move ready state
The operating system must manage large amount data active process
Usually data stored data structured called process control block PCB
Generally state represented list PCBs one process state
When process move one state another corresponding PCB move one state list another operating system
A new PCB created process first created new state persists process terminates

Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Outline OS resource management technique policy multitasking virtual memory paging interrupt polling
Related idea memory management process management need CPU scheduling determines process memory executed CPU given point
The problem capitalise computer greater capability speed led concept timesharing
A timesharing system allows multiple user interact computer time
Multiprogramming allowed multiple process active gave rise ability programmer interact computer system directly still sharing resource whereas timesharing system create illusion user exclusive access computer
That user actively compete resource though exactly happening behind scene
One user may actually know sharing machine user anything special allow
The operating system manages sharing resource including CPU behind scene
CPU scheduling act determining process ready state moved running state
That CPU scheduling algorithm decide process given CPU make computational progress
CPU scheduling decision made process switch running state waiting state program terminates
This type CPU scheduling called nonpreemptive scheduling need new CPU process result activity current executing process
CPU scheduling decision may also made process move running state ready state process move waiting state ready state
These example preemptive scheduling currently running process fault preempted operating system
Scheduling algorithm often evaluated using particular metric turnaround time process
This amount time time process arrives ready state time exit running state last time
One would like average turnaround time process small possible
There various approach used determine process get chosen first move ready state running state
Here examination three In FCFS scheduling approach process moved CPU order arrive running state
FCFS scheduling nonpreemptive
Once process given access CPU keep unless make request force wait request force wait request device use another process
The SJN CPU scheduling algorithm look process ready state dispatch one smallest service time
Like FCFS generally implemented nonpreemptive algorithm
Explain role operating system term managing memory peripheral hardware interface
CPU scheduling distributes processing time equitably among ready process
The algorithm establishes particular time slice time quantum amount time process receives preempted return ready state allow another process turn
Eventually preempted process given another time slice CPU
This procedure continues process eventually get time need terminates
Note algorithm preemptive
The expiration time slice arbitrary reason move process CPU
This action presented transition running state ready state
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Outline OS resource management technique scheduling multitasking virtual memory paging interrupt polling
Operating system must also take account fact computer usually connected network
Today World Wide Web one would take network communication granted however vastly connected interactive world requires management data level
Operating system able process input output fro physical computer usually network card sort
This communication network card computer usually managed Network Interface Controller NIC small component handle two physical data link layer
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
Along peripheral fundamental aspect operating system must deal graphic graphic management
Computer graphic generally described setting pixel value computer screen
As computer graphic play role many aspect computer science common application graphical user interface GUI modern operating system
Files folder represented icon screen icon indicating file type instance
The operating system must account whereabouts calculation computer graphic typically done using individual Graphics Processing Unit GPU
Identify limitation range resource specified computer system Describe possible problem resulting limitation resource computer system
A type cache
Aside obvious various miscellaneous system concept require management may entirely obvious
One cache
Cache component transparently store data future request data served faster
The data stored within cache might value computed earlier duplicate original value stored elsewhere
If requested data contained cache request served simply reading cache comparatively faster
Otherwise data recomputed fetched original storage location comparatively slower
Hence greater number request served cache faster overall system performance becomes
Evaluate resource available variety computer system
An operating system responsible communicating variety device
Usually communication accomplished help device driver small program know way particular device expects receive deliver information
With device driver every operating system longer need know every device might possible expected communicate te fuure
It another beautiful example abstraction

iPod Touch iPhone iPad run iOS mobile operating system derived Mac OS
The Android operating system developed Google open source project part Open Handset Alliance
It become popular OS variety mobile device
Android iOS dominate current market mobile operating system though competitor
Outline operating system hide complexity hardware user application
Modern computer hardware incredibly complex
Luckily operating system hide complexity use abstraction APIs
For example application want create file particular location order OS create file
The program need concerned filesystem disk running FAT NTFS etc disk whether network server local drive
The OS hide detail
Other example include virtualizing real device drive letter virtual memory input device Java virtual machine

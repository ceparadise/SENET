A machine virtual address physical address
Pages
How many entry needed conventional page table
The answer entry Why entry
My doubt number page table entry depend virtual address space rather physical address space
What mean virtual address space physical address space
The process access many page present physical memory
So make sense virtual physical memory address space
But virtual address space
Does mean different virtual address entry mapped physical location page table
Guess would lead inconsistency right
Can someone help get bigger picture
I really need internalize concept
When using Virtual Memory translating Virtual Address Space Physical Address Space
To understand requires entry consider page size
In order byte address KB require entry
If consider Virtual Address given u bit give u bit
These bit used indexing page table determining address page main memory
The reason virtual memory program getting large could fit main memory
So order allow greater degree multiprogramming virtual memory introduced
A program could memory
However required part would loaded memory required concept refered Demand Paging
Page table organized per number page frame

But using inverted page table reverse mapping done table organized per number frame


The main objective increase degree multi programming ability interact multiple process though insufficient amount physical memory

I try solve exercise unfortunately without success yet
From following given information virtual address space calculated My idea find many page addressed
The page count lead size virtual address space right
Virtual address space page size page count As far I understand page count defined logical address size
The logical address split level page table plus offset
Due page table entry size byte bit bit logical address used stage address
The offset size bit
Each page stage address bit plus bit offset
So result page count
Page count With page size page count I get virtual address space
I think wrong
It much larger
What correct
Any help appreciated
Since Logical address size bit mean logical address space byte assuming system byte addressable
Otherwise general logical address given also found
From information assuming entire page used Now consider outermost page table
It entry mean second level page table page page entry
Going logic derived number page process logical address space And given page size KB Therefore logical address space size KB byte By posting answer agree

A location usually
You think storage box one length
Each box address unique number assigned
By specifying memory address particular byte data
Disks divided unique address
Usually need worry address unless programmer
A identifies component
In example every unique address
On every unique address called

This submission getting response Also sorry mi understanding
First I need know difference physical addressing virtual addressing concept embedded system
virtual addressing concept implemented embedded system
advantage system physical addressing concept embedded system
How mapping virtual addressing physical addressing done embedded system
Explain concept simple example simple architecture
Physical addressing mean program actually know real layout RAM
When access variable address really stored physical RAM chip
With virtual addressing application memory access go page table map virtual physical address
So every application private address space program read write another program memory
This called
Virtual addressing many benefit
It protects program crashing poor pointer manipulation etc
Because program distinct virtual memory set program read another data safety security plus
Virtual memory also enables program physical RAM may stored disk slower flash use called back application attempt access page
Also since one program may resident particular page physical paging system either program must compiled load different memory address b every program must use Code c set program run simultaneously
The mapping may done software hardware support memory trap pure hardware
Sometimes even page table special set hardware memory
I know top head embedded system every desktop hardware TLB Translation Lookaside Buffer basically cache mapping advanced Memory Mapping Units help virtual machine like
The downside virtual memory added complexity hardware implementation slower performance
The VAX Virtual Address eXtented Digital Equipment Corp became Compaq became HP good example virtual embeded hardware system
It bit mini computer OS called VMS Virtual Memory Systems
Dave Cutler one principle architets system much later wrote Kernal Windows NT
He good read stuff
The Vax special hardware control virtual space control opcode access security hardware secure
This system grandfather modfern day PC Kernal Level
The first BSOD I saw WNT I able read came crash dump used VMS stop system unstable
By te way Look name VMS WNT find next letter alhabet VMS make term WNT
This accident
maybe jab DEC letting go

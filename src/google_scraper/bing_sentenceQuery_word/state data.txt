In program described designed remember preceding event user interaction remembered information called system
The set state system occupy known
In state space often system internal behaviour interaction environment consists separately occurring individual action event accepting input producing output may may cause system change state
Examples system circuit component
The output digital circuit computer program time completely determined current input state
circuit divided two type whose output dependent present input signal whose output function current input past history input
In sequential logic information past input stored electronic memory element
The stored content memory element given point time collectively referred circuit contains information past circuit access
Since two possible state finite number memory element digital circuit certain finite number possible state
If number binary memory element circuit maximum number state circuit
Similarly computer program store data represent storage location computer
The content memory location given point program execution called program
way designing describes computation term program state statement change program state
In language program describes desired result specify change state directly
A specialized definition state used computer program operate sequentially stream data program
Serial program operate incoming data character packet sequentially one time
In program information previous data character packet received stored variable used affect processing current character packet
This called data carried previous processing cycle called state
In others program information previous data stream start fresh data input called
The output sequential circuit computer program time completely determined current input current state
Since memory element two possible state total number different state circuit assume finite fixed number memory element
If binary memory element digital circuit distinct state
The concept state formalized abstract mathematical called used design sequential digital circuit computer program
An example everyday device state
To change channel TV user usually press channel channel button remote control sends coded message set
In order calculate new channel user desire digital tuner television must stored number
It add one subtracts one number get number new channel adjusts TV receive channel
This new number stored
Similarly television also store number control level produced speaker
Pressing volume volume button increment decrement number setting new level volume
Both number part TV state
They stored preserve information TV turned turned TV return previous station volume level
As another example state content memory element
When computer laptop go save energy shutting processor state processor stored computer restored computer come hibernation processor take operation left
Following state distinguished

In computer science state program defined condition regarding stored input
The term state used similarly used science whereas state object instance gas liquid solid show current physical makeup state computer program show current value content
The stored input computer program stored variable constant
In analyzing state program developer may go look value stored input
As program executed state may change variable change value stored memory also change
For example control variable variable used loop change state program iteration
Looking state program considered testing method way analyzing code base
Developers also talk different type state example contrasting two complementary state contradictory one another contrasting two different state resulting different operation

For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


Organizations nearly every industry looking professional skill transform big data better insight data scientist short supply
You could fill gap

I new computer science programming I wondering difference computer science programming
get choose study one university
We looking long answer provide explanation context
Do give answer explain answer right ideally citation
Answers include explanation may removed
Computer science study computer programming practice making computer thing
Take look offered university interested find whether course CS course programming course something else example Software Engineering even combination
Many course advertised computer science offer significant programming component may put theoretical part course practice may sake learn skill making program
A caveat Science become muddied field modern time least United States university degree programming
This mean people interested programming must sign Computer Science degree reaction Computer Science program emphasize programming
That said Computer Science mathematical science Computational Mathematics might better term
It involves study graph theory algorithmic complexity formal logic automaton general logical structure describe transformation response input algorithm
A Computer Scientist classic sense could reason rule govern computing system including modern computer without necessarily knowing detail implementation current architecture
A strong background Computer Science give ability develop recall efficient scalable algorithm anticipate logical reduction reason soundly tractable
Programming contrast person use transform something machine
That make obvious intimate connection Computer Science much confusion come
A programmer relative environment language able take virtually set algorithm transform form writing code
A strong background programming CS degree provide enables write better code code easily understood others successful expressing algorithm implementing
There large amount crosstalk course high level experience one correspond strongly developing experience noted CS major almost always competent programmer seasoned programmer picked many principle CS
Think Physics Engineering
A good way remembering difference requires computer see work programming pencil paper Computer Science
Computer science deal theoretical foundation information computation practical technique implementation application
Computer science computer astronomy telescope
Edsger Dijkstra Programming craft creating computer program
Computer Science point view supposed Hard Science like Physics
It involves study compiler compiler generator hardware architecture concept various form number system algorithm algorithmic efficiency performance theory behind arithmetic operation processor
When I CS university spent lot time mucking around assembler learning difference compiling linking interpreting etcetera
A lot done programming act writing code compiled run via interpreter intention generating result solve problem
That Programming act solving problem described knowledge Computer Science
It kind Pure Maths Applied Maths split
You need Computer Science degree programmer programmer CS background likely deeper understanding behaviour computer program
I would reword question What difference Computer Science Software Engineering
After involve programming
Computer Science theortical study computation possible
It look thing like Godels Theorem Halting problem
Software engineering write program designed maintanable
theory programming
Programming implementation
scientific practical approach computation application
A computer scientist specializes theory computation design computational system
Its subfields divided variety theoretical practical discipline
Some field computational complexity theory explores fundamental property computational problem highly abstract field computer graphic emphasize visual application
Still field focus challenge implementing computation
For example programming language theory considers various approach description computation whilst study computer programming investigates various aspect use programming language complex system
interaction considers challenge making computer computation useful usable universally accessible human
If programming carpentry computer science
More info carpentry interested thing like order build thing frame subfloor interior wall drywall etc
How build take le time construct modified later
In case architecture part like CS anyway concerned thing like capability material big beam need support span
Similarly CS theoretical capability computer programming practical application knowledge
Computer science programming physic mechanical engineering
Computer science theoretical take scientific mathematical approach information computation
Computer programming practical process designing writing testing debugging maintaining source code computer program
They different related field
Both benefited
A degree computer science lot broader scope cover theory behind computing
A hand focused developing coding programming skill student training different programming language
If confused browse detail program California College San Diego
That may provide clarity regarding scope degree
It study problem solving method
Computer programming It part problem solving process make field computer science
Computer programming small subset computer science
Programming people
People read write maintain code
Computer science implement describe algorithm
Programming development making money

I know quote true least data
Data need processed lot convenient accurate cheaper data machine readable format
Data format form read understood processed computer
Let understand example
Suppose went restaurant ordered food beer
Upon paying bill guy restaurant billing desk printed gave receipt like kept another copy receipt This receipt format
Everyone understand receipt serf purpose well restaurant happy
worry
So good far
But notice receipt
There lot data
It date time product restaurant sold amount
Now imagine restaurant owner plan open new branch restaurant want know thing planning new restaurant The first question answered straight forward data receipt last two answer fairly answered added external data like city population data etc
So search answer asks manager restaurant information disappointment come bundle thousand receipt restaurant storing
Finally receipt scanned computer information printed receipt converted format analyzed someone computer
How convenient would receipt also stored somewhere format
Maybe something like It really easy often impossible computer understand language format way human understand thing
Therefore data stored database computer system server format computer understands best format
These format name computer understands best
The format used example
Other popular format include data stored database
Formats like JSON efficient store semistructured
Relational database good handling structured data tabular format
Note If reading post part series really need worry technical term
All need know data required format reason mentioned paragraph Well stupid question I say
We know data need format could read machine computer mean
What really worth thinking
There several good reason
Here short list I keep going
But I sure understood format data need format read machine
I wanted give idea move next post series explaining I hope post informative enjoyed reading

Government agency investing strategy increase access information created collected held government
While strategy typically involve placing information web sometimes exhibit misunderstanding importance providing information machine readable format
The degree information machine readable however critical meeting priority open government open data directly influence many case limit us citizen interested party make information
Historically effort make government information available public focused pushing static information government program service web
The intended user human read print take action based reading material engaging transaction
In case user able query data map result using sophisticated geospatial display
Access data hand rarely provided
This historical practice dictated large part capability familiar web technology HTML PDF narrow vision expected user us information
Machine readable format expand field vision new user new us require technology RDF XML JSON may le familiar context still proven widely used arena web service content management
Taking next step machine readable format requires government agency fully appreciate potential us government information well range possible format implication format intended use
So begin
An important starting point understand machine readable synonymous digitally accessible information
Scanning report text graphic even row column number make digitally accessible computer still really able understand information
This distinction seen difference magazine cover barcode cover
A computer directly understand picture magazine represents even presented online format read understand bar code using identifying price tracking purchase example
Let consider significance bar code machine readable format universally embedded product document today virtually unseen year ago
What factor account prevalence
Similar factor coming play advent machine readable format government data
The expectation similar benefit usability payback extensibility provide motivation
To realize benefit similar condition also apply
Uniformity standardization data format processing needed
Simplicity creating embedding format must achieved
Cost advantage must realized use justify creation
When condition met machine readable data become prevalent leading turn increased capability
For reason commitment open government transparency increase effort make information available must include machine readable version datasets report information document form PDF HTML JPG
Consider bar chart government report
You read report PDF format understand analysis chart provides
However neither chart underlying data available way allows processing information
Next generation effort opening government must ensure user access example static bar chart image also information source bar chart underlying data much magazine bar code described reveals far data magazine leveraged additional benefit
In practical sense machine readable information help government agency bridge gap document typically static frozen format data may dynamic open processing
By adopting machine readable perspective agency meet open government open data objective completely reliably responsibly
Further implication document versus data various level machine readability along condition required broader deeper implementation far beyond scope paper intends provide basic awareness main component machine readable information
To aid awareness following section briefly outline characteristic difference document data take quick look special case syndication format
It concludes glossary relevant term
Subsequent paper address issue surrounding machine readability related policy greater detail
primary format used make government information available public document form
While PDF made possible many document available web simply providing PDF report fully address need information document underlying data
For example PDF necessarily indicate authored came nature content
This type information document often referred metadata document
Much bar code contains additional data product metadata provides additional data assist citizen researcher searching particular author particular topic
Without access metadata thousand government document web citizen essentially looking needle haystack
There number tool available extract kind information many kind PDF document make available use application developer ensure data available searching citizen others
Thus PDF document step towards machine readability useful enhanced appropriate metadata
developed several purpose one make metadata document directly available
XML properly used tag information document computer automatically extract help provide user capability searching browsing information discovery
Along line important emerging property XML involves providing mechanism tracking version document
When used allows history document made available others important capability tracking legislation policy guidance decision memo
Producing quality metadata pivotal ability search tool find particular document response particular query
XML produce metadata tool make available use
Producing metadata ensuring use language XML fall document owner producer technologist support
Machine readability directly influence data usability
Datasets particular large datasets convey little information human
Only data processed way visualized analyzed summarized becomes informative useful
Thus fully realize potential open government data government agency must release data format allows processing
Providing innovator journalist end user data way make possible better understand raw data examine way meet interest responds question
It allows drive business case becomes business
The common machine readable format data Comma Separated Variables CSV provided directly many standard database spreadsheet product
CSV store tabular data format making easily exchanged machine
CSV like XML document inherently make metadata available
There number metadata format developed use along CSV currently tend defined developing open data website rather data provider
A general problem CSV primarily make difficult computer find common element datasets
If one dataset value Alaska another one AK separate information must retained somewhere link thing
The term linked data emerging Resource Description Framework RDF standard designed enhance capability datasets metadata directly attached also allow common term related throughout datasets
These feature RDF making increasingly attractive modern open data site
When information published machine readable format information especially metadata shared via syndication enables automatic continuous feed information
A user using one number application request information pushed machine
Common syndication format RSS Atom JSON thus used sharing machine readable document machine readability solution
They viewed accurately beneficial outcome machine readability outcome people familiar today
The following glossary provides basic definition term acronym may encounter investigating machine readability
They arranged alphabetically topic theme
Application Programming Interface When information made available machine readable format becomes possible make information directly available program request information web
An API way information made directly available machine
Atom machine syndication format based XML
It widely used application publish document news item syndicate basic metadata document title author etc
Comma separated value A format store tabular data number text form
CSV open format widely used store organize tabular data
Most open government data site use CSV data release format
Any format stored viewed shared computer
While machine readable format also digital format digital format machine readable
Tim inventor World Wide Web proposed rating scheme open government data
He suggested making data available online one star making machine readable using three star using RDF format four star using RDF link datasets five star
HyperText Markup Language The main markup language displaying web page information web browser
HTML open standard
The tag markup HTML mainly relate information displayed human user information
In general putting document HTML without form tagging metadata considered making machine readable useful sense
JavaScript Object Notation A machine readable data format derived JavaScript language used many web site
It used representing simple data structure associative array
As data serialization format language machine independent
JSON open format defined RFC
JSON also used Facebook way publishing public information increasing use datasharing syndication application
Machine readable data useful information produced etc
associated data
Both document structured datasets require metadata searchable sharable etc
The Government Open Government Directive defines open format one platform independent machine readable made available public without restriction would impede All format discussed document Open Formats
Portable Document Format A file format used mainly represent document layout stay independent system environment
As Adobe released PDF format open standard
PDF mainly human readable format concerned layout organization
Tools connecting metadata PDF extracting text make PDF machine readable many document format
Resource Description Framework A data language used represent data information web resource linked together
RDF open standard
RDF increasing popularity data release language allows common term linked datasets
Really Simple Syndication An XML RDF based language used publish frequently updated work
Includes content metadata content author date
An RSS feed common syndication method sharing document published web
way embedding metadata common object web document
It supported Bing Google Yahoo
web search engine
Use enhances ability search engine find machine readable document optimize search rank
Use increasingly important enhancement machine readable document due role increasing Search Engine Optimization online resource
Digital format used help publish continuous feed information
eXtensible Markup Language A markup language defines set rule encoding document format human machine readable
XML open format created maintained
XML enhanced proper use XML schema use metadata embedded XML
This tremendously useful document Jim
Thank providing everyone benefit
Uniformity simplicity really key As design company owner main designer deal lot data I tell data usage involves hand machine rather interpreting data accessible format infographics
Lets keep thing simple

Saddened see PDF promoted primary format US government us make information available public
PDF tool textual data far perfect typically require involvement level free data locked inside
Scraping PDFs image OCR even get started painful
While PDF go open source still part specification thus creating barrier entry level user
Moreover PDFs require browser viewing web thus defining Platform technology
HTML format promoted utilized US government making information available public
HTML Web Platform standard backbone internet widely used semantic web technology microformats utilized date Living Standard maintained
word HTML Web core language creating document applicatons everyone use anywhere
Moreover reason pointing success bar code Uniformity HTML Web Platform standard format structuring content aka publishing language
This standard format release public domain enabled immediate global consumption adoption turn fueled growth tool utilizing HTML

Programming language used implement algorithm
They create program communicate instruction computer
There many different type programming language
But ability Languages defined
instruction encoded language human use understand instruction language computer understand code

set executed directly CPU
Each instruction performs specific task load operation unit data memory
Every program directly executed CPU made series instruction
The phrase executed need qualification machine code definition lowest level programming detail visible programmer internally many processor use optimise transform machine code instruction sequence sophisticated way
Numerical machine code may regarded representation primitive
While possible write program directly numerical machine code tedious error prone manage individual bit calculate numerical address constant manually
For reason program almost never written directly machine code modern context
Three exception low level program would called absence assembly machine language available
All practical program today written assembly language
The source code translated executable machine code utility important exception program translated machine code
However may seen executor processor performing instruction source code typically consists directly executable machine code generated assembly source code
Every processor processor family machine code
Instructions pattern physical design correspond different command machine
Thus instruction set specific class processor using mostly architecture
Successor derivative processor design often include instruction predecessor may add additional instruction
Occasionally successor design discontinue alter meaning instruction code typically needed new purpose affecting code compatibility extent even nearly completely compatible processor may show slightly different behavior instruction rarely problem
Systems may also differ detail memory arrangement operating system
Because program normally relies factor different system typically run machine code even type processor used
A machine code instruction set may instruction length may instruction
How pattern organized varies strongly particular architecture often also type instruction
Most instruction one field specifies basic instruction type arithmetic logical etc
actual operation add compare field may give type addressing offset index actual value constant operand contained instruction called
Not machine individual instruction explicit operand
An combined left operand result implicit accumulator arithmetic instruction
Other architecture accumulator version common instruction accumulator regarded one general register longer instruction
A operand implicit stack
Special purpose instruction also often lack explicit operand CPUID architecture writes value four implicit destination register instance
This distinction explicit implicit operand important code generator especially register allocation live range tracking part
A good code optimizer track implicit well explicit operand may allow frequent register register assigned result constant expression freed replacing constant code enhancement
A computer program sequence instruction executed CPU
While simple processor execute instruction one another processor capable executing several instruction
may influenced special instruction transfer execution instruction numerically following one
taken execution continues another address execution continues next instruction depending condition
A much readable rendition machine language called us refer machine code instruction rather using instruction numeric value directly
For example processor machine code cause CPU decrement would represented assembly language
The provides specific example machine code whose instruction always bit long
The general type instruction given operation field highest bit
jump immediate instruction fully specified
register instruction include additional field determine exact operation
The field used type indicate register operand give shift amount field contain operand directly
For example adding register placing result register encoded Load value register taken memory cell cell location listed register Jumping address In machine code implemented even fundamental underlying layer called providing common machine language interface across line family different model computer widely different underlying
This done facilitate machine language program different model
An example use IBM family computer successor
With dataflow path width bit bit beyond nevertheless present common architecture machine language level across entire line
Using microcode implement enables computer present architecture entirely different computer
The line used allow porting program earlier IBM machine new family computer
emulator IBM model
Machine code generally different also known either executed interpreter compiled machine code faster direct execution
An exception processor designed use particular bytecode directly machine code case
Machine code assembly code sometimes called referring part language feature library
The computer architecture physically separate storage signal pathway code instruction
Today processor implement separate signal pathway performance reason actually implement support task like loading program data executing
Harvard architecture contrasted data code stored memory read processor allowing computer execute command
From point view part code execution stored
In system comprises program usually
In environment different thread one process share code space along data space reduces overhead considerably compared process switching

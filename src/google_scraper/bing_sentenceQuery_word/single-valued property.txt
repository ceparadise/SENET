The syntax reading writing property like field property read writes usually translated method call
The syntax easier read write lot method call yet interposition method call hood allows element implementation may called field
See instructive example C language
Programming language support property include
Some language support property require programmer define pair method instead
provides alternative mechanism using object variable visibility flag
Other language designed natively support property
While first class property emulated due operator overloading
Also note compiler support first class property Microsoft compiler example
In language property implemented pair method accessed using syntax public field
Omitting method pair yield uncommon property
In language support property similar construct implemented single method either return change underlying data depending context invocation
Such technique used

Some language Ruby Smalltalk achieve syntax using normal method sometimes limited amount
Some language follow syntax convention formally specifying utilizing property method
Among convention The following example demonstrates dot notation JavaScript
The following example demonstrates bracket notation JavaScript
Recent C version also allow property backing field property generated compiler compilation
This mean property must setter however private
first class property exist several way emulate property limited degree
Two follow An example taken MSDN
In D version property accessor mutator must marked property The example could used arbitrary method like Properties work correctly class class available Python newer see
Python added new syntax involving decorator defining property
Ruby also provides automatic synthesizer defined instance method Class

In C property named member class struct interface offering neat way access private field called get set accessor method
The following code example declares property called Species class Animal abstract access private variable called name Often property name internal member access capital initial letter Name case internal member prefix
Also note implicit parameter called value used set accessor type underlying member variable
Accessors fact represented internally method order maintain compatibility language support accessors
Once property defined easy get set value If property get accessor property
If set accessor property
If property

I working app requires communication OData service Microsoft Dynamics CRM exact
I requirement I need know property entity

return contact however I want property definition contact
Right return JSON value however I looking something schema contact entity
It return property
possibly type property
I tried using without luck
Is possible get information entity
Any help would appreciated
The answer provided describe get metadata entity technically definition given entity
However using Web API alternative would download CSDL metadata document metadata Web API look definition contact entityType
This data used generate documentation provides specific definition used Web API
You see difference structure

metadata defines LookupAttributeMetadata attribute Web API us navigation property property
For information understand Web API metadata see See
The previous answer close need get list Attributes
Plus get entity want filter Contact
In returned JSON find attribute Which array
In case I one property LogicalName well MetadataId GUID property
So first property entity
The tell CRM include Attributes
The inner tell field return Attribute
The make sure return metadata Contact
If using Web Api look like retrieve navigation property describe attribute aka field property
For example Further example By posting answer agree

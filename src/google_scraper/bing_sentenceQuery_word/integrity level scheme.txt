one two main programming language
Unlike main dialect Scheme follows design philosophy specifying small standard core powerful tool language extension
Scheme created released developer via series memo known
It first dialect Lisp choose first require implementation perform giving stronger support functional programming associated technique recursive algorithm
It also one first programming language support
It significant influence effort led development
The Scheme language standardized official standard standard called R RS
The widely implemented standard new standard ratified
Scheme diverse user base due compactness elegance minimalist philosophy also caused wide divergence practical implementation much Scheme Steering Committee call world unportable programming language dialect rather single language
Scheme started attempt understand purpose Steele Sussman wrote tiny Lisp interpreter using added mechanism creating actor sending message
Scheme originally called Schemer tradition language like
The current name resulted author use limited filename two component six character
Currently Schemer commonly used refer Scheme programmer
A new language standardization process began Scheme workshop goal producing standard
This process broke earlier R RS approach unanimity
feature standard module system allowing split core language library
A number draft specification released final version
A successful vote resulted ratification new standard announced August
Currently newest release various Scheme implementation support standard
There portable reference implementation proposed implicitly phased library called psyntax load bootstrap properly various older Scheme implementation
introduces numerous significant change language
The source code specified large subset Unicode character may appear Scheme symbol minor change lexical rule
Character data also specified Unicode
Many standard procedure moved new standard library form large expansion standard containing procedure syntactic form formerly part standard
A new module system introduced system exception handling standardized
replaced expressive syntactic abstraction facility allows use Scheme macro expansion time
Compliant implementation support Scheme full semantics number expanded mainly direction support standard floating point numerical representation
The standard caused controversy seen departed minimalist philosophy
In August Scheme Steering Committee oversees standardization process announced intention recommend splitting Scheme two language large modern programming language programmer small version subset large version retaining minimalism praised educator casual implementors
Two working group created work two new version Scheme
The site link working group charter public discussion issue tracking system
The ninth draft small language made available April
A vote ratifying draft closed May final report available since August describing language effort therefore considered isolation successor
Scheme primarily programming language
It share many characteristic member Lisp programming language family
Scheme simple syntax based parenthesized list prefix operator followed argument
Scheme program thus consist sequence nested list
Lists also main data structure Scheme leading close equivalence source code data format
Scheme program easily create evaluate piece Scheme code dynamically
The reliance list data structure shared Lisp dialect
Scheme inherits rich set primitive Lisp progenitor
Scheme us strictly support
Thus procedure assigned value variable passed argument procedure
This section concentrate mainly innovative feature language including feature distinguish Scheme Lisps
Unless stated otherwise description feature relate standard
This subsection describes feature Scheme distinguished programming language earliest day
These aspect Scheme strongly influence product Scheme language aspect version Scheme programming language onward share
Scheme simple language much easier implement many language comparable
This ease attributable use derive much syntax language primitive form
For instance syntactic construct defined Scheme standard classed derived library form written macro involving fundamental form principally lambda
As say sec
The fundamental variable binding construct lambda expression variable binding construct explained term lambda expression
Example macro implement expression using perform variable binding
Thus using defined Scheme implementation would rewrite reduces implementation task coding procedure instantiation
In Sussman Steele remarked minimalism Scheme conscious design goal rather unintended outcome design process
We actually trying build something complicated discovered serendipitously accidentally designed something met goal much simpler intended realized lambda small simple serve core powerful expressive programming language
Like modern programming language unlike earlier Lisps Scheme lexically scoped possible variable binding program unit analyzed reading text program unit without consideration context may called
This contrast dynamic scoping characteristic early Lisp dialect processing cost associated primitive textual substitution method used implement lexical scoping algorithm compiler interpreter day
In Lisps perfectly possible reference inside procedure refer quite distinct binding external procedure depending context call
The impetus incorporate lexical scoping unusual scoping model early new version Lisp came Sussman study
He suggested lexical scoping mechanism would help realize initial goal implementing Lisp
The key insight introduce lexical scoping Lisp dialect popularized Sussman Steele Lambda Paper Scheme An Interpreter Extended Lambda Calculus adopted concept page described attributed idea
mathematical notation lambda calculus inspired Lisp use lambda keyword introducing procedure well influencing development technique involving use Lisp
But early Lisps suitable expression lambda calculus treatment
The introduction lexical scope resolved problem making equivalence form lambda notation practical expression working programming language
Sussman Steele showed new language could used elegantly derive imperative declarative semantics programming language including dynamic scope Lisps using lambda expression simple procedure instantiation control structure environment modifier
They introduced along first description Scheme first Lambda Papers subsequent paper proceeded demonstrate raw power practical use lambda calculus
Scheme inherits block structure earlier block structured language particularly
In Scheme block implemented three
For instance following construct creates symbol called bound number Blocks create arbitrarily complex block structure according need programmer
The use block structuring create local binding alleviates risk otherwise occur
One variant permit binding refer variable defined earlier construct thus The variant designed enable procedure bound one another
See definition used example All procedure bound single may refer one another name well value variable defined earlier may refer defined later
A variant named let form identifier keyword
This bind let variable argument procedure whose name given identifier whose body body let form
The body may repeated desired calling procedure
The named let widely used implement iteration
Example simple counter Like procedure Scheme procedure created named let first class object
Scheme iteration construct Scheme use express
Scheme implementation required optimize tail call support unbounded number active tail call sec
property Scheme report describes safe Scheme programmer write iterative algorithm using recursive structure sometimes intuitive
Tail recursive procedure form provide support iteration using tail recursion
Continuations Scheme
Scheme provides procedure also known capture current continuation packing escape procedure bound formal argument procedure provided programmer
sec
continuation enable programmer create
Continuations used emulate behavior imperative programming language
The following function given function list return first element return true
The following example traditional programmer puzzle show Scheme handle continuation object binding variable passing argument procedure
When executed code display counting sequence In contrast Common Lisp data procedure Scheme share common namespace whereas Common Lisp making possible function variable name requiring special notation referring function value
This sometimes known distinction referring unified namespace Scheme separate namespaces Common Lisp
In Scheme primitive used manipulate bind data used bind procedure
There equivalent Common Lisp primitive
This subsection document design decision taken year given Scheme particular character direct outcome original design
Scheme specifies comparatively full set numerical datatypes including type known Scheme numerical tower sec

The standard treat abstraction commit implementor particular internal representation
Numbers may quality exactness
An exact number produced sequence exact operation involving exact thus contagious
The standard specifies two implementation must produce equivalent result operation resulting exact number
The standard specifies procedure used change exactness number
produce exact number numerically closest argument
produce inexact number numerically closest argument
The standard omits procedure main report specifies compatibility procedure standard library rnrs
In standard Scheme implementation required implement whole numerical tower must implement coherent subset consistent purpose implementation spirit Scheme language sec

The new standard require implementation whole tower exact integer object exact rational number object practically unlimited size precision implement certain procedure always return exact result given exact argument sec
sec

Example exact arithmetic implementation support exact rational complex number
Example Same arithmetic implementation support neither exact rational number complex number accept real number rational notation
Both implementation conform standard second conform implement full numerical tower
Scheme support delayed evaluation form procedure
The lexical context original definition promise preserved value also preserved first use
The promise ever evaluated
These primitive produce handle value known used implement advanced construct
In standard longer primitive instead provided part compatibility library rnrs
In suggested implementation given implementing promise procedure argument using ensure ever evaluated irrespective number time called sec

SRFI enables expression finite infinite sequence extraordinary economy
For example definition using function defined SRFI Most Lisps specify order evaluation procedure argument
Scheme
Order order expression operator position chosen implementation basis constraint effect concurrent evaluation operator operand expression constrained consistent sequential order evaluation
sec
ev procedure describes argument passed return value argument
In contrast Lisps appearance expression operator position first item Scheme expression quite legal long result expression operator position procedure
In calling procedure add expression ev ev ev may evaluated order long effect evaluated parallel
Thus following three line may displayed order standard Scheme example code executed although text one line may interleaved another would violate sequential evaluation constraint
In standard also later report syntax Scheme easily extended via macro system
The standard introduced powerful hygienic macro system allows programmer add new syntactic construct language using simple sublanguage sec
Prior hygienic macro system relegated appendix standard high level system alongside low level macro system treated extension Scheme rather essential part language
Implementations hygienic macro system also called required respect lexical scoping rest language
This assured special naming scoping rule macro expansion avoids common programming error occur macro system programming language
specifies sophisticated transformation system available language extension Scheme time
Invocations macro procedure bear close treated differently
When compiler encounter program first check see symbol defined syntactic keyword within current lexical scope
If attempt expand macro treating item tail argument without compiling code evaluate process repeated recursively macro invocation remain
If syntactic keyword compiler compiles code evaluate argument tail evaluate variable represented symbol head call procedure evaluated tail expression passed actual argument
Most Scheme implementation also provide additional macro system
Among popular one macro system similar system provided
Prior Scheme standard equivalent procedure ubiquitous Lisps although first Lambda Paper described similar LISP function EVAL first Revised Report replaced took two argument
The second third fourth revised report omitted equivalent
The reason confusion Scheme lexical scoping result evaluating expression depends evaluated
For instance clear whether result evaluating following expression If evaluated outer environment defined result sum operand
If evaluated inner environment symbol bound value procedure result product two operand
resolve confusion specifying three procedure return environment providing procedure take environment evaluates expression environment provided
sec
extends providing procedure called programmer specify exactly object import evaluation environment
In dialect Lisp including Common Lisp convention value evaluates value false boolean expression
In Scheme since IEEE standard value except f including equivalent Scheme written evaluate value true boolean expression
sec
Where constant representing boolean value true Lisps Scheme
In Scheme primitive datatypes disjoint
Only one following predicate true Scheme object
sec Within numerical datatype contrast numerical value overlap
For example integer value satisfies predicate time
sec Scheme three different type equivalence arbitrary object denoted three different relational operator testing equality Type dependent equivalence operation also exist Scheme compare two string latter performs comparison compare character compare number
Up standard standard comment Scheme semicolon make rest line invisible Scheme
Numerous implementation supported alternative convention permitting comment extend single line standard permit two entire may turned comment commented preceding introduced SRFI multiline comment block comment may produced surrounding text
Scheme input output based datatype
sec defines two default port accessible procedure correspond Unix notion
Most implementation also provide
input standard output supported standard standard procedure
Most implementation provide string port similar redirection capability enabling many normal operation performed string buffer instead file using procedure described SRFI
The standard specifies much sophisticated capable port procedure many new type port
The following example written strict Scheme
Example With output defaulting Example As using optional port argument output procedure Example As output redirected newly created file Example As explicit file open port close send output file Example As using send output file
Similar procedure provided input
Scheme provides predicate
For character input output provided
For writing reading Scheme expression Scheme provides
On read operation result returned object input port reached end file tested using predicate
In addition standard SRFI defines basic formatting procedure resembling Common Lisp function named
In Scheme procedure bound variable
At language standard formally mandated program may change variable binding procedure effectively redefining
Language change For example one may extend accept string well number redefining In every binding including standard one belongs library exported binding immutable
sec Because redefinition standard procedure mutation forbidden
Instead possible import different procedure name standard one effect similar redefinition
In Standard Scheme procedure convert one datatype another contain character string name predicate end
procedure change value data end
These convention often followed Scheme programmer
In formal context Scheme standard word procedure used preference function refer lambda expression primitive procedure
In normal usage word procedure function used interchangeably
Procedure application sometimes referred formally
As Lisps term used Scheme refer procedure argument
The term proper tail recursion refers property Scheme implementation perform optimization support indefinite number active
The form title standard document since Revised Report Algorithmic Language Scheme reference title standard document Revised Report Algorithmic Language Algol The Summary page closely modeled Summary page ALGOL Report
The language formally defined standard
They describe standard form keywords accompanying syntax provide control structure language standard procedure perform common task
This table describes standard form Scheme
Some form appear one row easily classified single function language
Forms marked L table classed derived library form standard often implemented macro using fundamental form practice making task implementation much easier language
Note defined library syntax expander need know achieve splicing functionality
In longer library syntax
The following two table describe standard procedure Scheme
far extensive summary type would practical
Some procedure appear one row easily classified single function language
String character procedure contain name perform comparison argument upper case lower case version character taken equal
Implementations take two argument defined left optional
Because Scheme minimalism many common procedure syntactic form defined standard
In order keep core language small facilitate standardization extension Scheme community Scheme Request Implementation SRFI process extension library defined careful discussion extension proposal
This promotes code portability
Many SRFIs supported Scheme implementation
SRFIs fairly wide support different implementation include A full list accepted finalized SRFIs available The elegant minimalist design made Scheme popular target language designer hobbyist educator small size typical also popular choice
This resulted score implementation differ much porting program one implementation another quite difficult small size standard language mean writing useful program great complexity standard portable Scheme almost impossible
The standard specifies much broader language attempt broaden appeal programmer
Almost implementation provide traditional development debugging
Many also Scheme program executable binary
Support embedding Scheme code program written language also common relative simplicity Scheme implementation make popular choice adding scripting capability larger system developed language
The Scheme interpreter compile Scheme C make embedding particularly easy
In addition Bigloo compiler configured generate also feature experimental bytecode generator
Some implementation support additional feature
For example provide integration Java class Scheme C compiler often make easy use external library written C allowing embedding actual C code Scheme source
Another example offer set visual tool supporting learning Scheme

If new student think back probably remember given information school academic honesty policy first day class
This information likely addressed among thing school requirement submitting original work policy regarding cheating expectation student behavior
In giving information school suggesting cheat rather merely wanted inform expect student act certain degree integrity
term used describe person level honesty moral commitment willingness right
For example expect doctor honest u diagnosis wo try prescribe medication need generally work best interest health
We expect society doctor perceived people great integrity strong moral compass
Conversely doctor integrity might strongly influenced drug company bribe might talk getting test procedure need
When happens society take dim view case legal charge expected act integrity
One earliest encounter likely integrity outside family academic environment
Specifically teacher instructor expect every assignment turn work
This mean expected copying someone else idea word pas
In case plagiarism unintentional important certain word idea work completely
In academic context scholarly work integrity tremendous importance
For example college professor write book perform experiment expected theory assertion backed rigorous research provide citation
In case discovered someone falsified research data outright lied person face number consequence expected work honesty integrity
Among important people expect act integrity politician
For example politician campaigning public office make many promise claim elected
In general candidate elected precisely claim make integrity one important characteristic
Unfortunately though politician make lot claim campaign trail always follow
This call integrity question seriously weakens chance
Academics politics two major area integrity important integrity fundamental law enforcement justice system
Broadly speaking expect police officer judge impartial uphold law honestly regardless person race ethnicity characteristic
Recently however integrity law enforcement justice system increasingly called question
Get FREE access day create account
For example growing focus police brutality unfair practice United States particularly relate racial ethnic minority
For many Americans allegation hard believe even shocking
This expect law enforcement officer conduct honestly adhere moral principle people equal eye law
In many way idea integrity mean act integrity difficult pin universal term
This integrity mean something society culture created meaning change society evolves
For example fifteenth century person defending practice burning witch would likely seen great deal integrity whereas would consider act reprehensible
The complexity integrity largely related fact rooted shared value notion morality static universal
In fact considered moral behavior much mean depends individual perspective belief
Therefore concept morality honesty change society criterion integrity
Let review
In general word used describe person commitment honesty willingness right
For example person abstains cheating lying stealing would considered person act great integrity
In society integrity important aspect culture contributes strength community
In academic environment example student expected avoid submit work entirely
Other area integrity important include legal justice system politics
Despite importance though universal definition understanding integrity difficult locate
This often concept integrity tends change society culture evolve

Subscriber portal The Windows integrity mechanism core component Windows security architecture restricts access permission application running user account le trustworthy
The WindowsÂ integrity mechanism extends security architecture operating system assigning integrity level application process securable object
The integrity level representation trustworthiness running application process object file created application
The integrity mechanism provides ability resource manager file system use policy block process lower integrity lower trustworthiness reading modifying object higher integrity
The integrity mechanism allows Windows security model enforce new access control restriction defined granting user group permission access control list ACLs
The Windows security architecture based primarily granting access right read write execute permission privilege user group represented internally security identifier SIDs
When user log Windows security subsystem set SID group membership SIDs security access token
The security access token assigned every application process run user
Every time application process open object file registry key resource manager manages object call security subsystem make access decision
The access check determines allowed access permission user
The security subsystem also known Security Reference Monitor compare user group SIDs access token access right security descriptor associated object
If user SID granted full access right ACL application process user run full access object
For information Windows security architecture see
The Windows integrity mechanism extends security architecture defining new access control entry ACE type represent integrity level security descriptor
The new ACE represents object integrity level
An integrity level also assigned security access token access token initialized
The integrity level access token represents subject integrity level
The integrity level access token compared integrity level security descriptor security reference monitor performs access check
WindowsÂ Vista us function determine access right allowed securable object
Windows restricts allowed access right depending whether subject integrity level higher lower object depending integrity policy flag new access control ACE
The security subsystem implement integrity level mandatory label distinguish discretionary access user control ACLs provide
The Windows integrity mechanism enables number important scenario WindowsÂ Vista
In order address requirement Windows integrity mechanism design meet following goal
The Windows integrity mechanism meet goal defining new mandatory label ACE type assigning integrity level object
Details structure described later section paper
However mandatory label ACE defines object integrity level without change existing security descriptor data structure definition commonly used discretionary access control list
The Windows integrity mechanism based mandatory label operating system assigns order differentiate discretionary access user control
Discretionary access control allows object owner group granted permission change object access permission
Windows provides graphical user interface UI advanced user view modify security permission represented discretionary ACL object file registry key
Mandatory label always assigned specific object control object creator set initialize label object creation
No graphical UI managing integrity label implemented WindowsÂ Vista label management available necessary relatively area
The purpose Windows integrity mechanism restrict access permission application running user account le trustworthy
Unknown potentially malicious code downloaded Internet must prevented modifying system state changing user data file manipulating behavior application program
The Windows security subsystem assigns simple hierarchy integrity level code running different privilege level user
Previous version Windows adjust security access token privilege application process although adjustment common
Before WindowsÂ Vista application ran using administrative account full administrator right
WindowsÂ Vista incorporates concept least privilege enabling broader use standard user account
User Account Control UAC Admin Approval Mode administrator account mean multiple application desktop running different privilege level
For example Protected Mode Internet Explorer us integrity mechanism run Web browser process limited access permission
The primary security problem Windows integrity mechanism address unauthorized tampering user data indirectly system state
A secondary problem integrity mechanism help information disclosure
However information disclosure prevented respect access process address space
Information sharing common Windows application convenient information sharing application fundamental user experience
One example copy paste
Rigid security boundary information sharing application running user account severely affect application compatibility user experience
Untrustworthy code try modify user data many way
Some attack may try manipulate data directly creating modifying deleting file
Other attack target another process running higher privilege goal getting arbitrary code execute another application required level access
There many type attack
Because wide range application design implementation integrity mechanism provide complete isolation barrier
The Windows integrity mechanism intended application sandbox
However one security tool application developer use restrict behavior le trustworthy application
Some trait Windows integrity mechanism similar earlier integrity model computer security
However Windows integrity mechanism designed primarily address tampering elevation privilege highly collaborative Windows application environment
Previous integrity model concerned maintaining integrity trustworthy process enforcing policy prevent reading untrusted data
The Biba security model based hierarchy integrity label access policy allowed subject integrity level dominates object integrity level
The Windows integrity mechanism resembles Biba model following way The Windows integrity level ordered lower value indicates le trustworthiness higher value indicates greater trustworthiness
A subject modify object
The integrity level dynamic
For example integrity level subject change lower value process read data object
The strict integrity model Biba allow process read data
This sometimes called integrity policy
The Windows integrity policy described detail inhibit prevent subject reading executing object
There many example attack reading malformed untrusted input data result exploit vulnerability application arbitrary code execution
The Windows integrity mechanism inhibit prevent reading data level
Windows enforce strict integrity policy described Biba model
The integrity design assumes process designed handle untrusted data unknown untrusted source running lower integrity level untrusted data verified use
However Windows integrity mechanism enforce constraint
The Windows integrity mechanism implement dynamic policy
A dynamic policy change integrity level subject subject open object
An issue dynamic integrity process obtains open handle many object based high integrity suddenly becomes subject open particular file
Forcing open handle object close integrity level change significantly affect application behavior
The dynamic process becomes target object process lower integrity level
Such process might able modify behavior application lower level open handle object
The Windows integrity mechanism designed integrity protection data support military commercial requirement described model
The Windows implementation integrity control build concept Constrained Unconstrained Data Items certified Transformation Procedures
However concept useful application designer consider information flow untrusted source process
Although Windows integrity mechanism similar earlier integrity model computer security WindowsÂ Vista try implement model
Instead Windows integrity mechanism limit access permission available process running different privilege trust level
For information earlier work integrity model Biba dynamic integrity policy see

protection theft damage well service provide
Cyber security includes controlling physical access hardware well protecting harm may come via network access data code injection
Also due operator whether accidental security susceptible deviating secure procedure various method
The field growing importance due increasing reliance computer system growth including tiny device part Internet Things
A vulnerability weakness design implementation operation internal control
Most vulnerability discovered documented CVE database
An vulnerability one least one working attack exists
Vulnerabilities often hunted exploited aid manually using customized script
To secure computer system important understand attack made typically classified one category A computer system algorithm secret method bypassing normal authentication security control
They may exist number reason including original design poor configuration
They may added authorized party allow legitimate access attacker malicious reason regardless motif existence create vulnerability
DoS designed make machine network resource unavailable intended user
Attackers deny service individual victim deliberately entering wrong password enough consecutive time cause victim account locked may overload capability machine network block user
While network attack single IP address blocked adding new firewall rule many form DDoS attack possible attack come large number point defending much difficult
Such attack originate range technique possible including innocent system fooled sending traffic victim
An unauthorized user gaining physical access computer likely able directly copy data
They may also compromise security making modification installing software using wireless mouse
Even system protected standard security measure may able booting another operating system tool bootable medium
designed prevent attack
act surreptitiously listening private conversation typically host network
For instance program used eavesdrop system
Even machine operate closed system contact outside world eavesdropped upon via monitoring faint transmission generated hardware specification NSA referring attack
act masquerading valid entity falsification data username order gain access information resource one otherwise unauthorized obtain
There several type spoofing including describes malicious modification product
security service planting surveillance capability router example
describes situation attacker level restricted access able without authorization elevate privilege access level
For example standard computer user may able fool system giving access restricted data even full unrestricted access system
attempt acquire sensitive information usernames password credit card detail directly user
Phishing typically carried often directs user enter detail fake website whose look feel almost identical legitimate one
Preying victim trust phishing classified form
also known UI redress attack User Interface redress attack malicious technique attacker trick user clicking button link another webpage user intended click top level page
This done using multiple transparent opaque layer
The attacker basically click meant top level page routing irrelevant page likely owned someone else
A similar technique used hijack keystroke
Carefully drafting combination stylesheets iframes button text box user led believing typing password information authentic webpage channeled invisible frame controlled attacker
aim convince user disclose secret password card number etc
example impersonating bank contractor customer
A common scam involves fake CEO email sent accounting finance department
In early reported scam cost US business two year
In May team victim type cyber scam perpetrator impersonating team president resulting handover team employee tax form
Employee behavior big impact information security organization
Cultural concept help different segment organization work effectively work effectiveness towards information security within Relationship Organizational Culture Information Security provides following definition information security culture totality pattern behavior organization contribute protection information Andersson Reimers found employee often see part organization Information Security effort often take action ignore organizational Information Security best interest
Research show Information security culture need improved continuously
In Security Culture Analysis author commented never ending process cycle evaluation change To manage information security culture five step taken strategic planning operative planning implementation
The growth number computer system increasing reliance upon individual business industry government mean increasing number system risk
The computer system financial regulator financial institution like SWIFT investment bank commercial bank prominent hacking target cybercriminals interested manipulating market making illicit gain
Web site apps accept store brokerage account information also prominent hacking target potential immediate financial gain transferring money making purchase selling information
payment system also tampered order gather customer account data
Computers control function many utility including coordination valve opening closing water gas network
The Internet potential attack vector machine connected worm demonstrated even equipment controlled computer connected Internet vulnerable
In division investigated hacking incident energy company
Vulnerabilities many use local radio cellular communication cause problem billing fraud
The industry reliant series complex system could attacked
A simple power outage one airport cause repercussion worldwide much system relies radio transmission could disrupted controlling aircraft ocean especially dangerous radar surveillance extends mile offshore
There also potential attack within aircraft
In Europe NewPENS US NextGen program moving create dedicated network
The consequence successful attack range loss confidentiality loss system integrity outage loss aircraft even loss life
Desktop computer laptop commonly targeted gather password financial account information construct attack another target
device like sensor camera microphone GPS receiver compass could exploited may collect personal information including sensitive health information
Wifi Bluetooth cell phone network device could used attack vector sensor might remotely activated successful breach
The increasing number device also potential target
Large corporation common target
In many case aimed financial gain identity theft involves loss million client credit card detail recent breach
Some cyberattacks ordered foreign government government engage intent spread propaganda sabotage spy target
Many people believe Russian government played major role US presidential election using Twitter Facebook affect result election whether true ultimately determined congress
Medical record targeted use general identify theft health insurance fraud impersonating patient obtain prescription drug recreational purpose resale
Although cyber threat continue increase organization increase security training business
Not attack financially motivated however example security firm suffered serious series attack group retaliation firm CEO claiming infiltrated group motive appears embarrass data leak cripple company wiping workstation server
Vehicles increasingly computerized engine timing seat belt tensioners door lock many model
Additionally may use bluetooth communicate onboard consumer device cell phone network
expected even complex

In computer security countermeasure action device procedure technique reduces eliminating preventing minimizing harm cause discovering reporting corrective action taken
End user security habit
Reimers Andersson conducted number study end user security habit found type repeated security best practice marked effect perception compliance good end user network security habit especially concerning malware ransomeware
Some common countermeasure listed following section alternately secure design mean software designed ground secure
In case security considered main feature
Some technique approach include The Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture design describe security control security countermeasure positioned relate overall
These control serve purpose maintain system quality attribute confidentiality integrity availability accountability
Techopedia defines security architecture unified security design address necessity potential risk involved certain scenario environment
It also specifies apply security control
The design process generally reproducible
The key attribute security architecture A state computer security conceptual ideal attained use three process threat prevention detection response
These process based various policy system component include following Today computer security comprises mainly preventive measure like firewall
A firewall defined way filtering network data host network another network implemented software running machine hooking case operating system built operating system provide real time filtering blocking
Another implementation physical firewall consists separate machine filtering network traffic
Firewalls common amongst machine permanently connected
Some organization turning platform extend data accessibility detect
However relatively organisation maintain computer system effective detection system fewer still organised response mechanism place
As result Reuters point Companies first time report losing electronic theft data physical stealing asset
The primary obstacle effective eradication cyber crime could traced excessive reliance firewall automated detection system
Yet basic evidence gathering using put criminal behind bar
Vulnerability management cycle identifying remediating mitigating especially
Vulnerability management integral computer security
Vulnerabilities discovered analyzes computer system search known vulnerability insecure software configuration susceptibility Beyond vulnerability scanning many organisation contract outside security auditor run regular system identify vulnerability
In sector contractual requirement
While correctness computer system possible yet common
Operating system formally verified include make small percentage market
properly implemented virtually impossible directly break
Breaking requires input stolen key stolen plaintext either end transmission extra cryptanalytic information
method mitigating unauthorized access system sensitive information
It requires something know password PIN something card dongle cellphone piece hardware
This increase security unauthorized person need gain access
The tight security measure le unauthorized hack
Social engineering direct computer access physical attack prevented mean difficult enforce relative sensitivity information
Training often involved help mitigate risk even highly disciplined environment
military organization social engineering attack still difficult foresee prevent
Enoculation derived seek prevent social engineering fraudulent trick trap instilling resistance persuasion attempt exposure similar related attempt
It possible reduce attacker chance keeping system date security patch update using security scanner hiring competent people responsible security
The effect data reduced careful
While hardware may source insecurity microchip vulnerability maliciously introduced manufacturing process assisted computer security also offer alternative computer security

Databases function use primary key foreign key maintain relationship table
The database table unique identifier assigned record
Each table one column designated primary key
A Social Security number primary key database listing employee Social Security number unique
However privacy concern assigned company ID number better choice function primary key employee
Some database Microsoft primary key automatically random key real meaning
It better use key meaning record
The simplest way enforce referential integrity allow change primary key
A identifier table match primary key different table
The foreign key creates relationship different table referential integrity refers relationship table
When one table foreign key another table concept referential integrity state may add record table contains foreign key unless corresponding record linked table
It also includes technique known cascading update cascading delete ensure change made linked table reflected primary table

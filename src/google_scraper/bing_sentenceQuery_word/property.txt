Programming language support property include
Some language support property require programmer define pair method instead
provides alternative mechanism using object variable visibility flag
Other language designed natively support property
While first class property emulated due operator overloading
Also note compiler support first class property Microsoft compiler example
In language property implemented pair method accessed using syntax public field
Omitting method pair yield uncommon property
In language support property similar construct implemented single method either return change underlying data depending context invocation
Such technique used

Some language Ruby Smalltalk achieve syntax using normal method sometimes limited amount
Some language follow syntax convention formally specifying utilizing property method
Among convention The following example demonstrates dot notation JavaScript
The following example demonstrates bracket notation JavaScript
Recent C version also allow property backing field property generated compiler compilation
This mean property must setter however private
first class property exist several way emulate property limited degree

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
This question already answer I understand Rice theorem state Trivial property mean
However given property I hard time seeing Trivial
Can someone help understand better maybe good example
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
A property P set Turing machine
The property contains TM
Essentially order check property trivial check TM satisfies TM satisfy
If kind exist property nontrivial
Otherwise trivial
However deciding difficult For example consider property M L M
This property since TMs empty language TMs nonempty language
A trickier example M L M
Initially may seem like nontrivial property
But recall every TM recognizes language
So L M RE every M
Thus property simply collection every TM
So trivial

Ontology Ling Liu Tamer Eds
ontology semantic data model ontological engineering In context computer information science defines set representational primitive model domain knowledge discourse
The representational primitive typically class set attribute property relationship relation among class member
The definition representational primitive include information meaning constraint logically consistent application
In context database system ontology viewed level abstraction data model analogous hierarchical relational model intended modeling knowledge individual attribute relationship individual
Ontologies typically specified language allow abstraction away data structure implementation strategy practice language ontology closer expressive power logic language used model database
For reason ontology said semantic level whereas database schema model data logical physical level
Due independence lower level data model ontology used integrating heterogeneous database enabling interoperability among disparate system specifying interface independent service
In technology stack Semantic Web standard ontology called explicit layer
There standard language variety commercial open source tool creating working ontology
The term ontology come field philosophy concerned study existence
In philosophy one talk theory nature existence Aristotle ontology offer primitive category substance quality presumed account All That Is
In computer information science ontology technical term denoting artifact purpose enable modeling knowledge domain real imagined
The term adopted early Artificial Intelligence AI researcher recognized applicability work mathematical logic argued AI researcher could create new ontology computational model enable certain kind automated reasoning
In AI community came use term ontology refer theory modeled world Physics component knowledge system
Some researcher drawing inspiration philosophical ontology viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy
In early effort create interoperability standard identified technology stack called ontology layer standard component knowledge system
A widely cited web page paper associated effort credited deliberate definition ontology technical term computer science
The paper defines ontology explicit specification conceptualization turn object concept entity presumed exist area interest relationship hold among
While term specification conceptualization caused much debate essential point definition ontology One objection definition overly broad allowing range specification simple glossary logical theory couched predicate calculus
But hold true data model complexity example relational database single table column still instance relational data model
Taking pragmatic view one say ontology tool product engineering thereby defined use
From perspective matter use ontology provide representational machinery instantiate domain model knowledge base make query service represent result calling service
For example API search service might offer textual glossary term formulate query would act
On hand Semantic Web standard suggests specific formalism encoding ontology OWL several variant vary expressive power
This reflects intent specification abstract data model domain conceptualization independent particular form
Ontology discussed applied context software database engineering yet theoretical grounding well
specifies vocabulary make assertion may input output knowledge agent software program
As ontology provides language communicating agent
An agent supporting interface required use term ontology knowledge
Nonetheless definition formal constraint ontology put restriction stated language
In essence committing ontology
supporting interface using ontology vocabulary requires statement asserted input output definition constraint ontology
This analogous requirement row database table insert statement SQL must consistent integrity constraint stated declaratively independently internal data format
Similarly ontology must formulated representation language intended semantic level specification independent data modeling strategy implementation
For instance conventional database model may represent identity individual using primary key assigns unique identifier individual
However primary key identifier artifact modeling process denote something domain
Ontologies typically formulated language closer expressive power logical formalism predicate calculus
This allows ontology designer able state semantic constraint without forcing particular encoding strategy
For example typical ontology formalism one would able say individual member class attribute value without referring implementation pattern use primary key identifier
Similarly ontology one might represent constraint hold across relation simple declaration A subclass B might encoded join foreign key relational model
concerned making representational choice capture relevant distinction domain highest level abstraction still clear possible meaning term
As form data modeling knowledge skill required
The heritage computational ontology philosophical ontology rich body theory make ontological distinction systematic coherent manner
For example many insight formal ontology motivated understanding real world applied building computational ontology world data
When ontology encoded standard formalism also possible reuse large previously designed ontology motivated systematic account human knowledge language
In context ontology embody result academic research offer operational method put theory practice database system
Ontologies part standard stack Semantic Web used specify standard conceptual vocabulary exchange data among system provide service answering query publish reusable knowledge base offer service facilitate interoperability across multiple heterogeneous system database
The key role ontology respect database system specify data modeling representation level abstraction specific database design logical physical data exported translated queried unified across independently developed system service
Successful application date include database interoperability cross database search integration web service

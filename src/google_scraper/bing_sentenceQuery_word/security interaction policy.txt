A defines goal element organization computer system
The definition highly formal informal
Security policy enforced organizational policy security mechanism
A technical implementation defines whether computer system
These formal policy categorized core security principle Confidentiality Integrity Availability
For example whereas
If system regarded set transition operation change system state seen statement partition state authorized unauthorized one
Given simple definition one define one start authorized state never enter unauthorized state
To represent concrete policy especially automated enforcement language representation needed
There exist lot application specific language closely coupled security mechanism enforce policy application
Compared abstract policy language

Computer Science All President bold new initiative empower American student kindergarten high school learn computer science equipped computational thinking skill need creator digital economy consumer active citizen world
Our economy rapidly shifting educator business leader increasingly recognizing computer science CS new basic skill necessary economic opportunity social mobility
CS All build effort already led parent teacher school district state private sector leader across country
Last year tech job across United States unfilled percent STEM job projected computer field
Computer science data science important tech sector many industry including transportation healthcare education financial service
Parents increasingly recognize need
However estimate one quarter school United States offer computer science programming coding state still allow count towards high school graduation even advanced economy making available student
Wide disparity exist even access course
In addition course access challenge medium portrayal classroom curriculum material unconscious bias stereotype exacerbate problem discourage many student taking course
For example
These statistic mirror current makeup America largest innovative tech firm woman compose le technical employee le percent
We better
Tech career exciting fun collaborative well critical economy
We want Americans opportunity part team
CS For All help make reality ensure every student access Computer Science classroom level
When come computer science student President Obama led way CS Student became first President write line code
His first line code moveForward CS All moving forward together
Who taught code
A student named Adrianna Newark New Jersey took computer science course school
If President start learning computer science
We know need basic tool make possible including teacher infrastructure
Thanks President well way making happen closing connectivity divide school half empowering million student broadband enlisting school district cause
And order make sure youth pathway workforce adult access skill President expanded city state rural area

She collaborator support National Science Foundation created Exploring Computer Science high school curriculum teacher professional development program committed reaching student especially underserved community school exists across nation including seven largest school district
retired computer science math teacher Houston Texas advocated Computer Science education since
She fought keep computer science certification teacher played integral part increasing programming computational thinking Texas math standard
She serf affiliate Code Buddy Spring Branch Independent School District
A growing list district leader committing support President vision expanded computer science curriculum student
Dozens private sector partner nonprofit organization well state local government stepped support CS All commitment
Today announcement build upon bipartisan progress state like Washington Arkansas
Both state announced ambitious computer science education effort passed legislation make computer science count towards high school graduation
Similarly city like New York Chicago San Francisco already announced major expansion computer science education
Local leader using computer science solve many intractable local challenge opportunity Check
Involving young people real problem help solve community best practice education exciting youth
typically significant computer science opportunity American youth pull partner solving challenge engaging future
Seattle leadership hosted involving community member across city
New Orleans engaging youth others open data initiative part work Police Data Initiative city
Denver library hosting camp
Let youth engagement part learning experience
Businesses philanthropy also played major role building movement expand CS nationally

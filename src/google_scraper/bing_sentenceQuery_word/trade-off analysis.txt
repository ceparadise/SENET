A situational decision involves diminishing losing one quality quantity property set design return gain aspect
In simple term tradeoff one thing increase another must decrease
Tradeoffs stem limitation many origin including simple physic instance certain volume object fit given space full container must remove item order accept vessel carry large item multiple small item
Tradeoffs also commonly refer different configuration single item tuning string guitar enable different note played well allocation time attention towards different task
The concept tradeoff implies tactical strategic choice made full comprehension advantage disadvantage setup
An economic example decision invest stock risky carry great potential return versus bond generally safer lower potential return
The term also used widely evolutionary context case process reference decisive factor
In concept tradeoff constraint often closely related
In commonly expressed term one potential choice loss best available alternative
An opportunity cost example individual would decision worker take time work salary attend medical school annual tuition
If assume sake simplicity medical school allows study individual considering stopping work would face going medical school earning work going medical school losing salary pay tuition
The concept often used describe situation everyday life
The old saying put egg one basket implies respect one buy composed many rather one stock may higher expected value return
Similarly trash can used inside taken street emptied Dumpster small large
A large trash need taken Dumpster often may become heavy full user risk strain back injury moving
The choice waste receptacle frequency needing take trash Dumpster versus ease safety use
In case food waste second present large trash can likely sit long time kitchen leading higher level decomposing food indoors potential pest attraction
With small trash taken Dumpster often thus eliminating persist rot attracts pest
Of course user large trashcan could carry outside frequently anyway heavier would weigh user would think take confine schedule compared smaller evidently full take taking
In cold climate finger compartment serve well keep hand warm arrangement also confines finger movement prevents full range hand function glove separate finger drawback keep finger warm mitten
As mitten glove warmth versus dexterity
In like fashion warm coat often bulky hence impede freedom movement wearer
Thin coat worn winter sport athlete give wearer freedom movement warm
When copying music computer format used routinely save space information thrown away detriment
scheme take much disc space affect sound quality much thus providing better sound
Large car carry many people five since larger crumple zone may safer accident
However also tend heavy often hence relatively poor
Small car like carry two people light weight mean fuel efficient
At time smaller size weight small car mean smaller crumple zone mean occupant le protected case accident
In addition small car accident larger heavier car occupant smaller car fare poorly
Thus car size large versus small involves multiple tradeoff regarding passenger capacity accident safety fuel economy
In athletics demand different physical attribute running
As two contest distinct event competition pursuit feature distinct team athlete
Whether professional runner better suited marathon running versus sprinting based runner morphology physiology variation type well runner individual interest preference factor
This tradeoff chiefly perspective sport recruiter decides role prospective athlete would best suit team
In expressed term particular choice loss preferred alternative given
A tradeoff involves sacrifice must made obtain certain product service experience rather others could made obtained using required resource
For example person going basketball game opportunity cost loss alternative watching particular television program home
If basketball game occurs working hour opportunity cost would several hour lost work would need take time work
Many factor affect tradeoff environment within particular country including availability raw material skilled labor force machinery producing product technology capital market rate produce product reasonable time scale forth
A economics often illustrated graphically named economist show greatest least amount one thing attained various given amount
As example production theory output one good output another illustrated graphically
The Pareto frontier also used
In includes show highest level expected return portfolio could given particular level risk measured portfolio return
In tradeoff occur beneficial change one trait linked detrimental change another trait
Tradeoffs important engineering
For example used trade desirable property improved gain bias point immunity reduction
In tradeoff example may include maturity parental care mate choice
For example higher fecundity number offspring lower parental care offspring receive
Parental care function fecundity would show negative sloped linear graph
A related phenomenon known demographic compensation arises different component specie survival growth fecundity etc show negative across
For example survival may higher towards northern edge distribution fecundity growth increase towards south leading compensation allows specie persist along environmental gradient
Contrasting trend life cycle component may arise tradeoff also independent opposite response environmental condition
In tradeoff viewed tool trade
A program often run faster us memory
Consider following example The Software Engineering Institute specific method analysing tradeoff called Architectural Tradeoff Analysis Method ATAM
Strategy often involve tradeoff example might trade pawn improved position
In scenario chess player might even tradeoff loss valuable piece even Queen protect King
In might trade
often involves competing interest must traded interest different people different principle
ethical use information resulting treat disease today
In patient physician often faced difficult decision involving tradeoff
One example localized patient need weigh possibility prolonged life expectancy possible stressful unpleasant treatment
Governmental tradeoff among controversial political social difficulty time
All politics viewed series tradeoff based upon core value core people politician
also involve tradeoff may energize alienate
With work schedule employee often use tradeoff work period compressed narrow group hour working day traditional working day allowing employee take every second Friday

Unfortunately I live ranking company really low application computer science le candid
Outside academia much going
Data science think would booming advent much computation technology however company hiring academia slide downhill student
I would try go school Silicon Valley get started possible
Still question

A case increased space usage decreased time
Here refers consumed performing given task etc refers time consumed performing given task time
The utility given tradeoff affected related speed storage space subject
Biological usage tradeoff seen earlier stage
Using stored knowledge encoding stimulus reaction instinct DNA avoids need calculation situation
More specific computer implemented since earliest operating system
In first proposed using tradeoff
The common situation algorithm involving implementation include entire table reduces computing time increase amount memory needed compute table entry needed increasing computing time reducing memory requirement
A tradeoff applied problem data storage
If data stored uncompressed take space access take le time data stored compressed since compressing data reduces amount space take take time run
Depending particular instance problem either way practical
There also rare instance possible directly work compressed data case compressed faster work compression without compression
Storing source rendering every time page requested would trading time space time used le space
Rendering image page changed storing rendered image would trading space time space used le time
This technique generally known
Larger code size traded higher program speed applying
This technique make code longer iteration loop save computation time required jumping back beginning loop end iteration
Algorithms also make use tradeoff include

Tools analysis useful study many problem theoretical computer science
Perhaps surprisingly many case discrete feature problem allow application sophisticated analytical tool
A seminal example phenomenon use inequality analysis Boolean function first demonstrated Kahn Kalai Linial
Results discrete analysis play important role hardness approximation computational learning computational social choice communication complexity

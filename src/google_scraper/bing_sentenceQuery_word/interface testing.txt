How Interface like IEnumerable IQuerable store data
example go
How I Interface like
I fill Int value
Please clarify specific problem add additional detail highlight exactly need
As currently written hard tell exactly asking
See page help clarifying question
The interface contain data
Although may see IEnumerable type using collection underlying object always specific type implementing interface
The object actually containing data may type implementing interface
Please refer And would like implement version IEnumerable inherit interface
Try searching A Beginners Tutorial Implementing IEnumerable codeproject An interface never store data
An implementation
Whenever code see object type actual dynamic type something else like
If want type implement
Usually embedded private class implement enumerator collection though
Interfaces define well interface
You see defining Contract explains work specific concept
Behind interface actual Implementation example Database Connection
In computer science interface point interaction software To make bit simple consider hardware world
USB defines interface thing specific shape go specific plug protocol talk USB device
An behind interface device
Fx
camera storage device
Well confusing question I try anyway
Interface describes public method property describe data stored
The implementer interface responsible store data structure suit need
You interface like either implemented defining another interface use

In language term often used define contains data code defines behavior signature
A code data method corresponding interface said interface
Furthermore class implement multiple interface hence different type time
An interface thus definition anywhere object exchanged example call object exchanged defined term interface rather specifying particular
This approach mean class implement interface used
For example may used allow development progress final implementation available
In another case implementation may substituted testing
Such implementation replaced real code later development process
Usually method defined interface contains code thus called must implemented code run invoked

In process product ensure meet specification
This normally done use variety
To generate set attempt cover functionality system fully exercise
The difficulty accomplishing task twofold deal domain size sequence
In addition tester face difficulty
Unlike command line interface system GUI many operation need tested
A relatively small program possible GUI operation
In large program number operation easily larger
The second problem sequencing problem
Some functionality system may accomplished sequence GUI event
For example open file user may first click File Menu select Open operation use dialog box specify file name focus application newly opened window
Increasing number possible operation increase sequencing problem exponentially
This become serious issue tester creating test case manually
becomes problem GUIs well
A GUI may change significantly even though underlying application
A test designed follow certain path GUI may fail since button menu item dialog may changed location appearance
These issue driven GUI testing problem domain towards automation
Many different technique proposed automatically generate complete simulate user behavior
Most testing technique attempt build previously used test CLI Command Line Interface program scaling problem applied GUI
For example modeling system modeled finite state machine program used generate test case exercise state work well system limited number state may become overly complex unwieldy GUI see also
A novel approach test suite generation adapted CLI technique involves using planning system
Planning technique AI domain attempt solve problem involve four parameter Planning system determine path initial state goal state using operator
As simple example planning problem given two word single operation replaces single letter word another goal might change one word another
In author used planner IPP demonstrate technique
The system UI first analyzed determine possible operation
These become operator used planning problem
Next initial system state determined goal state specified tester feel would allow exercising system
The planning system determines path initial state goal state becomes test plan
Using planner generate test case specific advantage manual generation
A planning system nature generates solution planning problem way beneficial tester When manually creating test suite tester focused test function specific path GUI
By using planning system path taken care tester focus function test
An additional benefit planning system restricted way generating path may often find path never anticipated tester
This problem important one combat
Another method generating GUI test case simulates novice user
An expert user system tends follow direct predictable path GUI whereas novice user would follow random path
A novice user likely explore possible state GUI expert
The difficulty lie generating test suite simulate novice system usage
Using proposed solve problem
Novice path system random path
First novice user learn time generally make mistake repeatedly secondly novice user following plan probably domain system knowledge
Genetic algorithm work follows set gene created randomly subjected task
The gene complete task best kept one discarded
The process repeated surviving gene replicated rest set filled random gene
Eventually one gene small set gene threshold set gene set naturally best fit given problem
In case GUI testing method work follows
Each gene essentially list random integer value fixed length
Each gene represents path GUI
For example given tree widget first value gene value called allele would select widget operate following allele would fill input widget depending number possible input widget example pull list box would one selected list value
The success gene scored criterion reward best novice behavior
A system testing X window system extensible windowing system described
The system provides functionality via editor protocol dynamically send GUI input get GUI output program without directly using GUI
For example one call XSendEvent simulate click menu forth
This system allows researcher automate gene creation testing given application test set novice user test case created
At first strategy migrated adapted CLI testing strategy
A popular method used CLI environment
Capture playback system system screen captured bitmapped graphic various time system testing
This capturing allowed tester play back testing process compare screen output phase test expected screen
This validation could automated since screen would identical case passed different case failed
Using worked quite well CLI world significant problem one try implement system
The obvious problem one find screen GUI system may look different state underlying system making automated validation extremely difficult
This GUI allows graphical object vary appearance placement screen
Fonts may different window color size may vary system output basically
This would obvious user obvious automated validation system
To combat problem tester gone hood collected GUI interaction data underlying windowing system
By capturing window event log interaction system format decoupled appearance GUI
Now event stream captured
There filtering event stream necessary since stream event usually detailed event directly relevant problem
This approach made easier using architecture example making view GUI simple possible model controller hold logic
Another approach use software use make also possible better separate user interface rest application
Another way run test GUI build driver GUI command event sent software another program
This method directly sending event receiving event system highly desirable testing since input output testing fully automated user error eliminated

Latency delay input system desired outcome term understood slightly differently various context latency issue also vary one system another
Latency greatly affect usable enjoyable electronic mechanical device well communication
Latency communication demonstrated live transmission various point earth communication ground transmitter satellite satellite receiver take time
People connecting distance live event seen wait response
This latency wait time introduced signal travelling geographical distance well various piece communication equipment
Even limited speed light refractive index cable repeater amplifier along length introduce delay
expression much time take data get one designated point another
In environment example AT T latency measured sending returned sender time considered latency
Ideally latency close zero possible
The contributor network latency include special case network latency Internet large network
The factor determine latency Internet
However distance transmission medium number hop equipment server greater smaller network
Internet latency measurement would generally start exit network end return requested data Internet resource
length time take computer act signal telling stop decide response event
important factor determining Internet latency
A WAN busy directing traffic produce delay whether resource requested server another computer network elsewhere Internet
LAN user also experience delay WAN busy
In either example delay would still exist even rest hop including server desired data located entirely free traffic congestion
delay sound created heard
In sound created physical world delay determined varies slightly depending medium travel
Sound travel faster denser medium It travel faster solid le quickly liquid slowest air
We generally refer speed sound measured dry air room temperature
In electronics audio latency cumulative delay audio input audio output
How long delay depends hardware even software used operating system driver used computer audio
Latencies generally noticed individual separate production arrival sound ear
See video demonstration measure audio latency iOS device defined sum time operation performed linear
In parallel workflow latency determined slowest operation performed single task worker
delay input mechanical system device desired output
This delay determined Newtonian limit mechanism excepting mechanic
An example would delay time shift gear time shift lever gear box bicycle shifter actuated
combined delay input command desired output
In computer system latency often used mean delay waiting increase real perceived beyond desired
Specific contributor computer latency include mismatch data speed microprocessor device inadequate data performance hardware involved well driver
The processing load computer also add significant latency
From user perspective latency issue usually perceived lag action response
In simulation example using helmet provides stereoscopic vision head tracking latency time computer detection head motion time display motion image
In multiplayer networked Internet gaming low latency critical best gameplay enjoyability
Control difficult significant latency player lagging behind event game due delay information getting computer
Latency issue noticeable individual generally increasing user annoyance impacting level increase
The severity effect varies one application another mitigating tactic
However game often enjoyable around latency
In communication delay result heavy traffic hardware problem incorrect set configuration
Latency testing vary application application
In application measuring latency requires special complex equipment knowledge special computer command program case latency measured stop watch
In networking estimated latency equipment server determined running ping command information latency hop gathered trace route command
camera might used capture minute difference response time input various mechanical electronic system
Reducing latency function tuning tweaking upgrading computer hardware software mechanical system
Within computer latency removed hidden technique prefetching anticipating need data input request using parallelism across multiple execution thread
Other step reduce latency increase performance include uninstalling unnecessary program optimizing networking software configuration upgrading hardware

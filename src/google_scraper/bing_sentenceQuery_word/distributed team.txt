field study distributed system
A model component located communicate coordinate action
The component interact order achieve common goal
Three significant characteristic distributed system concurrency component independent failure component
Examples distributed system vary
A run distributed system called distributed programming process writing program
There many alternative message passing mechanism including pure HTTP connector
A goal challenge pursued computer scientist practitioner distributed system however goal fallen favour industry distributed system different conventional system difference partial system failure partial upgrade simply papered attempt transparency see
also refers use distributed system solve computational problem
In problem divided many task solved one computer communicate message passing
The word term distributed system distributed programming originally referred computer network individual computer physically distributed within geographical area
The term nowadays used much wider sense even referring autonomous run physical computer interact message passing
While single definition distributed system following defining property commonly used A distributed system may common goal solving large computational problem user perceives collection autonomous processor unit
Alternatively computer may user individual need purpose distributed system coordinate use shared resource provide communication service user
Other typical property distributed system include following Distributed system group networked computer goal work
The term distributed computing lot overlap clear distinction exists
The system may characterized parallel distributed processor typical distributed system run concurrently parallel
Parallel computing may seen particular tightly coupled form distributed computing distributed computing may seen loosely coupled form parallel computing
Nevertheless possible roughly classify concurrent system parallel distributed using following criterion The figure right illustrates difference distributed parallel system
Figure schematic view typical distributed system system represented network topology node computer line connecting node communication link
Figure b show distributed system detail computer local memory information exchanged passing message one node another using available communication link
Figure c show parallel system processor direct access shared memory
The situation complicated traditional us term parallel distributed quite match definition parallel distributed see detailed discussion
Nevertheless rule thumb parallel computation multiprocessor us parallel algorithm coordination distributed system us distributed algorithm
The use concurrent process communicate root architecture studied
The first widespread distributed system invented
predecessor introduced late ARPANET invented early
became successful application ARPANET probably earliest example
In addition ARPANET successor Internet early worldwide computer network included used support distributed discussion system
The study distributed computing became branch computer science late early
The first conference field PODC date back European counterpart DISC first held
Various hardware software architecture used distributed computing
At lower level necessary interconnect multiple CPUs sort network regardless whether network printed onto circuit board made loosely coupled device cable
At higher level necessary interconnect running CPUs sort
Distributed programming typically fall one several basic architecture category
Another basic aspect distributed computing architecture method communicating coordinating work among concurrent process
Through various message passing protocol process may communicate directly one another typically relationship
Alternatively enable distributed computing done without form direct utilizing shared
Reasons using distributed system distributed computing may include Examples distributed system application distributed computing include following Many task would like automate using computer type would like ask question computer produce answer
In task called
Formally computational problem consists together instance
Instances question ask solution desired answer question
Theoretical computer science seek understand computational problem solved using computer efficiently
Traditionally said problem solved using computer design produce correct solution given instance
Such algorithm implemented run computer program read problem instance performs computation produce solution
Formalisms used abstract model sequential computer executing algorithm
The field concurrent distributed computing study similar question case either multiple computer computer executes network interacting process computational problem solved network efficiently
However obvious meant solving problem case concurrent distributed system example task algorithm designer concurrent distributed equivalent sequential computer
The discussion focus case multiple computer although many issue concurrent process running single computer
Three viewpoint commonly used In case distributed algorithm computational problem typically related graph
Often graph describes structure computer network problem instance
This illustrated following example
Consider computational problem finding coloring given graph
Different field might take following approach While field parallel algorithm different focus field distributed algorithm lot interaction two field
For example graph coloring originally presented parallel algorithm technique also used directly distributed algorithm
Moreover parallel algorithm implemented either parallel system using shared memory distributed system using message passing
The traditional boundary parallel distributed algorithm choose suitable network run given network lie place boundary parallel distributed system shared memory message passing
In parallel algorithm yet another resource addition time space number computer
Indeed often running time number computer problem solved faster computer running parallel see
If decision problem solved using polynomial number processor problem said class
The class NC defined equally well using PRAM formalism Boolean machine simulate Boolean circuit efficiently vice versa
In analysis distributed algorithm attention usually paid communication operation computational step
Perhaps simplest model distributed computing synchronous system node operate lockstep fashion
During node parallel receive latest message neighbour perform arbitrary local computation send new message neighbor
In system central complexity measure number synchronous communication round required complete task
This complexity measure closely related network
Let diameter network
On one hand computable problem solved trivially synchronous distributed system approximately communication round simply gather information one location round solve problem inform node solution round
On hand running time algorithm much smaller communication round node network must produce output without possibility obtain information distant part network
In word node must make globally consistent decision based information available
Many distributed algorithm known running time much smaller round understanding problem solved algorithm one central research question field
Other commonly used measure total number bit transmitted network cf

Traditional computational problem take perspective ask question computer distributed system process question produce answer stop
However also problem want system ever stop
Examples problem include similar problem
In problem distributed system supposed continuously coordinate use shared resource conflict occur
There also fundamental challenge unique distributed computing
The first example challenge related
Examples related problem include
A lot research also focused understanding nature distributed system process designating single organizer task distributed among several computer node
Before task begun network node either unaware node serve coordinator leader task unable communicate current coordinator
After coordinator election algorithm run however node throughout network recognizes particular unique node task coordinator
The network node communicate among order decide get coordinator state
For need method order break symmetry among
For example node unique comparable identity node compare identity decide node highest identity coordinator
The definition problem often attributed LeLann formalized method create new token token token lost
Coordinator election algorithm designed economical term total transmitted time
The algorithm suggested Gallager Humblet Spira general undirected graph strong impact design distributed algorithm general influential paper distributed computing
Many algorithm suggested different kind network undirected ring unidirectional ring complete graph grid directed Euler graph others
A general method decouples issue graph family design coordinator election algorithm suggested Korach Kutten Moran
In order perform coordination distributed system employ concept coordinator
The coordinator election problem choose process among group process different processor distributed system act central coordinator
Several central coordinator election algorithm exist
So far focus distributed system solves given problem
A complementary research problem property given distributed system
The analogous example field centralised computation given computer program task decide whether halt run forever
The halting problem general case naturally understanding behaviour computer network least hard understanding behaviour one computer
However many interesting special case decidable
In particular possible reason behaviour network machine
One example telling whether given network interacting asynchronous machine reach deadlock
This problem decidable likely efficient centralised parallel distributed algorithm solves problem case large network

A reach beyond restriction traditional environment
A distributed workforce dispersed geographically wide area domestically internationally
By installing key technology distributed company enable employee located anywhere access company resource software application data without working within confines
This employee distributed remain primarily unconnected
A company distributed workforce connects employee using make easy team member across world work together
Using shared software approach called SaaS worker team share file securely well access company communication CRM video service management IT security analytics web content management calendar much
New technology changing important aspect live work way manage distance work management distance requires technical artifact
In fact technique organizational structure also required
In section take look way distributed work evolved past several century specifically cover last decade
Over century workplace became increasingly associated
In mid prominent business strategy based mechanistic view office worker unit production housed unified controlling space
Then office seen communication system floorplan opening facilitate free flow information
This office space designed intention fostering communication flexible teamwork within physical location
Then major workplace revolution computer moved computer room desktop
In second workplace revolution saw introduction new way working response realization information technology transforming cultural social technological construction process
At time digital tool reduced need synchronous office worker purpose carrying defined convergence communication computing technology allows individual organization connect way scale previously inconceivable
Today new economy characterized increasing virtualization product process organization relationship
The new economy production longer requires people work together physical space access tool resource need produce work allows distributed work
After reviewing chapter Trust Control Hudson Bay Company book Distributed Work distributed work studied throughout history simply since middle
Between management rely trust control successfully manage distributed work
During time addition dispersed operation relied heavily combination explicit information detailed record keeping tacit situated knowledge developed socialization participating life Bay
The Hudson Bay Company case distributed work showed variety control mechanism including selection technique information requirement direct local oversight distributed practice
For example elaboration reporting requirement period inland expansion used supplement current knowledge
A final aspect note HBC case senior management early learning strength weakness contract mean controlling distant agent
Early manager found common sense enough encourage everyone comply
Instead company manager created way encourage worker comply business norm
All HBC concludes trust control vital distributed group organization
HBC suggests process outcome geographically dispersed work shaped interaction number element complex dynamic emergent suggested contemporary literature
Thus important review distributed work prior public emergence century
There several key term associated collocated work distributed work
The important concept coupling work collaboration readiness technology readiness
This section briefly define four concept
refers knowledge participant common aware information common
Common ground established general knowledge person background also specific knowledge learned several different cue available moment including person appearance behavior conversational interaction
The figure show characteristic contribute achieving common ground inherent various communication medium
It important note remote complain difficulty establishing common ground
This individual connected audio conferencing difficult tell speaking know participant well
However people video engage subtle negotiation establishes local common whether said understood whether conversation proceed need repair
Overall common ground people establish easier greater
refers extent kind communication required work
Tightly coupled work work strongly depends talent collection worker nonroutine even ambiguous
Components type work highly interdependent meaning work requires frequent complex communication among group member short feedback loop multiple stream information
This type communication difficult remote location mostly technology support rapid back forth conversation awareness repair ambiguity
On hand loosely coupled work fewer dependency routine
It important group member establish common ground task goal procedure working type work overall requires le frequent le complicated interaction
group willingness work together share idea
Using shared technology assumes coworkers need share information rewarded sharing
It important note one attempt introduce groupware remote technology organization community culture sharing collaboration
Common ground often used collaboration team solve complex problem
In order solve complex problem different skill perspective member team must pooled together
To team must make sure common ground term knowledge representation problem
Care must taken note achieve common ground collaborating difference constructively managed rather downplayed
This collaboration differs compromise
company group willingness ability use technology
Companies require technical infrastructure going adopt technology company
In particular require habit including preparation regular access attention given others need information order effectively use necessary technology distributed work
Researchers repeatedly see failure distributed work often result attempt introduce new technology organization community yet comfortable technology already place
The following chart explains order various collaboration technology adopted organization allow employee become familiar learn new technology
The list show observed order various collaboration technology adopted used different organization
As chart show advanced technology introduced small step
These key concept important help differentiate collocated distributed work
Later fifth concept organizational management management practice management activity part shaping fundamental premise collaboration without proximity There two type work explain geographical distance
case team member location
term used explain team member physical location working project
There many difference similarity benefit obstacle two type work
In order distinguish collocated distributed work necessary go detail
Collocated work case team member physical location
This may temporary due travel common location permanent collaborator group common work site
Same location mean coworkers get workspace short walk communicate via interaction
Also meeting small group meeting major advantage collocated work individual able move one meeting another simply overhearing conversation seeing someone working aware long worked without progress
In addition meeting coworkers observe someone reaction able see gesture glance
This allows one make sure group prior moving
Also coworkers access common space group interaction mutual access significant shared information
In study researcher observed individual describe something drawing hand air
Later someone referred idea pointing spot air first person drawn idea
Opposite collocated work distributed work case team member physically location
Thus forced use different method technology communicate make progress working
Today technology distributed work group use communicate constantly changing rapid change different group varying access technology
describe option communication today include Distributed work successful company group display technology readiness
Some benefit distributed work include Distributed work far perfect many failure include Overall people little common ground benefit significantly video channel
Effective group communication involves various characteristic
Because distance limit interpersonal interaction member distributed group characteristic often become constrained
Communication medium focus alternative way achieve quality promote effective
This section address communication technology relation theory grounding mutual knowledge discus cost benefit various communication technology tool
process updating evolving common ground shared information participant
The base mutual knowledge important effective coordination communication
Additionally participant constantly gather various form verbal nonverbal evidence establish understanding change task
The following mean grounding collecting evidence Different form result varied presence communication characteristic
Therefore nature communication technology either promote inhibit grounding participant
The absence grounding information result reduced ability read understand social cue
This increase social distance
The lack one characteristic generally force participant use alternative grounding technique cost associated grounding change
There often one cost increase another decrease
There also often correlation cost
The following table highlight several cost change medium communication change
Structured Management Hinds Kiesler It argued work adapted individual situation task decomposition version control
This applied distributed group allowing group divide work manageable chunk
Group member work autonomously come together produce finished product
Many recent software development built specifically address method
Email Email prevents communication verbal inference sarcasm humor additionally leaf email writer unaware communication lacking
When people try anticipate perspective email audience study suggest end pulling upon experience perspective instead
This often lead inconsistency email conversation chaotic communication
A team made variety professional different company collaborated different geographic location create optimized rocket engine
They encountered variety challenge used communication technology tool plan execute project
SLICE tasked designing rocket engine current cost increase speed market ten time increase rocket engine useful life three time
Additionally team eight presented design month work without committing working time project without collocated meeting without common professional ground
The manager three involved company began project spending year developing umbrella agreement Continuous Ordering Agreement explicitly defined contractual obligation allocation intellectual property allotment time team would work project
Determining policy risk management project responsibility funding company required significant level trust respect team
The Continuous Ordering Agreement strategically accomplished three fundamental element successful team
The team able candidly share information without worrying disclosing company intellectual property planning time idea project significantly reduced team protected management change within respective company
The team primarily used Internet Notebook Project Vault teleconference method collaborative technology
The Internet Notebook allowed team securely remotely access project work review idea simultaneously
The Project Vault common file storage information transfer tool used promote sharing information
Although team initially planned use written communication due overwhelming number idea amount data team began hold two teleconference week
The following table illustrates capability method In order maintain efficiency minimize confusion team decided address need knowledge management retracting prohibition conversation instead enforcing rule total information sharing
The issue became organization order idea simply solved
Another issue involvement interaction team member collocated team
Because team member also involved project respective company also altered protocol allow interruption multitasking meeting
This unintentionally resulted team performing analysis receiving feedback
The team found necessary change work structure order accommodate virtual collaboration limited prevent complication fulfillment basic creative need
The team specifically identified need consistent frequent communication team member rapid creation deletion information common ground task solution
SLICE consequently restructured work meet requirement enhance virtual collaboration experience member After month working project member time dedicated member working different geographic location team designed optimized rocket engine fewer part part instead normal decrease manufacturing cost million million quality performance industry
In future design improvement horsepower solve number current problem currently cause limitation distance technology
Greater solve disruptive influence today delay audio video transmission
This also allow larger smoother display remote worker making interaction similar flow interaction
In future possible technology provide capability way superior option
However likely problem result distributed work technology lack knowledge operate technology future interaction able eliminated completely

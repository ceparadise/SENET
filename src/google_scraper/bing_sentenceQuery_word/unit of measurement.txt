Philosophers written variety conceptual metaphysical semantic epistemological issue related measurement
This entry survey central philosophical standpoint nature measurement notion measurable quantity related epistemological issue
It refrain elaborating many problem associated measurement focus issue general character
Modern philosophical discussion late nineteenth century present divided several strand scholarship
These strand reflect different perspective nature measurement condition make measurement possible reliable
The main strand mathematical theory measurement operationalism conventionalism realism account account
These strand scholarship part constitute directly competing view
Instead best understood highlighting different complementary aspect measurement
The following rough overview perspective These perspective principle consistent
While mathematical theory measurement deal mathematical foundation measurement scale operationalism conventionalism primarily concerned semantics quantity term realism concerned metaphysical status measurable quantity account concerned epistemological aspect measuring
Nonetheless subject domain neatly divided list suggests
Issues concerning metaphysics epistemology semantics mathematical foundation measurement interconnected often bear one another
Hence example operationalists conventionalists often adopted view proponent account argued prevailing empiricist interpretation mathematical theory measurement
These subtlety become clear following discussion
The list strand scholarship neither exclusive exhaustive
It reflects historical trajectory philosophical discussion thus far rather principled distinction among different level analysis measurement
Some philosophical work measurement belong one strand many work squarely fit either
This especially case since early measurement returned forefront philosophical discussion several decade relative neglect
This recent body scholarship sometimes called epistemology measurement includes rich array work yet classified distinct school thought
The last section entry dedicated surveying development
Although philosophy measurement formed distinct area inquiry second half nineteenth century fundamental concept measurement magnitude quantity discussed since antiquity
According Euclid line surface another latter whole multiple former Book V def

Two magnitude common measure whole multiple magnitude incommensurable otherwise Book X def

The discovery incommensurable magnitude allowed Euclid contemporary develop notion magnitude
Ratios either rational irrational therefore concept ratio general measure Michell
Aristotle distinguished quantity quality
Examples quantity number line surface body time place whereas example quality justice health hotness paleness
According Aristotle quantity admit equality inequality degree one thing another ibid

Qualities conversely admit equality inequality admit degree one thing called pale le pale another ibid

Aristotle clearly specify whether degree quality paleness correspond distinct quality whether quality paleness capable different intensity
This topic center ongoing debate thirteenth fourteenth century Jung
Duns Scotus supported addition theory according change degree quality explained addition subtraction smaller degree quality
This theory later refined Nicole Oresme used geometrical figure represent change intensity quality velocity Clagett Sylla
Oresme geometrical representation established subset quality amenable quantitative treatment thereby challenging strict Aristotelian dichotomy quantity quality
These development made possible formulation quantitative law motion sixteenth seventeenth century Grant
The concept qualitative intensity developed Leibniz Kant
Leibniz principle continuity stated natural change produced degree
Leibniz argued principle applies change extended magnitude length duration also intensity representational state consciousness sound Jorgensen Diehl
Kant thought relied Leibniz principle continuity formulate distinction extensive intensive magnitude
According Kant extensive magnitude representation part make possible representation whole
An example length line mentally represented successive synthesis part line join form whole
For Kant possibility synthesis grounded form intuition namely space time
Intensive magnitude like warmth color also come continuous degree apprehension take place instant rather successive synthesis part
The degree intensive magnitude represented approximation negation A imagining gradual diminution complete absence
Scientific development nineteenth century challenged distinction extensive intensive magnitude
Thermodynamics wave optic showed difference temperature hue corresponded difference magnitude velocity wavelength
Electrical magnitude resistance conductance shown capable addition division despite extensive Kantian sense synthesized spatial temporal part
Moreover early experiment psychophysics suggested intensity sensation brightness loudness could represented sum noticeable difference among stimulus could therefore thought composed part see
These finding along advance axiomatization branch mathematics motivated leading scientist late nineteenth century attempt clarify mathematical foundation measurement Maxwell von Kries Helmholtz Mach Poincaré Hölder historical survey see Darrigol Michell Cantù Schlaudt
These work viewed today precursor body scholarship known measurement theory
Mathematical theory measurement often referred collectively measurement theory concern condition relation among number mathematical entity used express relation among object
In order appreciate need mathematical theory measurement consider fact relation exhibited equality sum difference always correspond relation among object measured number
For example twice one would mistaken thinking object measured degree Celsius twice hot object degree Celsius
This zero point Celsius scale arbitrary correspond absence temperature
Similarly numerical interval always carry empirical information
When subject asked rank scale strongly agree given statement reason think interval correspond equal increment strength opinion
To provide third example equality among number transitive empirical comparison among physical magnitude reveal approximate equality transitive relation
These example suggest mathematical relation among number used measurement empirically significant different kind measurement scale convey different kind empirically significant information
The study measurement scale empirical information convey main concern mathematical theory measurement
In seminal essay Counting Measuring Hermann von Helmholtz phrased key question measurement theory follows W hat objective meaning expressing denominate number relation real object magnitude condition
Broadly speaking measurement theory set identify assumption underlying use various mathematical structure describing aspect empirical world ii draw lesson adequacy limit using mathematical structure describing aspect empirical world
Following Otto Hölder measurement theorist often tackle goal formal proof assumption serving axiom lesson ii following theorem
A key insight measurement theory empirically significant aspect given mathematical structure among object measured
For example relation bigger among number empirically significant measuring length insofar mirror relation longer among object
This mirroring mapping relation object mathematical entity constitutes measurement scale
As clarified measurement scale usually thought isomorphism homomorphism object mathematical entity
Other broad goal claim measurement theory highly heterogeneous body scholarship
It includes work span late nineteenth century present day endorse wide array view ontology epistemology semantics measurement
Two main difference among mathematical theory measurement especially worth mentioning
The first concern nature object whose relation number supposed mirror
These may understood least four different way concrete individual object qualitative observation concrete individual object abstract representation individual object universal property object
Which interpretation adopted depends large part author metaphysical epistemic commitment
This issue especially relevant discussion realist account measurement
Second different measurement theorist taken different stand kind empirical evidence required establish mapping object number
As result measurement theorist come disagree necessary condition establishing measurability attribute specifically whether psychological attribute measurable
Debates measurability highly fruitful development measurement theory following subsection introduce debate central concept developed therein
During late nineteenth early twentieth century several attempt made provide universal definition measurement
Although account measurement varied consensus measurement method
For example Helmholtz defined measurement procedure one find denominate number express value magnitude denominate number number together unit meter magnitude quality object amenable ordering smaller greater length
Bertrand Russell similarly stated measurement method unique reciprocal correspondence established magnitude kind number integral rational real
Norman Campbell defined measurement simply process assigning number represent quality quality property admits ordering
Defining measurement numerical assignment raise question assignment adequate condition
Early measurement theorist like Helmholtz Hölder Campbell argued number adequate expressing magnitude insofar algebraic operation among number mirror empirical relation among magnitude
For example qualitative relation longer among rigid rod roughly transitive asymmetrical regard share structural feature relation larger among number
Moreover concatenation rigid rod share structural associativity mathematical operation addition
A similar situation hold measurement weight balance
Here deflection arm provides ordering among weight heaping weight one pan constitutes concatenation
Early measurement theorist formulated axiom describe qualitative empirical structure used axiom prove theorem adequacy assigning number magnitude exhibit structure
Specifically proved ordering concatenation together sufficient construction numerical representation relevant magnitude
An additive representation one addition empirically meaningful hence also multiplication division etc
Campbell called measurement procedure satisfy condition additivity fundamental involve measurement magnitude
Kinds magnitude fundamental measurement procedure length area volume duration weight electrical called fundamental magnitude
A hallmark magnitude possible generate concatenating standard sequence equal unit example series equally spaced mark ruler
Although viewed additivity hallmark measurement early measurement theorist acknowledged additivity necessary measuring
Other magnitude exist admit ordering smaller greater whose ratio difference currently determined except relation fundamentally measurable magnitude
Examples temperature may measured determining volume mercury column density may measured ratio mass volume
Such indirect determination came called derived measurement relevant magnitude derived magnitude Campbell
At first glance distinction fundamental derived measurement may seem reminiscent distinction extensive intensive magnitude indeed fundamental measurement sometimes called extensive
Nonetheless important note two distinction based significantly different criterion measurability
As discussed distinction focused intrinsic structure quantity question whether composed part
The distinction contrast focus property measurement
A fundamentally measurable magnitude one fundamental measurement operation found
Consequently fundamentality intrinsic property magnitude derived magnitude become fundamental discovery new operation measurement
Moreover fundamental measurement numerical assignment need mirror structure part
Electrical resistance example fundamentally measured connecting resistor series Campbell
This considered fundamental measurement operation shared structure numerical addition even though object equal resistance generally equal size
The distinction fundamental derived measurement revised subsequent author
Brian Ellis Ch
distinguished among three type measurement fundamental associative derived
Fundamental measurement requires ordering concatenation operation satisfying condition specified Campbell
Associative measurement procedure based correlation two ordering relationship correlation volume mercury column temperature
Derived measurement procedure consist determination value constant physical law
The constant may local determination specific density water mass volume universal determination Newtonian gravitational constant force mass distance
Henry Kyburg Ch
proposed somewhat different threefold distinction among direct indirect systematic measurement completely overlap Ellis
A radical revision distinction fundamental derived measurement offered Duncan Luce John Tukey work conjoint measurement discussed
The previous subsection discussed axiomatization empirical structure line inquiry date back early day measurement theory
A complementary line inquiry within measurement theory concern classification measurement scale
The psychophysicist Stevens distinguished among four type scale nominal ordinal interval ratio
Nominal scale represent object belonging class particular order male female
Ordinal scale represent order algebraic structure
For example Mohs scale mineral hardness represents mineral number ranging softest hardest empirical significance equality among interval ratio number
Celsius Fahrenheit example interval scale represent equality inequality among interval temperature ratio temperature zero point arbitrary
The Kelvin scale contrast ratio scale familiar scale representing mass kilogram length meter duration second
Stevens later refined classification distinguished linear logarithmic interval scale ratio scale without natural unit
Ratio scale natural unit used counting discrete object representing probability named absolute scale
As Stevens note scale type individuated family transformation undergo without loss empirical information
Empirical relation represented ratio scale example invariant multiplication positive number multiplication convert inch centimeter
Linear interval scale allow multiplication positive number constant shift conversion Celsius Fahrenheit accordance formula
Ordinal scale admit transformation function long monotonic increasing nominal scale admit substitution
Absolute scale admit transformation identity
Stevens classification scale later generalized Louis Narens Ch
Luce et al
Ch
term homogeneity uniqueness relevant transformation group
While Stevens classification scale met general approval scientific philosophical circle wider implication measurement theory became topic considerable debate
Two issue especially contested
The first whether classification ordering operation deserve called measurement operation accordingly whether representation magnitude nominal ordinal scale count measurement
Several physicist including Campbell argued classification ordering operation provide sufficiently rich structure warrant use number hence count measurement operation
The second contested issue whether concatenation operation found magnitude could fundamentally measured ratio scale
The debate became especially heated longer controversy surrounding measurability intensity sensation
It debate turn
One main catalyst development mathematical theory measurement ongoing debate surrounding measurability psychology
The debate often traced back Gustav Fechner described method measuring intensity sensation
Fechner method based recording noticeable difference sensation associated pair stimulus two sound different intensity
These difference assumed equal increment intensity sensation
As Fechner showed assumption stable linear relationship revealed intensity sensation logarithm intensity stimulus relation came known Fechner law Heidelberger Luce Suppes
This law turn provides method indirectly measuring intensity sensation measuring intensity stimulus hence Fechner argued provides justification measuring intensity sensation real number
Fechner claim concerning measurability sensation became subject series debate lasted nearly century proved extremely fruitful philosophy measurement involving key figure Mach Helmholtz Campbell Stevens Heidelberger Ch
Michell Ch

Those objecting measurability sensation Campbell stressed necessity empirical concatenation operation fundamental measurement
Since intensity sensation concatenated manner afforded length weight could fundamental measurement sensation intensity
Moreover Campbell claimed none psychophysical regularity discovered thus far sufficiently universal count law sense required derived measurement Campbell Ferguson et al

All psychophysicist shown intensity sensation consistently ordered order yet warrant use numerical relation sum ratio express empirical result
The central opponent Campbell debate Stevens whose distinction type measurement scale discussed
Stevens defined measurement assignment numeral object event according rule claimed consistent assignment count measurement broad sense
In useful case scientific inquiry Stevens claimed measurement construed somewhat narrowly numerical assignment based result operation coupling temperature mercury volume matching sensation
Stevens argued view relation among number need mirror qualitative empirical structure claiming instead measurement scale regarded arbitrary formal schema adopted accordance usefulness describing empirical data
For example adopting ratio scale measuring sensation loudness volume density sound lead formulation simple linear relation among report experimental subject loudness volume density
Such assignment number sensation count measurement consistent based matching operation performed experimental subject capture regularity experimental result
According Stevens condition together sufficient justify use ratio scale measuring sensation despite fact sensation separated component part laid end end like measuring stick see also Hempel
In century two main line inquiry measurement theory one dedicated empirical condition quantification one concerning classification scale converged work Patrick Suppes Scott Suppes historical survey see Savage Ehrlich Diez b
Suppes work laid basis Representational Theory Measurement RTM remains influential mathematical theory measurement date Krantz et al
Suppes et al
Luce et al

RTM defines measurement construction mapping empirical relational structure numerical relational structure Krantz et al

An empirical relational structure consists set empirical object rigid rod along certain qualitative relation among ordering concatenation numerical relational structure consists set number real number specific mathematical relation among equal bigger addition
Simply put measurement scale empirical numerical relational structure measurement construction scale
RTM go great detail clarifying assumption underlying construction different type measurement scale
Each type scale associated set assumption qualitative relation obtaining among object represented type scale
From assumption axiom author RTM derive representational adequacy scale type well family permissible transformation making type scale unique
In way RTM provides conceptual link empirical basis measurement typology scale
On issue measurability Representational Theory take middle path liberal approach adopted Stevens strict emphasis concatenation operation espoused Campbell
Like Campbell RTM accepts rule quantification must grounded known empirical structure chosen arbitrarily fit data
However RTM reject idea additive scale adequate concatenation operation available Luce Suppes
Instead RTM argues existence fundamental measurement operation involve concatenation
The central example type operation known additive conjoint measurement Luce Tukey Krantz et al
Ch

Here measurement two different type attribute temperature pressure gas obtained observing joint effect volume gas
Luce Tukey showed establishing certain qualitative relation among volume variation temperature pressure one construct additive representation temperature pressure without invoking antecedent method measuring volume
This sort procedure generalizable suitably related triplet attribute loudness intensity frequency pure tone preference reward size delay receiving Luce Suppes
The discovery additive conjoint measurement led author RTM divide fundamental measurement two kind traditional measurement procedure based concatenation operation called extensive measurement conjoint nonextensive fundamental measurement
Under new conception fundamentality traditional physical attribute measured fundamentally well many psychological attribute Krantz et al

Above saw mathematical theory measurement primarily concerned mathematical property measurement scale condition application
A related distinct strand scholarship concern meaning use quantity term
Scientific theory model commonly expressed term quantitative relation among parameter bearing name length unemployment rate introversion
A realist one term would argue refers set property relation exist independently measured
An operationalist conventionalist would argue way apply concrete particular depends nontrivial choice made human specifically choice way relevant quantity measured
Note broad construal realism compatible operationalism conventionalism
That conceivable choice measurement method regulate use given choice term succeeds referring property relation
Nonetheless many operationalists conventionalists adopted stronger view according fact matter several nontrivially different operation correct applying given
These stronger variant inconsistent realism measurement
This section dedicated operationalism conventionalism next realism measurement
Operationalism operationism measurement view meaning determined set operation used measurement
The strongest expression operationalism appears early work Percy Bridgman argued mean concept nothing set operation concept synonymous corresponding set operation
Length example would defined result operation concatenating rigid rod
According extreme version operationalism different operation measure different quantity
Length measured using ruler timing electromagnetic pulse strictly speaking distinguished two distinct labeled respectively
This conclusion led Bridgman claim currently accepted quantity concept joint different operation overlap domain application
He warned dogmatic faith unity quantity concept across joint urging instead unity checked experiment whenever application extended new domain
Nevertheless Bridgman conceded long result different operation agree within experimental error pragmatically justified label corresponding quantity name
Operationalism became influential psychology behaviorist like Edwin Boring Skinner
Indeed Skinner maintained behaviorism nothing thoroughgoing operational analysis traditional mentalistic concept
Stevens Boring student key promoter operationalism psychology argued psychological concept empirical meaning stand definite concrete operation
The idea concept defined measurement operation consistent Stevens liberal view measurability discussed
As long assignment number object performed accordance concrete consistent rule Stevens maintained assignment empirical meaning need satisfy additional constraint
Nonetheless Stevens probably embrace view psychological attribute
Instead good reason think understood operationalism methodological attitude valuable extent allowed psychologist justify conclusion drew experiment Feest
For example Stevens treat operational definition amenable improvement light empirical discovery implying took psychological attribute exist independently definition Stevens
This suggests Stevens operationalism moderate variety found early writing Bridgman
Operationalism met initial enthusiasm logical positivist viewed akin verificationism
Nonetheless soon revealed attempt base theory meaning operationalist principle riddled problem
Among problem automatic reliability operationalism conferred measurement operation ambiguity surrounding notion operation overly restrictive operational criterion meaningfulness fact many useful theoretical concept lack clear operational definition Chang
In particular Carl Hempel criticized operationalists unable define dispositional term solubility water multiplying number scientific concept manner run need systematic simple theory
Accordingly writer semantics avoided espousing operational analysis
A widely advocated approach admitted conventional element use resisting attempt reduce meaning quantity term measurement operation
These account classified general heading conventionalism though differ particular aspect measurement deem conventional degree arbitrariness ascribe convention
An early precursor conventionalism Ernst Mach examined notion equality among temperature interval
Mach noted different type thermometric fluid expand different nonlinearly related rate heated raising question fluid expands uniformly temperature
According Mach fact matter fluid expands uniformly since notion equality among temperature interval determinate application prior conventional choice standard thermometric fluid
Mach coined term principle coordination sort conventionally chosen principle application quantity concept
The concept uniformity time space received similar treatment Henri Poincaré Part
Poincaré argued procedure used determine equality among duration stem scientist unconscious preference descriptive simplicity rather fact nature
Similarly scientist choice represent space either Euclidean geometry determined experience consideration convenience
Conventionalism respect measurement reached sophisticated expression logical positivism
Logical positivist like Hans Reichenbach Rudolf Carnap proposed coordinative definition correspondence rule semantic link theoretical observational term
These statement intended regulate use theoretical term connecting empirical procedure Reichenbach Carnap Ch

An example coordinative definition statement measuring rod retains length transported
According Reichenbach statement empirically verified universal experimentally undetectable force could exist equally distorts every object length transported
In accordance verificationism statement unverifiable neither true false
Instead Reichenbach took statement express arbitrary rule regulating use concept equality length namely determining whether particular instance length equal Reichenbach
At time coordinative definition seen replacement rather necessary addition familiar sort theoretical definition concept term concept
Under conventionalist viewpoint specification measurement operation exhaust meaning concept length thereby avoiding many problem associated operationalism
Realists measurement maintain measurement best understood empirical estimation objective property relation
A clarificatory remark order respect characterization measurement
First term objective meant exclude mental property relation object psychological measurement
Rather measurable property relation taken objective inasmuch independent belief convention human performing measurement method used measuring
For example realist would argue ratio length given solid rod standard meter objective value regardless whether measured
Second term estimation used realist highlight fact measurement result mere true value Trout
Third according realist measurement aimed obtaining knowledge property relation rather assigning value directly individual object
This significant observable object lever chemical solution human often instantiate measurable property relation directly observable amount mechanical work acidic intelligence
Knowledge claim property relation must presuppose background theory
By shifting emphasis object property relation realist highlight character measurement
Realism measurement confused realism entity electron
Nor realism measurement necessarily entail realism property temperature since one could principle accept reality relation ratio among quantity without embracing reality underlying property
Nonetheless philosopher defended realism measurement done arguing form realism property Byerly Lazara Swoyer Mundy Trout
These realist argue least measurable property exist independently belief convention human measure existence structure property provides best explanation key feature measurement including usefulness number expressing measurement result reliability measuring instrument
For example typical realist length measurement would argue empirical regularity displayed individual object length ordered concatenated best explained assuming length objective property extensive structure Swoyer
That relation among length longer sum exist independently whether object happen ordered concatenated human indeed independently whether object particular length happen exist
The existence extensive property structure mean length share much structure positive real number explains usefulness positive real representing length
Moreover measurable property analyzed dispositional term becomes easy explain measuring instrument reliable
For example one assumes certain amount electric current wire entail disposition deflect ammeter needle certain angle follows ammeter indication counterfactually depend amount electric current wire therefore ammeter reliable Trout
A different argument realism measurement due Joel Michell proposes realist theory number based Euclidean concept ratio
According Michell number ratio quantity therefore exist space time
Specifically number ratio pair infinite standard sequence sequence length normally denoted meter meter etc
sequence whole multiple length trying measure
Measurement discovery estimation ratio
An interesting consequence empirical realism number measurement representational activity rather activity approximating number Michell
Realist account measurement largely formulated opposition strong version operationalism conventionalism dominated philosophical discussion measurement
In addition drawback operationalism already discussed previous section realist point measurable quantity fails make sense scientific practice
If quantity real value independently one choice measurement procedure would difficult explain scientist mean measurement accuracy measurement error try increase accuracy diminish error
By contrast realist easily make sense notion accuracy error term distance real measured value Byerly Lazara Swoyer Trout
A closely related point fact newer measurement procedure tend improve accuracy older one
If choice measurement procedure merely conventional would difficult make sense progress
In addition realism provides intuitive explanation different measurement procedure often yield similar result namely sensitive fact Swoyer Trout
Finally realist note construction measurement apparatus analysis measurement result guided theoretical assumption concerning causal relationship among quantity
The ability causal assumption guide measurement suggests quantity ontologically prior procedure measure
While stance towards operationalism conventionalism largely critical realist charitable assessment mathematical theory measurement
Brent Mundy Chris Swoyer accept axiomatic treatment measurement scale object empiricist interpretation given axiom prominent measurement theorist like Campbell Ernest Nagel Cohen Nagel Ch

Rather interpreting axiom pertaining concrete object observable relation among object Mundy Swoyer reinterpret axiom pertaining universal magnitude universal property meter long rather concrete instantiation property
This construal preserve intuition statement like size twice size first foremost two derivatively object Mundy
Mundy Swoyer argue interpretation general logically entail consequence empiricist interpretation along additional claim universal magnitude
Moreover interpretation measurement theory becomes genuine scientific theory explanatory hypothesis testable prediction
Despite virtue realist interpretation largely ignored wider literature measurement theory
account measurement based analogy measuring system communication system
In simple communication system message input encoded signal transmitter end sent receiver end decoded back output
The accuracy transmission depends feature communication system well feature environment level background noise
Similarly measuring instrument thought information machine Finkelstein interact object given state input encode state internal signal convert signal reading output
The accuracy measurement similarly depends instrument well level noise environment
Conceived special sort information transmission measurement becomes analyzable term conceptual apparatus information theory Hartley Shannon Shannon Weaver
For example information reading conveys occurrence state object quantified p p namely function decrease uncertainty object state Finkelstein alternative formulation see Brillouin Ch
Kirpatovskii Mari
Ludwik Finkelstein Luca Mari suggested possibility synthesis information theory measurement theory
As argue theory centrally appeal idea mapping information theory concern mapping symbol input output message measurement theory concern mapping object number
If measurement taken analogous theory could provide formalization syntax measurement measurement theory could provide formalization semantics
Nonetheless Mari also warns analogy communication measurement system limited
Whereas sender message known arbitrary precision independently transmission state object known arbitrary precision independently measurement
account measurement originally developed metrologists little involvement philosopher
Metrology officially defined science measurement application JCGM field study concerned design maintenance improvement measuring instrument natural science engineering
Metrologists typically work standardization bureau specialized laboratory responsible calibration measurement equipment comparison standard evaluation measurement uncertainty among task
It recently philosopher begun engage rich conceptual issue underlying metrological practice particularly inference involved evaluating improving accuracy measurement standard Chang Boumans Chap
Frigerio et al
Tal Teller b Riordan
Further philosophical work required explore assumption consequence account measurement implication metrological practice connection account measurement
Independently development metrology Bas van Fraassen recently proposed conception measurement information play key role
He view measurement composed two level physical level measuring apparatus interacts object produce reading pointer position
On abstract level background theory represents object possible state parameter space
Measurement locates object abstract parameter space thereby reducing range possible state
This reduction possibility amount collection information measured object
Van Fraassen analysis measurement differs account developed metrology explicit appeal background theory fact invoke symbolic conception information developed Shannon Weaver
Since early new wave philosophical scholarship emerged emphasizes relationship measurement theoretical statistical modeling
According account measurement consists two level concrete process involving interaction object interest instrument environment ii theoretical statistical model process model denotes abstract local representation constructed simplifying assumption
The central goal measurement according view assign value one parameter interest model manner satisfies certain epistemic desideratum particular coherence consistency
A central motivation development account attempt clarify epistemological principle underlying aspect measurement practice
For example metrologists employ variety method calibration measuring instrument standardization tracing unit evaluation uncertainty discussion metrology see previous section
Traditional philosophical account mathematical theory measurement elaborate assumption inference pattern evidential ground success criterion associated method
As Frigerio et al
argue measurement theory clarifying aspect measurement abstract away process measurement focus solely mathematical property scale
By contrast account take scale construction merely one several task involved measurement alongside definition measured parameter instrument design calibration object sampling preparation error detection uncertainty evaluation among others
According account measurement involves interaction object interest system measurement instrument measurement system environment includes measuring subject
Other secondary interaction may also relevant determination measurement outcome interaction measuring instrument reference standard used calibration chain comparison trace reference standard back primary measurement standard Mari
Measurement proceeds representing interaction set parameter assigning value subset parameter known measurands based result interaction
When measured parameter numerical called quantity
Although measurands need quantity quantitative measurement scenario supposed follows
Two sort measurement output distinguished account JCGM Giordani Mari Tal As proponent account stress inference instrument indication measurement outcome nontrivial depend host theoretical statistical assumption object measured instrument environment calibration process
Measurement outcome often obtained statistical analysis multiple indication thereby involving assumption shape distribution indication randomness environmental effect Bogen Woodward
Measurement outcome also incorporate correction systematic effect correction based theoretical assumption concerning working instrument interaction object environment
For example length measurement need corrected change measuring rod length temperature correction derived theoretical equation thermal expansion
Systematic correction involve uncertainty example determination value constant uncertainty assessed secondary experiment involving theoretical statistical assumption
Moreover uncertainty associated measurement outcome depends method employed calibration instrument
Calibration involves additional assumption instrument calibrating apparatus quantity measured property measurement standard Rothbart Slayden Franklin Baird Ch
Soler et al

Another component uncertainty originates vagueness definition measurand known definitional uncertainty Mari Giordani
Finally measurement involves background assumption scale type unit system used assumption often tied broader theoretical technological consideration relating definition realization scale unit
These various theoretical statistical assumption form basis construction one model measurement process
Unlike mathematical theory measurement term model denotes structure interprets formal language term model denotes abstract local representation target system constructed simplifying assumption
The relevant target system case measurement process system composed measuring instrument object event measured environment including human operator secondary instrument reference standard component various interaction
Measurement viewed set procedure whose aim coherently assign value model parameter based instrument indication
Models therefore seen necessary precondition possibility inferring measurement outcome instrument indication crucial determining content measurement outcome
As proponent account emphasize indication produced measurement process may used establish different measurement outcome depending measurement process modeled depending environmental influence taken account statistical assumption used analyze noise approximation used applying background theory
As Luca Mari put measurement result report information meaningful context metrological model model required include specification entity explicitly implicitly appear expression measurement result
Similarly model said provide necessary context evaluating various aspect goodness measurement outcome including accuracy precision error uncertainty Boumans Mari
account diverge empiricist interpretation measurement theory require relation among measurement outcome isomorphic homomorphic observable relation among item measured Mari
Indeed according account relation among measured object need observable prior measurement Frigerio et al

Instead key normative requirement account value assigned model parameter coherent manner
The coherence criterion may viewed conjunction two coherence model assumption relevant background theory substantive presupposition quantity measured ii objectivity mutual consistency measurement outcome across different measuring instrument environment model Frigerio et al
Teller Tal
The first meant ensure quantity measured second meant ensure measurement outcome reasonably attributed measured rather artifact measuring instrument environment model
Taken together two requirement ensure measurement outcome remain valid independently specific assumption involved production hence measurement outcome threaten general applicability
Besides applicability physical measurement analysis also shed light measurement economics
Like physical quantity value economic variable often observed directly must inferred observation based abstract idealized model
The nineteenth century economist William Jevons example measured change value gold postulating certain causal relationship value gold supply gold general level price Hoover Dowell Morgan
As Julian Reiss show Jevons measurement made possible using two model model economy based assumption quantity gold capacity raise lower price statistical model data based assumption local variation price mutually independent therefore cancel averaged
Taken together model allowed Jevons infer change value gold data concerning historical price various good
The way model function economic measurement led philosopher view certain economic model measuring instrument right analogously ruler balance Boumans Morgan
Marcel Boumans explains macroeconomist able isolate variable interest external influence tuning parameter model macroeconomic system
This technique free economist impossible task controlling actual system
As Boumans argues macroeconomic model function measuring instrument insofar produce invariant relation input indication output outcome insofar invariance tested calibration known stable fact
Another area model play central role measurement psychology
The measurement psychological attribute intelligence anxiety depression rely homomorphic mapping sort espoused Representational Theory Measurement Wilson
Instead psychometric theory relies predominantly development abstract model meant predict subject performance certain task
These model constructed substantive statistical assumption psychological attribute measured relation measurement task
For example Item Response Theory popular approach psychological measurement employ variety model evaluate validity questionnaire
Consider questionnaire meant ass English language comprehension ability presenting subject series question item
One simplest model used validate questionnaire Rasch model Rasch
This model supposes straightforward algebraic log odds probability subject answer given item correctly difficulty particular item subject ability
New questionnaire calibrated testing fit indication prediction Rasch model assigning difficulty level item accordingly
The model used conjunction questionnaire infer level English language comprehension outcome raw questionnaire score indication Wilson Mari Wilson
The sort statistical calibration scaling provided Rasch model yield repeatable result often first step towards psychological measurement
Psychologists typically interested result measure sake sake assessing underlying latent psychological attribute
It therefore desirable able test whether different measure different questionnaire multiple controlled experiment measure latent attribute
Such testing known construct validation
A construct abstract representation latent attribute intended measured reflects hypothesis variety behavior correlate one another study individual difference similarly affected experimental manipulation
Nunnally Bernstein Constructs denoted variable model predicts correlation would observed among indication different measure indeed measure attribute
Such model involve substantive assumption attribute including internal structure relation attribute statistical assumption correlation among different measure Campbell Fiske Nunnally Bernstein Ch
Angner
Several scholar pointed similarity way model used standardize measurable quantity natural social science
For example Mark Wilson argues psychometric model viewed tool constructing measurement standard sense measurement standard used metrologists
Others raised doubt feasibility desirability adopting example natural science standardizing construct social science
As Anna Alexandrova point ethical consideration bear question construct validity le consideration reproducibility
Such ethical consideration context sensitive applied piecemeal
Nancy Cartwright Rosa Runhardt make similar point Ballung concept term borrow Otto Neurath denote concept fuzzy scope
Examples Ballung concept race poverty social exclusion quality PhD program
Such concept multifaceted measured single metric without loss meaning must represented either matrix index several different measure depending goal value play see also Cartwright Bradburn
In similar vein Leah McClimans argues uniformity always appropriate goal designing questionnaire question often unavoidable desirable obtaining relevant information subject
These insight highlight interdependence epistemic pragmatic ethical consideration characteristic standardization construct social science
The development account discussed previous section part larger epistemic turn philosophy measurement occurred early
Rather emphasizing mathematical foundation metaphysics semantics measurement philosophical work recent year tends focus presupposition inferential pattern involved concrete practice measurement historical social material dimension measuring
The philosophical study topic referred epistemology measurement Mari Leplège Tal
In broadest sense epistemology measurement study relationship measurement knowledge
Central topic fall purview epistemology measurement include condition measurement produce knowledge content scope justification limit knowledge reason particular methodology measurement standardization succeed fail supporting particular knowledge claim relationship measurement activity observation theorizing experimentation modelling calculation
In pursuing objective philosopher drawing work historian sociologist science investigating measurement practice longer period Wise Smith Latour Ch
Schaffer Porter Wise Alder Galison Gooday Crease well history philosophy scientific experimentation Harré Hacking Franklin Cartwright
The following subsection survey topic discussed burgeoning body literature
A topic attracted considerable philosophical attention recent year selection improvement measurement standard
Generally speaking standardize quantity concept prescribe determinate way concept applied concrete particular
To standardize measuring instrument ass well outcome measuring instrument fit prescribed mode application relevant concept
The term measurement standard accordingly least two meaning one hand commonly used refer abstract rule definition regulate use quantity concept definition meter
On hand term measurement standard also commonly used refer concrete artifact procedure deemed exemplary application quantity concept metallic bar served standard meter
This duality meaning reflects dual nature standardization involves abstract concrete aspect
In noted standardization involves choice among nontrivial alternative choice among different thermometric fluid among different way marking equal duration
These choice nontrivial sense affect whether temperature time interval deemed equal hence affect whether statement natural law containing term temperature time come true
Appealing theory decide standard accurate would circular since theory determinately applied particular prior choice measurement standard
This circularity variously called problem coordination van Fraassen Ch
problem nomic measurement Chang Ch

As already mentioned conventionalists attempted escape circularity positing statement known coordinative definition supposed link specific measurement operation
A drawback solution supposes choice measurement standard arbitrary static whereas actual practice measurement standard tend chosen based empirical consideration eventually improved replaced standard deemed accurate
A new strand writing problem coordination emerged recent year consisting notably work Hasok Chang Bas van Fraassen Ch

These work take historical coherentist approach problem
Rather attempting avoid problem circularity completely predecessor set show circularity vicious
Chang argues constructing standardizing measurement iterative task
Each epistemic iteration history standardization respect existing tradition time correcting Chang Ch

The concept temperature example associated crude ambiguous method ordering object hot cold
Thermoscopes eventually thermometer helped modify original concept made precise
With iteration quantity concept stable set standard turn allowed theoretical prediction tested precisely facilitating subsequent development theory construction stable standard
How process avoids vicious circularity becomes clear look either retrospect given current scientific knowledge within looking historical development original context van Fraassen
From either vantage point coordination succeeds increase coherence among element theory instrumentation
The question count measurement quantity quantity though unanswerable independently addressed together process mutual refinement
It one adopts foundationalist view attempt find starting point coordination free presupposition historical process erroneously appears lack epistemic justification
The new literature coordination shift emphasis discussion definition definition
In metrological jargon realization physical instrument procedure approximately satisfies given definition cf
JCGM
Examples metrological realization official prototype kilogram cesium fountain clock used standardize second
Recent study suggest method used design maintain compare realization direct bearing practical application concept quantity unit scale le definition concept Tal Riordan
As already discussed Sections theory measurement interdependent historically conceptually
On historical side development theory measurement proceeds iterative mutual refinement
On conceptual side specification measurement procedure shape empirical content theoretical concept theory provides systematic interpretation indication measuring instrument
This interdependence measurement theory may seem like threat evidential role measurement supposed play scientific enterprise
After measurement outcome thought able test theoretical hypothesis seems require degree independence measurement theory
This threat especially clear theoretical hypothesis tested already presupposed part model measuring instrument
To cite example Franklin et al
There would seem first glance vicious circularity one use mercury thermometer measure temperature object part experiment test whether object expand temperature increase
Nonetheless Franklin et al
conclude circularity vicious
The mercury thermometer could calibrated another thermometer whose principle operation presuppose law thermal expansion gas thermometer thereby establishing reliability mercury thermometer independent ground
To put point generally context local threat circularity usually avoided appealing kind instrument part theory
A different sort worry evidential function measurement arises global scale testing entire theory concerned
As Thomas Kuhn argues scientific theory usually accepted long quantitative method testing become available
The reliability newly introduced measurement method typically tested prediction theory rather way around
In Kuhn word The road scientific law scientific measurement rarely traveled reverse direction
For example Dalton Law state weight element chemical compound related proportion initially conflicted best known measurement proportion
It assuming Dalton Law subsequent experimental chemist able correct improve measurement technique
Hence Kuhn argues function measurement physical science test theory apply increasing scope precision eventually allow persistent anomaly surface would precipitate next crisis scientific revolution
Note Kuhn claiming measurement evidential role play science
Instead argues measurement test theory isolation comparison alternative theory proposed attempt account anomaly revealed increasingly precise measurement illuminating discussion Kuhn thesis see Hacking
Traditional discussion like Kuhn conducted background logical positivist distinction theoretical observational language
The measurement correctly perceived threat possibility clear demarcation two language
Contemporary discussion contrast longer present epistemological threat take granted level prerequisite measurement evidential power
Without minimal substantive assumption quantity measured amenability manipulation relation quantity would impossible interpret indication measuring instrument hence impossible ascertain evidential relevance indication
This point already made Pierre Duhem see also Carrier
Moreover contemporary author emphasize theoretical assumption play crucial role correcting measurement error evaluating measurement uncertainty
Indeed physical measurement procedure become accurate model underlying process involves increasing theoretical richness model Tal
The acknowledgment theory crucial guaranteeing evidential reliability measurement draw attention problem observational grounding inverse challenge traditional threat Tal
The challenge specify role play measurement particularly sort connection observation necessary sufficient allow measurement play evidential role science
This problem especially clear one attempt account increasing use computational method performing task traditionally accomplished measuring instrument
As Margaret Morrison Wendy Parker forthcoming argue case reliable quantitative information gathered target system aid computer simulation manner satisfies central desideratum measurement empirically grounded
Such information rely signal transmitted particular object interest instrument use theoretical statistical model process empirical data related object
For example data assimilation method customarily used estimate past atmospheric temperature region thermometer reading available
Some method fitting computational model atmosphere behavior combination available data nearby region forecast condition time observation Parker forthcoming
These estimation used various way including data evaluating climate model
Regardless whether one call estimation measurement challenge idea producing reliable quantitative evidence state object requires observing object however loosely one understands term observation
Two key aspect reliability measurement outcome accuracy precision
Consider series repeated weight measurement performed particular object balance
From realist perspective outcome measurement close true value quantity case true ratio object weight chosen close
An analogy often cited clarify distinction arrow shot target accuracy analogous closeness hit bull eye precision analogous tightness spread hit cf
JCGM Teller
Though intuitive way carving distinction raise epistemological difficulty
It commonly thought exact true value quantity interest science unknowable least quantity measured continuous scale
If assumption granted accuracy quantity measured known exactitude estimated comparing inaccurate measurement
And yet unclear convergence among inaccurate measurement taken indication truth
After measurement could plagued common bias prevents individual inaccuracy cancelling averaged
In absence cognitive access true value evaluation measurement accuracy possible
In answering question philosopher benefited studying various sens term measurement accuracy used practicing scientist
At least five different sens identified metaphysical epistemic operational comparative pragmatic Tal
In particular epistemic sense term metaphysically neutral presuppose existence true value
Instead accuracy measurement outcome taken closeness agreement among value reasonably attributed quantity given available empirical data background knowledge cf
JCGM Note Giordani Mari
Thus construed measurement accuracy evaluated establishing robustness among consequence model representing different measurement process
Under conception imprecision special type inaccuracy
For example inaccuracy weight measurement breadth spread value reasonably attributed object weight given indication balance available background knowledge way balance work standard weight used
The imprecision measurement component inaccuracy arising uncontrolled variation indication balance repeated trial
Other source inaccuracy besides imprecision include imperfect correction systematic error inaccurately known physical constant vague measurand definition among others see
Paul Teller raise different objection conception measurement accuracy
He argues assumption call measurement accuracy realism according measurable quantity definite value reality
Teller argues assumption false insofar concern quantity habitually measured physic specification definite value value range quantity involves idealization hence refer anything reality
For example concept usually understood phrase velocity sound air involves host implicit idealization concerning uniformity air chemical composition temperature pressure well stability unit measurement
Removing idealization completely would require adding infinite amount detail specification
As Teller argues measurement accuracy understood useful idealization namely concept allows scientist ass coherence consistency among measurement outcome linguistic expression outcome latched onto anything world
Precision similarly idealized concept based indefinite specification count repetition measurement circumstance Teller

In science measurement collection quantitative numerical data describes property object event
A measurement made comparing quantity
Since comparison perfect measurement inherently include much measured value deviate true value
The study measurement called metrology
There many measurement system used throughout history across world progress made since century setting international standard
The modern SI base type physical measurement
Measuring volume cup water Erlenmeyer flask give better measurement trying gauge volume putting bucket even measurement reported using unit milliliter
So criterion scientist used compare measurement type magnitude unit
The level type methodology used taking measurement
Magnitude actual numerical value measurement
Unit ratio number standard quantity gram candela micrometer
Uncertainty reflects systematic random error measurement
Uncertainty description confidence accuracy precision measurement typically expressed error
Measurements calibrated say compared set standard system measuring device deliver value match another person would obtain measurement repeated
There common standard system may encounter SI come French name It commonly used metric system
SI specific metric system decimal system measurement
Examples two common form metric system MKS system meter kilogram second base unit CGS system centimeter gram second base unit
There many unit SI form metric system built upon combination base unit
These called derived unit The British Imperial system measurement common SI unit adopted
Although Britain largely adopted SI system United States Caribbean country still use English system

A bit digit smallest increment data computer
A bit hold one two value corresponding electrical value respectively
Because bit small rarely work information one bit time
Bits usually assembled group eight form
A byte contains enough information store single character like h
A kilobyte KB byte one thousand byte might expected computer use base two math instead decimal base ten system
Computer storage often measured megabyte MB gigabyte GB
A novel contains MB information
MB kilobyte byte one million byte
Similarly one GB MB byte
A terabyte TB GB TB amount information book large library roughly CDs worth data
A petabyte PB TB
PB data written DVDs would create roughly DVDs stack foot tall stack CDs mile high
Indiana University building storage system capable holding petabyte data
An exabyte EB PB
A zettabyte ZB EB
Finally yottabyte YB ZB
Many hard drive manufacturer use decimal number system define amount storage space
As result MB defined one million byte GB defined one billion byte
Since computer us binary system mentioned may notice discrepancy hard drive published capacity capacity acknowledged computer
For example hard drive said contain GB storage space using decimal system actually capable storing byte
However binary system GB byte
As result instead acknowledging GB computer acknowledge GB
This malfunction matter different definition
We count base power Computers count base So computer jargon following unit used The name abbreviation number byte easily confused notation bit
The abbreviation number bit use b instead B
Since one byte made eight bit difference significant
For example broadband Internet connection advertised download speed M p speed mega per second mega per second would abbreviated M p
Bits bit rate bit time bit per second bps commonly used describe connection speed pay particular attention comparing Internet connection provider service

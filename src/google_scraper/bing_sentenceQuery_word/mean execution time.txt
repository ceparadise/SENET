In time program running contrast
A error detected execution running state program whereas error detected program ever executed
code optimization typically done compile time may done run time depending particular language compiler
When program executed first performs necessary setup link program need execution begin starting program
In case language implementation task done language runtime instead though unusual mainstream language common consumer operating system
Some program debugging performed efficient accurate performed runtime
bound checking example
For reason programming discovered program tested real data despite sophisticated checking testing
In case end user may encounter message
one language feature designed handle runtime error providing structured way catch completely unexpected situation well predictable error unusual result without amount inline error checking required language without
More recent advancement runtime engine enable provides debug information every exception interest implemented independent source code attaching special software product runtime engine

process performs instruction
The instruction program trigger sequence simple action executing machine
Those action produce effect according instruction program
Programs computer may execute without human interaction may type
In case command simply program whose execution chained together
The term used almost synonymously
A related meaning run execute refers specific action user starting program Please run application
The context execution take place crucial
Very program execute
Programs usually contain implicit explicit assumption resource available time execution
Most program execute support specific source language provide crucial service supplied directly computer
This supportive environment instance usually decouples program direct manipulation computer peripheral providing general abstract service instead
Prior execution program must first written
This generally done compiled statically linked executable
This executable invoked often operating system load program memory possibly performs begin execution moving control program step depend operating system
At point execution begin program enters
The program run end either normal termination
A system executes program called program
Loosely speaking interpreter actually program say
This contrast language translator convert program one language another
The common language translator
Translators typically convert source human readable language language sometimes low native simpler faster directly execute
The idea ratio execution translation program large program need compiled run number time
This provide large benefit translation versus direct interpretation source language
One development time increased compilation
In case changed file must recompiled
Then executable need relinked
For change executable must rebuilt scratch
As computer compiler become faster fact becomes le obstacle
Also speed end product typically important user development time
Translators usually produce abstract result completely ready execute
Frequently operating system convert translator final executable form execution program begin

Wikipedia Advertizing Wikipedia In set stored storage location denoted
In assignment statement one basic
Common notation assignment
Assignment statement typically allow variable contain different value different time execution
Thus language featuring destructive assignment rarely enforce requires procedure return result given set input point time
An assignment operation process different value associated particular variable name time pass
The program model operates changing state using successive assignment statement
Primitives imperative programming language rely assignment
At lowest level assignment implemented using
The container value
It possible put value variable later replace new one
An assignment operation modifies current state executing program
Consequently assignment dependent concept
In assignment Example Assuming numeric variable assignment mean content variable doubled execution statement
The case assigned value depends previous one common many imperative language notably majority descendant defining special like convenience example becomes
An example segment code In sample variable first declared int assigned value
Notice declaration assignment occur statement
In second line declared without assignment
In third line reassigned value
Finally assigned value
For assignment operation necessary value valid represents modifiable entity valid modifiable
In language typically one necessary declare variable prior assigning value
Any assignment change existing value
disallowed language
In assignment discouraged favor single assignment also called
Single assignment example differs assignment described article done usually variable created subsequent allowed
Once created single assignment named value variable
An evaluation expression change observable state machine produce value input
Imperative assignment introduce side effect destroying making old value unavailable substituting new one referred reason similar
Single assignment form assignment available language Haskell variable sense imperative programming language rather named constant value possibly compound nature element progressively defined
Purely functional language provide opportunity avoiding sequential one step time execution since value independent
Impure functional language provide single assignment well true assignment though true assignment typically used le frequency imperative programming language
For example Scheme single assignment true assignment used variable specialized primitive provided destructive update inside list vector string etc
In OCaml single assignment allowed variable via syntax however destructive update used element array string separate operator well field record object explicitly declared meaning capable changed initial declaration programmer
Functional programming language use single assignment include vals
code considered explicit sense named variable explicitly unassigned state set exactly
In Haskell contrast unassigned variable every variable thought implicitly set value rather computational object produce value created
In programming language assignment statement return value others
In example assignment statement return assigned value allowing idiom assignment statement return value assigned
In statement return value function used control loop assigning value variable
In programming language example return value assignment undefined idiom invalid
In variable assignment operation similar assignment like assigning field array field mutable data structure usually evaluate value unit type typically type expression evaluated purely side effect
A statement like called value assigned multiple variable
Chained assignment often used initialize multiple variable Not programming language support chained assignment
In programming language example chained assignment supported assignment return value
In also available value class type making appropriate return type assignment operator
This however strongly discouraged also allows value class type assigned temporary object result statement effect assignment temporary object detected error type
In assignment statement expression thus return value
Instead chained assignment series statement multiple target single expression
The assignment executed evaluates expression assigns result leftmost target assigns result next target using new value
Some programming language since since using tuples allow several variable assigned parallel syntax like simultaneously assigns
If side assignment array variable feature sometimes called The list unpacked assigned
More interestingly Swaps value
In language without parallel assignment would written use temporary variable since leaf original value
Parallel assignment introduced name
Beginning programmer sometimes confuse assignment equality mean mathematics used assignment many language
But assignment alters value variable equality testing test whether two expression value
In language single equal sign used assignment operator equality relational operator context determining meant
Other language use different symbol two operator
For example The similarity two symbol lead error programmer forgets form appropriate mistypes intended
This common programming problem language C assignment operator also return value assigned validly nested inside expression way function return value
If intention compare two value statement instance assignment quite likely return value interpretable Boolean true case clause executed leading program behave unexpectedly
Some language processor detect situation warn programmer potential error
Common textual representation assignment include
These two form typical programming language classify assignment infix
Other possibility include left arrow keyword though rarer variant Some platform put expression left variable right Some language Tcl uniformly use prefix syntax statement including assignment

I trying solve question dealing n instruction uneven pipeline k stage
I came across generic formula even pipeline
k n clock cycle
But I feel work uneven pipeline formula based fact instruction take time sum time k stage instruction onwards take time maximum stage delay
A example A pipeline designed stage execution time respectively
How much time take execute instruction
The first instruction pas stage one one without stall take cycle
The second instruction go next begin end cycle
As soon finish execution ready go next stage
But occupied previous instruction
Hence need stall cycle yellow
After stall need pause cycle finish cycle
The pattern followed coming instruction
So first instruction finish cycle
Each remaining instruction finish cycle taking cycle
You put total number cycle come Hope help
This basic concept pipeline
There execution time instruction pipeline might dependency raw war waw might branch instruction
Although question asked pretty straight forward
The first instruction need cycle complete rest take max cycle complete
So time needed
Here assuming execution type instruction time without data dependency branch happen real life
In real life solve pipeline problem draw timing diagram check dependency branching apply optimization
So try develop formula clear concept
In case uneven pipeline like mentioned question take execution time largest pipeline treat whole pipeline even pipeline execution time using formula mentioned question

It said Compile time When known compile time process reside compile time binding used generate absolute code
Here I sure absolute code
Load time When known compile time process reside memory compiler generates code
What code
Execution time If process moved execution one memory segment another binding must delayed done run time
If I simple C program like Hello What mechanism Linux usually use three choice allocate process run hello world program
I think concept better described reference titled

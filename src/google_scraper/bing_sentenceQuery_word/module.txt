The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
A module separate unit software hardware
Typical characteristic modular component include allows used variety system allows function component system
The term first used architecture
In computer programming especially older language output language known distinguish set language statement sometimes known
In mainframe system IBM object module linked together object module form
The load module executable code ran computer
concept similar function contained within unit programming code separate function developed separate unit code code easily maintained reused different program
newer idea inherently encompasses modular programming
In computer hardware electronics module relatively compact unit larger device arrangement designed separately installed replaced serviced

Functions procedure summarise set programming instruction
Modules used group function procedure specific purpose
Computer program consist thousand line code like textbook thousand word
In way textbook divided chapter program divided related functionality using
In textbook specific concept covered basis
Similarly computer program specific functionality divided named
Programs usually integrate block code module already created project
The program us implemented function procedure module
You need JavaScript enabled play audio clip
BBC Simon Lumb describes function used programming In computer program often section program want repeat
Chunks instruction given name called
Algorithms broken procedure function
This save time call function required instead type whole instruction set
Programming language set also known function procedure
If programmer make one
Functions differ procedure function return value unlike procedure
However passed procedure function
In program drawing shape program could ask user shape draw
The instruction drawing square could captured
The algorithm action could set task If computer program set instruction could given name sequence would executed calling
A function could calculate VAT due good sold
The algorithm function could If computer program set instruction could given name would executed running calling function
In example function would called using The function would return value VAT used elsewhere

According Stephen Schach Software chapter module consists single block code invoked way procedure function method invoked This seems vague broad
So could anyone explain clearly show actual example break requirement module

Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
Module might overloaded term much Wikipedia describes term discussing use relative software
They discus term structured programming based design approach
Key characteristic modularity related use low high
My usage language like C even module related defining separately compiled unit source file typically one associated header file
Other language use module description language put structuring around module front center name approach
Historically module implication described paper
He primarily concerned discussing benefit replacing functional decomposition data oriented decomposition big step toward present state art object oriented decomposition
Object oriented language organized around class maybe term module le important le precise context
A module For example encapsulates database access
It API access functionality
It single file plugged source tree built
The concept module come modular programming paradigm advocate software composed separate interchangeable component called module breaking program function module accomplishes one function contains everything necessary accomplish
There formal definition module module context project largely depends nature design project
Generally speaking module standalone piece code provides specific tightly coupled functionality module define enforce logical boundary code

technique emphasizes separating functionality independent interchangeable contains everything necessary execute one aspect desired functionality
A module interface express element provided required module
The element defined interface detectable module
The contains working code corresponds element declared interface
Modular programming closely related goal facilitating construction large software program system decomposition smaller piece originating around
While historically usage term inconsistent today modular programming refers decomposition code entire program piece structured programming code use structured programming use kind
In programming use interface architectural pattern construct module known
The term like sometimes used instead
In implementation distinct concept package collection module upcoming introduction collection package enhanced access control planned
Furthermore term package us software example
A similar concept typically refers higher level component piece whole module piece individual program
The scale term module varies significantly language Python file module planned module collection package turn collection file
Other term module include used dialect
Languages formally support module concept include CL Morpho several derivative
Conspicuous example language lack support module Pascal original form
As module proposed module added Pascal superseded Modula Oberon included module start various derivative included module
native module since
Modular programming performed even programming language lack explicit syntactic feature support named module
For example also us module programming ILE
With modular programming module perform logically discrete function interacting interface
Often module form DAG case cyclic dependency module seen indicating single module
In case module form DAG arranged hierarchy module independent depending module module depend one
A particular program library module hierarchy turn seen module program library system
When creating modular system instead creating monolithic application smallest component whole several smaller module written separately composed together construct executable application program
Typically also separately via linked
A may perform construction
This make modular designed system built correctly far reusable traditional monolithic design since many module may reused without change project
This also facilitates breaking project several smaller project
Theoretically modularized software project easily assembled large team since team member creating whole system even need know system whole
They focus assigned smaller task claimed counter key assumption actually possible add developer late software making later still
Modular programming form subsystem particularly software library date early software system used
Modular programming per se goal modularity developed late analog concept
The term modular programming date least National Symposium Modular Programming organized Information Systems Institute July key concept SoC
Modules included original specification included extension early implementation later formalized
One first language designed start modular programming
Another early modular language Wirth drew Mesa well original Modula successor influenced later language particularly successor
Modula use like refer object module coincides notation access field record similarly attribute method object widespread seen C Dart Go Java Python among others
Modular programming became widespread original language include module later version notably included form unit
The Extended Pascal ISO standard kept closer modular support
one complete module system including parameterized module map module
In modular programming overshadowed often conflated particularly due popularity Java
For example C family language support object class originally supporting module year later
Java support module form package though primary unit code organization class
However Python prominently used module object start using module primary unit code organization package unit includes support module object vast array module available
Modular programming widespread found virtually major language developed since
The relative importance module varies language language still overlap confusion class unit organization encapsulation distinct concept

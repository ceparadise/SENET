Published Mar The field surgery entering time great change spurred remarkable recent advance surgical computer technology
diagnostic instrument used operating room year help provide vital information ultrasound tomography CAT imaging technology
Only recently robotic system made way operating room surgical assistant surgical planner answer surgeon demand way overcome surgical limitation minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery
The Robotic surgical system enables surgeon remove gallbladder perform general surgical procedure seated computer console video imaging system acrossthe room patient
The surgeon operate control hand finger direct robotically controlled laparoscope
At end laparoscope advanced articulating surgical instrument miniature camera allow surgeon peer body perform procedure
Now Imagine An army ranger riddled shrapnel deep behind enemy line
Diagnostics wearable sensor signal physician nearby mobile army surgical hospital service needed urgently
The ranger loaded armored vehicle outfitted robotic surgery system
Within minute undergoing surgery performed physician seated control console kilometer harm way
The patient saved
This power amalgamation technology surgical science offering Doctors
Just computer revolutionized latter half century field robotics potential equally alter live century
We already seen robot changed manufacturing car consumer good streamlining speeding assembly line
We even robotic lawn mower robotic pet
And robot enabled u see place human yet able visit planet depth ocean
In coming decade see robot artificial intelligence coming resemble human create
They eventually become conscious able anything human
When talk robot task human often talk future future Robotic surgery already
Robotic surgery latest technological advancement introduces robotic technology field surgery
Only recently robotic system made way operating room surgical assistant surgical planner answer surgeon demand way overcome surgical limitation minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery
This system enables surgeon remove gallbladder perform general surgical procedure seated computer console video imaging system across room patient
The surgeon operate control hand finger direct robotically controlled laparoscope
At end laparoscope advanced articulating surgical instrument miniature camera allow surgeon peer body perform procedure
This system robotic device developed development potential revolutionize surgery operating room
They provide surgeon precision dexterity necessary perform complex minimally invasive surgical MIS procedure bypass neurological orthopedic plastic surgery among many future application
Robotic surgery broadened scope increased effectiveness minimally invasive surgery MIS improved patient outcome created safer efficient operating room
These Robotic system one day applicable surgical specialty
The Laparoscopic instrument inserted small used surgeon whenever possible
Patients le traumatized require shorter hospital stay heal faster conventional surgery
Laparoscopic instrument mainly limited scissors stapler close incision attach blood vessel
It also graspers manipulate tissue
The instrument enter body long tube video image tiny camera called endoscope poked another incision guide surgeon
For relatively simple procedure like gallbladder removal tool work well enough
But surgeon ca use instrument perform complicated task like suturing knot tying
Because limitation operation ca performed endoscopically
Robotic surgery us laparoscopic miniature robotic hand dexterity tie knot
The reason surgeon cut person open get hand
The surgeon like get hand around organ palpate
Robotic surgery provides little instrument let surgeon feel working hand normal procedure hence avoiding bigger incision
The Robotic surgical system consists joystick one surgeon right left hand computer end robotic instrument snake body perform actual surgery
Each hydraulically powered end effector consists single digit three four inch long lesshan half inch wide
It four joint rotate swivel swing back forth grasper end
The result A finger function like entire hand
The surgery completely anthropomorphic
If hand move instrument move hand move right instrument move right
The system also force feedback relay doctor response muscle tissue action
The feedback make procedure feel like normal surgery
The system also tactile sensor transmit feel tissue surgeon fingertip
Surgery us robotic image processing system order interactively assist medical team planning surgical intervention execution
This new technique enhances quality surgical procedure minimizing side effect smaller incision lesser trauma precision thus increasing patient benefit decreasing surgical cost
These technique successfully introduced several area surgery neurosurgery orthopedics cardiovascular general surgery etc
WHY GO FOR A ROBOTIC SURGERY
The advantage using surgery many They bring cost operation
The patient faster recovery time fewer trauma
There le chance complication
The doctor see better fiber optic regular sight
Robotic arm suffer fatigue tremor human hand
This category application command control usually requires relatively low bandwidth
This appears case control medical device well
The exception robotic surgery application require transmission control signal also transmission motion image VMS tape quality
Latency essential factor application overshoot controlled parameter could result situation
It suggested latency human nervous system msec therefore latency control system msec
These application may involve transmission real patient data patient may consider sensitive control signal tampered could cause life threatening situation
They require high level transmission security sure viewed altered transmission
Reliability The network must close reliable possible lack reliability could result life threatening situation
This group application tend point point application initially require scalability
However viewed successful telemedicine application bandwidth available network scalable capacity increased future response potential increase demand
In case robotic surgery future additional interactive monitoring site may added also serve useful teaching function require degree network scalability

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I using Subversion private synchronization laptop desktop
Recently I discovered several ASCII file several binary file corrupted
Instead expected content long series file name directory structure inserted truncated stray string binary data
I never encountered update commit reply indicating repository corrupt file system hardware issue two client used Subversion server
My question way I determine file started go corrupt repo revert file old commit still intact
I try repository
That might least give idea corruption
I performed past fix corruption always bit dicey

What good metaphor example explain English major difference classical computer science good using profoundly different thing
Most people idea Computer Science even
They see word computer
Hence Computer Science major interpreted He hook printer
Or good computer
Even fewer people know difference computer programming Computer Science
Computer Science computing theory
CS learned without actual computer
CPU micro architecture
How sort number traverse list etc
State machine
Algorithms big Oh etc
How design programming language compiler
Programming writing code creating application language compiler created computer scientist
Lastly using computer using GUI mouse keyboard
Internet etc Yet three used interchangeably layman
What good metaphor example explain English major difference classical computer science good using Or simply pithy example real computer science nothing using
Many good question generate degree opinion based expert experience answer question tend almost entirely based opinion rather fact reference specific expertise
How automotive analogy
So people equate using software package like equating driving proficiency ability design antilock brake trust life manufacturable consistent high quality low cost work year extreme weather
Or equating driving proficiency researching kind braking feature avoid collision without freaking driver swerving another lane
Perhaps lay people confuse term computer science class teach computer use skill programming theory engineering
All stuff arguably first part fit curriculum computer science
None content computer science English class learning way English major fuzzier concept
Since english major Computer literacy like reading computer programming like composition computer science like linguistics
All language skill exactly interchangable
Somebody put way I afraid I forgotten
Disinfecting kitchen microbiology operating computer computer science
Computer science computer astronomy telescope
Edsgar Dijkstra I read book unfortunately I forgot book
I work real engineer lot seem think computer programming CS thing apparently think engineer really high level math well different topic
I used CAD drafter back high school I tell I basically mechanical engineer seems even playing field
I guess could tell English major friend read book already might well English major
Or le confrontational way let know would equivalent saying
Hmm another metaphor Google search Yea
I miss fourth bullet computer engineering
An engineer know thing work
A scientist know thing work
A builder make thing sometimes work
A user us thing
For thing read house computer car For builder substitute suitable name manual labor professional
programmer thing computer mason thing house etc
I found another quote Edsger Dijkstra harm done topic became known actually like referring surgery firmly implanted people mind computing science machine peripheral equipment
You shorten Computer science like referring surgery
But even need say
It think would enough say CS kind math nothing computer
Computer science knowledge computer use
Computer literacy knowledge computer use

A relational database RDB collective set multiple data set organized table record column
RDBs establish relationship database table
Tables communicate share information facilitates data searchability organization reporting
RDBs use Structured Query Language SQL standard user application provides easy programming interface database interaction
RDB derived mathematical function concept mapping data set developed Edgar Codd
RDBs organize data different way
Each table known relation contains one data category column
Each table record row contains unique data instance defined corresponding column category
One data record characteristic relate one many record form functional dependency
These classified follows RDB performs select project join database operation select used data retrieval project identifies data attribute join combine relation
RDBs many advantage including Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

Relational database allow data separated connected across several table
Tables connected primary foreign key increase efficiency
A single table useful recording limited amount data
But large database inefficient take space relational database
It also requires new data added every time enter new record whereas relational database
Finally data partially duplicated across record occur table easily avoided relational database
Therefore large set data many different efficient create separate table connect relationship

Simon Lumb explains difference relational flat file database Relational allow data stored clear organised manner across multiple table
Links known formed allow data shared across table
For instance retail company might different table following information could complicated eg company sold book may several category within book including author name title genre physical size many detail
Storing information one table would create large table

Any opinion finding conclusion recommendation expressed material author necessarily reflect view UK Essays
In following report I talking main reason use database benefit using brief history old database design current database design today
I explain terminology relational database current attribute within
I relate Microsoft SQL Management Studio visual screenshots syntax quote formatted accordingly
For criterion I expand Primary Keys comment benefit referential integrity relevant information keep consistency flow system
For criterion I expand Cascading update provide evidence applying practise implemented database
Finally I provide conclusion summing main point giving personal opinion I feel necessary
In world storing retrieving data organisational purpose system called File Database implemented
Herman Hollerith man intentionally came idea data could stored represented system flat file system implemented
Flat file system built IBMs operating system Microsoft NT time
Flat file system large group data stored within file usually simple layout usually consisting customer data separated line
For example Michael Monaghan Manchester Road Manchester Anthony Monaghan Fellow Close Manchester The format flat file system user friendly regarding formatting although fulfil correct function storing customer detail
Taking consideration Data Protection Act would accessed administrative personnel would encrypted use
If database administrator needed search flat file system specific record would usually use third party program query information
As technology developed new practises put place quickly discovered flat file system efficient way store manipulate data
There needed robust advanced system available would change formatting database able retrieve record ease speed
Relational database created
The first relational design model first proposed implemented Codd
He came idea inserting data centralised point querying data based quality feature data
This later developed relational database design structure see today
The term relational mean form relationship relate one another
In specific term relational database two table connection field value
These database contain variety information regarding company requires store online shopping
These linked customer purchase item stock table decrease quantity item etc
Alongside relational database concept application used query database SQL Management Studio
SQL Structured Query Language language manipulate query specific vague need
SQL used create database form relationship constraint modify table change individual record needed
In table contain many different field column example CustomerID CompanyName ContactName ContactTitle etc
These used organise data category
Each column assigned data type keep referential integrity database running flexibility
Data type used minimise much space possible without allocating space needed
The screenshot displaying table created using SQL syntax management studio
In table field defined first CustomerID alongside data type used VARCHAR
Within relational database record unique free duplicated data
This save error potential problem referring data future
For example employee might need notifying required hand week resignation notice
In result user queried database two name name thus resignation letter might go wrong person
In scenario key field made used
Key field made uniquely identify record number character value replicated throughout database
So event record surname administrator refer unique ID called Primary Key
A Primary Key table constraint affect entirety table working
It allows record unique correspond unique number
Repeated data provide good standing point referential integrity information queried
As primary key table constraint affect complete table
Referential Integrity complete consistency relationship table
Primary key foreign key constraint provide referential integrity throughout database
If key removed integrity relationship would removed destroyed table
Tables need Referential Integrity stop repeated data entered database conflicting foreign key constraint
Referential Integrity need rule keep data consistent robust
A primary key constraint must present within table ensure validity data foreign key constraint link relational table suitable relationship
It also help stop N N Many Many Relationships conflicted destroying referential integrity
Many many relationship cause repeated data inserted within table example online library database many book cover many subject many subject listed many book
Another example would Student Tutor table Student may one tutor tutor would many different student
To solve table must inserted table called intermediate table
An intermediate table contains primary key separate table would used match ID together find indivuaul
For example
Class We understand thus Mr Michael Monaghan teaching Anthony Monaghan
This put Many Many relationship reference relating table
Student Tutor table
Candidate key used key field could negotiated used primary key table
The administrator need take consideration numerical value would best suited character value primary key
A Composite key table two unique attribute make one primary key
This would used match two attribute within table
An example would ISBN Number
These natural naming key also known Surrogate key
Surrogate key natural naming key provide unique attribute table
Foreign key used link two together form relational database
One column might updated record updated table constraint
Foreign key also known table constraint
Once foreign key executed within table table relationship
A relationship could set Customer order displayed updated customer purchase another table etc
Table constraint change table affect running entire table
A Primary key would affect table entering detail making unique
A column constraint similar concept affect column null statement defines nothing left blank column
Cascading update process relational database offer enforce Referential Integrity
It allows user update field within table information set override existing column
Cascading deletes also allows user delete drop record integrity data also removed saving time space
Cascading update also help keep data consistent enforce referential integrity throughout database
It allows record updated update along changing value relationship
It ensures referential integrity database relational link
ON DELETE NO ACTION CASCADE SET NULL SET DEFAULT ON UPDATE NO ACTION CASCADE SET NULL SET DEFAULT The syntax cascading follows updating deletion field data following action occur throughout table
For example NO ACTION mean perform action update delete default
CASCADE performs action update delete tie data related modification table
SET NULL set value NULL value necessary mark updated deleted
SET DEFAULT place target table default state previously set constraint
For example CREATE TABLE Students int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY Name varchar int default CONSTRAINT coursestuFK FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Courses ON DELETE SET DEFAULT If specific course name removed course table Students related foreign key value set
To enable Cascading update within database enabled alongside constraint another table
For example database I declaring foreign key constraint Student table referencing course table
The cascading statement executed
Secondly I insert value Students table
This student used test show Cascading working effectively
The data entered correctly Monaghan record completed relating English course Courses table
I use DELETE FROM statement allows remove field within table based unique value
There one course called English I wish remove I remove English
When querying Courses table English field removed
I use statement SELECT FROM Students cascading delete option Anthony Monaghan field removed English removed
Transaction log used within SQL roll back running statement encountered error
If two statement executed time error occurred none statement would executed
Here example using transaction BEGIN TRANSACTION END TRANSACTION The SQL statement would contained within BEGIN END TRANS
In conclusion following report I outlined many different aspect feature make relational database cascading update key constraint
primary composite candidate foreign key
I explained definition given relevant syntax reference needed
I also used image support statement giving point data type querying relational database
I felt considerable amount research development I experienced working SQL assignment It broaden knowledge large small company organise database different design approach
To sum main point assignment relational database exceptional advantage flat file system management capability much detailed regard formatting easier query information needed

A relational database model store data
The vast majority database used modern application relational term database relational database often used synonymously
Likewise database management system relational database management system RDBMSes
Other database model include hierarchical database though rarely used
Each table relational database contains record field
In terminology row sometimes called tuples column may referred attribute table may called relation
A table visualized row column intersection row column contains specific value
It relational since record share field
Database table often include provides unique identifier row within table
The key may assigned column requires unique value row may comprised multiple column together form unique combination value
Either way primary key provides efficient way data used share value table within database
For example value primary key one table assigned field row another table
Values imported table called foreign key
The standard way access data relational database Structured Query Language query
SQL query used create modify delete table well select insert delete data existing table

Candidates able In data held several problem associated
Consider following scenario The limitation trying represent information single file quickly become apparent
The first row represents Pulse reading patient Kit Kline
The second row represents different test requires u information forename surname age patient
This continues test result
This make size database unnecessarily large process data entry cumbersome repetitive
The process unnecessarily duplicating data called Note data entry error highlighted table
Such data inconsistency occurs large amount duplicate data entered database
By duplicating data across record flat file introduce risk The problem database system lead The key difference relational database database relational database data grouped stored
An entity real world thing data held database
Examples entity include Attributes fact aspect property detail entity
Examples attribute include In general entity attribute attribute smaller part
An attribute belongs single entity
The key field sometimes called primary key used store attribute make particular entity entry database unique
For example NHS number passport number vehicle registration booking reference flight number etc
Consider library database
Entities would separate linked table
The book table would detail book detail author would stored separate table
A table would hold detail library member could borrow book
Another table would also needed store detail actual lending data return date
This loan table would need store detail book author borrower link data table
The simplified diagram show key field table used link entity
The component relational database In relational database
Database table made
Each record relational database table corresponds instance
In example table Students record top row containing field name record
Each record corresponds instance Student entity
row represents individual student
Note although two student called Philip Barker date birth different Student IDs therefore considered different student
An piece information characteristic entity
Attributes entity represented database table column
A field store one item data
In table student represented relational database record student stored following For example student Student ID called born
Fields following characteristic In relational database must entity
Sometimes existing attribute used unique time sort numeric ID created
This called
In Student database table Key Field needed unique item data student
Sometimes one field combined make primary key example cinema reservation could uniquely defined particular seat number particular screening
To link table one table must appear field table
This best explained example case simplified relational database doctor surgery
There two Patient Test Results two table created
As neither patient treatment unique attribute entity given numeric ID
All data associated patient held one table data associated test result held another
In order create two table created adding Patient Table field Test Result Table
This mean new test result added test result table data patient need added Patient ID
The example show two table might look real data
As seen Patient ID make link two table apart field duplication data
If detail patient tested needed easily accessed relationship two table data
Problems also avoided
There three different type relationship entity Each relationship shown diagram one The diagram show diagram drawn represent entity relational database planned store detail student resource borrowed school library book video music etc
The Student entity one end relationship Library Loan entity many end end link look like crow foot
The relationship instance Student entity instance Library Loan entity stated When converted database table entity need table containing field attribute
All student attribute name date birth etc held Students table Library Loans table hold data associated student library loan
See table The Students table field called Student ID Library Loans table field called Loan ID
Because key field field record table Student ID value used uniquely identify student
Similarly Library Loan record uniquely identified Loan ID field Library Loans table
Note database table often designed new record created key field entry generated incremental number
Microsoft Access assign data type AutoNumber field
Sometimes however natural choice unique data used instead
Car Registration Number National Insurance Number Product Serial Number
In order create relationship two table key one table must added field table becomes key
In case library database shared field would Student ID field
primary key Students table
It selected general rule relationship entity entity end relationship used entity end relationship see diagram
After Student ID field added Library Loans table table would look like one
By appearing table Student ID field created relationship two table
It act key field Students table key field Library Loans table
Unlike Loan ID field Student ID field occur one record Library Loans table student may borrowed one resource library
The diagram show example data Students Library Loans table
Notice value primary key Students table match value foreign key Library Loans table
This creates link two table permit question What loan student borrowed answered
Notice every library loan record associated student however every student library loan
When user input detail new library loan entry rejected also associate loan existing student
valid Student ID
This known ensuring referential integrity one method validating data entry
A form used data rather use database table directly
When edited
user interface In GCSE Computing exam might well asked
Make sure take note following The interrogation database called database question used interrogate data called
There many reason user may wish query data including The list show query mean producing
This information used decision maker organisation plan strategy tactic
Databases usually allow user create reuse query
A query design specifies record user searching field display record
There two type query The example simple query us Microsoft Access database table query find name student form
This involves following step A query also written using query language tructured uery anguage
The example would written For GCSE Computing examination could simplified Further example query data could A report used data
It either displayed screen typically
A printed report therefore snapshot data database particular point time
Reports offer number advantage displaying printing database table query result Most relational database include facility report generated data held database
Reports include make information easy assimilate
As form report customised include logo colour font style organisation
In GCSE Computing exam might well asked
Make sure take note following When database designed field set accept particular data type
This help check wrong type data entered
For example database allow store text field data type integer
Data type also help make sure data
For example field data type integer requires le storage space hold value compared field data type real
Data type also help ensure data sorted correctly
For example integer value stored number field easily sorted correctly
However value stored field text would sort alphabetical order
In way date field allow data sorted year month day
A field data type text accept number text
Numeric field used store number
This There two type numeric field need know
A field type store day month year record year month finally day easily validated using
Date field display date information different format full name August numerical version
Modules package code database developer use add extra functionality relational database
Each module collection procedure stored together unit database
Modules associated specific form report case procedure tend specific form report attached
Modules used present company business rule user friendly interface
An example business rule might state credit check performed existing customer processing loan application
In large organisation module contain general procedure reused different section company
This save different user write version query database help ensure company standard practice followed
Well written module tend optimised run faster efficiently query written end user
Modules presented user application tailored user need
For example user interface form use dental receptionist
She use query appointment database order find book slot patient
By mean module save end user understand table field relationship database
In Microsoft Access module produced using language called Visual Basic Applications
Other database vendor similarly language producing module
Some vendor specialised producing professional module common business function
For example purchase individual system Oracle composed database module A complex query look data two field us
The following example us complex query find pupil Form born
This query us logical operator written The following operator used refine search A query design MS Access shown
Note two entry search criterion row query given meaningful name Select Query Pupils born
Below complex query us logical operator OR find pupil Form OR Form This time query definition two criterion row
The query result shown Wildcard character used database query
For example may want list pupil born November pupil whose surname start C
Wildcard search allow specify part data know leave data handling software fill blank
Note wildcard character vary different relational database
For example wildcard character would use Microsoft Access database differ wildcard character used internationally recognised standard called
used several popular relational database ORACLE MYSQL
The following table show wildcards use compose query criterion using Microsoft Access
A built database check data entered It mean data actually correct requires
Field data type provide basic method validation
Field data type assigned field creation database table data type Numeric Boolean Image restrict entered
These used numerical data limit range number user enter
Examples The day part date must range
This type check used number
An extra check digit calculated number entered added end
The number checked stage check digit number seeing match one entered
One example check digit used digit ISBN number uniquely identifies book
The last number ISBN actually check digit number example ISBN

number would check digit shown
Checksum check digit These simply check particular field user continue
null value empty field permitted
Usually every field record need filled however likely must value presence check mean system allow record saved entry made
All alphanumeric data length
A single character length string text Hello World length space counted text string
A length check ensures data either exact length exceed specified number character
A lookup check take value entered compare list value separate table
It return confirmation value entered second list based value
One use lookup restricts user input using
A user forced use list box select predetermined list valid value
For example may select Male Female exam grade range A G U
etc
An example frequently encountered entering postcode online form
The database look postcode return list possible address user select
A database system manages airline seat booking could use check limit entry available list box selection
Rather checking data entered travel agent could presented list box show seat still available
This would eliminate example complicated lookup validation
special form lookup
It used relational database enforce valid input involves checking entry certain field value table
For example Orders table new record entered database could check field new order existing data already Customers table prevent entry order customer exist
Certain field database may require entry particular format
mixture number letter
Simple example date structure text specific length
More complex example include data item postcode National Insurance Numbers driving licence number product code
Most database allow format defined database field input mask defines valid character permitted field
For example item code factory may look like The first two character letter next three character number last character letter
This would allow format check applied field example letter number
This make sure letter entered first two last character number entered middle three
Typing data computer data capture form called transcribing
If error made called
Verification used
Data verified therefore totally
There two main method verification Double entry data entered twice sometimes two different people
The computer compare two version accept entry difference
A familiar example type verification encountered setting new password user usually asked key password second time ensure make mistake first time
As password displayed screen check useful ensuring right password set

also called collection data specially organized rapid search retrieval
Databases structured storage retrieval modification deletion data conjunction various operation
A DBMS extract information database response query
A brief treatment database follows
For full treatment
A database stored set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Using keywords various sorting command user rapidly search rearrange group select field many record retrieve create report particular data
Database record file must organized allow retrieval information
main way user retrieve database information
The power DBMS come ability define new relationship basic one given table use get response query
Typically user provides string character computer search database corresponding sequence provides source material character appear user request example record content field person word
The many user large database must able manipulate information within quickly given time
Moreover large business organization tend build many independent file containing related even overlapping data activity often require linking data several file
Several different type DBMS developed support requirement flat hierarchical network relational
Early system arranged sequentially alphabetically numerically chronologically development storage device made possible random access data via index
In flat database record organized according simple list entity many simple database personal computer flat structure
The record organized treelike structure level record branching set smaller category
Unlike hierarchical database provide single link set record different level create multiple linkage set placing link pointer one set record another speed versatility network database led wide use within business
used association file record expressed link simple flat list becomes one row table relation multiple relation mathematically associated yield desired information
Various Structured Query Language widely employed DBMS relational database
database store manipulate complex data structure called object organized hierarchical class may inherit property class higher chain database structure flexible adaptable
The information many database consists text document database primarily contain information statistic table financial data raw scientific technical data
Small database maintained system may used individual home
These larger database become increasingly important business life part commonly designed office software including program
Typical commercial database application include airline reservation function medical record hospital legal record insurance company
The largest database usually maintained governmental agency business organization university
These database may contain text material abstract report legal statute wire service newspaper journal encyclopaedia catalog various kind
Reference database contain bibliography index serve guide location information book periodical published literature
Thousands publicly accessible database exist covering topic ranging law medicine engineering news current event game classified advertisement instructional course
Increasingly formerly separate database combined electronically larger collection known
Businesses government agency employ software analyze multiple aspect data various pattern
For example government agency might flag human investigation company individual purchased suspicious quantity certain equipment material even though purchase spread around country various subsidiary
early adopter computer database technology
In United States National Crime Information Center NCIC established police record subsequently computerized made available police agency throughout country
The NCIC database enables local police department apprehend offender might otherwise evade advent database marketing individual customer characteristic purchase history retained company information system
Even company particularly large retailer catalog house compile comprehensive data individual customer able customize offering communication
task
A distributed database system example consists database see section Information system database residing different network site
Data may deliberately replicated several different computer enhanced availability reliability linkage computer database already reside may library network consortium
The emergence digital technology century affected humankind inventory recorded information dramatically

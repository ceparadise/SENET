Clones organism exact genetic copy
Every single bit DNA identical
Clones happen twin one many example
Or made lab
Below find natural identical twin similar different clone made modern cloning technology
Many people first heard cloning Dolly Sheep showed scene
Artificial cloning technology around much longer Dolly though
There two way make exact genetic copy organism lab artificial embryo twinning somatic cell nuclear transfer
Artificial embryo twinning relatively way make clone
As name suggests technique mimic natural process creates identical twin
In nature twin form early development embryo split two
Twinning happens first day egg sperm join embryo made small number unspecialized cell
Each half embryo continues dividing ultimately developing separate complete individual
Since developed fertilized egg resulting individual genetically identical
Artificial embryo twinning us approach carried Petri dish instead inside mother
A early embryo separated individual cell allowed divide develop short time Petri dish
The embryo placed surrogate mother finish developing
Again since embryo came fertilized egg genetically identical
Somatic cell nuclear transfer SCNT also called nuclear transfer us different approach artificial embryo twinning produce result exact genetic copy clone individual
This method used create Dolly Sheep
What SCNT mean
Let take apart A somatic cell cell body sperm egg two type reproductive cell
Reproductive cell also called germ cell
In mammal every somatic cell two complete set chromosome whereas germ cell one complete set
The nucleus compartment hold cell DNA
The DNA divided package called chromosome contains information needed form organism
It small difference DNA make u unique
Moving object one place another
To make Dolly researcher isolated adult female sheep
Next removed nucleus DNA egg cell
Then somatic cell egg cell
After couple chemical tweak egg cell new nucleus behaving like freshly fertilized egg
It developed embryo implanted surrogate mother carried term
The transfer step often done using electrical current fuse membrane egg somatic cell
The lamb Dolly exact genetic replica adult female sheep donated somatic cell
She mammal cloned adult somatic cell
Watch video enucleation nuclear transfer
Natural fertilization egg sperm join SCNT make thing dividing ball cell called embryo
So exactly difference two
An embryo cell two complete set chromosome
The difference fertilization SCNT lie two set come
In fertilization sperm egg one set chromosome
When sperm egg join grow embryo two father sperm one mother egg
In SCNT egg cell single set chromosome removed
It replaced nucleus somatic cell already contains two complete set chromosome
So resulting embryo set chromosome come somatic cell

You may heard researcher cloning identifying gene responsible various medical condition trait
What difference
When scientist clone organism making exact genetic copy whole organism described
When scientist clone gene isolate make exact copy one organism gene
Cloning gene usually involves copying DNA sequence gene smaller easily manipulated piece DNA plasmid
This process make easier study function individual gene laboratory

In refers making exact copy frequently OOP
In programming language exception include etc
simply store value somewhere computer memory often
By using simple assignment copy content variable another one Copying primitive type Java Many OOP programming language including make use object reference
Object reference similar pointer language allow object passed around whole object need copied
A Java example copying object using simple assignment The object duplicated variable actually referring object
In equivalent code make clear object copied object
The process actually making another exact replica object instead reference called cloning
In language language library facilitate sort cloning
In Java class contains copy object return reference copied object

Cloning process creating genetically identical copy biological matter
This may include entire organism
Some organism generate clone naturally
protozoa produce develop new individual genetically identical parent organism
capable creating clone type reproduction called
In binary fission bacterial replicated original cell divided two identical cell
Natural cloning also occurs animal organism process budding offspring grows body parent fragmentation body parent break distinct piece produce offspring
In human formation identical twin type natural cloning
In case two individual develop one egg
When speak cloning typically think organism cloning actually three different type cloning
laboratory process used produce offspring genetically identical donor parent
Clones adult animal created process called somatic cell nuclear transfer
In process somatic cell removed placed egg cell nucleus removed
A somatic cell
What risk cloning
One main concern relates human cloning current process used animal cloning successful small percentage time
Another concern cloned animal survive tend various health problem shorter life span
Scientist yet figured problem occur reason think problem would happen human cloning
Scientists successful cloning number different animal
Some animal include sheep goat mouse
How spell breakthrough
Scientists succeeded cloning adult
And Dolly daddy
First Dolly Now Millie Scientists successfully produced cloned transgenic goat
Cloning Clones Researchers developed way create identical mouse
View picture cloned animal Guardian Unlimited
Should human cloned

A major objection human cloning cloned embryo used produce cloned embryo ultimately destroyed
The objection raised regard us embryonic stem cell source
Changing development however could help ease concern stem cell use
Scientists developed new technique generating stem cell
These cell could potentially eliminate need human embryonic stem cell therapeutic research
Other ethical concern cloning involve fact current process high failure rate
According Genetic Science Learning Center cloning process success rate percent animal

Look around
If outside library probably see people
You notice exact copy
Everyone look different
This difference gene important survival specie
When reproduce gene get mixed sperm egg combine make baby look completely different parent
However one organism made exact copy another
Like photocopy original clone exact DNA organism started
Cloning require sexual reproduction
To create clone egg taken donor structure called nucleus hold DNA taken
This blank cell injected DNA organism cloned
The egg stimulated divide form new organism surrogate mother
Cloning scare lot people imagine army identical human created lab cloning important us
Let look pro con two type cloning
process making entirely new cell tissue
Although ethical issue stand way cloning full human animal like sheep rat cat dog even monkey cloned
Monkeys closest relative human animal cloned birth two successfully cloned rhesus macaque monkey big accomplishment provides support idea one day human could cloned
Although highly controversial human reproductive cloning could beneficial society
First couple unable conceive could still genetically related offspring
DNA parent could put donor egg developed surrogate mother create cloned baby
However serious ethical issue involved human cloning
Cloning incredibly inefficient process
Many egg need used successful clone made
The process harvesting human egg donation painful lengthy pose health risk donor
There also increased risk miscarriage harmful surrogate mother
use cloned cell develop treatment disease
During therapeutic cloning person DNA inserted special type cell become type cell without nucleus
Instead inserting developing cell surrogate mother form new organism cell grown lab given specific chemical differentiate stem cell needed tissue

Tens thousand people waiting organ transplant watching
Organs must harvested quickly donor dy taken hospital transplant within hour
The organ must also match patient avoid dangerous condition body attack new organ
Therapeutic cloning make possible sidestep problem
Using therapeutic cloning cell patient body could taken DNA injected stem cell
The tissue grown lab new organ creating perfect match patient need wait matching donor
Therapeutic cloning also potential reverse currently incurable disease
Parkinson disease condition neuron brain cell control muscle start die
Neurons divide dead tissue never regenerates
DNA person could placed stem cell treated chemical grow neuron
The new neuron could inserted brain replace dead one reversing disease
Therapeutic cloning sound like great idea challenge overcome
The first source stem cell
Many people stem cell research believe must kill embryo obtain
However true
Adult tissue like intestine skin bone marrow contain stem cell
The umbilical cord normally discarded also source stem cell
Scientists also developed technique change adult cell skin cell stem cell called changed type cell like neuron
However reprogramming adult cell stem cell still relatively new technology
There still question newly made cell behave time
Stem cell divide quickly scientist worry cell could change implantation patient possibly leading cancer uncontrolled cell growth
It also unclear new cell act patient able blend work together existing cell
process creating exact copy organism
yet done human animal DNA one animal inserted egg without nucleus developed inside surrogate mother create new identical clone
Ethical issue source egg prevented experiment human cloning
potential grow custom made organ transplant cure disease like Parkinson disease
However still question safety cloned tissue human

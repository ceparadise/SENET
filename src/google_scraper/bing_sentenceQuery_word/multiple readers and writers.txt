In example common computing problem
There least three variation problem deal situation many try access shared resource one time
Some thread may read may write constraint process may access shared resource either reading writing another process act writing
In particular allowed two reader access share time
A solves one problem
The basic problem first formulated solved Courtois Suppose shared memory area basic constraint detailed
It possible protect shared data behind mutual exclusion case two thread access data time
However solution suboptimal possible reader might lock another reader request access
It would foolish wait done starting read operation instead reader shall kept waiting share currently opened reading
In solution problem first reader must lock resource shared file available
Once file locked writer may used many subsequent reader without
Before entering every new reader must go entry section
However may single reader entry section time
This done avoid race condition reader
two reader increment readcount time try lock resource causing one reader block
To accomplish every reader enters ENTRY Section lock ENTRY Section done
At point reader locking resource
They locking entry section reader enter
Once reader done executing entry section unlock signalling mutex
Signalling equivalent code
Same valid EXIT Section
There single reader exit section time therefore every reader must claim lock Exit section using
Once first reader entry section lock resource
Doing prevent writer accessing
Subsequent reader utilize locked writer resource
The last reader indicated readcount variable must unlock resource thus making available writer
In solution every writer must claim resource individually
This mean stream reader subsequently lock potential writer starve
This first reader lock resource writer lock get released
And released last reader
Hence solution satisfy fairness
The first solution suboptimal possible reader might lock writer waiting lock reader request access
It would unfair jump immediately ahead happened often enough would
Instead start soon possible
This motivation constraint added
This also called
A solution scenario In solution preference given writer
This accomplished forcing every reader lock release readtry semaphore individually
The writer hand need lock individually
Only first writer lock readtry subsequent writer simply use resource get freed previous writer
The last writer must release readtry semaphore thus opening gate reader try reading
No reader engage entry section readtry semaphore set writer previously
The reader must wait last writer unlock resource readtry semaphore
On hand particular reader locked readtry semaphore indicate potential concurrent writer reader entry section
So writer wait reader release readtry writer immediately lock subsequent writer
However writer able access resource current reader released resource occurs reader finished resource critical section
The resource semaphore locked writer reader entry section
They able first locking readtry semaphore done one time
If writer wishing get resource indicated reader status readtry semaphore reader lock resource
This done allow writer immediately take control resource soon current reader finished reading
Otherwise writer would need wait queue reader done last one unlock readtry semaphore
As soon writer show try set readtry hang waiting current reader release readtry
It take control resource soon current reader done reading lock future reader
All subsequent reader hang readtry semaphore waiting writer finished resource open gate releasing readtry
The rmutex wmutex used exactly way first solution
Their sole purpose avoid race condition reader writer entry exit section
In fact solution implied problem statement result starvation first problem may starve writer queue second problem may starve reader
Therefore sometimes proposed add constraint operation obtaining lock shared data always terminate bounded amount time
A solution fairness reader writer might follows Note also solution satisfy condition thread shall allowed starve semaphore preserve ordering blocking releasing thread
Otherwise blocked writer example may remain blocked indefinitely cycle writer decrementing semaphore
The simplest reader writer problem us two semaphore need array reader read data buffer
Please notice solution get simpler general case made equivalent problem therefore N reader allowed enter parallel N size buffer
In writer value write semaphore given read semaphore reader value read given write completion loop

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I need help understanding implementation problem shown I new concept I rough idea among reader one writer multiple reader trying access
Can anyone please provide insight regarding problem implementation situation
I looking coding sample code pseudocode I working
I looking problem implementation
Upon research I assumed following based line However upon code I also assumed following based line Could I also say one reader may read time therefore reader starved
Therefore would either correct way interpreting coding problem implementation would I wrong
First I would suggest future well write pseudocode command It cleaner easier read image
Also would suggest briefly explaining semantics operation since used three code
To answer reader able read simultaneously mean starvation although simultaneous reading ability additional requirement least classical formulation problem moreover reader read simultaneously protocol
Starvation mean exists process stuck waiting process share resource one reader wait done might read eventually done reading stuck
This protocol seems one described First problem
It easy see mentioned link writer starved
Suppose reading time count
Imagine scenario whenever read together first finish decrement counter immediately request reading counter back
This way counter never reach writer starved stuck waiting

The problem classical one computer science resource database accessed reader modify resource writer modify resource
When writer modifying resource else reader writer access time another writer could corrupt resource another reader could read partially modified thus possibly inconsistent value
This problem extensively studied since often categorized three variant Unfortunately solution first two problem easily found Internet
As today even algorithm called third problem
However algorithm simple decompose problem smaller step property
We build solution using C code
We use mutex
Those semaphore used lock initialized released state available place initialization appear code snippet shown comment
First said earlier want reader writer order prevent starvation
To achieve use semaphore named materialize order arrival
This semaphore taken entity request access resource released soon entity gain access resource Now write writer code straightforward
The writer want exclusive access resource
We create new semaphore named writer request modifying resource The reader code bit complicated multiple reader simultaneously access resource
We want first reader get access resource lock writer access time
Similarly reader done resource need release lock resource reader currently accessing
This similar light switch dark room first person entering room turn light last person leaving room turn light
However much simple room one door one person enter leave room time prevent someone switching light someone enters time using another door
This use counter named representing number reader currently accessing resource well semaphore named protect counter conflicting access
We look back solution check look like fit requirement
It formally proved correct using example
part since time requested semaphore ever held calling process forget deadlock analysis property hold every process call work general case
always strictly greater reader currently executing line inclusive variable unconditionally incremented line unconditionally decremented line without modification modification ever occurs without exclusive lock granted integrity guaranteed
taken line go
It released line go back
Detection raising falling edge guaranteed use lock
As seen mean reader executing line inclusive without taken reader possibly gone especially line represents resource access
requested held line requested held line
However first situation line happens equal first reader get access resource never case another reader currently trying execute line seen two potentially deadlocking reservation never occur time
Thus two semaphore interact cause deadlock
The resource never accessed writer without taken unconditional exclusive way
Since seen always collectively taken reader access resource resource properly protected
Fair access guaranteed taken upon arrival released access resource granted

learn share knowledge build career
I taking operating system class learned problem deal multiple process want read write memory time
I also dealing version problem work I writing application requires multiple user read write shared SQL server database
Because writer problem seems well understood discussed I assuming Microsoft solved
Meaning I need worry setting permission configuring SQL server ensure people reading writing database time
Specifically I assume SQL server default A writer take exclusive lock least row modifying hold transaction commits
lock incompatible lock two writer concurrently modify row
A reader default read committed isolation level take shared lock release soon data read
This incompatible lock reader must wait writing transaction finish reading modified data
SQL Server also reader blocked writer instead read earlier version row
Classic SQL Servers like use pessimistic approach lock row table page writing operation done
You really cope said creator already solved problem
Have look first information database book cover problem depth
If interested topic I would suggest reading Database Systems Connolly Begg example

In lock also known lock lock primitive solves one
An RW lock allows access operation write operation require exclusive access
This mean multiple thread read data parallel exclusive needed writing modifying data
When writer writing data writer reader blocked writer finished writing
A common use might control access data structure memory updated invalid read another thread update complete
lock usually constructed top top
Some RW lock allow lock atomically upgraded locked well downgraded
RW lock designed different priority policy reader writer access
The lock either designed always give priority reader always give priority writer regard priority
These policy lead different tradeoff regard
Several implementation strategy lock exist reducing synchronization primitive assumed
demonstrates implement lock using two mutexes single integer counter
The counter track number blocking reader
One mutex protects used reader global ensures mutual exclusion writer
This requires mutex acquired one thread released another
The following operation This implementation
Alternatively lock implemented term ordinary mutex lock addition integer counter boolean flag
The operation setup The operation similar slightly different input Each inverse operation

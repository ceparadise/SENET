In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

In grouping variable number data item possibly zero shared significance problem solved need operated upon together controlled fashion
Generally data item type language supporting inheritance derived common ancestor type
A collection concept applicable prescribe specific implementation concrete though often conventional choice see discussion
Examples collection include
array table usually considered collection hold fixed number data item although commonly play role implementation collection
array generally considered collection
Many collection define particular linear ordering access one end
The actual data structure implementing collection need example priority queue often implemented kind tree
Important linear collection include In list order data item significant
Duplicate data item permitted
Examples operation list searching data item list determining location present removing data item list adding data item list specific location etc
If principal operation list addition data item one end removal data item generally called
If principal operation addition removal data item one end called
In case data item maintained within collection order unless removed somewhere else special case list collection
Other specialized operation list include sorting order data item great importance
A stack LIFO data structure two principal operation add element top collection remove top element
In priority queue track minimum maximum data item collection kept according ordering criterion order data item matter
One may think priority queue list always keep minimum maximum head remaining element kept bag
Other collection instead interpreted sort function given input collection yield output
Important associative collection include A set interpreted specialized multiset turn specialized associative array case limiting possible set represented
In set order data item matter undefined duplicate data item permitted
Examples operation set addition removal data item searching data item set
Some language support set directly
In others set implemented dummy value key used representing set
In multiset bag like set order data item matter case duplicate data item permitted
Examples operation multisets addition removal data item determining many duplicate particular data item present multiset
Multisets transformed list action sorting
In associative array map dictionary lookup table like dictionary lookup like word provides like definition
The value might reference compound data structure
A usually efficient implementation thus data type often known hash
In graph data item association one data item collection somewhat like tree without concept data item peer
Examples operation graph traversal search explore association data item looking specific property
Graphs frequently used model situation solve related problem
An example creates graph mesh representation data network figure association switching node need broken turn tree thus prevent data going around loop
In tree special kind graph data item associated number data item turn associated number data item frequently viewed
Every data item root single parent root parent number child possibly zero
Examples operation tree addition data item maintain specific property tree perform sorting etc
traversal visit data item specific sequence
Tree collection used naturally store hierarchical data presented manner menu system file directory data storage system
Specialized tree used various algorithm
For example us kind tree called
As described collection various kind collection abstract concept
There exists literature considerable confusion abstract concept computer science specific implementation various language kind language
Assertions collection list set tree etc
data structure abstract data type class must read mind
Collections first foremost abstraction useful formulating solution computing problem
Viewed light retain important link underlying mathematical concept lost focus implementation
For example priority queue often implemented heap associative array often implemented hash table abstract type often referred preferred implementation heap hash though strictly correct
Some collection may language list complex collection implemented library sometimes

What main difference collection Hibernate
In scenario use
A unordered collection contain duplicated element
That mean persist bag order element expect order retains collection retrieved
There concept Java collection framework use corresponds
A similar except store unique object
That mean duplicate element contained set
When add element set second time replace old one
A set unordered default ask sorted
The corresponding type Java
Examples Mapping Mapping Thus mapped exactly way hbm file
But differs way handle duplicate record
Source From Hibernate reference Bags worst case since permit duplicate element value index column primary key defined
Hibernate way distinguishing duplicate row
And also There particular case however bag also list much performant set
For collection standard bidirectional relationship idiom example add element bag list without needing initialize fetch bag element
Both unordered collection
Bags allow duplicate
Sets

I learning Hibernate collection used hibernate
I know bag collection used mapping property type Collection list
And also difference betweeen bag list bag unordered duplicate allowed collection type list maintain insertion order collection
But apart difference two
I read one book bag lack object used key element bag decrease performance updating deleting element
When element bag change Hibernate must update element since way Hibernate find element changed one idea
Your definition correct
Bag work like list without index know order element similar Set duplicate
The important thing know Hibernate map collection bag implicitly use index column relation
This may decrease performance statement good aware
Here find work internally When want insertion order capability list want allow duplicate value go bag
Here ca go set allow duplicate value
Just want add One point
There two type bag Bag without id Bag Id
In Bag without Id remove element entire bag got cleared element inserted
But bag Id element removed get removed rest element impacted
So using bag always try use id bag unless good reason use another
List also two type list order without order
Lists without order similar bag without id
While list order data structure maintains indexing order
So remove one element
rest element got shifted automatically
Hence type list used maintain order element inserted list
Also note although ordering persisted seperate column table
It appears object state fetch
Hence used internal operation

Accessibility link Monday January By BST Aug I six year old I found brother book BASIC programming started experimenting house PC machine
A mild booting error missing core system file later followed touch computer anymore old one AMSTRAD CPS marked beginning relationship computer
I grew ultimate goal pursue BSc Computer Science took goal met mistake submitting country required choice study education system document I
I ended enrolled BSc Economics course I particularly interested
My specific situation might generally applicable worldwide audience Internet technical study becoming ubiquitous
Computer Science however stop flying around mind I sure someone might facing dilemma I faced year ago point represent thought advice I believe might useful people The problem I learning thing I liked thing I try
The answer really simple stop thinking studying Computer Science probably study Computer Science
How know actually tried
You play safe
Start short online introductory course programming algorithm
Coursera time start get idea like code
Ruby would good language start simple avoids many complexity language
Watch video program along start getting excited would probably enjoy studying Computer Science
On hand like Computer Science get passionate coding possible area may suited Technical Writing
Writing documentation
This would require bit technical knowledge actually know writing spot error
Either way Computer Science change way think
During BSc I idea I would make possible convert computing
I realised however change line thinking either going back school another BSc rather finding role unrelated personality potential
It old saying picking something like well people pay
I knew I many year steer towards goal many year benefit advantage another degree I wanted take bigger risk find way exact moment
My thinking process fairly simple I experienced A lead believe B B true I take action I experienced studying something I like I change lead hypothesis faster I would graduate quicker I would dive thing I liked proper CS course
I accepted hypothesis true I graduated highest mark BSc I I wanted apply accepted really good BSc CS degree abroad
I time ready spend another year life starting moment I realised I could convert month
There Ivy League MSc Computer Science conversion course widely known
Their entry requirement involve good undergraduate degree strong passion Computer Science exactly I needed
These month course really intensive challenging life changing time
If passionate programming find course interesting logical importantly memorable
The actual studying homework programming assignment medium hard difficulty may seem paced bit fast push achieve great thing
Go designated prerequisite disastrous ignore prerequisite advise tremendously useful follow
Make sure understand code term math programming abstract thinking bug group project programming multiple computer language
A thing I realised converting Computing You WILL make mistake point find early learn identify even earlier next time move take personally
Make sure accept actively seek offer input colleague especially think input needed
New tool platform requirement APIs likely appear month month beauty technology
Just smile face new challenge
Attend hackathons competition coding finding smart solution interest problem coder know create something scratch
Having completed project show great way showcase work ability
Jack Kelly PhD student Computer Science My first degree Neuroscience
I adore reading science quite enjoy Neuroscience research
But I much prefer building useful thing constantly figuring little puzzle computing allows every day Konstantinos Kamnitsas MSc CS Conversion Course said In Computing easy realise idea
All need initial spark computer implement
No need expensive construct something like previous

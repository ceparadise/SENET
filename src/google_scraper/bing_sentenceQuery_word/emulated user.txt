In hardware software enables one computer system called behave like another computer system called
An emulator typically enables host system run software use peripheral device designed guest system
Emulation refers ability electronic device emulate imitate another program device
Many example designed emulate printer much software written HP printer
If printer emulates HP printer software written real HP printer also run printer emulation produce equivalent printing
Since least today enthusiast use emulator play using original programming code interpreted system
A hardware emulator emulator take form hardware device
Examples include card installed like allowed run PC software program
In theoretical sense implies assumption enough memory available operating environment emulated within environment
However practice quite difficult particularly exact behavior system emulated documented deduced
It also say nothing timing constraint emulator perform quickly original hardware emulated software may run much slowly would original hardware possibly triggering timer interrupt alter behavior
Yes possible Commodore emulate IBM PC us sense possible bail
Emulation strategy combat
Emulation focus recreating original computer environment difficult achieve valuable ability maintain closer connection authenticity digital object
Emulation address original environment digital object recreates current machine
The emulator allows user access kind current run original environment
Jeffery Rothenberg early proponent emulation strategy state ideal approach would provide single extensible solution designed applied uniformly automatically synchrony example every refresh cycle type document medium
He state apply date system also upwardly mobile future unknown system
Practically speaking certain application released new version rather address issue every digital object created previous version one could create emulator allowing access said digital object
Because primary use digital format relies heavily emulation preservation strategy
Artists specialize resurrecting obsolete technology artwork recognize importance decentralized deinstitutionalized process preservation digital culture
In many case goal emulation new medium art preserve digital medium saved indefinitely reproduced without error reliance hardware age becomes obsolete
The paradox emulation emulator made work future computer
Emulation technique commonly used design development new system
It eas development process providing ability detect recreate repair flaw design even system actually built
It particularly useful design system concurrency error difficult detect correct without controlled environment provided virtual hardware
This also allows software development take place hardware ready thus helping validate design decision
Most emulator emulate hardware operating system firmware software required desired software must provided well may emulated
Both OS software emulator rather run native hardware
Apart interpreter emulated binary hardware input output device must provided virtual form well example writing specific memory location influence displayed screen would need emulated
While emulation could taken extreme go atomic level basing output simulation actual circuitry virtual power source would highly unusual solution
Emulators typically stop simulation documented hardware specification digital logic
Sufficient emulation hardware platform requires extreme accuracy level individual clock cycle undocumented feature unpredictable analog element implementation bug
This particularly case classic home computer whose software often depends highly sophisticated programming trick invented game programmer
In contrast platform little use direct hardware addressing emulator PlayStation Vita
In case simple may suffice
This translates system call emulated system system call host system Linux compatibility layer used run closed source Linux native software
For example graphic processor fully programmable game used one program mostly communicated game via therefore many emulator emulate graphic processor simply interpret command received CPU original program would
Developers software often design software especially accurate emulator called trying real hardware
This software produced tested final hardware exists large quantity tested without taking time copy program debugged low level without introducing side effect
In many case simulator actually produced company providing hardware theoretically increase accuracy
Math emulator allow program compiled math instruction run machine installed extra work done CPU may slow system
If math coprocessor installed present CPU CPU executes instruction make determined interrupt coprocessor available calling math emulator routine
When instruction successfully emulated program continues executing
Typically emulator divided correspond roughly emulated computer subsystem
Most often emulator composed following module Buses often emulated either reason performance simplicity virtual peripheral communicate directly CPU memory subsystem
It possible memory subsystem emulation reduced simply array element sized like emulated word however model fall quickly soon location computer logical memory match
This clearly case whenever emulated hardware allows advanced memory management case logic embedded memory emulator made module sometimes integrated CPU simulator
Even emulated computer feature MMU though usually factor break equivalence logical physical memory many architecture offer even often block logical memory mapped mean module must discarded nature ROM emulated
Features may also complicate memory emulation
As result emulator implement least two procedure writing reading logical memory procedure duty map every access correct location correct object
On system memory address address memory rest RAM something along line following procedure would typical The CPU simulator often complicated part emulator
Many emulator written using CPU simulator order concentrate good efficient emulation specific machine
The simplest form CPU simulator computer program follows execution flow emulated program code every machine code instruction encountered executes operation host processor semantically equivalent original instruction
This made possible assigning simulated CPU
The logic simulated CPU le directly translated software algorithm creating software basically mirror original hardware implementation
The following example illustrates CPU simulation accomplished interpreter
In case interrupt every instruction executed though behavior rare real emulator performance reason generally faster use subroutine work interrupt
Interpreters popular computer simulator much simpler implement alternative solution speed adequate emulating computer roughly decade ago modern machine
However speed penalty inherent interpretation problem emulating computer whose processor speed host machine
Until many year ago emulation situation considered completely impractical many
What allowed breaking restriction advance technique
Simple translation emulated program code code runnable host architecture usually impossible several reason Various form dynamic recompilation including popular technique try circumvent problem waiting processor control flow jump location containing untranslated code time translates block code host code executed
The translated code kept original code lost affected way even data segment meaninglessly translated recompiler resulting waste translation time
Speed may desirable older game designed speed faster computer mind
A game designed MHz PC level timer game second might give player second MHz PC
Other program DOS program may even run faster computer
Particularly emulating computer change core system typical software may use technique depend specific characteristic computer ran
CPU speed thus precise control speed emulation important application properly emulated
Most emulator mentioned earlier emulate main device thus often treated special case consistent interface virtual peripheral provided
This result performance advantage since module tailored characteristic emulated device design based standard unified however rival simpler model well additional advantage automatically providing service virtual device used within emulator
A unified API may necessarily mirror structure real hardware bus bus design limited several electric constraint need hardware management mostly ignored software implementation
Even emulator treat device special case usually common basic infrastructure The word emulator coined IBM development NPL product line using new
They discovered using hardware instead software simulation execute program written earlier IBM computer dramatically increased simulation speed
Earlier IBM provided
In addition simulator IBM compatibility feature provided IBM computer program run legacy program written later IBM
This program used instruction added compatibility feature trap instruction requiring special handling instruction ran
The compatibility feature required setting console toggle switch support program
In microcode first used speed simulation process IBM engineer coined term emulator describe concept
In become common use word emulate context software
However emulation referred emulation hardware microcode assist simulation referred pure software emulation
For example computer specially built running program designed another architecture emulator
In contrast simulator could program run PC old Atari game simulated
Purists continue insist distinction currently term emulation often mean complete imitation machine executing binary code simulation often refers computer program used simulate abstract model
Computer simulation used virtually every scientific engineering domain Computer Science exception several project simulating abstract model computer system practically semantically differs network emulation
Logic simulation use computer program simulate operation digital circuit processor
This done digital circuit designed logic equation circuit fabricated hardware
Functional simulation use computer program simulate execution second computer program written symbolic language rather binary
By using functional simulator programmer execute trace selected section source code search programming error bug without generating binary code
This distinct simulating execution binary code software emulation
The first functional simulator written testing assembly language program later execution military computer
This made possible flight program written executed tested computer hardware built
Autonetics also programmed functional simulator testing flight program later execution military computer
Video game console emulator program allow personal computer video game console emulate another video game console
They often used play older video game personal computer contemporary video game console
They also used translate game language modify existing game development process home brew demo creation new game older system
The helped spread console emulator would unavailable sale retail outlet
Examples console emulator released last decade
Terminal emulator software program provide modern computer device interactive access application running operating system host system
Terminals many others longer produced physical device
Instead software running modern operating system simulates dumb terminal able render graphical text element host application send keystroke process command using appropriate terminal protocol
Some terminal emulation application include Rumba
Due popularity emulator impersonated malware
Most emulator video game console like Xbox Xbox One Nintendo etc
Generally emulator make absurd nearly impossible claim able run Xbox one Xbox game one emulator note nearly impossible due architectural difference console novel depicts human interstellar culture relies software written five thousand year Humankind ever left Earth
Its computer still run million million circuitous thread inheritance layer upon layer support
Down bottom culture incredibly complex timekeeping system example little program ran counter
find modify old software written hundred year ago one character state buggy solve modern problem
As computer continued advance emulator developer grew skilled work length time commercial release console successful emulation began shrink
console handhelds saw significant progress toward emulation production
This led effort console manufacturer stop unofficial emulation consistent failure Cir
opposite effect
According legal precedent emulation legal within United States
However unauthorized distribution copyrighted code remains illegal according international copyright law Under United States law obtaining copy original machine legal ruling Cir
long user obtained legally purchased copy machine
To mitigate however several emulator platform capable running without BIOS file using simulate BIOS subroutine slight cost emulation accuracy

I frequently see computer science
These two term seem synonymous
Is difference
Yes concept different
A system behaves something else implemented entirely different way
It provides basic behaviour system may necessarily adhere rule system simulated
It give idea something work
Think flight simulator example
It look feel like flying airplane completely disconnected reality flying plane bend break rule see fit
For example fly Airbus upside London Sydney without breaking
An system behaves something else adheres rule system emulated
It effectively complete replication another system right binary compatible emulated system input output operating different environment environment original emulated system
The rule fixed changed system fails
The system built around premise
All old arcade system long forgotten implemented almost entirely hardware firmware hardware system emulated right original bug crash would occur reached highest possible score
A model constructed something else reproduces thing feature leaf others obviously want preserve feature relevant query leave irrelevant one
For instance simulation commuter traffic leaf commuter name maybe even identity using counter variable rather actual set object disregard rate arrival
running software X created platform A platform B without changing software
This requires building model A run B obviously model everything A involves code execution
In theory could omit support opcodes know particular software wo ever use rare emulator hard work much worthwhile thorough job something reusable kludge work Both mean something job something else
The difference Simulation happens level respect user finalized typically anticipate result reality without touching reality
Emulation happens level purpose replace underlying component another different one respect work old one
In word happen parallel world happens replaced world
Technically something environment act real thing
Conceptually however important difference
A supposed detached real world certain degree output simulation directly connected thing simulates
For example aircraft simulator actually fly pilot actually communicating real air traffic controller
A usually testing predicting process safe environment simulation disconnected real world nothing really bad happen crashed aircraft simulator never kill real people
An contrast goal taking place real thing example emulate simple microcontroller using sophisticated programmable CPU CPU used place original microcontroller physically connected machine actually control machine like microcontroller would
The replace hardware software component functional equivalent original module available become expensive maintain
Emulation also serve goal using hardware flexibly programmable microcontroller double several simpler controller switching emulation mode needed
While etymology strictly accurate think difference sympathy I imagine must feel like empathy I know feel like
A simulation might include visual representation problem might
For example might print column number representing many people lined something total revenue average speed
It characteristic match reality
Emulation often used context one platform pretending another platform far complete
So Windows Phone developer run debug phone apps Windows machine emulator look like phone behaves like one
You run old Commodore game emulator
The word precise
Most flight simulator like emulator opinion name stuck time immersive
Some people reserve word emulator case reject anything else
You probably never thought wrong speaking understand people may place boundary two word little differently make allowance someone say emulation really accurate complete simulation
Both term much similar concept mimicking
Simulation Simulators make use software produce replicated system much similar target model respect underlying core functionality especially basic methodology
Emulators hand focus exterior similarity compared target system
It minimum concern function mimicked
Emulators general used working completely different environment For example different Operating system compared original system

It seems problem whose solution requires finite memory emulated Finite State Machine
This would make problem ca solved Finite State Machine require infinite memory like general multiplication integer
My question infinite memory really mean infinite used completed sense negation finite
To notion infinite memory seems weird
How problem requires infinite memory computable
Can anyone help clarify
Thanks lot advance
The correct distinction
For example consider regular language consisting string even length
The length input unbounded always finite
The memory used machine bounded
In contrast machine accepts language unbounded input also unbounded memory memory usage still much smaller input size particular us finite amount memory
Any machine always halt every input guaranteed use finite amount memory
Only machine never halt use infinite memory even case every step using finite memory limit using infinite memory
For example consider Turing machine ignoring input writes work tape move right repeat
The machine never halt step accessed tape cell
If consider entire infinite computation whole computation us infinitely many memory cell finite time finitely many cell used

In serf element two principal operation The order element come stack give rise alternative name
Additionally operation may give access top without modifying stack
The name stack type structure come analogy set physical item stacked top make easy take item top stack getting item deeper stack may require taking multiple item first
Considered abstractly sequential collection push pop operation occur one end structure referred stack
This make possible implement stack pointer top element
A stack may implemented bounded capacity
If stack full contain enough space accept entity pushed stack considered state
The pop operation remove item top stack
Stacks entered computer science literature used term bury unbury mean calling returning subroutine
Subroutines already implemented proposed idea filed patent March Bauer received invention stack principle
The concept developed independently Australian first half
Stacks often described analogy stack plate cafeteria
Clean plate placed top stack pushing already
When plate removed stack one pop become new top
In many implementation stack operation push pop
An example top stack observes element without removing stack
Since done pop push data essential
An underflow condition occur stack top operation stack empty pop
Also implementation often function return whether stack empty
A stack easily implemented either
What identifies data structure stack either case implementation interface user allowed pop push item onto array linked list helper operation
The following demonstrate implementation using
An array used implement bounded stack follows
The first element usually bottom resulting first element pushed onto stack last element popped
The program must keep track size length stack using variable record number item pushed far therefore pointing place array next element inserted assuming index convention
Thus stack effectively implemented structure The operation add element increment index checking overflow Similarly decrement index checking underflow return item previously top one Using possible implement stack grow shrink much needed
The size stack simply size dynamic array efficient implementation stack since adding item removing item end dynamic array requires amortized O time
Another option implementing stack use
A stack pointer head list perhaps counter keep track size list Pushing popping item happens head list overflow possible implementation unless memory exhausted Some language make stack operation push pop available standard type
Some language notably family including designed around stack directly visible manipulated programmer
The following example manipulating stack Lisp interpreter prompt line starting interpreter response expression Several container type operation LIFO semantics additionally template class adapts existing container provide restricted operation
PHP class
Java library contains class specialization
Following example program language using class
A common use stack architecture level mean allocating accessing memory
A typical stack area computer memory fixed origin variable size
Initially size stack zero
A usually form hardware register point recently referenced location stack stack size zero stack pointer point origin stack
The two operation applicable stack There many variation basic principle stack operation
Every stack fixed location memory begin
As data item added stack stack pointer displaced indicate current extent stack expands away origin
Stack pointer may point origin stack limited range address either origin depending direction stack grows however stack pointer cross origin stack
In word origin stack address stack grows downwards towards address stack pointer must never incremented beyond etc
If pop operation stack cause stack pointer move past origin stack occurs
If push operation cause stack pointer increment decrement beyond maximum extent stack occurs
Some environment rely heavily stack may provide additional operation example Stacks often visualized growing bottom like stack
They may also visualized growing left right topmost becomes rightmost even growing top bottom
The important feature bottom stack fixed position
The illustration section example growth visualization top stack bottom since stack top item pushed popped
A move first element third position second first third second
Here two equivalent visualization process A stack usually represented computer block memory cell bottom fixed location stack pointer holding address current top cell stack
The top bottom terminology used irrespective whether stack actually grows towards lower memory address towards higher memory address
Pushing item stack adjusts stack pointer size item either decrementing incrementing depending direction stack grows memory pointing next cell copy new top item stack area
Depending exact implementation end push operation stack pointer may point next unused location stack may point topmost item stack
If stack point current topmost item stack pointer updated new item pushed onto stack point next available location stack updated new item pushed onto stack
Popping stack simply inverse pushing
The topmost item stack removed stack pointer updated opposite order used push operation
Many design including dedicated register use stack pointer dedicated call return push pop instruction implicitly update dedicated register thus increasing density
Some CISC processor like also typically stack pointer well
In contrast CPU design dedicated stack instruction therefore register may used stack pointer needed
The architecture example set register organised stack direct access individual register relative current top also possible
As machine general implicit argument allows small footprint good usage also prevents type optimization possible processor permitting two three operand
A stack structure also make implementation somewhat complex implement although still feasible exemplified modern implementation
example architecture using within another strategy avoid use slow main memory function argument return value
There also number small microprocessor implement stack directly hardware stack directly accessible
Examples line
Many microprocessor used implement programming language level
Stacks also used basis number mainframe mini computer
Such machine called famous
Calculators employing use stack structure hold value
Expressions represented prefix postfix infix notation conversion one form another may accomplished using stack
Many compiler use stack parsing syntax expression program block etc
translating low level code
Most programming language allowing parsed stack based machine
Another important application stack
Consider simple example finding correct path maze
There series point starting point destination
We start one point
To reach final destination several path
Suppose choose random path
After following certain path realise path chosen wrong
So need find way return beginning path
This done use stack
With help stack remember point reached
This done pushing point stack
In case end wrong path pop last point stack thus return last point continue quest find right path
This called backtracking
The prototypical example backtracking algorithm find vertex graph reached specified starting vertex
Other application backtracking involve searching space represent potential solution optimization problem
technique performing backtracking search without exhaustively searching potential solution space
A number meaning define basic operation adding two number printing character taking argument stack placing return value back stack
For example return stack operand stack also graphic state stack dictionary stack
Many also including
Almost way receive parameter return special stack hold information calling nesting order switch context called function restore caller function calling finish
The function follow runtime protocol caller callee save argument return value stack
Stacks important way supporting nested function call
This type stack used implicitly compiler support CALL RETURN statement equivalent manipulated directly programmer
Some programming language use stack store data local procedure
Space local data item allocated stack procedure entered deallocated procedure exit
The typically implemented way
Using stack data procedure call important security implication see programmer must aware order avoid introducing serious security bug program
Several use stack separate usual function call stack programming language principle organize information
These include Some computing environment use stack way may make vulnerable security breach attack
Programmers working environment must take special care avoid pitfall implementation
For example programming language use common stack store data local called procedure linking information allows procedure return caller
This mean program move data stack contains critical return address procedure call
If data moved wrong location stack oversized data item moved stack location large enough contain return information procedure call may corrupted causing program fail
Malicious party may attempt attack take advantage type implementation providing oversized data input program check length input
Such program may copy data entirety location stack may change return address procedure called
An attacker experiment find specific type data provided program return address current procedure reset point area within stack within data provided attacker turn contains instruction carry unauthorized operation
This type attack variation attack extremely frequent source security breach software mainly popular compiler use shared stack data procedure call verify length data item
Frequently programmer write code verify size data item either oversized undersized data item copied stack security breach may occur

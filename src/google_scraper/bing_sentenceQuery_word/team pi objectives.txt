Making meeting small commitment build trust
Ba must energized intention
Takeuchi The Company summary business technical goal train intends achieve upcoming
During PI planning team create PI objective provide several benefit Note The article explains difference Team PI Objectives provides additional insight usage value
SAFe relies rolling wave commitment Agile team train assist business planning outcome resulting improved alignment trust development business stakeholder
However PI objective confused set fixed inflexible deliverable
But business meaningful planning depends team amount reliable predictable forecasting
Too little ARTs commit anything Too much ARTs never say Neither good increase distrust business development
That significantly hinders business success mention joy work
We need something primary purpose PI objective
In addition alignment process setting realistic objective help avoid much Work Process WIP system
PI objective plan built bottom Agile team estimate identify part solution
They summarized ART part Solution Train shown Figure
During PI planning team review new feature plan story need deliver
In also identify specific team PI objective
Creating team PI objective trivial
It requires reasonable estimating planning velocity analysis upcoming defining finally summarizing information simple business term understood everyone
Figure illustrates example one team PI objective
The team PI objective often relate directly intended feature indeed many
However mapping always straightforward since feature require collaboration multiple team Figure illustrates
Note feature Feature A delivered individual team others Feature B require collaboration
In addition feature input feature team objective appear well
These include technical objective example proof concept Figure enable future feature enhancement development infrastructure
All result process captured affected team objective
Features acceptance criterion excellent tool help understand capture collaborate around work need done easy get caught finishing feature missing overall goal hiding inside
PI objective help shift focus away developing feature achieving desired business outcome
The core question becomes Is goal complete listed feature goal provide outcome desired feature In word could provide value half amount work without building feature would acceptable
A better understanding intent offered direct conversation often result team providing new perspective quickly finding way apply expertise create better solution
help improve predictability delivering business value since included team commitment counted team program predictable measure
However team agree best deliver stretch objective included capacity PI
Since objective might finished PI stakeholder plan accordingly
Stretch objective provide several benefit Typically total allowance stretch objective percent total capacity
And one must constantly keep mind stretch objective used identify variable within scope plan
Team PI objective summary team plan PI
Sometimes cause description fuzzy nonverifiable chunk As countermeasure team make objective SMART As objective finalized PI planning Business Owners collaboratively assign business value team individual objective conversation
The value particular conversation team overstated communicates strategy context behind weighting decision
Business Owners use scale lowest highest
Business value confused measure associated effort total story point associated objective
Business value assigned calculated serf input execution consideration
Many team objective provide direct immediate value solution
Others advance infrastructure development environment quality initiative allow faster creation future business value
All factor must weighed final balance
When objective made smarter stretch objective identified business value established objective Figure might evolve look like Figure
A vote confidence held near end PI planning team commit PI objective
However must reasonable ask people work
Therefore SAFe commitment two part In way stakeholder know either program result achieved planned provided sufficient notice able mitigate take corrective action minimizing business disruption
That good get research development
The result PI planning process number approved objective sheet one per team
Teams vote confidence level objective set confidence high enough aggregate set objective becomes committed ART plan
The summarizes team objective program PI objective format suitable management communication
The summarized objective SMART much like team PI objective stretch objective
Also like team PI objective might business ART working enablers business technical goal
During meeting ARTs planned objective rolled large solution level solution PI objective synthesized summarized
This top level PI objective SAFe communicate stakeholder value stream whole deliver upcoming PI
Figure illustrates summary team program program solution PI objective
It important business value assigned team PI objective
The predictability metric rolled determine predictability higher level
During review team PI objective everything envisioned various business stakeholder likely achieved PI timebox
Therefore current development work WIP need reevaluated Business Owners gain agreement PI objective
Those work item get moved back
Decreasing excess WIP reduces overhead thrashing increase productivity velocity
The net result feasible set PI objective agreed business stakeholder team member well increased efficiency higher probability delivery success
And something everyone able commit
Planning large solution level work similarly planning ARTs impact pushing work back reevaluation later PI

Published I often asked PI Objectives needed feature already determined handed team
Why repeat process something already known
Features built product management team possible input development well business owner
Still development team may complete visibility across feature till PI planning
Often feature maybe big single team handle may split one team
The idea PI objective get revalidation feature assigned also team understanding
Agile merely assigning task team collaborative scope work derived team
While end result might look like simplified summary feature achieving SMART PI objective require team knowledge team velocity competency milestone major refactoring dependency might known emerge team break out
Once PI objective synthesized technical team important understand business value intended work business owner value assignment play role
Now team able get better business understanding sense priority input PI

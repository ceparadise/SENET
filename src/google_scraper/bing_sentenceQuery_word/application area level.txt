The Bachelor Computer Science bachelor computer science degree offered college university
There several bachelor degree computer science program core curriculum Bachelor Computer Science
Other comparable degree include Following trend established field study many university offer degree awarded student exhibit superior academic performance complete additional year study
Not bachelor degree program
Truth known uncommon curriculum coursework vary one school degree
Students carefully review consider computer science program make sure help meet educational career goal
Some common topic addressed bachelor degree computer science program include Algorithms Programming Paradigms Data Structures Information Retrieval Programming Principles Computer Architecture Logic Computation
More course usually associated specialized discipline computer science include interaction information theory data communication theory computation numerical computation operating system compiler computer graphic game design information assurance distributed system artificial intelligence among others

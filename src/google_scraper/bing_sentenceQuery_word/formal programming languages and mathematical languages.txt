In together set rule specific
The formal language set symbol letter token string language may formed
The string formed alphabet called word word belong particular formal language sometimes called
A formal language often defined mean also called
The field study primarily purely aspect internal structural pattern
Formal language theory sprang linguistics way understanding syntactic regularity
In computer science formal language used among others basis defining grammar formalized version subset natural language word language represent concept associated particular meaning
In typically defined formal language defined set formal language limited computational power
In formal language used represent syntax philosophy mathematics reduced syntactic manipulation formal language way
The first formal language thought one used literally meaning concept writing Frege described formal language pure thought
early used rewriting string influential
An context formal language although often make sense use usual sense word generally
The element alphabet called
An alphabet may contain number element however definition formal language theory specify alphabet finite number element result apply
A alphabet finite sequence letter
The set word alphabet Σ usually denoted Σ using
The length word number letter composed
For alphabet one word length often denoted e ε λ even Λ
By one combine two word form new word whose length sum length original word
The result concatenating word empty word original word
In application especially alphabet also known word known break metaphor replaces metaphor
A alphabet Σ Σ set alphabet
Sometimes set word grouped expression whereas rule constraint may formulated creation expression
In computer science mathematics usually deal adjective formal often omitted redundant
While formal language theory usually concern formal language described syntactical rule actual definition concept formal language possibly infinite set string composed given alphabet le
In practice many language described rule
The notion may closer intuitive concept language one described syntactic rule
By abuse definition particular formal language often thought equipped formal grammar describes
The following rule describe formal language alphabet Σ Under rule string string
This formal language express addition addition equality express look like mean
For instance nowhere rule indication mean number zero mean addition
For finite language one explicitly enumerate word
For example describe language b ab cba
The case construction contains word
However even finite alphabet Σ b infinite number word potentially expressed abb ababba aaababbbbaab
Therefore formal language typically infinite describing infinite formal language simple writing b ab cba
Here example formal language Formal language used tool multiple discipline
However formal language theory rarely concern particular language except example mainly concerned study various type formalism describe language
For instance language given Typical question asked formalism include Surprisingly often answer decision problem done extremely expensive characterization expensive
Therefore formal language theory major application area
Formal language may classified based expressive power generative grammar well complexity recognizing
provide good compromise expressivity ease widely used practical application
Certain operation language common
This includes standard set operation union intersection complement
Another class operation application string operation
Examples suppose language common alphabet
Such used investigate class language
A class language closed particular operation operation applied language class always produce language class
For instance known closed union concatenation intersection closed intersection complement
The theory study common closure property language family right
A compiler usually two distinct component
A generated tool like identifies token programming language grammar
expressed simpler formal language usually mean
At basic conceptual level usually generated like attempt decide source program valid belongs programming language compiler built
Of course compiler parse source code usually translate executable format
Because parser usually output answer typically
This used subsequent stage compiler eventually generate containing run directly hardware requires execute
In set expressed formal language
A also called consists formal language together also called
The deductive apparatus may consist set may interpreted valid rule inference set
A formal system used one expression one expression
Although formal language identified formula formal system likewise identified theorem
Two formal system may theorem yet differ significant way formula A may syntactic consequence formula B one another instance
A finite sequence formula may interpreted axiom follows preceding formula sequence
The last sentence sequence theorem formal system
Formal proof useful theorem interpreted true proposition
Formal language entirely syntactic nature may given give meaning element language
For instance mathematical set possible formula particular logic formal language assigns meaning
The study interpretation formal language called
In mathematical logic often done term
In model theory term occur formula interpreted object within fixed compositional interpretation rule determine truth value formula derived interpretation term formula interpretation term formula becomes true

The Formal Semantics Programming Languages provides basic mathematical technique necessary beginning study semantics logic programming language
These technique allow student invent formalize justify rule reason variety programming language
Although treatment elementary several topic covered drawn recent research including vital area concurency
The book contains many exercise ranging simple basic set theory structural operational semantics introduced way define meaning programming language along associated proof technique
Denotational axiomatic semantics illustrated simple language fall proof given equivalence operational denotational semantics soundness relative completeness axiomatic semantics
A proof Godel incompleteness theorem emphasizes impossibility achieving fully complete axiomatic semantics included
It supported appendix providing introduction theory computability based presentation domain theory semantics method proof several functional language treated
The simplest language recursion equation evaluation
This work extended lan guages higher recursive type including treatment eager lazy
Throughout relationship denotational operational semantics stressed proof correspondence operation denotational semantics provided

As software engineer I write lot code industrial product
Relatively complicated stuff class thread design effort also compromise performance
I lot testing I tired testing I got interested formal proof tool Coq Isabelle Could I use one formally prove code done
time I check one tool I walk away unconvinced usable everyday software engineering
Now could I looking Specifically I get impression make one tool work would require huge investment properly define prover object method program consideration
I wonder prover would run steam given size everything would deal
Or maybe I would get rid prover tool seem really well declarative language I wonder would result proven code could used would fast small enough
Also I luxury changing language I work need Java I ca tell bos I going code OXXXml language I prove correctness code Could someone experience formal proof tool comment
Again I would use formal prover tool I think great I impression ivory tower I ca reach lowly ditch PS I also Haskell OCaml get wrong idea I fan declarative language formal proof I trying see I could realistically make useful software engineering Update Since fairly broad let try following specific question example using provers prove correctness industrial program
Would Coq suitable task
If Coq suitable I write program Coq first generate Coq
Could approach handle threading performance optimization
I try give succinct answer question
Please bear mind strictly field research info may
There many tool specifically designed formally prove property Java
However I need make small digression mean prove correctness program
The Java type checker prof formal property Java program namely certain error like adding never occur
I imagine interested much stronger property namely program never enter unwanted state output certain function conforms certain mathematical specification
In short wide gradient proving program correct mean simple security property full proof program fulfills detailed specification
Now I going assume interested proving strong property program
If interested security property program reach certain state general seems best approach
However wish fully specify behavior Java program best bet use specification language language instance
There language specifying behavior C program instance I know
Once specification need prove program conforms specification
For need tool formal understanding specification operational semantics language Java order express namely execution program respect specification
This tool also allow formulate generate proof theorem
Now task specifying proving quite difficult often separated two One tool par code specification generates adequacy theorem
As Frank mentioned example tool
One tool prof theorem automatically interactively
Coq interacts Krakatoa manner powerful automated tool like also used
One minor point theorem much hard proven automated method automatic theorem provers known occasionally soundness bug make le trustworthy
This area Coq shine comparison automatic
If want generate Ocaml code definitely write Coq Gallina first extract code
However Coq terrible generating Java even possible
Can tool handle threading performance issue
Probably performance threading concern best handled specifically designed tool particularly hard problem
I sure I tool recommend though Martin Hofmann project seems interesting
In conclusion formal verification real world Java program large field Coq suitable part task
You find overview example
I would like mention three remarkable application formal verification tool industry real system
Note I little experience topic I learn reading paper
The tool JPF short system verify executable Java bytecode program see
It used detect inconsistency executive software Rover NASA Ames
show use model checking find serious error file system
A system called FiSC applied three file system JFS ReiserFS serious bug found
It Best Paper Award
describes AWS applies formal method product like DynamoDB EBS Internal distributed lock manager
It focus tool
By way Lamport intensively used TLA toolbox
He often give quite complete formal verification TLA proposed well coauthor appendix paper
A formal specification program le program written another programming language
As result specification certainly include bug
The advantage formal verification program specification two separate implementation bug different
But always one common source bug overlooked case often match
Thus formal verification panacea still miss number bug
A disadvantage formal verification impose something like twice implementation cost probably need specialist formal specification need use le experimental tool come wo come cheap
I guess setting test case scaffolding run automatically would better use time
You ask different question
I agree appear formal verification method application common
one realize however lot formal verification principle built compiler determine program correctness
way use modern compiler using much formal verification
You say I tired testing formal verification really substitute testing
way testing
You mention Java
many advanced formal verification method built java verification program called indeed run large codebases
Note turn false positive false negative result need human developer
But note even turning real functional defect generally turn antipatterns avoided code anyway
You make mention particular application industrial
Formal verification practice tends depend particular application
Formal verification technique seem widely used EE prove circuit correctness
microprocessor design
Here example survey formal verification tool EE field
Formal verification possible program written subset designed embedded system

submitted Hey guy first post reddit
I college student double majoring biochem math math I really interested
I getting graph theory recently research idea I trying work flesh
I realized able program would definitely help I begun teaching Java seemed like good starting point far learning programming general
I know lot mathematician use programming I looking recommendation programming language learn Java best suited mathematics research
I realize mathematics incredibly multifaceted field though probably one language cover different branch mathematics
But recommendation would lead right direction would helpful indeed
sidenote Does anyone know potential Java use mathematical research
I still much beginner computer I good grasp
Post comment
Mathematician
Slowly learning want complement OCaml I prove theorem program time
It fun look like I able use work pretty soon better way learn
To learn Coq start For programming theorem proving would benefit one imperative language Matlab count one functional language Haskell ML dialect
I add one nice thing extremely rigorous definition I ca really understand yet distinct actual implementation
This attractive property formal sort thing one main reason I want learn OCaml another ML dialect
There primary math research programming system two notable The former based C robust graph support package interface Sage contrast really extension python go way beyond near constant development
Generically knowing two great start pure math research
If numerical stuff applied math matlab free alternative octave key
I use Matlab time hate everything Octave except price
Perhaps would better latter maybe former Python seems used lot scientific community computation combination library group library like numPy sciPy give access advanced mathematical function tool like complex number etc
Python syntax also easy learn reduces amount low level management would language
That said mean le able optimised fastest running code control finest level I doubt would effect unless huge computation
As others said Haskell also interesting look
It type structure allow complex abstraction though niche language may lack library functionality looking functionality exists well documented
Okay thanks advice
I planning learning Python next anyway next project possibly Haskell
I still ton learn put good track
By library functionality mean catalog mathematical
Like application find indefinite integral sake example
I suppose simply defined library load extra function use
In reality library provide lot advanced functionality need without pain writing low level code needed
For example graphing library may function called give equation plot
This save interface graphic card create window set axis interpolate smooth line point
Libraries bit code already written use
You mentioned working Java thing like would library
There math library simple function like double x
Libraries might exist complex number allow work etc
Different language different library available theory could write functionality language
Java great starting point
How far gotten
What kind program written
If give idea already know I might able point right direction
Im professional I programming since age written simple math program Cython solves python speed issue
You common misunderstanding You think somehow important
All computer language used anything
They capability
Anything Java also Python C Ruby Perl Mathematica whatever
What asking library available kind computation need
But need ask specific question specific goal mind
Why stop
You anything Python C using paper pencil
Just memorize algorithm compute desk
Point language specific advantage disadvantage respect mathematical research
It would foolish choose C explore parameter affect general solution differential equation Mathematica available would foolish use Mathematica run large scale Monte Carlo simulation
Moreover programming language mathematical research like GAP OP really asking
Since like Java Rich Schwartz large collection program written Java might enjoy playing
They web page Some program used prove serious theorem
For example proof every triangle angle le degree periodic billiards path relied heavily program McBilliards discovery unbounded orbit outer billiards began program Billiards King
In research I used Python
Java great math unless going familiarize library extension
The notation also compact trouble type everything
I would recommend Python Haskell want strong general purpose language
There bunch language designed math proof probably better need write general purpose software I experience
Java nice easy think let really play fast loose
At point addition everyone else said probably want think becoming familiar Your choice tool certainly matter varies depending
Here need You want learn especially algebra combinatorics
I highly recommend learning GAP also available part used online cloud
Especially good computational group theory
alternative pay
Student license buck discount prove poor pay full price
Magma faster GAP linear algebra finite field arithmetic pick going cryptography
standard
Use going work particle physic astrophysics
It made CERN
Its us limited physic though decent data mining general
high level language functional programming
Best banging quick solution making graphic running simulation
Good support GPU programming parallel processing type thing
similar Mathematica support object oriented programming little le high level
This industry standard applied math especially engineering good lot thing
Has lot package
Python good choice quick ideation kind like CS version Mathematica
Great library linear algebra including thing I found far compute Smith normal form quickly
Also really good gadget programming science
Learn C numerical work especially simulation
If plan generate bunch data going need go fast
There several occasion another mathematician wrote simulation Python ran find counterexample spent month trying prove something false I come along translate C get overnight show conjecture false
Do guy know Python
Haskell really neat I think used research much interesting merit
A cool idea learn time learning category theory
I know anybody us Java mathematics research
Java software development
I sure certain thing best choice
That ton information helpful
I looking Linux I need go ahead make switch
Learning language seems worthwhile I going get serious research
How long roughly would say took learn assuming learned
About year le tinkering undergrad
The best way mess around fun use solve problem immediately hand
I recommend starting Mathematica really comprehensive documentation easy self teach
Use check homework problem play function explore
Make hobby task labor
Do get book
It toy job
Then specific field working pick whichever language best
I think said graph theory
Mathematica support graph theory limited come end pretty quickly
There pretty great python package graph theory I pick second
Install linux time start learn python already two go hand hand
I almost got Mint installed computer
I keep mind trying force way book proving fruitful I think I need play around get feel Java I move python soon
Python play well linux compiling real easy dual boot
Project Euler one way fun learning new language case know
Check haskell
It syntax way similar pure math notation list comprehension example purely functional language feel bit like math using imperative language like C something
Since already learning Java might interested graph theory
Personally I would recommend sticking Java still learning program
Maple pretty popular Python
MATLAB also commonly used applied mathematician
If want research algebraic graph theory matrix used computation hence Matlab Octave want something free especially sparse matrix handling
Mathematica nice symbolic computation little expensive student
Sage Maple alternative I much experience former free latter Python lot library useful computation science
Java language thing
Fortran typically used program run supercomputer
Mathematician
The three language I used Haskell functional language come easily someone math
The syntax read much like mathematical expression
Octave Matlab modeling AI machine learning need python general scripting OOP Thank guy help nice know people using
It seems main language keep mentioned Python Haskell Matlab Octave
Python seems great general purpose programming addition math Haskell Matlab definitely list I get advanced
Do guy find easier pick language already learned one
I know python us OOP like Java least conceptual level would seem easier learn
Pick proof assistant
Coq
If going look intutionistic type theory I recommend Agda

On wikipedia I found definition formal language In mathematics computer science linguistics formal language set string symbol may constrained rule specific
This look quite abstract
And I ca image language fit definition
Does anyone idea look like fit definition
Let get question first
A good formal language language
English Slovene example
So Tagalog Tarifit Berber
Unfortunately linguist seem definition natural language would agree upon
Noam Chomsky famously tried model natural language using gammars paper
He invented discovered prefer paper although called useful model English language revolutionized computer science
Formally formal language set string finite alphabet
That
Examples include valid C program valid HTML file valid XML file string balanced parenthesis
set code encoding deterministic Turing machine always halt set simple graph colored actually code encoding set binary string end begin etc
Some easy recognize using regex equivalently DFA impossible recognize using DFA recognized using PDA equivalently described grammar admit description recognized Turing machine recognizable even Turing machine called uncomputable
This definition useful
Many thing encounter CS evey day cast term formal language
For good introduction subject I highly recommend superb book Hopcroft et al
English formal language
It set string spoken form evolution time dialect sort thing formal language
A formal language could gain word email one decade next
A language set sequence made given symbol
It either finite infinite set English sentence infinite even though sentence eg excessively long comprehended even native speaker
If finite description formal definition
If language infinite say language arithmetic expression involving number two binary operator variable ca possibly list string belong language sometimes see blazs comment give finite description set rule
E NUM v E E E E NUM sequence digit v variable finite description infinite set
That make formal
The various aspect like speech evolution language different issue
Those also formalised

There many popular language
But computer scientist tell u order understand behaviour program language definitely unambiguously argue upon program behavior
prove identity need translate another well understood language
They call language semantics
Authors propose one many semantics
They explain meaning construction translate language
Once everybody understand program certainly say
Looks good yet I understand something
Do tell u introduce another language understand first one
Why understand better original one
Why semantics better
Why learn semantics C right away instead inventing another language describing semantics C
The applies syntax
Why I ask question regarding syntax
In comment I hear semantics mean another language translation
But Formal Semantics VHDL say understand something one way understand meaning meaning specified supply language mechanism translates another known language
That semantics Relation formal system
Hennessy say semantics allows formal processing program meaning semantics supplied BNF Syntax Diagram
What formal system language
Can I say HW synthesis given HDL program interconnection gate process semantics extraction
We translate description language understand afterwards
Why learn semantics C right away instead inventing another language describing semantics C
Because order define semantics C need kind language example English
English ambiguous especially semantics
The computer science notion semantics generally mathematical description program description exactly translation
There several kind semantics different thing A little sadly universally understanding program semantics neither easy intention
It former well math messy
It latter semantics provide indeed provide common unambiguous description used understand program
If reading semantics much meaningful reading agreeing semantics basic element language important example explain unambiguously C primitive work
In conclusion Do tell u introduce another language understand first one
Technically language math
Also basically programming language even introducing new language would pretty much Why understand better original one
Because math may harder understand way precise complete
The applies syntax
There work verified parser question would mean semantics parser trivial

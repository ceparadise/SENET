A language computing
It common example command language
These language used directly also automate task would normally performed manually command line
They share though command language usually stronger underlying
Command language often either simple grammar close shallow many language

Sometimes referred language used executing series would otherwise executed
A good example command language Windows
Although command language useful executing series command functionality limited available command line make easier learn
Below basic example Microsoft Windows batch file deletes file Windows temp directory
REM Delete Windows temp file
echo Deleting Windows temp file
del
Below basic example script could run Microsoft Windows performs similar task batch file example sophistication
In example script deletes file creates log containing information file deleted
Delete Windows file log result file file sec min hour mday mon year wday yday isdst timeoffset sec min hour mday mon year wday yday isdst localtime year year file c open mylog print ERROR
foreach file file file system del file print Deleting file hour min sec print mylog Deleting file hour min sec close mylog In conclusion script command language similar however script program offer user ability perform much command would otherwise executed prompt


In set rule defines combination symbol considered correctly structured document fragment language
This applies document represents document represents data
The syntax language defines surface form
computer language based sequence character based spatial layout connection symbol may textual graphical
Documents syntactically invalid said
Syntax form contrasted meaning
In processing computer language semantic processing generally come syntactic processing case semantic processing necessary complete syntactic analysis done together
In syntactic analysis comprises semantic analysis comprises middle end phase distinguished
Computer language syntax generally distinguished three level Distinguishing way yield modularity allowing level described processed separately often independently
First lexer turn linear sequence character linear sequence known lexing
Second parser turn linear sequence token hierarchical syntax tree known narrowly speaking
Thirdly contextual analysis resolve name check type
This modularity sometimes possible many language earlier step depends later step example C tokenization depends context
Even case syntactical analysis often seen approximating ideal model
The parsing stage divided two part concrete syntax tree determined grammar generally far detailed practical use AST simplifies usable form
The AST contextual analysis step considered form semantic analysis adding meaning interpretation syntax alternatively informal manual implementation syntactical rule would difficult awkward describe implement formally
The level generally correspond level
Words specified grammar generally given
Phrases CFL generally DCFL specified grammar generally given BNF
Phrase grammar often specified much constrained grammar full order make easier parse parse DCFL linear time simple even simpler efficient parse grammar whose production rule constrained
In principle contextual structure described automatically analyzed mean though general step done manually via rule implemented via store name type scope
Tools written automatically generate lexer lexical specification written regular expression parser phrase grammar written BNF allows one use rather need procedural functional programming
A notable example pair
These automatically produce syntax tree parser writer must manually write code describing converted syntax tree
Contextual analysis also generally implemented manually
Despite existence automatic tool parsing often implemented manually various reason perhaps phrase structure alternative implementation improves performance allows grammar changed easily
Parsers often written functional language Haskell scripting language Python Perl C
As example syntactically valid Lisp program assuming function exists else name resolution fails adding
However following invalid Note lexer unable identify first error know producing token remainder program invalid since word rule begin
The second error detected parsing stage The parser identified list production rule due token match thus give error message general may ambiguous
Type error undeclared variable error sometimes considered syntax error detected usually case compiling language though common classify kind error error instead
As example Python code contains type error add string literal integer literal
Type error kind detected They detected parsing phrase analysis compiler us separate rule allow integerLiteral integerLiteral stringLiteral integerLiteral though likely compiler use parsing rule allows expression form LiteralOrIdentifier LiteralOrIdentifier error detected contextual analysis type checking occurs
In case validation done compiler error detected runtime
In dynamically typed language type determined runtime many type error detected runtime
For example Python code syntactically valid phrase level correctness type b determined runtime variable type Python value
Whereas disagreement whether type error detected compiler called syntax error rather error type error detected program execution time always regarded semantic rather syntax error
The syntax textual programming language usually defined using combination structure structure inductively specify nonterminals symbol
Syntactic category defined rule called specify value belong particular syntactic category
Terminal symbol concrete character string character example syntactically valid program constructed
A language different equivalent grammar equivalent regular expression lexical level different phrase rule generate language
Using broader category grammar LR grammar allow shorter simpler grammar compared restricted category LL grammar may require longer grammar rule
Different equivalent phrase grammar yield different parse tree though underlying language set valid document
Below simple grammar defined using notation regular expression
It describes syntax defines production syntactic category This grammar specifies following Here decimal digit character parenthesis terminal symbol
The following example token sequence grammar The grammar needed specify programming language classified position
The phrase grammar programming language specified using grammar though overall syntax due variable declaration nested scope hence
However exception language phrase grammar
In language like Perl Lisp specification implementation language allows construct execute parsing phase
Furthermore language construct allow programmer alter behavior parser
This combination effectively blur distinction parsing execution make syntax analysis language meaning parsing phase may finish
For example Perl possible execute code parsing using statement Perl function prototype may alter syntactic interpretation possibly even syntactic validity remaining code
Colloquially referred Perl parse Perl code must executed parsing modify grammar strongly even Perl parse Perl undecidable
Similarly Lisp introduced syntax also execute parsing meaning Lisp compiler must entire Lisp system present
In contrast C macro merely string replacement require code execution
The syntax language describes form valid program provide information meaning program result executing program
The meaning given combination symbol handled semantics either
Not syntactically correct program semantically correct
Many syntactically correct program nonetheless per language rule may depending language specification soundness implementation result error translation execution
In case program may exhibit
Even program within language may still meaning intended person wrote
Using example may possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may false The following C language fragment syntactically correct performs operation semantically defined operation meaning As simpler example syntactically valid semantically defined us
Even though compiler programming language Java C would detect uninitialized variable error kind regarded error rather syntax error
To quickly compare syntax various programming language take look list example

In contrast language shield programmer worrying consideration provide notation easily written read programmer
Programming language language programmer writes instruction computer ultimately execute
The earliest programming language assembly language far removed instruction directly executed machine hardware
Users soon A machine language consists numeric code operation particular computer execute directly
The code string binary digit bit frequently converted hexadecimal base human viewing modification
Machine language instruction typically use bit represent operation addition represent operand perhaps location next instruction
Machine language difficult read write since resemble conventional mathematical notation human language code vary computer computer
Assembly language one level machine language
It us short code instruction allows programmer introduce name block memory hold data
One might thus write add pay total instead instruction add two number
Assembly language designed easily translated machine language
Although block data may referred name instead machine address assembly language provide sophisticated mean organizing complex information
Like machine language assembly language requires detailed knowledge internal
It useful detail important programming computer interact printer scanner storage device forth
Algorithmic language designed express mathematical symbolic computation
They express algebraic operation notation similar mathematics allow use subprogram package commonly used operation reuse
They first language
The first important algorithmic language mula slation designed team led John Backus
It intended scientific computation collection organized multidimensional array
Its control structure included conditional IF statement repetitive loop DO loop GOTO statement allowed nonsequential execution program code
FORTRAN made convenient subprogram common mathematical operation built library

A command specific instruction given computer application perform kind task function
In Windows command usually entered via like
Commands must always entered command line interpreter exactly
Entering command incorrectly wrong misspelling etc
could cause command fail worse could execute wrong command right command wrong way creating serious problem
There many different kind command many phrase use word probably actually command
Yes kind confusing
Below popular kind command might encounter Command Prompt command true command
By true command I mean program intended run command line interface case Windows Command Prompt whose action result also produced command line interface
See complete list command detail ever want check without explanation command
DOS command correctly called command might considered purest Microsoft based command since graphical interface command life completely command line world
Do confuse DOS command Command Prompt command
Command Prompt may appear similar true operating system Command Prompt program run within Windows operating system
Both share many command certainly
See interested command available latest version Microsoft DOS
A run command simply name given executable particular program
A run command command strictest sense like shortcut
In fact shortcut live Start Menu Start Screen usually nothing icon representation executable program basically run command picture
For example run command Paint painting drawing program Windows run Run box Search box even Command Prompt Paint obviously command line program
Some example bit confusing
The run command Remote Desktop Connection example run command command line switch make opening program specific parameter easy
However Remote Desktop Connection program designed really command
See article list program executables
Another command see referenced really command Control Panel applet command
A Control Panel applet command really run command control parameter instructing Windows open specific
For example executing open Date Time applet Control Panel directly
Yes execute command Command Prompt Control Panel command line program
See complete list command
Recovery Console command also true command
Recovery Console command available within Recovery Console command line interpreter available troubleshooting problem Windows XP Windows
I also keep detail example command
There error
Please try

In reference specific location used various level
Memory address sequence conventionally displayed manipulated
Such numerical semantic base upon feature CPU incremental well upon use memory like endorsed various
A memory specifically consists many code CPU device use access
Generally
operating system specialized address physical memory using machine code instructing CPU direct hardware device called use separate execute program command
The memory controller consists number line represented bit
The width bus thus number addressable storage unit number bit unit varies among computer
A us memory address execute store retrieve
In early computer logical physical address corresponded since introduction knowledge physical address
Rather address using computer memory mapping see
Most modern computer address identifying single storage data large stored single byte may reside multiple byte occupying sequence consecutive address
There exist computer minimal addressable storage unit exactly processor
For example used bit many used giving word approximately megabyte storage
The efficiency addressing memory depends bit size bus used address bit used address available computer
For example machine
address memory location one memory bus
address location
In contrast machine address bus address location bit equivalent byte KB
Some older computer
For example address identified single six bit digit consisting four numerical bit
The used decimal address theory highest possible address
In practice CPU supported memory location two optional external memory unit could added supporting address total
A size characteristic given
It denotes number digit CPU process one time
Modern processor including embedded system usually word size bit current general purpose computer use bit
Many different size used historically including bit
Very often referring modern computer one also describing size address space computer
For instance computer said also usually allows memory address computer address byte memory GiB
This allows one memory address efficiently stored one word
However always hold true
Computers memory address larger smaller word size
For instance many processor would limited mere memory addressing
The supported addressing via allowing access rather memory
All Intel processor since include PAE support mapping physical address virtual address
In theory modern computer address byte practice amount memory limited CPU design
number physical memory connector amount memory
Each memory location hold
Its interpretation data instruction use determined retrieve manipulate
Some early programmer combined instruction data word way save memory expensive The space word store little bit data processor ignored small section middle word often exploited extra data storage
program treat sometimes data sometimes instruction
generally nowadays make testing maintenance disproportionally difficult saving byte also give incorrect result compiler processor assumption machine still sometimes used deliberately great care
In modern environment usually space chunk memory following type Some part address space may mapped
A computer program access address given programming usually called sometimes known data type language
But program also use specifies location relation somewhere else
There many
Mapping logical address physical virtual memory also add several level indirection see
Many programmer prefer address memory distinction code space data space cf
well physical virtual memory see word numerically identical pointer refer exactly byte RAM
However many early computer support particular machine force program storage completely separate data storage
Many modern three separate storage area program storage coefficient storage data storage
Some commonly used instruction fetch three area simultaneously fewer storage area even total byte storage would make instruction run slower
Early computer use address based combination two number within segment
Some segment implicitly treated dedicated normal
Although usage different segment different reflecting
In segment segment register generally set zero offset variable

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
While studying lot usage phrase like etc
I know term physical address refers actual RAM I clear idea logical address reside
So question Can anyone please explain thing
Well entire point virtual memory
When program run OS make believe memory
That address say empty ready program use
If run two program one get space one access address without interference program
Obviously work OS must perform clever bookkeeping mapping program virtual memory place real memory hard disk
That first program access cell information cell number real memory
It may somewhere else OS responsible converting address first program real address X well virtual address second program real address Y

In also represented form circuitry order enable access storage cell register device
In computer supporting term used mostly differentiate
In particular computer utilizing MMU translate memory address virtual physical address refer address translation performed MMU respectively
Depending upon underlying performance computer may hindered access memory
For example computer memory data bus generally le access aligned even address
In case fetching one value requires single memory read operation single transfer data bus
If data value start odd address processor may need perform two memory read cycle load value
one low address throwing away half second read cycle load high address throwing away half retrieved data
On processor processor unaligned memory access result exception raised usually resulting software exception raised
The DMA feature allows device CPU address main memory
Such device therefore also need knowledge physical address

I reading Operating Systems Concept I chapter
However I could use clarification reassurance understanding correct
Logical Addresses Logical address generated CPU according book
What exactly mean
In address I assume code compiled program program idea code loaded memory
All compiler set general sketch program layout image laid assign real address
When program executed CPU take layout image compiler made hand address logical one one generated code
Physical Addresses The physical address generated CPU generates set logical address consisting base address offset
The logical address go MMU another device somewhere along line logical address mapped physical RAM address
What actual difference
I see one benefit
Using logical address give freedom application
If physical address hard coded program success would depend heavily physical computer machine available RAM address etc
Does use logical address converted physical address impose two step instead one one therefore head
Where logical address reside generation
They may exist register CPU CPU servicing process go
I understand implementation dependent
I assume may stored special register space buffer CPU TLB correct
If table may exist actual RAM CPU hold base address table RAM correct
It seems holding address RAM counter productive purpose logical memory address
I assume understanding incorrect
This answer mean exhaustive may explain enough make thing click
In virtual memory system disconnect logical physical address
An application given virtual address space let say
This usable memory free use see fit
It nice contiguous block memory point view application
However application running OS mediate
Underneath nice contiguous model lot mapping going convert logical physical address
With mapping OS hardware I call lower layer free put application page anywhere want either physical memory swapped secondary storage
When application try access memory logical address lower level translate physical address using translation table
And try access logical memory swapped disk page fault raised lower level bring relevant data back memory whatever address want
In bad old day physical address code relocatable fixed load since could load anywhere
With virtual memory code data logical memory location dozen different process time actual address different however
It even shared one copy exists address space many process
This crux shared code use physical memory need shared memory allow easy communication
It course le efficient pure environment CPU manufacturer try make insanely efficient possible since used heavily
The advantage outweigh disadvantage
logical address address relative programme tell much memory particular process take tell exact location process exact location generated using mapping known physical address Logical address Logical address generated CPU
give problem computer computer pas problem processor logical address seen address called logical address
Physical address processor create process solve problem store data secondary memory address called physical address To best memory physical address explicit set stone address memory logical address consists base pointer offset
The reason basically specified
It allows segmentation program process thread data also dynamic loading program allowance least without actual interlacing instruction memory needing take place
A logical address reference memory location independent current assignment data memory
A physical address absolute address actual location main memory
It chapter Stallings
Logical Vs Physical Address space An address generated CPU commonly refereed Logical Address whereas address seen memory unit one loaded memory address register memory commonly refereed Physical compile time load time address binding generates identical logical physical execution time address binding scheme result differing logical physical address
The set logical address generated program known Logical Address Space whereas set physical address corresponding logical address Physical Address run time mapping virtual address physical address done hardware device known Memory Management case mapping base register known relocation value relocation register added address generated user process time sent understand situation help example If base register contains value attempt user address location dynamically relocated location access location mapped location
The user program never see real physical address space always deal Logical two different type address Logical address range max Physical address range R R value relocation user generates logical address think process run location clear text user program supply logical address logical address must mapped physical address used

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
My professor note system virtualization refer lot term trap seem explicitly define
I ca seem find definition Google either small article
From context I sort understand trapping operation virtual OS performs longer privilege operating restricted mode forwarding hypervisor handled
However could someone solid understanding give better definition
also I apologize poor tagging seem relevant tag virtual system A trap basically localized occurs guest OS required privilege run particular instruction
Operating system running top virtual machine monitor hypervisor know running mode
execute limited set instruction since full control
So operating system executes privileged instruction instruction run mode privileged mode instruction create trap go hypervisor emulates expected functionality OS
Note hypervisor run command emulates application VM application never know running VM

What difference Trap Interrupt
If terminology different different system mean
A exception user process
It caused division zero invalid memory access
It also usual way invoke kernel routine run higher priority user code
Handling synchronous user code suspended continues afterwards
In sense active time code expects trap happen relies fact
An something generated hardware device like hard disk graphic card port etc
These asynchronous
happen predictable place user code passive since interrupt handler wait happen eventually
You also see trap kind interrupt since handler trap handler look like interrupt handler register stack pointer saved context switch execution resume case left
closely related
Traps type exception similar interrupt
Intel defines two overlapping category vectored event v exception class v v
All quote post April version
For definitive complex perspective I recommend reading SDM chapter Interrupt Exception handling
Vectored Events cause processor jump interrupt handler saving much processor state enough execution continue point later
Exceptions interrupt ID called vector determines interrupt handler processor jump
Interrupt handler described within Interrupt Descriptor Table
occur random time execution program response signal hardware
System hardware us interrupt handle event external processor request service peripheral device
Software also generate interrupt executing INT n instruction
occur processor detects error condition executing instruction division zero
The processor detects variety error condition including protection violation page fault internal machine fault
classified depending way reported whether instruction caused exception restarted without loss program task continuity
Summary increment instruction pointer
A exception reported immediately following execution trapping instruction
Traps allow execution program task continued without loss program continuity
The return address trap handler point instruction executed trapping instruction
A exception generally corrected corrected allows program restarted loss continuity
When fault reported processor restores machine state state prior beginning execution faulting instruction
The return address saved content CS EIP register fault handler point faulting instruction rather instruction following faulting instruction
Example A page fault often recoverable
A piece application address space may swapped disk ram
The application trigger page fault try access memory swapped
The kernel pull memory disk ram hand control back application
The application continue left faulting instruction accessing swapped memory time memory access succeed without faulting
An exception always report precise location instruction causing exception allow restart program task caused exception
Aborts used report severe error hardware error inconsistent illegal value system table
Software invoked interrupt triggered INT instruction behave manner
The instruction completes processor save state jump interrupt handler
Generally speaking term like exception fault abort mean thing called Interrupts
Coming difference Trap Interrupt Trap Is programmer initiated expected transfer control special handler routine
For ex instruction good example Where Interrupt Hardware Is program control interruption based external hardware event external CPU For ex Pressing key keyboard time timer chip A special kind commonly referred
An general term cover interrupt hardware device interrupt software
A trap called code like program used call OS routine normally synchronous
An interrupt called event many time hardware like network card received data CPU timer name suggests interrupt normal control flow CPU switch driver routine handle event
An interrupt within system
An interrupt handler summoned deal cause interrupt control returned interrupted context instruction
A trap interrupt
An interrupt used signal completion obviate need device polling
A trap used call operating system routine catch arithmetic error
I think Traps caused execution current instruction thus called synchronous event
interrupt caused independent instruction running processor related external event thus known asynchronous one
Interrupts hardware interrupt trap interrupt
Occurrences hardware interrupt usually disable hardware interrupt true trap
If need disallow hardware interrupt trap served need explicitly clear interrupt flag
And usually interrupt flag computer affect hardware interrupt opposed trap
This mean clearing flag prevent trap
Unlike trap interrupt preserve previous state CPU
A trap software write program declare variable divide zero value treated run program throw error call special version trap program asks o required service
In case interrupt general word hardware interrupt like error cpu interrupted random time course fault hardware brings

A signal informing occurred
When program receives interrupt signal take specified action ignore signal
Interrupt signal cause program suspend temporarily service interrupt
Interrupt signal come variety source
For example every generates interrupt signal
Interrupts also generated indicate event occurred
These called Interrupt signal initiated program called
A software interrupt also called PCs support type software interrupt hardware interrupt
Each type software interrupt associated take control interrupt occurs

Difference Between Things Terms Objects Posted In computer normal execution program could event cause CPU temporarily halt
Events like called interrupt
Interrupts caused either software hardware fault
Hardware interrupt called simply Interrupts software interrupt called Exceptions Traps
An Exception automatically generated software interrupt Trap interrupt initiated programmer
Once interrupt software hardware raised control transferred special subroutine called ISR Interrupt Service Routine handle condition raised interrupt
The term Interrupt usually reserved hardware interrupt They program control interruption caused external hardware event
Here external mean external CPU Hardware interrupt usually come many different source timer chip peripheral device keyboard mouse etc
port serial parallel etc
disk drive CMOS clock expansion card sound card video card etc
That mean hardware interrupt almost never occur due event related executing program
For example event like key press keyboard user internal hardware timer timing raise kind interrupt inform CPU certain device need attention
In situation like CPU stop whatever
pause current program provides service required device get back normal program
When hardware interrupt occur CPU start ISR hardware interrupt disabled
machine
If need hardware interrupt occur ISR running need explicitly clearing interrupt flag instruction
In machine clearing interrupt flag affect hardware interrupt
A Trap identified transfer control initiated programmer
The term Trap used interchangeably term Exception automatically occurring software interrupt
But may argue trap simply special subroutine call
So fall category interrupt
For example machine programmer use instruction initiate trap
Because trap always unconditional control always transferred subroutine associated trap
The exact instruction invokes routine handling trap easily identified explicit instruction used specify trap
Interrupts hardware interrupt trap interrupt
Occurrences hardware interrupt usually disable hardware interrupt true trap
If need disallow hardware interrupt trap served need explicitly clear interrupt flag
And usually interrupt flag computer affect hardware interrupt opposed trap
This mean clearing flag prevent trap
Unlike trap interrupt preserve previous state CPU

program check interrupt normally occur run time error program like Illegal function

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
An interrupt signal device attached computer program within computer requires stop figure next
Almost personal larger computer today start list computer one program perhaps application word processor keep running instruction either A ca go B interrupt signal sensed
After interrupt signal sensed computer either resume running current program begin running another program
Basically single computer perform one computer instruction time
But interrupted take turn program set instruction performs
This known
It allows user number different thing time
The computer simply take turn managing program user start
Of course computer operates speed make seem though user task performed time
The computer operating system good using little pause operation user think time work program
An operating system usually code called
The interrupt handler prioritizes interrupt save one waiting handled
The operating system another little program sometimes called figure program give control next
In general hardware interrupt software interrupt
A hardware interrupt occurs example operation completed reading data computer tape drive
A software interrupt occurs application program terminates request certain service operating system
In personal computer hardware interrupt request value associate particular device

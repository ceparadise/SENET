Assistance assignment obtained number source The scope collaboration deal extent completed work product collaboration
Did collaboration concern single sentence page effort
Or design computer program affected
While scope deal quantity assistance received degree deal quality depth assistance received
Different degree assistance defined include following It important understand difference plagiarism permitted collaboration
Plagiarism defined deliberate copying writing presenting one information idea phrasing another person without proper acknowledgment true source
If one includes work another without proper citation one guilty plagiarism may subject honor system sanction
If one includes work another proper citation use another work permitted completing assignment one submits English paper copied entirety someone else original author properly cited plagiarism work submitted satisfy assignment requirement
Although honor system penalty apply grade assignment may reduced even extent credit given requirement met
The offense plagiarism far serious offense failing meet assignment requirement
Whenever using information idea phrasing another person one work cite original author unless received explicit instruction citing original author unnecessary
Including citation unnecessary harm
Failing include citation necessary get expelled school
The first thing student must working assignment understanding assignment asking
One must understand assignment specification one satisfy
In many course step previous step
Program specification answer question must software creating
That information may specified assignment specification may something determine
With detailed program specification one able determine program output input
Large problem often broken collection interacting problem solved independently
The design solution involves decomposing problem smaller unit defining interaction unit
It many way similar developing outline English paper although much detailed
In beginning programming course program design may performed instructor
Next one must create program code
This typically involves process refinement one begin creating code outline similar outline paper possibly using form
The statement outline progressively made precise evolve actual statement programming language
Code created must entered computer
The programmer must know use basic system command menu option manipulating file use editor enter code file compile link source code executable possibly electronically submit program course instructor
Compilation typically result syntax error must corrected
This step analogous using word processor enter text English paper check correct spelling grammar mistake
Once executable must tested
With testing come discovery bug must removed
With testing correction bug one must step back earlier task process
The resolution bug encountered testing could lead back changing program design one solution component

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
Collaboration joint effort multiple individual work group accomplish task project
Within organization collaboration typically involves ability two people view contribute document content network
In enterprise ability collaborate communicate increasingly becoming essential business application
may encompass use tool corporate public Internet
allows employee work together document data type stored outside company firewall
Employees use platform share edit work together project
Cloud collaboration enables two people work project
Collaboration may case collaborating necessarily communicating working together time
Synchronous collaboration known involves collaborative partner working together simultaneously communication work
ability work various location communicate also quickly becoming something employer employee take granted
People work home traveling site inside outside business hour expect able collaborate coworkers whatever device using
requires platform application support
involves embedding business application word processor enterprise instant messaging shared calendar software unified user interface us enhance collaboration
That approach allows people communicate instantly share resource disposal within application
The purpose make online collaboration simple intuitive working people room enabling capacity people anywhere world

The subfield deal specifically human use computer form support maintain relationship others social us regulate information flow instructional us make decision including major financial political one
It focus common work product rather meeting
By contrast CSC focused output rather character emotional consequence meeting relationship reflecting difference communication collaboration
Unlike communication research focus trust focus CSC focus theory concerned
For instance rely relationship studied part CSC usually part communication
The term CSC emerged replace following term Two different type software sometimes differentiated Base technology could described social collaborative neither
Those say social seem focus say collaborative seem concerned actual output
While software may designed achieve closer social tie specific deliverable hard support collaboration without also enabling relationship form hard support social interaction without kind shared work
Accordingly differentiation social collaborative software may also stated play work
Some theorist hold play ethic apply work must become order make using computer comfortable experience
The study led many conclusion controversial

Communication essential collaboration disruptive studied CSC proper
It somehow hard find draw line process general human communication
Reflecting desired norm directly regulated communication collaboration told apart interaction important collaboration research know stop study work start study people
Tasks undertaken field resemble social science special focus Less ambitiously specific CSC field often studied name reference general field study focusing instead technology minimal attention collaboration implied

Since specialized device exist game conference include usual capability true computer studying separately may justified
There also separate study
The subfield also often stand alone
The development field reach back late visionary assertion others saw potential ultimately redefine work
A early thinker even suggested The inventor computer mouse studied especially way could enable interpersonal communication
worked embodied principle well regarded considered represent future user interface
However time collaboration capability limited
As computer even processor slow expensive idea using simply accelerate augment human communication eccentric many situation
Computers processed number text collaboration general devoted better accurate handling number
This began change rise general use purpose
People clearly collaborating online sort motif using small suite tool support motif
Research time focused textual communication little exchange audio video representation
Some researcher emphasized similar online applied model analysis computer collaboration
Another major focus form focused link application graphic
Such system much simpler early example used
In rise network presented internet mass medium whole generation
By late chat emerged
For first time people used computer communication computing device
This however long anticipated predicted studied expert field
Video collaboration usually studied
Online videoconferencing studied small scale use decade since people simply facility create video together directly properly communication collaboration concern
Other pioneer field included many anyone else shed light group activity

The separate conference deal larger social question basic concern apply system work process design tend still discussed part CSC research
Where decision made based exclusively mostly information received exchanged online people rendezvous signal trust willingness make major decision
Team role function always major focus CSC There software without someone writing
Presumably write must understand something collaboration team
This design code however one form collaborative content
What efficient effective way share information
Can creative network form online system
Can people building content
By late rise simple repository easy public use way applied joint editing meeting agenda become major concern
Different wikis adopted different social pseudopolitical structure combat problem caused conflicting point view differing opinion content
How work made simpler le prone error easier learn
What role diagram notation play improving work output
What word worker come work already understanding misunderstand get using word mean thing
Study core become increasingly important due standard use method

In IT context collaboration situation multiple party converge toward common goal
The term applied technology allows individual group work together
This cover broad spectrum technology including social interactive medium social platform
In IT term may used way fit definition using technology achieve specified goal

In Department Computer Science form collaboration encouraged plagiarism often difficult detect large component student evaluation may derived assignment work
Thus precise statement constitutes acceptable collaboration required
In case instructor define constitutes acceptable collaboration course
What required collaboration one course may considered serious misconduct another
These guideline form default suitable majority course based individual evaluation opposed team evaluation
In event imperative every instructor vocal clear guideline course whether guideline formulated specifically course
If guideline made clear may difficult distinguish honest mistake intentional misconduct
A clear case plagiarism exists student pass someone else work
Examples behavior include limited following These case indisputable plagiarism characterized submission work performed another one name
Collaboration research constitute plagiarism generally encouraged
These effort constitute honest attempt obtaining deeper understanding problem hand
They also serve validation student approach problem
Some example follows Provided plagiarism committed valid encouraged activity
The difference example plagiarism encouraged collaboration originality acknowledgment
In general work submitted without acknowledgment original work indicated author constitutes plagiarism
Some example illustrate point follow
It noted example constitute academic misconduct may questionable academic value
It also noted anyone knowingly negligence contributing someone else academic misconduct also guilty

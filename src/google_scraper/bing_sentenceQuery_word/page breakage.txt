discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

The encoding field
In processor PC incremented fetching instruction hold memory address next instruction would executed
Processors usually fetch instruction sequentially memory control transfer instruction change sequence placing new value PC include branch subroutine call return
A transfer conditional truth assertion let computer follow different sequence different condition branch provides next instruction fetched somewhere else memory
A subroutine call branch save content PC somewhere
A return retrieves saved content PC place back PC typical central processing unit PC digital counter may one many register CPU hardware
The instruction cycle begin fetch CPU place value PC bus send memory
The memory responds sending content location data bus
Following fetch CPU proceeds execution taking action based memory content obtained
At point cycle PC modified next instruction executed different one like processor register PC may bank binary latch one representing one bit value PC
The number bit relates processor architecture instance CPU may use bit able address unit memory
If PC counter may increment pulse applied COUNT UP input CPU may compute value
To identify current instruction PC may combined register identify segment page approach permit PC fewer bit assuming memory unit interest within current vicinity
Use PC normally increment assumes computer execute usually linear sequence instruction PC central von Neumann architecture
Thus programmer write control flow even algorithm sequential
The long instruction word architecture single instruction achieve multiple effect technique predict execution prepare subsequent instruction execution outside regular sequence
The language essentially language virtual machine complex built hardware
In programming programmer may write sequence instruction respond event without specifying overall sequence program dataflow programming programmer may write section computing pipeline without specifying timing relative section

Yeah
I found question whose answer given

Overview PSW A collection information encapsulates basic execution state program instant
It permit interrupted process resume operation interrupt handled
The information held program status register usually contains value program counter bit indicating status various condition ALU overflow carry along information supervisor privileged status
The content processor register may also need preserved memory interruption process recovered interrupted process resumed complete process state reestablished

In linguistics smallest element uttered isolation objective practical meaning
This contrast deeply morpheme smallest unit meaning necessarily stand
A word may consist single morpheme example several whereas morpheme may able stand word word mentioned
A complex word typically include root one affix one root compound
Words put together build larger element language phrase clause sentence
The term may refer spoken word written word sometimes abstract concept behind either
Spoken word made unit sound called phoneme written word symbol called grapheme letter English alphabet

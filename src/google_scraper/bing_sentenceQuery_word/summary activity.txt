Column August Advertisement A group child playground kid clutching slip paper number move along line drawn chalk comparing number go sorting ascending order one ten
Another group child sitting circle pass piece fruit apple orange hand hand color fruit holding match color wearing
It may look like child engaged exercise learning computer science
In first activity turned sorting network strategy computer use sort random number order
And second activity acting process computer network route information intended destination
Both called Computer Science Unplugged endeavor teach student computer science The nature project invite question Why would one want thing
The answer make lot sense
At core field computer science beneath visible trapping hardware software mental discipline known computational thinking
Computational thinking ability understand apply fundamental principle computer network operate
While particular feature product come go bedrock rule remain
Rather talking chip disk ROM RAM write author Computer Science Unplugged want convey feeling real building block computer science represent information computer make computer thing information make work efficiently reliably make people use It grounding computational thinking facility latest feature product foster future success field whether student go become engineer inventor entrepreneur
That powerful rationale teaching computational thinking young people
But problem
In conventional computer science instruction principle accessible learn program
This pose big hurdle especially younger student
Enter Computer Science Unplugged developed New Zealand past two decade
Professors figured teach concept computer science game puzzle magic trick
Taking computer picture time allows child young five learn basic idea undergird computer science
Youngsters tackle topic apparently abstruse algorithm binary number Boolean circuit cryptographic protocol
The activity offered Computer Science Unplugged aimed student kindergarten seventh grade though used student high school even college

AP Otero Younger child might learn finite state automaton sequential set choice following pirate map dashing around playground search fastest route Treasure Island
Older kid learn computer compress text save storage space taking upon compress text book
This done marking repetition word within text crossing word time reappears drawing arrow back first appearance page
Seuss book like compress especially efficiently frequent repetition
Whatever student age prior knowledge Computer Science Unplugged make liberation screen keyboard
It incorporates physical activity asking student move gesture run hunt effort embody computer operation
It employ object crayon string chalk among common item convey abstract entity like data memory
And nurture social interaction among student student teacher
Teachers encouraged allow child discover answer still offering plenty guidance feedback
Ultimately Computer Science Unplugged aim evoke interest subject inspire student regard computer science exciting intellectual adventure
Later course go use actual computer learn program
But student offline introduction computer science may well make interested pursuing subject may increase odds learn later absorbed deep lasting way
Even student go study computer science gained something valuable capacity computational thinking world ever profoundly shaped computer
Indeed computational thinking essential part true computer literacy
Being computer literate mean simply knowing manage word processing program run successful Google search
It include solid understanding principle computer network operate
Even many computer teacher Canterbury academic say often appreciate intellectual richness computer science teach without computer
Among student approach Computer Science Unplugged counter negative preconception subject boring geeky boy
Computer Science Unplugged explicitly designed aim attracting female student field
Unplugging computer science open many felt excluded young student female student student In fact Computer Science Unplugged expanded access even beyond traditional student population include senior citizen example member general public attend science fair festival
With ingenuous enthusiasm Bell Witten Fellows write The subject bursting fascinating idea waiting explored want share people might tuned computer would interested idea computer The three made resource Computer Science Unplugged available free
Their activity translated dozen language used school South Korea United Kingdom
In adoption slower interest growing
The Canterbury researcher note student developing country limited access computer Computer Science Unplugged make possible teach subject
In country access computer nearly universal still need develop power mind sometimes mean turning machine

This course introduce field computer science fundamental computer programming
Introduction Computer Science I specifically designed student prior programming experience taking course require background Computer Science
This course touch upon variety fundamental topic within field Computer Science use Java portable computer programming language developed Sun Microsystems Oracle demonstrate principle
We begin overview course topic well brief history software development
We cover basic programming terminology concept object class inheritance polymorphism well fundamental Java primitive data type relational operator control statement exception handling file input
By end course strong understanding fundamental Computer Science Java programming language
This course lay groundwork strong educational Computer Science successful career devoted implementing principle learn progress CS discipline
We begin course identifying motivation learning fundamental programming concept learning history programming language general
We discus hardware physical device make computer software Operating Systems application run computer computer
We conclude brief discussion Java programming language use throughout rest course
By end unit strong understanding history programming well prepared learn programming concept greater detail
Java programming language
Since programming OO currently one popular programming paradigm need learn fundamental concept order build career Computer Science
This unit begin discussion make OO programming unique advantage made paradigm newly designed program
We discus fundamental concept OO relate back Java
By end unit strong understanding programming relates Java employed
Now basic understanding OO programming move fundamental concept programming language studying semester Java
The concept learn unit many case directly transferable number language
We begin learning Hello World basic software application simply print Hello World In unit discus relational logical operator Java provide foundation topic like control structure discus Unit
In unit start taking look operator notation
We discus relational operator apply numeric operand object operand concluding unit introduction logical operator
By end unit able perform comparison logic function Java fundamental understanding employed
Control structure dictate behavior program circumstance
Control structure belong one two family test value determine code executed based value loop performing identical operation multiple time
Control structure like switch program behave differently based data fed
The loop allow repeat block code often needed
As see functionality useful designing complex program
This unit introduce control structure way used moving discus switch loop
We also discus advanced topic nesting scope
By end unit able draw information learned previous unit create control structure allow create complex useful program
In addition method predefined Java write method
In unit discus name method declare parameter list specify return type
This unit introduces scope variable well
By end unit strong understanding define call method
This unit discus Arrays
An Array data structure allows element data type stored
Each array element unique index associated value store
Arrays commonly used loop structure loop
In addition unit introduces array application
In unit discus two important programming concept Java input output well exception handling
Input output technique allow programmer design complex useful program
For reason must fully understand use programming language functionality
In unit discus function Java moving file writing reading data file
Each unit contain discussion applicable Java class part standard programming language FileWriter PrintWriter FileReader BufferedReader IOException
We identify common pitfall design concept keep mind programmer
By end unit strong understanding write read file write Java program performs function
Exception handling mechanism allows program continue executing even error occurs program instead terminating abruptly

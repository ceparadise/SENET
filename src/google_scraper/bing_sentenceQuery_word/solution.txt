Computer science often difficult define
This probably due unfortunate use word computer name
As perhaps aware computer science simply study computer
Although computer play important supporting role tool discipline
Computer science study problem solution come process
Given problem computer scientist goal develop list instruction solving instance problem might arise
Algorithms finite process followed solve problem
Algorithms solution
Computer science thought study algorithm
However must careful include fact problem may solution
Although proving statement beyond scope text fact problem solved important study computer science
We fully define computer science including type problem stating computer science study solution problem well study problem solution
It also common include word describing problem solution
We say problem computable algorithm exists solving
An alternative definition computer science say computer science study problem computable study existence nonexistence algorithm
In case note word computer come
Solutions considered independent machine
Computer science pertains process also study
Abstraction allows u view problem solution way separate logical physical perspective
The basic idea familiar u common example
Consider automobile may driven school work today
As driver user car certain interaction take place order utilize car intended purpose
You get insert key start car shift brake accelerate steer order drive
From abstraction point view say seeing logical perspective automobile
You using function provided car designer purpose transporting one location another
These function sometimes also referred
On hand mechanic must repair automobile take different point view
She know drive must know detail necessary carry function take granted
She need understand engine work transmission shift gear temperature controlled
This known physical perspective detail take place The thing happens use computer
Most people use computer write document send receive email surf web play music store image play game without knowledge detail take place allow type application work
They view computer logical user perspective
Computer scientist programmer technology support staff system administrator take different view computer
They must know detail operating system work network protocol configured code various script control function
They must able control detail user simply assumes
The common point example user abstraction sometimes also called client need know detail long user aware way interface work
This interface way user communicate underlying complexity implementation
As another example abstraction consider Python module
Once import module perform computation This example
We necessarily know square root calculated know function called use
If perform import correctly assume function provide u correct result
We know someone implemented solution square root problem need know use
This sometimes referred black box view process
We simply describe interface name function needed parameter returned

What problem
Why important topic computer science
stand time
This mean problem solved Polynomial time using Turing machine like regular Turing machine also including choice function
Basically solution poly time
If case known NP problem solved using given problem modified input NP problem given problem problem NP complete
The main thing take away problem solved polynomial time known way
way showing certain class problem solvable realistic time
Edit As others noted often approximation solution problem
In case approximation solution usually give approximation bound using special notation tell u close approximation
NP set question answer polynomial time O n problem size constant
Polynomial time sometimes used definition
P set decision problem
Since solved polynomial time also verified polynomial time
Therefore P subset NP
A problem x NP also every problem NP quickly ie
polynomial time transformed x
In word So make interesting one problem solved quickly problem solved quickly
See also post problem least hard hardest problem NP
Note problem also
However problem NP even decision problem despite prefix
That NP mean
Yes confusing usage entrenched unlikely change
mean something specific careful get definition wrong
First NP problem problem A problem X If X deterministic algorithm exists solve instance X correctly problem NP solved reduction X
So far nobody come deterministic algorithm nobody proven one exist million buck anyone either
That mean ca solve particular instance problem
It mean ca something work reliably instance problem way could reliably sort list integer
You might well able come algorithm work well practical instance problem
If looking example problem I suggest take look
The basic premise expression way saying series expression joined ORs must true The problem find solution satisfy expression exactly booleans match A solution one might
However algorithm discovered solve problem general case polynomial time
What mean best way solve problem essentially brute force try different combination find one work
What special problem ANY problem reduced problem
This mean find algorithm solve problem get mention respect admiration computer scientist mathematician around world
class problem
The class consists problem solvable
For example could solved O n constant k size input
Simply put write program run time
The class consists problem polynomial time
That given potential solution could check given solution correct polynomial time
Some example Boolean Satisfiability problem problem
There many problem known class NP
mean problem hard problem NP
It important computer science proven problem NP another problem
That mean solution one problem solution NP problem
Many algorithm security depends fact known solution exist NP hard problem
It would definitely significant impact computing solution found
Basically world problem categorized Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Unsolvable Problem Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Intractable Problem Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The first one solution problem
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The second need exponential time O n
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The third called NP
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The fourth easy problem
P refers solution problem Polynomial Time
NP refers Polynomial Time yet find solution
We sure Polynomial Time solution provide solution solution verified Polynomial Time
NP Complete refers Polynomial Time still yet find solution verified Polynomial Time
The problem NPC NP difficult problem prove P solution NPC problem NP problem found P solution
NP Hard refers Polynomial Time yet find solution sure able verified Polynomial Time
NP Hard problem surpasses NPC difficulty
It class problem must simulate every possibility sure optimal solution
There lot good heuristic problem educated guess best
Honestly might best place look answer
If NP P solve hard problem much faster thought could
If solve one problem P polynomial time applied problem category
We need separate algorithm problem
We write algorithm solve problem scale certain way
Although simplification let label algorithm scaling good enough
It helpful know thing problem trying solve rather algorithm use solve
So say problem algorithm P
And one algorithm NP
That mean lot simple problem NP write bad algorithm solve easy problem
It would good know problem NP really tricky one want say one found good algorithm
After I could come problem call X I think need algorithm
I tell world best algorithm I could come solve X scale badly I think X really tough problem
But tomorrow maybe somebody cleverer invents algorithm solves X So good definition hard problem
All lot problem NP nobody know good algorithm
So I could X certain sort problem one good algorithm solve X could used roundabout way give good algorithm problem NP
Well people might bit convinced X genuinely tricky problem
And case call X
There good explains problem
The first minute mainly boolean algebra
So jump right beginning minute interested concept P NP boolean satisfiability problem reduction
The definition NP complete problem correct I thought I might wax lyrical philosophical importance nobody addressed issue yet
Almost complex problem come NP Complete
There something fundamental class seems computationally different easily solvable problem
They sort flavour hard recognise
This basically mean moderately complex algorithm impossible solve exactly scheduling optimising packing covering etc
But lost problem encounter NP Complete
There vast technical field people study approximation algorithm give guarantee close solution NP complete problem
Some incredibly strong guarantee example get guarantee really obvious algorithm
Even better reality strong heuristic excel giving great answer guarantee
problem
Note two famous problem graph isomorphism factoring known P NP
I heard explanation probably one enigmatic idea study algorithm
NP stand nondeterministic polynomial time name called complexity class problem belong
The important thing complexity class problem within class polynomial time algorithm
As example consider problem counting stuff
Suppose bunch apple table
The problem How many apple
You provided possible answer
You verify answer polynomial time using algorithm duh counting apple
Counting apple happens O n notation time take one step count apple
For n apple need n step
This problem NP complexity class
A problem classified shown polynomial time
Without going deeply discussion suffice say certain problem polynomial time solution found
That take something like n
n factorial step solve
However given solution problem verify polynomial time
A classic example problem The Traveling Salesman Problem
The author ApoxyButt From problem set problem reduced polynomial time whose solution may still verified polynomial time
That NP problem transformed problem
Informally problem NP problem least tough problem NP
Decision Problem A called NP complete following two property Some Ex NP problem one computer algorithm verifies solution created polynomial time
problem NP also solve polynomial time called P NP problem So get crackin

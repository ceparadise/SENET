fastThread universal thread dump analyser
It par complex thread dump present insightful metric beautiful graph
Following great diagram posted
It well illustrates API call would cause thread move state
STATE DIAGRAM Java Thread state As one diagram equal thousand word go thousand word
Diagram excerpt thread dump
Red color highlight indicates section thread dump mean Click diagram enlarge see
Anatomy Thread Dump Following key thing I would looking thread dump Total number threa count reported Thread dump
If many thread expected count concern
Too many thread cab result unable create new native
If CPU consumption quite high I would grep string
As would show thread executing
running thread dump captured
Note many thread RUNNABLE state cause surge CPU
Then stack trace RUNNABLE state studied see optimized
I look repeating stack trace among thread
If stack trace appears across multiple thread concern
good tool group together thread stack trace thread dump
Below excerpt sample thread dump thread similar stack trace From stack trace infer thread blocked waiting lock object
thread waiting obtain lock object
definitely bad sign
clear indication thread starvation
Now need figure holding lock
I grep string
It show acquired lock got stuck waiting response database
Thus thread stuck waiting
daemon runnable So bottom line always look repeating stack trace Modern thread dump become smarter
If application experience dead lock going see message reported thread dump
Also thread causing deadlock also get reported
Here sample highly recommended capture two thread dump interval second
Please refer section document
I compare thread RUNNABLE state first thread dump thread RUNNABLE state second thread dump
If thread RUNNABLE state thread dump YELLOW flag
warning
Then I start compare stack trace
happen working method confirmed problem
It indicates particular thread looping infinitely method
Even one single thread loop infinitely would cause spike CPU utilization
When multiple thread try access get put APIs concurrently would cause thread go infinite looping
This problem happen always rarely happens
Here detailed blog describes problem
If thread dump see get put API indicative HashMap causing CPU spike
To fix problem replace HashMap ConcurrentHashMap
Below excerpt thread dump indicates infinite looping happening HashMap More information read blog Thread Dump searching thread state thread
Its basically analyzing thread
It useful application hang wanted know thread occurring issue
Still question
Ask

A memory dump process content memory displayed stored case application system crash
Memory dump help software developer system administrator diagnose identify resolve problem led application system failure
Memory dump also known core dump blue screen death BSOD computer
Memory dump primarily identifies problem error within operating system installed application within system
Typically memory dump provides information last state program application system terminated crashed
This information consists memory location program counter program state related detail
It displayed also creates system log file later
After memory dump computer generally unavailable inaccessible rebooted
Memory dump also caused memory leak system memory longer continue operation

I trying setup script take copy database one server another
Thanks post I found way
But I need change name database copy
I thought using sed simple text replace
But I worried could corrupt database
Does one know proper way
Just restore different database
For dump custom format For dump created option If streaming dump remote host omit dump data coming stdin
You ca easily command restore need connect different DB like order create new DB
So example might Note omission flag
The first command longhand way writing
If stuck created flag indeed dump long extremely careful
There four line one comment start file refer database name
For database name regress dumped Pg This transformed quite safely three four want rewrite comment specific command
Do global find replace database name though
This last resort much better dump without

Dump
This one word I heard among hardcore programmer hacker yet I never knew mean
I found almost everywhere center around software digital hardware
They say something like dumping file dump CPU dump memory
What feat usually performed
A data taken storage medium
unedited
For example content recorded state core specified time
In Unix software backup file system
In essence dump content taken storage medium contains state medium used mostly debugging purpose
In programming dump something mean get content
For example one say mean query content memory given address store somewhere analysis result called
In computing core dump properly memory dump storage dump consists recorded state working memory computer program specific time generally program terminated abnormally crashed
The name come day magnetic core memory used introduction semiconductor memory name remained established system inspired UNIX long technology faded use
In practice key piece
In large meaning represents state running program process medium storage

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
A core dump printing copying permanent medium content random access memory one moment time
One think snapshot RAM
A core dump taken mainly purpose debugging program
With arrival language interactive debugging problem require core dump day
It likely used specialized programmer maintain occasionally debug problem The core refers ferrite core earlier memory technology
In earlier operating system certain system error would automatically result performing core dump
Typically core dump actually report result core dump present RAM content formatted series line indicate memory location value recorded location
Additional information tell exactly instruction executing time core dump initiated
IBM dictionary include term Microsoft mention antiquated term

In system particular point time
The term coined analogy
It refer state system capability provided certain system
A full large data set may take long time complete
On may writes data backed
This prevents backup introduces may result
For example user move file directory already backed file would completely missing since backup operation already taken place addition file
Version skew may also cause corruption file change size content underfoot read
One safely backing live data temporarily disable write access data backup either stopping accessing application using provided operating system enforce exclusive read access
This tolerable system desktop computer small workgroup server regular acceptable
system however bear service stoppage
To avoid downtime system may instead perform backup copy data set frozen allow application continue writing data
Most snapshot implementation efficient create snapshot
In word time needed create snapshot increase size data set contrast time required direct backup proportional size data set
In system initial snapshot taken data set subsequent snapshot copy changed data use system pointer reference initial snapshot
This method snapshot consumes le disk capacity data set repeatedly cloned
Some Unix system
These implement entire copying changed overwritten within parent storage thus preserving past image block device
Filesystems snapshot image later mounted medium
Some volume manager also allow creation snapshot extending approach disassociating block modified within snapshot parent block original volume
Such scheme could also described performing additional operation triggered writes snapshot
On Linux LVM allows creation snapshot
Writable snapshot introduced LVM version
Some file system internally track old version file make snapshot available special
Others like provide operating system accessing file history
In access snapshot provided Volume Service VSS
provides snapshot via VSS interface shared storage
Snapshots also available NSS file system since version recently platform product
EMC Isilon OneFS clustered storage platform implement single scalable file system support snapshot file directory level
Any file directory within file system snapshotted system implement snapshot dynamically based method determined optimal system
On Linux file system support creating snapshot cloning individual file
Additionally Btrfs also support creation snapshot subvolumes
On AIX also support snapshot
hybrid implementation track snapshot block level make branched file set nameable user application clone
included snapshotting scheme incremental backup service merely watch mounted volume change copy changed file periodically volume using

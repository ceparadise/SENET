Modern society seen significant shift user computer technology usage expert professional user base
Initially computer quite costly degree human aid needed efficient part professional computer operator
As computer adoption became widespread affordable le human assistance needed common usage
Despite short history formal academic discipline computer science made number fundamental contribution science fact along founding science current epoch human history called driver seen third major leap human technological progress CE BC
These contribution include Although first proposed term computer science appears article Louis Fein argues creation analogous creation justifying name arguing like subject applied interdisciplinary nature characteristic typical academic discipline
His effort others rewarded university went create program starting Purdue
Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested

In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate



How teach kid programming computer science much learning code
Most people quit
Here idea link help answer question
In past year I published magazine first year common question people asked Where I child begin learn code Or How I teach kid programming computer science My answer variation It It depends whether child adult parent teacher
It also depends learning code answer
Learning comfortable technology learning technology work learning technology help hurt u individually society answer question Where I begin learn code Writing publishing magazine taught vast majority people start coding quit
They get bored
Or coding hard
Or coding really fit thing
For example coding requires lot problem solving skill turn requires balance rigid step step process intuition based experience
Not everybody like combination
From start magazine published article based guideline developed Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA If learn lot topic give coding never learn code understand technology work technology appropriate
If learn code terrific
However learning code helpful required technology literate
With prologue specific answer question Where I begin learn code If kid year old especially younger sibling might want start game toy teach programming concept
For example Robot Turtles great board game neat extension like online community create game board
These game sometimes let replace object direct game person like child parent adding another level fun engagement
In style Move Turtle phone application let kid basic programming
Kids adult give direction move turtle make turtle thing
Each step corresponds programming activity specify action detail action example move action forward way screen detail action
There also robot like KIBO robot developed Tufts University geared kid age
KIBO Kickstarter looking mass market technology
Kids almost age also might appreciate Computer Science Unplugged computational thinking project
Like board game project teach computer science programming concept without computer
If kid comfortable game like Robot Turtles CS Unplugged activity might try next project coding aspect
Robots like Sphero make easy direct cute little robot ball around room graduate programming robot
Computational thinking project also project basic programming Python useful advanced project
From simple use coding kid also gravitate programming language geared towards kid education language like Python
For example least one ebook online teach basic Python kid
They learn small bit language importantly learn programming concept
Languages geared towards kid tend use Logo language kid enter basic direction avatar often turtle follows direction screen use block language like Scratch Alice Tynker several others
These language make easy kid focus language le specific syntax
In contrast adult use programming language syntax structure critical bit code slightly le important
When kid might start beginning board game programmable robot language geared towards education
But also might dive language like PHP Python JavaScript part reading online finding neat project trying replicate project computer
They also might love game learn modify game get coding
I used web browser View Source menu example learn HTML CSS JavaScript million people year ago
Technology everywhere number way older kid latch learn
While parent might mixed feeling kid lost hour video game game lead programming
Minecraft put Raspberry Pi computer designed help kid get hardware software project
Skyrim game make somewhat easy older kid research code modification make game even fun
I also highly recommend find local programming group like Coder Dojo kid adult work together computing project
It structured way relax fun technology engaging people
Technology social activity strictly solo
You also learn sharing debating
And I would encourage parent kid look online resource geared towards teacher teach computer science programming
Often resource like Minecraft Education parent use get kid started kid explore
Bottomline though true subject important start kid adult place find comfortable provide tool explore find way
Programming computer science fascinating absorbing
But discover
A teacher parent ca force enthralled concept making computer something
What I found interesting publishing magazine many teacher want learn programming computer science much student
There lot energy fun ingenuity going teaching computer science coding classroom
Even better fad
Teachers get connection math taught kid generation example math used computing
Teachers also get need guideline online behavior another critical skill want technology literate
What applies kid adult also applies teacher many option learn computer programming computer science
It important holistic focus strictly learning skill
It important kid well rounded view technology love gadget healthy respect work might might fit society
While teacher might enjoy board game Robot Turtles might work great kindergarten first grade classroom Computer Science Unplugged project project geared towards time constraint classroom well laser focus one topic project
If student graduate programming tool like Scratch Alice Tynker Codea Minecraft like great kid project within single class period period time
There many resource online help distill programming language education project kid handle easily
Finally Skype classroom great example technology teacher kid use connect teacher classroom
You learn programming necessarily
But teacher student expand horizon learn lot world engage people would never meet otherwise
As I noted start biggest lesson learned first year publishing magazine coding answer
The answer exposure technology computer science programming
Most people never code
Yet learn enough programming realize phone tablet computer device magical
They tool created human being like
And tool limitation benefit
Tools extremely fun use
It also true group charged creating programming computer science curriculum treat programming one aspect curriculum
While lot hype outside classroom everyone must learn code people charged creating curriculum student take holistic broader view
I want thank reader subscriber great first year publishing magazine
I started Help Kids Code way explore computer science coding meet write people really neat stuff
It fun ride
I look forward second year

From cell phone alarm wake tablet used chat friend complete homework today student surrounded computer technology
It ubiquitous critical daily routine
Yet understand technology work even becomes ever intrinsic solve business community challenge
Today computer science help retailer determine grow sale ensures law enforcement officer right place maintain public safety
It foundation smart grid fuel personalized medicine initiative optimize outcome minimize treatment side effect
Computing algorithm help organization industry solve problem new effective way
According Bureau Labor Statistics million new computer science job
However current professional university student computer scientist trained fill role
Since take many year create computer scientist since computer science skill becoming increasingly integral job industry skill gap track emerge formidable economic security social justice challenge next year
Teachers school parent industry must act multiple front address student readiness expand access computer science curriculum opportunity help foster interest computer science ensure becomes core component every child education
Even though computer science skill becoming increasingly important competitive global economy significant roadblock prevent school incorporating computer science curriculum exposing student subject
Currently school make computer science available student
According College Board percent school offered AP computer science exam
This lack course offering compounded fact significant lack teacher qualified engage student computer science deep knowledge topic often take job industry lack student interest taking advanced course least partly due misconception computing expert boring male always front computer
Overall student engagement number low even relative STEM field female minority student particular vastly underrepresented existing computer science course
Of student took AP computer science exam fewer percent female three percent African American approximately eight percent Hispanic according College Board
These issue stunt expansion computer science prevent student gaining basic technology literacy imperative future worker field
Communities school industry must work together integrate computer science school young age help encourage diversity field ensure student ethnicity gender socioeconomic background opportunity learn skill
While comprehensive plan needed incorporate computer science education school ensure student prepared job tomorrow five simple step teacher school parent industry take today integrate computer science classroom begin overcome challenge Teachers register online teacher training course learn teach computer science curriculum integrate basic computer science principle existing lesson plan
Parents teacher school educate student career opportunity available get computer science degree
While could mean working technology giant like Apple Oracle student also use computer science skill advance healthcare research help build case government funding
Teachers offer student extra credit using free online learning tool develop basic computer science skill create project
A good place start
Industry school formalize mentorship program encourage support student learn computer science develop skill inside outside classroom via program lesson
Parents help kid develop confidence ability explore computer science action life community coding apps younger child high school student
Students parent educator industry vested interest better integrating computer science experience
Our economic stability national security depend population solid computer science skill coding literacy
As future education must focus making computer science integral part every child education ensure student gender background chance pursue opportunity
How school teach computer science
Sure site

A group nonprofit educator want student even kindergartner know fundamental
More job knowledge computer work
Not start one surf web actually run simplest series input lead series particular output
Yet across United States child taught even
It discipline left largely YouTube watcher kid lucky enough born family resource
According Google Gallup half student attend school offer dedicated class
Black student le likely white peer access course teacher parent likely tell boy would good computer science girl
That technical worker company like Google Apple Facebook white male surprise
But group nonprofit educator tech company state district want change
And year work carefully crafted yet adaptable framework education look like grade level went live week
The writer hope help state craft standard ultimately bring subject classroom across country
The response history inequity computer science said Pat Yongpradit chief academic officer one organization steering initiative
People different motivation participating
Some wanted make sure state strong pipeline worker fill local tech job
Others think basic coding reading writing skillset American student need posse
And still others hope creating framework help roll back mindset computer science select begin diversify largely white male space
Yongpradit see computer science literacy modern Right many people use dating apps idea algorithm could literally help meet future spouse work pointed
It hard understand talk around mean without basic understanding server added
Equipping young people fundamental understanding computer science provide richer experience citizen modern age said
According group involved first time people across spectrum come together broad task
Perhaps contrary discipline teacher exactly clamoring someone tell teach educator background computer science state district seem welcoming input
Mark Saunders director Office Technology Virtual Learning Virginia Department Education one handful state actively working develop standard
The state plan use framework basis standard
It bigger preparing student potential job Saunders said
At core computer science computational thinking computational thinking algorithmic process key skill every student use lot different profession everyday And framework help state teacher particularly elementary level computer science likely integrated day framed class think teach concept
Most concept even require computer learn early stage said Rebecca Dovi director education Virginia nonprofit CodeVA work teacher student improve education
At recent camp Dovi whose group reviewed framework said team worked programming concept essentially hinge cheer routine group young girl planning fun
On piece paper girl drew symbol describe different movement
Two line clap
A dot foot stomp
Then learned could use symbol describe routine paper
That algorithmic Dovi said necessarily needing States nonprofit like Dovi working train teacher teach computer science
But general acknowledgement lack savvy among asked teach subject state work standard curriculum present significant hurdle
I think low supply right Saunders said
While number state including Virginia nonprofit provide teacher training existing teacher still pathway state certification teacher
Yongpradit pointed new teacher come prepared teach computer science pipeline still sparse
There also acknowledged challenge losing teacher highly qualified teach computer science tech industry salary often higher
Some district offer signing bonus certain teacher generally pretty small
But Leigh Ann DeLyser national director education research characterized idea teacher likely leave classroom teacher complete And last six month said around teacher city trained teach basic computer science
One trickier challenge getting parent broadly community board idea computer science everyone
For many year education broadly codified AP course level
There assumption DeLyser said student special smarter She hope framework help change
But work
According survey whopping percent parent say see computer science good use resource percent told teacher school official feel way
And parent often cite lack interest subject key reason woman underrepresented computer science yet perhaps unconsciously le likely tell girl would good
Saunders Virginia Education Department also said counselor may likely think student high math aptitude succeed computer science think limited view
Sepi Hejazi Moghadam head research development education Google support new framework find mindset concerning mask fact real difference access encouragement school home creating gap
It kind suggesting higher representation motivated said
Moghadam think school principal beginning look incorporating computational skill lesson though hope framework accelerate pace
That framework developed something minor miracle given writer hundred people periphery offering different opinion
They always agree
DeLyser one framework writer said instance technical thing routing protocol included early simplified pointed minute detail necessarily thing every child need know
But framework computer science maybe moment emphasis maybe even people want desperately happen say early tell
Last year every student opportunity learn computer science
He called federal government approve funding state make goal reality
The nation new education law name computer science core subject writing
And last several year Yongpradit said definitely wave activity federal state Arkansas Indiana Florida made major push level major city like New York Chicago
California toward standard
So Virginia South Carolina Washington state
What designing necessarily ideal
Activists think state focused cranking programmer instead teaching every student think computationally
But ultimately said Dovi CodeVA framework chance show teacher introduce every child every grade level computer science
We really beautiful opportunity really disrupt inequity place said
That hope draw student select conversation lesson big data cybersecurity privacy critical issue today child grapple adult

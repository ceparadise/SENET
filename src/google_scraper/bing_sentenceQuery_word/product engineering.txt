Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device

Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone

That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver

Software engineer work business government agency civilian military organization
Some software engineer work
Some organization specialist perform task
Other organization require software engineer many
In large project people may specialize one role
In small project people may fill several role time
Specializations include industry academia
Most software engineer programmer work hour week percent software engineer percent programmer worked hour week
Injuries occupation rare
However like worker spend long period front computer terminal typing keyboard engineer programmer susceptible eyestrain back discomfort hand wrist problem
The field future look bright according rated Software Engineer best job United States
In software engineering ranked best job United States time
The offer certification specific topic like process improvement
company also sponsor certification examination
Many program oriented toward specific technology managed vendor technology
These certification program tailored institution would employ people use technology
Broader certification general software engineering skill available various professional society
As certified software professional CSDP
In added certification known Certified Software Development Associate CSDA
The professional certification program early discontinued due lack interest
The ACM examined possibility professional certification software engineer late eventually decided certification inappropriate professional industrial practice software engineering
In developed legally recognized professional certification called available fully qualified member
Software engineer may eligible membership qualify Chartered Engineer status
In Canada developed legally recognized professional certification called
In Ontario Canada Software Engineers graduate accredited program successfully complete PEO Professional Practice Examination PPE least month acceptable engineering experience eligible licensed become Professional Engineers
The PEO recognize online distance education however consider Computer Science program equivalent software engineering program despite tremendous overlap two
This sparked controversy certification war
It also held number holder profession exceptionally low
The vast majority working professional field hold degree CS SE
Given difficult certification path holder degree never bother pursue license
The initial impact outsourcing relatively lower cost international human resource developing third world country led massive migration software development activity corporation North America Europe India later China Russia developing country
This approach flaw mainly distance timezone difference prevented human interaction client developer massive job transfer
This negative impact many aspect software engineering profession
For example student avoid education related software engineering fear importing software product service country displaced
Although statistic currently show threat software engineering related career appear affected
Nevertheless ability smartly leverage offshore resource via workflow improved overall operational capability many organization
When North Americans leaving work Asians arriving work
When Asians leaving work Europeans arriving work
This provides continuous ability human oversight process hour per day without paying overtime compensation disrupting key human resource sleep pattern
While global outsourcing several advantage global generally distributed development run serious difficulty resulting distance developer
This due key element type distance identified geographical temporal cultural communication includes use different language dialect English different location
Research carried area global software development last year extensive body relevant work published highlight benefit problem associated complex activity
As aspect software engineering research ongoing related area
Software engineering direct overlap
It also considered part overall
In general software engineering focus technique application software development industry computer science focus algorithm theory
Typical formal definition The term used le formally Software engineering see practitioner individual follow engineering approach
These approach specified various software engineering book research paper always connotation predictability precision mitigated risk professionalism
This perspective led call licensing certification codified body knowledge mechanism spreading engineering knowledge maturing field
proposed body software developer alternative emphasizes coding skill accountability software developer without professionalism prescribed curriculum leading craftmanship without engineering lack predictability precision missing risk mitigation method informal poorly defined

The concept new rarely understood widely misinterpreted including software engineering textbook paper among community programmer crafter
One core issue software engineering approach empirical enough validation approach usually absent limited hence software engineering often misinterpreted feasible theoretical environment

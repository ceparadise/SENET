In method apparatus efficiently storing data structure continue accessed using memory instruction memory APIs even end process created last modified
Often confused NVRAM persistent memory instead closely linked concept emphasis program state exists outside fault zone process created
Efficient access defining characteristic persistent memory
It provided using microprocessor memory instruction load store
It also provided using APIs implement RDMA action RDMA read RDMA write
Other method allow access data also qualify
Persistent memory capability extend beyond stored bit
For instance loss key metadata page table entry construct translate virtual address physical address may render durable bit
In respect persistent memory resembles abstract form computer storage
In fact almost existing persistent memory technology implement least basic file system used associating name identifier stored extent minimum provide file system method used naming allocating extent

Persistence refers object process characteristic continue exist even process created cease machine running powered
When object state created need persistent saved storage location like hard drive versus temporary file volatile random access memory RAM
In term data persistence mean object erased unless really meant deleted
This entail proper storage certain measure allow data persist
In term computer thread process persistent process one killed shut
This usually true core system process essential properly functioning system
For example even Windows operating system OS explorer fails killed simply restarts
A persistent state refers retention state even process killed
In case state saved persistent storage device shutdown reloaded device turn ensuring device workspace data state turning device

In refers characteristic outlives created
This achieved practice storing state data
Programs transfer data storage device provide mapping native storage device data structure
Picture editing program example achieve persistence saving document
Persistence said transparent implemented intrinsic property execution environment program
An orthogonal persistence environment require specific action program running retrieve save
persistence requires data written read storage using specific instruction program resulting use transitive verb
The advantage orthogonal persistence environment simpler le program
Orthogonal persistence widely adopted operating system system state saving
Research prototype language Fibonacci pJama successfully demonstrated concept along advantage programmer
Using simplest persistence strategy
Notebook example orthogonal persistence using system image require action program running machine
An example persistence using system image simple text editing program executing specific instruction save entire document file
Requires enough RAM hold entire system state
State change made system last image saved lost case system failure shutdown
Saving image every single change would system image used single persistence technique critical system
Using journal second simplest persistence technique
Journaling process storing event log one applied system
Such log called journal
On startup journal read event reapplied system avoiding data loss case system failure shutdown
The entire history user command picture editing program example written file constitutes journal capable recovering state edited picture point time
Journals used also called transaction log redo log
Journals often combined persistence technique entire potentially large history system event reapplied system startup
This technique writing storage portion system state modified dirty since last write
Sophisticated document editing application example use dirty writes save portion document actually changed since last save
This technique requires state change intercepted within program
This achieved way requiring specific call transparent way automatic
This result code slower native code complicated debug
Any make easier program persist state generically called persistence layer
Most persistence layer achieve persistence directly use underlying
System prevalence technique combine system image transaction journal mentioned overcome limitation
A prevalent system must enough hold entire system state
use combination dirty writes transaction journaling technique mentioned
They provide persistence also service query auditing access control
Persistent operating system remain persistent even crash unexpected shutdown
Operating system employ ability include

Persistent storage device retains data power device shut

Last year time HP announced revolutionary technological change
Currently memory volatile meaning loos power lost
As result operating system developed move data hard drive random access memory write back needed
In computer science method apparatus efficiently storing data structure continue accessed using instruction APIs even end process created last modified
Often confused memory NVRAM persistent memory instead closely linked concept persistence emphasis program state exists outside fault zone process created
As example let share process opening Word Document
The Word application temporarily open file memory
In memory continue write document saved permanently click
As interact document computation made CPU pushing pulling data memory
When click file moved back computer memory stored permanently hard drive
You longer interacting stored version file
This efficient permanent storage take long time read write memory needed temporary caching mechanism
Let take notch
When turn laptop server operating system work back forth push setting information memory
But
Of course I oversimplifying process I illustrate mean software engineered last couple decade
That change
Persistent memory holy grail love child DRAM mesh forgetful memory persistent storage together
Even solid state drive SSD latency reading writing still required memory take caching slack
However huge step forward somewhere modern memory solid state hard drive Micron Intel introduced XPoint Persistent Memory provided following latency stats The technology transform operating system developed including data center cloud computing server
late last year
Shahin Khan recently shared gap CPU speed storage speed separate apps data memory becomes bottleneck
In come storage class memory mostly flash nod promising technology getting larger faster cheaper
So see example apps using Great Wall persistent memory built hardware software solution bridge gap traditional storage DRAM
Eventually expect programming language naturally support persistent memory

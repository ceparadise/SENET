This book build upon idea previous work including fourth book philosophical essay uncertainty titled
Taleb introduces book follows Some thing benefit shock thrive grow exposed volatility disorder stressor love adventure
Yet spite ubiquity phenomenon word exact opposite fragile
Let u call antifragile
Antifragility beyond resilience robustness
The resilient resists shock stay antifragile get better
example mild antifragility stressor poisonous substance antifragile becomes better overall small dose stressor
This different robustness resilience Antifragile system improves withstands stressor stressor neither large small
The larger point according Taleb depriving system vital stressor necessarily good thing downright harmful
More technically Taleb defines antifragility nonlinear response Simply antifragility defined response stressor source harm range variation leading positive sensitivity increase volatility variability stress dispersion outcome uncertainty grouped designation disorder cluster
Likewise fragility defined concave sensitivity stressor leading negative sensitivity increase volatility
The relation fragility convexity sensitivity disorder mathematical obtained theorem derived historical narrative

To skin game incurred monetary risk involved achieving goal
Taleb extends definition include risk Every captain go every ship
This remove word Situation manager business true owner follows strategy cosmetically seems sound hidden way benefit make antifragile expense fragility true owner society
When right collect large benefit wrong others pay price
Typically problem lead fragility easy hide risk
It also affect politician academic
A major source To every opinion maker need skin game event harm caused reliance information opinion person say people helped cause criminal Iraq invasion come completely unscathed
Further anyone producing forecast making economic analysis need something lose given others rely forecast repeat forecast induce risk taking toxic u form human pollution
Via negativa type theological thinking attempt describe God negation word God
Taleb expanded definition include generally focus something action avoid
Avoiding doctor minor illness removing certain food one diet improve health example
I would add experience considerable jump personal health achieved removing offensive irritant morning newspaper mere mention name fragilista journalist Thomas Friedman Paul Krugman lead explosive bout unrequited anger part bos daily commute though heating television email documentary filmmaker economic forecast news stock market gym strength training machine many
A technology anything nonperishable increase life expectancy every day perishable item human cat dog tomato
So book hundred year print likely stay print another hundred year
The opposite Neomania love change sake form philistinism comply Lindy effect understands fragility
Forecasts future adding subtracting
In finance Barbell strategy formed Trader invests Long Short duration bond invest Intermediate duration bond
This strategy useful interest rate rising short term maturity rolled receive higher interest rate raising value
Taleb generalizes phenomenon applies domain
Essentially transformation anything fragile antifragile
A dual strategy combination two extreme one safe one speculative deemed robust monomodal strategy often necessary condition antifragility
For instance biological system equivalent marrying accountant occasional fling rock star writer getting stable sinecure writing without pressure market spare time
Even trial error form barbell The Green Lumber Fallacy refers kind one mistake one important kind knowledge another word mistaking source important even necessary knowledge another le visible outside le tractable one many thing call knowledge much
Mathematically use incorrect function chance return correct output one conflates x x
The root fallacy although people may focusing right thing due complexity thing good enough figure intellectually
The term refers story author Jim Paul Brendan Moynihan book trader made fortune trading lumber thought literally green rather fresh cut
This get idea supposed understanding investment rationale narrative theoretical model unhelpful practical trading
The protagonist make big discovery
He remark fellow named Joe Siegel one successful trader commodity called green lumber actually thought lumber painted green rather freshly cut lumber called green dried
And made profession trade stuff
Meanwhile narrator grand intellectual theory narrative caused price commodity move went bust
It successful expert lumber ignorant central matter like designation green
He also knew thing lumber nonexperts think unimportant
People call ignorant might ignorant
The fact predicting order flow lumber usual narrative little detail one would assume outside important
People thing field subjected set exam selected nonnarrative argument make much difference
An early occurrence fallacy found ancient story
explains Thales reserved press ahead olive harvest discount rent high price demand peaked following prediction particularly good harvest
Aristotle attribute Thales success ability correctly forecast weather
However ability forecast made Thales successful Thales put position take advantage lack need understand much message first record
The Green Lumber Fallacy becomes problem namely Green Lumber Problem perpetuation fallacy high opaque negative impact
For example Toward end book Taleb provides example problem agency calling problem problem Alan Blinder problem
In last chapter example Taleb criticizes former vice chairman board governor trying sell investment product would allow investor circumvent regulation limiting benefit coverage near unlimited amount
Taleb commented scheme would allow scam taxpayer getting free insurance
He also criticized Blinder using game system built first place voicing opposition policy bank insurance would hurt business claiming good business public good
The event discussed medium denied Blinder
praised critic litany notable periodical including magazine Forbes
Although Boyd Tonkin criticized Taleb style vulgar silly slapdash infuriating idea book remarked time I returned two question core idea Is right matter
My verdict
Yes yes
gave book generally favorable review Taleb responded magazine Michael Shermer mischaracterizes concept antifragility
The relation fragility convexity sensitivity disorder thus mathematical derived empirical data
Less favorable review include described book maddening bold repetitious judgmental intemperate erudite reductive shrewd provocative pompous penetrating perspicacious pretentious
Taleb responded turn noting one five error review questioning Is crazy enough engage technical subject without asking specialist advice even engaging something basic Google search
Some negative review focus Taleb style overall structure book particularly difficulty easily summarize cursory review
So although book table content chapter summary map summary book difficult discern content header summary noticeable pattern many title abstruse Hungry Donkeys according author design intended handicap book reviewer forcing read book entirety

Fooled Randomness The Hidden Role Chance Life Markets book Nassim Nicholas Taleb deal fallibility human knowledge
The book first part Talebs philosophical essay uncertainty following book include The Black Swan The Bed Procrustes Antifragile
Taleb set forth idea human often unaware existence randomness
They tend explain random outcome look explanation even none
Other misperceptions randomness discussed include Survivorship bias see winner try learn forgetting huge number loser
Many real life phenomenon bet like tossing coin example bet almost always win lose lose saving
People easily fooled statement like I bet time book selected Fortune one Smartest Books All Time
A Today recounted many criticism raised book industry turned justified
Forbes admitted book playful time insufferably arrogant Wall Street Journal called Universa Investments buy October Black Swan gain
The New Yorker said book conventional Wall Street wisdom Martin Luther thesis Catholic Church TEXERE published first edition book
In TEXERE published second edition
In Random House published edition change
In French version appeared many unique change book translated language reported sold half million copy
The Black Swan The Impact Highly Improbable book essayist scholar philosopher statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb
It released April Random House book focus extreme impact certain kind rare unpredictable event human tendency find simplistic explanation event retrospectively
This theory become known black swan theory
The book also cover subject relating knowledge aesthetic way life author frequently share anecdote life elaborate theory
The book first edition appeared commercial success spent week New York Times list
The second expanded edition appeared Taleb bestselling author Fooled Randomness treat uncertainty randomness single idea
See Black swan theory Talebs definition Black Swan event main idea Talebs book attempt predict Black Swan event build robustness negative one occur able exploit positive one
Taleb contends bank trading firm vulnerable hazardous Black Swan event exposed loss beyond predicted defective financial model
Taleb refers book variously essay narrative one idea blindness respect randomness
It Talebs questioning occurs explanation drive book forward book layout follows simple logic moving literary subject beginning scientific mathematical subject later portion
Part One beginning Part Two delve psychology Taleb address science business latter half Part Two Part Three
Part Four contains advice approach world face uncertainty Taleb acknowledges contradiction book
There contradiction book story I prefer use story vignette illustrate gullibility story need story displace story
Metaphors story far potent idea easier remember
In first chapter Black Swan theory first discussed relation Talebs coming age Levant author elucidates approach historical analysis
He describes history opaque essentially box cause
One see event go event go one way determining produced effect Taleb argues due The Triplet Opacity
In second chapter Taleb discus neuroscientist named Yevgenia Nikolayevna Krasnova published book web discovered small publishing company published unedited work book became international bestseller
The Bed Procrustes Philosophical Practical Aphorisms philosophy book Nassim Nicholas Taleb written aphoristic style
It first released November Random House updated edition released October includes fifty percent material release
According Taleb book contrast classical value courage elegance erudition disease nerdiness philistinism
The title refers sadistic thug Greek mythology abducted traveler fool call wasting time often best investment
A man without heroic bent start dying age thirty difference slave Roman Ottoman day today employee slave need flatter bos
You rich money refuse taste better money accept modernity created youth without heroism age without wisdom life without grandeur

A cognitive bias refers systematic pattern deviation norm rationality judgment whereby inference people situation may drawn illogical fashion
Individuals create subjective social reality perception input individual construction social reality objective input may dictate behaviour social world
Thus cognitive bias may lead perceptual distortion inaccurate judgment illogical interpretation
Some cognitive bias presumably adaptive Cognitive bias may lead effective action given context
Furthermore cognitive bias enable faster decision timeliness valuable accuracy cognitive bias human processing limitation resulting lack appropriate mental mechanism simply limited capacity information processing
Kahneman Tversky argue cognitive bias efficient practical implication area including clinical judgment entrepreneurship finance Bias arises various process sometimes difficult distinguish
Tversky Kahneman colleague demonstrated several replicable way human judgment Tversky Kahneman explained human difference judgement decision making term heuristic
Heuristics involve mental shortcut provide swift estimate possibility uncertain occurrence heuristic simple brain compute sometimes introduce severe systematic error
For example heuristic defined tendency judge frequency likelihood occurrence extent event resembles typical case
The Linda Problem illustrates representativeness heuristic participant given description Linda suggests Linda might well feminist
They asked whether thought Linda likely bank teller bank teller representativeness heuristic may lead error activating stereotype inaccurate judgement others
Biases distinguished number dimension example bias specific group well bias individual level
Some bias affect desirability option considered others illusory correlation affect judgment likely something whether one thing cause another
A distinctive class bias affect memory consistency bias bias reflect subject motivation example desire positive leading egocentric bias avoidance unpleasant cognitive dissonance
Other bias due way brain perceives
This distinction sometimes described hot cognition versus cold cognition also bias subject evaluate evaluating diverse better many respect even group
Some cognitive bias belong subgroup attentional bias refer paying increased attention certain stimulus shown example people addicted alcohol drug pay attention stimulus
Common psychological test measure bias Stroop task many social institution rely individual make rational judgment
Epistemology branch philosophy concerned theory knowledge
Epistemology study nature knowledge justification rationality belief term Epistemology first used Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier
However according Brett Warren King James VI Scotland previously personified philosophical concept character Epistemon philosophical approach signified Philomath seeking obtain greater knowledge epistemology use theology
The dialogue used King James educate society various concept including history word epistemology derived ancient Greek epistēmē meaning knowledge suffix meaning logical discourse
Ferrier coined epistemology model ontology designate branch philosophy aim discover meaning knowledge called true beginning philosophy
The word equivalent concept Wissenschaftslehre used German philosopher Johann Fichte French philosopher gave term épistémologie narrower meaning theory knowledge
Émile Meyerson opened Identity Reality written mathematics known also knowing add two number knowing person place thing activity
Some philosopher think important distinction knowing knowing epistemology primarily concerned first distinction explicit English defined explicitly language
In French Portuguese Spanish Dutch know translated using connaître conhecer conocer modern Greek verb γνωρίζω ξέρω
Italian verb conoscere sapere noun knowledge conoscenza sapienza German verb wissen kennen
The verb implies process go one state another verb seems appropriate term describing episteme one modern European language hence German name Erkenntnistheorie
The theoretical interpretation significance linguistic issue remains controversial
In paper On Denoting later book Problems Philosophy Bertrand Russell stressed distinction knowledge description knowledge acquaintance gilbert Ryle also credited stressing distinction knowing knowing The Concept Mind
This position essentially Ryles argued failure acknowledge distinction knowledge knowledge lead infinite regress includes truth everything else accept true cognitive point view
Whether someone belief true prerequisite belief hand something actually known categorically false
It would accurate say knew bridge safe plainly
By contrast bridge actually supported weight might say believed bridge safe whereas proving epistemologist argue whether belief proper
Some would rather describe knowledge system justified true proposition plato Gorgias argues belief commonly invoked

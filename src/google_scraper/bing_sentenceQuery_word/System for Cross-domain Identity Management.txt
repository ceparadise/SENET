learn share knowledge build career
The SCIM standard created simplify user management cloud defining schema representing user group REST API necessary CRUD operation
It intended replace older SPML protocol
Are mature C library
Most stuff I googled Java else seem active
In response comment These library usually form In word hide underlying implementation using model user
That way worry detail actual protocol
I updated original answer hopefully provide better information
This library hopefully looking One author project recently updated include SCIM object support absolutely correct link blog post explains library purpose
The author added summary nuget people find nuget library reading blog post wo confused I
Here example deserialzing user based GET request Facebook easily create new user object set property etc
POST system
I initially ran issue using Newtonsoft deserialzier rather MS one Returned factory could make proper use
You use class using SCIM spec
Furthermore library I believe handle creation request want rather crafting seem pretty straightforward anyway another snippet author project Craig McMurtry I hope help massive amount thanks due Craig McMurtry Microsoft helpful trying get running library I hand craft model class
Please evaluate open source project
I leading development effort
While missing feature Microsoft implemented quite well far complete area scim
See fit need welcome feedback help shape future
By posting answer agree

automating exchange user identity information identity domain IT system
For example company hire fire employee added removed company electronic employee
SCIM could used automatically account user external system
Then new user account would exist external system new employee user account former employee might longer exist system
In addition simple management creating deleting SCIM also used share information user attribute attribute schema group membership
Attributes could range user contact information group membership
Group membership attribute value generally used manage user permission
Attribute value group assignment change adding challenge maintaining relevant data across multiple identity domain
The SCIM standard grown popularity importance organization use SaaS tool
A large organization hundred thousand hosted application internal external related server database file share require user provisioning
Without standard connection method company must write custom software connector join system IdM system
SCIM us standardised data formatted
The first version SCIM released SCIM standard working group organized Open Web Foundation
In transferred current standard SCIM released
SCIM completed September published IETF RFCs
A document also available
The standard implemented various software
The standard initially called still called place name officially changed IETF adopted
demonstrated October Cloud Identity Summit industry conference
There user account provisioned across separate system using SCIM standard collection vendor Ping Identity SailPoint Technology Nexus UnboundID
In March IETF Paris test continued vendor joined BCPSoft Gluu Courion nine company total
SCIM first standard exchanging user data build prior standard
SPML attempt simpler widely adopted solution cloud service provider
SailPoint Ping Identity considered initial driving force create open standard

Make sure turned work properly
scim work Keeping user identity synchronized across multiple disparate data store always challenge organization
Even identity federation often imperative user record established across IAM system application store retrieve user information local repository
For SaaS application even critical data store different security domain streamlining user onboarding offboarding increasingly requirement customer
Service Provisioning Markup Language SPML framework approved solve problem implementation usage protocol cumbersome leading low adoption standard
So developed using modern protocol like REST JSON order reduce complexity provide straightforward approach user management
The release SCIM July clarified issue discovered interop testing protocol successfully used number enterprise SaaS provider including Salesforce
While many SaaS provider support proprietary interface well mechanism like provisioning adoption SCIM allows easier powerful standardized communication identity data store
This avoids need develop integration allows organization leverage commercial solution like PingFederate support inbound outbound SCIM provisioning
For identity provider SCIM client like PingFederate connects user directory monitor change
The change pushed target directory service provider SCIM endpoint user added modified deleted
On service provider side PingFederate function SCIM server receive request user management modifies target directory required
PingFederate includes support LDAP well SDK integrating custom directory database

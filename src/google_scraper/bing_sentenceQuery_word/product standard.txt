In computing standard needed build program software work different system
Standards de jure de facto
They also open proprietary
In computing agreed way thing
Standards make easier people build program work different system different country
Standards affect many area computing eg software file format hardware
Some common standard include There advantage using standard creating program product
For instance program product popular widely compatible
Also easier work people work standard

A Product Standard precisely defined documented set functionality product registered conformant Open Brand Program
Each Product Standard describes purpose give detailed technical conformance requirement identifies specific testing requirement must satisfactorily completed
Where appropriate may also highlight important information included Conformance Statement see
Most detailed requirement conformance Product Standards usually identified reference document rather defined Product Standard
All reference precisely stated referenced document clearly uniquely identified title version number date
Conformance specific version identified document Product Standard automatically updated virtue newer version document specification standard released
Where conformance specific part document relevant part clearly identified
The relationship various document shown following figure The current set Product Standards listed The Open Group web site link full text Product Standard found
Product Standards central Open Brand Program
They single reference point linking referenced specification standard Product Standards test suite conformance requirement
The Conformance Statement Registered Product state precisely product satisfies requirement Product Standard
Registered Products dependent upon service typically provided operating system software hardware
In case Registered Product may completely independent operating system may require kind service communication service
The Product Standard therefore state dependency specifies Operational Environment within Registered Product run
Portability associated ease system application data user transferred one environment another
Software application may rely Application Program Interfaces APIs provided Registered Product
These Portability Interfaces provide one level portability allowing software application work different product registered Product Standard
Software application use defined Portability Interfaces often require direct access service provided Registered Product
The Portability Environment defined Product Standard establishes overall environment required software portability
The relationship Operational Environment required Registered Product Portability Interface provided Registered Product Portability Environment required application software shown following figure Interoperability fullest sense mean ability application process meaningfully exchange information service regardless physical location network topology vagary computer architecture
In context Open Brand Program concept mean provision service protocol support interoperability application extent defined Product Standard
interoperability invariably requires correct configuration end system network element
The Open Group Interoperability Assurance Program associated Indicators Compliance interoperability see description provides mechanism resolution interoperability issue encountered field
Any requirement Interoperability Assurance Program defined Indicators Compliance section Product Standard described Conformance Statement Registered Product
Each Product Standard defined set heading
However reader note structure Product Standard might vary additional alternative heading used necessary
The usual heading given The formal name Product Standard
The label text field used association X Device form Brand logo defined Trademark Usage Guide
Where family Product Standards label reflect family name otherwise label X Device used
A brief precise description nature purpose Product Standard relevant background material clear statement differs similar Product Standards
This main section Product Standard definition implementation conformance requirement must met product registration Open Brand Program
Conformance requirement addressed respect interface portability interoperability
These attribute discussed detail
A definition environment set environment within functionality identified Product Standard employed
The Portability Environment primarily concern application portability used constrain usage Registered Product specific service environment
It defines interface service must available source program addition product
They usually defined term additional Product Standard set alternative Product Standards product configuration product must also registered
Identifies formal standard Product Standard defers
It intention The Open Group product conforming Product Standards also conform overlapping formal standard therefore Product Standard defers relevant formal standard
It noted deference particular identified version formal standard upon Product Standard Product Standard automatically defer later version standard
Any discrepancy Product Standard Specification formal standard unintentional
In case formal standard deemed superior therefore conflict either implementor buyer requiring conformance Product Standard formal standard time
For buyer simply stating Open Brand required ensures relevant standard conformance achieved
Identifies one designated test suite must used conformance testing see detail
Where designated test suite specified time Product Standard published Indicators Compliance section marked accordingly
The Open Group web site checked update test suite
No test suite ever ensure conformance test suite therefore known Indicators Compliance
A short summary issue concerned migration Product Standard
The primary focus migration application information aspect may provided appropriate
To conform Product Standard product product configuration must conform attribute defined Product Standard
Some key attribute include Note Product Standard may refer subset key attribute appropriate
The following paragraph explain mean product product configuration conform attribute Product Standard
The first statement associated attribute identifies purpose second achieved
This attribute facilitates consistency interface consistent presentation information different display device
It defines conformant product must exchange information human user appropriate device
This attribute facilitates portability software usually limited application source code use functionality defined Product Standard
It identifies interface specification typically APIs conformant product must support program using relevant interface adhere
Note Portability Environment Operational Environment defined elsewhere Product Standard see
This attribute defines programming language application must written order invoke service Product Standard
It may also identify particular dialect language
A conformant product required support source program written required dialect
Where particular dialect programming language important identified example ISO C language rather C Language
Where Portability Interface specified term particular source code conformant product required support source code program written
Products registered conformant Product Standard includes defined Portability Interface must provide facility source program compiled must registered association defined compilation environment
Note requirement compilation environment available mean compilation environment delivered every indeed specific product shipment
The content product configuration actually delivered matter vendor purchaser agree part normal contract negotiation
A Product Standard may permit choice protocol order accommodate variety architecture implementation
This section may also include requirement Interoperability Assurance Program see
This attribute facilitates data interchange one element interoperability
It identifies data format definition conformant product must interpret create data
This attribute facilitates communication one element interoperability
It normally identifies specific communication protocol conformant product must support
In case specific protocol mandated instead required actual protocol support available must declared Conformance Statement
In case one attribute relevant specified Product Standard explicitly say using phrase applicable none appropriate
All conformance requirement must involve stimulus result
The stimulus must produce result conformant system
For APIs explicitly case definition API call state result calling aspect important clearly defined cause effect
It sufficient example Product Standard require particular protocol supported
It must set cause effect protocol must associated specific functionality behavior within product
Detailed conformance requirement expressed combination The Open Group Standards Information Base formal repository specification Standards adopted The Open Group
The Standards Information Base available The Open Group web site

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
In information technology product something example software application created made available customer usually distinct name order number
In mathematics product result arithmetically multiplying number quantity
There two term many hundred thousand million
Some product contain infinitely many term
For product relatively term number multiplicand written one another separated multiplication sign x
An example x x
This becomes awkward number term large
When product infinitely many term term must occur definable sequence
This sequence always clear term simply listed separated multiplication symbol
For reason product symbol devised large uppercase Greek letter pi
To denote x x following symbology used The expression side equation product
The value always integer
It usually start always increase succeeding term product
Suppose sequence multiplicand extended without limit according obvious pattern
Then product unlimited value x x x x denoted like The sideways called mean continues increase without limit
It imprecise say dealing product terminology often used anyway

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

A definition approved recognized standard organization accepted industry
Standards exist format electrical
From standpoint standard extremely important industry allow combination product different manufacturer create customized
Without standard company could used together
In addition standard make much easier learn use new
Most official computer standard set one following organization IEEE set standard type electrical interface
Its famous standard probably defines interface communication
This interface used number including
IEEE also responsible designing data format
While IEEE generally concerned hardware ANSI primarily concerned software
ANSI defined standard number programming language including
ITU defines international standard particularly communication protocol
It defined number standard including specify transmitting data telephone line
In addition standard approved organization also de facto standard
These format become standard simply large number company agreed use
They formally approved standard standard nonetheless
good example de facto standard

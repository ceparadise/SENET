In synchronization construct allows ability wait block certain condition become true
Monitors also mechanism signaling thread condition met
A monitor consists object
A basically container thread waiting certain condition
Monitors provide mechanism thread temporarily give exclusive access order wait condition met regaining exclusive access resuming task
Another definition us wrapped order safely allow access method variable one
The defining characteristic monitor method executed At point time one thread may executing
By using one condition variable also provide ability thread wait certain condition thus using definition monitor
For rest article sense monitor referred
Monitors invented first implemented language
As simple example consider object performing transaction bank account While thread executing method object said object holding
object implemented enforce
The lock initially unlocked locked start public method unlocked return public method
Upon calling one method thread must wait thread executing object method starting execution method
Note without mutual exclusion present example two thread could cause money lost gained reason
For example two thread withdrawing account could return true causing balance drop follows first thread fetch current balance find greater subtract thread store balance return
The monitor class example implementing following basic representation code wrapping function execution mutexes For many application mutual exclusion enough
Threads attempting operation may need wait condition hold true
A loop work mutual exclusion prevent thread entering monitor make condition true
Other solution exist loop unlocks monitor wait certain amount time lock monitor check condition
Theoretically work deadlock issue arise
It hard decide appropriate amount waiting time small thread hog CPU big apparently unresponsive
What needed way signal thread condition P true true
A classic concurrency problem task maximum size one thread producer thread add task queue one thread consumer thread take task queue
The queue assumed empty full empty full
Whenever queue full task need producer thread block room consumer thread dequeueing task
On hand whenever queue empty need consumer thread block task available due producer thread adding
As queue concurrent object shared thread access must made queue put course queue access never exposed thread
Thus code access queue constitutes must synchronized mutual exclusion
If code processor instruction critical section code access queue could arbitrary thread processor thread multiple processor risk exposing inconsistent state causing
A naïve approach design code synchronization making code subject race condition This code serious problem access queue interrupted interleaved thread access queue
The method likely instruction update queue member variable size beginning ending position assignment allocation queue element etc
In addition method read shared state well
If thread allowed interleaved call inconsistent state queue exposed leading race condition
In addition one consumer make queue empty another consumer exiting calling dequeue second consumer attempt dequeue empty queue leading error
Likewise producer make queue full another producer exiting calling enqueue second producer attempt add full queue leading error
One naive approach achieve synchronization alluded use mutex used protect critical section code still used lock acquired released check
This method assures inconsistent state occur waste CPU resource due unnecessary
Even queue empty producer thread nothing add long time consumer thread always unnecessarily
Likewise even consumer blocked long time processing current task queue full producer always
This wasteful mechanism
What needed way make producer thread block queue way make consumer thread block queue

Mutexes also involve order get lock order solve problem wasted CPU resource assume properly us blocking lock queue
The solution use
Conceptually condition variable queue thread associated monitor thread may wait condition become true
Thus condition variable associated
While thread waiting condition variable thread considered occupy monitor thread may enter monitor change monitor state
In type monitor thread may signal condition variable indicate assertion true current state
Thus two main operation condition variable As design rule multiple condition variable associated mutex vice versa
This correspondence
This predicate thread using monitor must protected mutual exclusion thread might cause condition changed might read thread question cause changed may different thread want wait different condition variable requiring mutex used
In example queue must protected unique mutex object
The producer thread want wait monitor using lock condition variable block queue
The consumer thread want wait different monitor using mutex different condition variable block queue
It would usually never make sense different mutexes condition variable classic example show often certainly make sense multiple condition variable using mutex
A mutex used one condition variable one monitor may also shared code use condition variable simply without operation happen require waiting certain condition concurrent data
The proper basic usage monitor To precise pseudocode verbose comment better explain going Having introduced usage condition variable let use revisit solve classic bounded problem
The classic solution use two monitor comprising two condition variable sharing one lock queue This ensures concurrency producer consumer thread sharing task queue block thread nothing rather shown aforementioned approach using
A variant solution could use single condition variable producer consumer perhaps named queueFullOrEmptyCV queueSizeChangedCV
In case one condition associated condition variable condition variable represents weaker condition condition checked individual thread
The condition variable represents thread waiting queue one waiting
However would require using thread using condition variable use regular
This regular might wake thread wrong type whose condition yet met thread would go back sleep without thread correct type getting signalled
For example producer might make queue full wake another producer instead consumer woken producer would go back sleep
In complementary case consumer might make queue empty wake another consumer instead producer consumer would go back sleep
Using ensures thread right type proceed expected problem statement
Here variant using one condition variable notifyAll Implementing mutexes condition variable requires kind synchronization primitive provided hardware support provides
Locks condition variable abstraction synchronization primitive
On uniprocessor disabling enabling interrupt way implement monitor preventing context switch critical section lock condition variable enough multiprocessor
On multiprocessor usually special atomic instruction memory etc
used depending provides
These usually require deferring internal lock state locking brief
Depending implementation atomic instruction may lock bus core access prevent instruction CPU
Here example pseudocode implementation part threading system mutexes condition variable using policy
This gloss threading system work show part relevant mutexes condition variable As example consider class implement
There method increment V decrement P private integer
However integer must never decremented thus thread try decrement must wait integer positive
We use condition variable associated assertion
Implemented showing synchronization removing assumption class showing mutex Conversely lock condition variable also derived semaphore thus making monitor semaphore reducible one another The implementation given incorrect
If thread call wait signal called may stuck indefinitely since signal increment semaphore enough time thread already waiting
When happens condition variable least one thread waiting least two thread could occupy monitor thread signal one thread waiting
In order one thread occupies monitor time choice must made
Two school thought exist best resolve choice
This lead two kind condition variable examined next The original proposal
With blocking condition variable signaling thread must wait outside monitor least signaled thread relinquishes occupancy monitor either returning waiting condition variable
Monitors using blocking condition variable often called monitor monitor
We assume two queue thread associated monitor object In addition assume condition variable queue All queue typically guaranteed implementation may guaranteed
The implementation operation follows
We assume operation run mutual exclusion others thus restarted thread begin executing operation complete
The routine selects next thread occupy monitor absence candidate thread unlocks monitor
The resulting signaling discipline known signaler must wait given priority thread entrance queue
An alternative queue signaler wait queue instead
Some implementation provide operation combine signaling returning procedure
In either case signal urgent wait signal wait condition variable signaled least one thread waiting condition variable signaling thread hand occupancy signaled thread seamlessly thread gain occupancy
If true start operation true end operation
This summarized following
In contract monitor
In contract assumed depend content length queue
When condition variable queried number thread waiting queue sophisticated contract given
For example useful pair contract allowing occupancy passed without establishing invariant See Howard Buhr
It important note assertion entirely programmer simply need consistent
We conclude section example class using blocking monitor implement bounded
Note example stack internally providing mutex earlier example shared condition variable checking different condition concurrent data
The difference example assumed regular queue using standalone mutex condition variable without detail monitor abstracted away case
In example wait operation called must somehow supplied stack mutex wait operation integrated part monitor class
Aside kind abstracted functionality raw monitor used include mutex condition variable unique mutex condition variable
With also called condition variable condition variable signaling cause signaling thread lose occupancy monitor
Instead signaled thread moved queue
There need queue
With nonblocking condition variable operation often called terminology follow
It also common provide operation move thread waiting condition variable queue
The meaning various operation given
We assume operation run mutual exclusion others thus restarted thread begin executing operation complete
As variation scheme notified thread may moved queue called priority
See Howard Buhr discussion
It possible associate assertion condition variable sure true upon return
However one must ensure preserved time ing thread give occupancy notified thread selected monitor
Between time could activity occupant
Thus common simply
For reason usually necessary enclose operation loop like condition stronger
The operation treated hint may true waiting thread
Every iteration loop past first represents lost notification thus nonblocking monitor one must careful ensure many notification lost
As example hinting consider bank account withdrawing thread wait account sufficient fund proceeding In example condition waited function amount withdrawn impossible depositing thread made condition true
It make sense case allow waiting thread monitor one time check assertion true
In language object may used monitor
Methods requiring mutual exclusion must explicitly marked keyword
Blocks code may also marked
Rather explicit condition variable monitor
object equipped single wait queue addition entrance queue
All waiting done single wait queue operation apply queue
This approach adopted language example
Another approach signaling omit operation
Whenever thread leaf monitor returning waiting assertion waiting thread evaluated one found true
In system condition variable needed assertion must explicitly coded
The contract wait Brinch Hansen Hoare developed monitor concept early based earlier idea
Brinch Hansen published first monitor notation adopting concept invented queueing mechanism
Hoare refined rule process resumption
Brinch Hansen created first implementation monitor
Hoare demonstrated equivalence
Monitors Concurrent Pascal soon used structure process synchronization
Programming language supported monitor include A number library written allow monitor constructed language support natively

monitoring computer activity data stored data transferred computer network
The monitoring often carried covertly may completed government corporation criminal organization individual
It may may legal may may require authorization court independent government agency
Computer network surveillance program widespread today almost Internet traffic monitored
Surveillance allows government agency maintain recognize monitor threat prevent investigate activity
With advent program program technology software law government posse unprecedented ability monitor activity citizen
However many group expressed concern increasing surveillance citizen end even already society limited political personal freedom
Such fear led numerous lawsuit
The group hacked government website protest considers draconian surveillance
The vast majority computer surveillance involves monitoring
For example United States mandate phone call etc
available unimpeded monitoring Federal law enforcement agency
also known packet sniffing monitoring data traffic
Data sent computer network take form small chunk called packet routed destination assembled back complete message
A intercept packet may examined analyzed
Computer technology needed perform sift intercepted data look information
Under telecommunication provider required install packet capture technology Federal law enforcement intelligence agency able intercept customer VoIP traffic
There far much data gathered packet sniffer human investigator manually search
Thus automated Internet surveillance computer sift vast amount intercepted Internet traffic filtering reporting investigator bit information interesting example use certain word phrase visiting certain type web site communicating via email chat certain individual group
Billions dollar per year spent agency development purchase implementation operation system intercept analyze data extracting information useful law enforcement intelligence agency
Similar system used identify suppress dissident
All technology allegedly installed German Finnish
The Internet rapid development become primary form communication
More people potentially subject Internet surveillance
There advantage disadvantage network monitoring
For instance system described Web greatly impacted modern society
Tim O Reilly first explained concept Web stated Web provides communication platform user generated content motivating people communicate friend online
However Internet surveillance also disadvantage
One researcher said Web surveillance directed large user group help hegemonically produce reproduce surveillance providing content
We characterize Web surveillance mass
Surveillance company monitor people focused work entertainment
This emotionally affect people cause emotion like jealousy
A research group state set test prediction feeling jealousy lead creeping partner Facebook woman particularly likely engage partner monitoring response jealousy
The study show woman become jealous people online group

Currently virtual assistant Amazon Alexa call local service
They constantly listening command recording part conversation help improve algorithm
If law enforcement able called using virtual assistant law enforcement would able access information saved device
The device connected home internet law enforcement would exact location individual calling law enforcement
While virtual assistance device popular many debate lack privacy
The device listening every conversation owner
Even owner talking virtual assistant device still listening conversation hope owner need assistance well gather data
Corporate surveillance computer activity common
The data collected often used marketing purpose sold corporation also regularly shared government agency
It used form enables corporation better tailor product service desirable customer
Or data sold corporation use aforementioned purpose
Or used direct marketing purpose targeted advertisement ad targeted user search engine analyzing search history email use free webmail service kept database
One important component prevention establishing business purpose monitoring may include following A second component prevention determining ownership technology resource
The ownership firm network server computer file explicitly stated
There distinction employee personal electronic device limited proscribed owned firm
For instance world popular search engine store identifying information web search
An search phrase used stored database month
Google also scan content email user Gmail webmail service order create targeted advertising based people talking personal email correspondence
Google far largest Internet advertising site place Google advertising banner link website order earn money visitor click ad
Each page containing Google advertisement add read modifies visitor computer
These cooky track user across site gather information web surfing habit keeping track site visit site
This information along information email account search engine history stored Google use build profile user deliver advertising
The United States government often gain access database either producing warrant simply asking
The openly stated us data collected consumer credit direct marketing agency augmenting profile individual monitoring
In addition monitoring information sent computer network also way examine data stored computer monitor activity person using computer
A surveillance program installed computer search content hard drive suspicious data monitor computer use collect report back activity operator Internet connection

In computer science also known applied mathematics problem finding number distinct element data stream repeated element
This problem numerous application
The element might represent packet passing web site element large database motif sequence element
An example instance cardinality estimation problem stream
For instance
The naive solution problem follows As long number distinct element big fit main memory exact answer retrieved
However approach scale bounded storage computation performed element minimized
In case several proposed use fixed number storage unit
To handle bounded storage constraint use randomization produce estimation distinct number element
estimator every element data sketch using hash function
The different technique classified according data sketch store

Each packet belongs one IP flow
The weight load imposed flow server
Thus represents total load imposed server flow packet belong
Any extreme order statistic estimator sketch unweighted problem generalized estimator weighted problem
For example weighted estimator proposed Cohen et al
obtained continuous max sketch estimator extended solve weighted problem
In particular algorithm extended solve weighted problem
The extended algorithm offer best performance term statistical accuracy memory usage among known algorithm weighted problem

This article
A problem computer science considered unsolved solution known expert field disagree proposed solution

Solving problem core computer science
Programmers must first understand human solves problem understand translate algorithm something computer finally write specific syntax required computer get job done
It sometimes case machine solve problem completely different way human
Computer Programmers problem solver
In order solve problem computer must Know information data describing problem
Determine step information one representation another
A computer heart really dumb
It really know thing number character booleans list called array item
See Data Types
Everything else must approximated combination data type
A good programmer encode fact necessary represent problem variable See Variables
Further good way bad way encode information
Good way allow computer easily compute new information
An algorithm see Algorithm set specific step solve problem
Think way tell year old neice play favorite song piano assuming neice never played piano would tell piano sit bench open cover key press order press etc etc etc
The core good programmer able define step necessary accomplish goal
Unfortunately computer know restricted limited set possible step
For example computer add two number
But want find average two number beyond basic capability computer
To find average must Computer scientist like use fancy word Encapsulation show smart
This term thing human every day
It combined another fancy term Abstraction
Abstraction idea ignoring detail
For example forest really vastly complex ecosystem containing tree animal water path etc etc etc
But computer scientist normal person forest
For example professor need cup coffee asks single item Get cup coffee used encapsulation abstraction
The number step required actually get coffee enumerable
Including getting walking hall getting car driving coffee stand paying coffee etc etc etc
Further idea cup coffee abstract
Do bring mug coffee Styrofoam cup
Is caffeinated
Is freshly brewed concentrate
Does come Africa America
All information would quickly unable funciton remember detail
Thus abstract away detail remember important item
This brings u idea Complexity Hiding
Complexity hiding idea time detail matter
In computer program simple idea drawing square screen involves hundred thousand low level computer instruction
Again person could possible create interesting program every time wanted something correctly every one instruction
By ecapsulating meant draw square reusing operation make programming tractable
The idea behind encapsulation store information necessary particular idea set variable associated single object
We create function manipulate object regardless actual data
From point treat idea high level rather worry part data action function necessary represent object computer
Brute force technique solving problem relies computer speed fast repeat step solve problem
For example wanted know many time number go number could following Of course silly way computer human solve problem
The real way would When doubt often use brute force solve problem often save time least computer time think problem solve elegant manner

Computer science also strong connection discipline
Many problem science engineering health care business area solved effectively computer finding solution requires computer science expertise knowledge particular application domain
Thus computer scientist often become proficient subject
Finally computer science wide range specialty
These include computer architecture software system graphic artifical intelligence computational science software engineering
Drawing common core computer science knowledge specialty area focus particular challenge
Finally importantly computer scientist computer scientist fun
Not mention lucrative career opportunity
Computer Science The Profession Computer science discipline involves understanding design computer computational process
In general form concerned understanding information transfer transformation
Particular interest placed making process efficient endowing form intelligence
The discipline range theoretical study algorithm practical problem implementation term computational hardware software
A central focus process handling manipulating information
Thus discipline span advancing fundamental understanding algorithm information process general well practical design efficient reliable software hardware meet given specification
Computer science young discipline evolving rapidly beginning
As includes theoretical study experimental method engineering design one discipline
This differs radically physical science separate understanding advancement science application science field engineering design implementation
In computer science inherent intermingling theoretical concept computability algorithmic efficiency modern practical advancement electronics continue stimulate advance discipline
It close interaction theoretical design aspect field bind together single discipline
Because rapid evolution difficult provide complete list computer science area
Yet clear crucial area theory algorithm data structure programming methodology language computer element architecture
Other area include software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking communication database system parallel computation distributed computation interaction computer graphic operating system numerical symbolic computation
A professional computer scientist must firm foundation crucial area field likely knowledge one area discipline depending upon person particular area practice
Thus well educated computer scientist able apply fundamental concept technique computation algorithm computer design specific design problem
The work includes detailing specification analysis problem provides design function desired satisfactory performance reliable maintainable meet desired cost criterion
Clearly computer scientist must sufficient training computer science area able accomplish task must also firm understanding area mathematics science well broad education liberal study provide basis understanding societal implication work performed

Intelligent Systems concerned mean computer may perform task might characterized intelligent performed human

Automata Theory abstract study computer capability

Information Storage Retrieval study method storing vast amount data computer method searching retrieving data

Software Engineering study tool technique software design development testing maintenance

Computer science often difficult define
This probably due unfortunate use word computer name
As perhaps aware computer science simply study computer
Although computer play important supporting role tool discipline
Computer science study problem solution come process
Given problem computer scientist goal develop list instruction solving instance problem might arise
Algorithms finite process followed solve problem
Algorithms solution
Computer science thought study algorithm
However must careful include fact problem may solution
Although proving statement beyond scope text fact problem solved important study computer science
We fully define computer science including type problem stating computer science study solution problem well study problem solution
It also common include word describing problem solution
We say problem computable algorithm exists solving
An alternative definition computer science say computer science study problem computable study existence nonexistence algorithm
In case note word computer come
Solutions considered independent machine
Computer science pertains process also study
Abstraction allows u view problem solution way separate logical physical perspective
The basic idea familiar u common example
Consider automobile may driven school work today
As driver user car certain interaction take place order utilize car intended purpose
You get insert key start car shift brake accelerate steer order drive
From abstraction point view say seeing logical perspective automobile
You using function provided car designer purpose transporting one location another
These function sometimes also referred
On hand mechanic must repair automobile take different point view
She know drive must know detail necessary carry function take granted
She need understand engine work transmission shift gear temperature controlled
This known physical perspective detail take place The thing happens use computer
Most people use computer write document send receive email surf web play music store image play game without knowledge detail take place allow type application work
They view computer logical user perspective
Computer scientist programmer technology support staff system administrator take different view computer
They must know detail operating system work network protocol configured code various script control function
They must able control detail user simply assumes
The common point example user abstraction sometimes also called client need know detail long user aware way interface work
This interface way user communicate underlying complexity implementation
As another example abstraction consider Python module
Once import module perform computation This example
We necessarily know square root calculated know function called use
If perform import correctly assume function provide u correct result
We know someone implemented solution square root problem need know use
This sometimes referred black box view process
We simply describe interface name function needed parameter returned

answer I think I found combining element least previous answer problem breaking barrier syntax semantic
Which problem actually every programmer computer scientist working
Lately semantic increasingly appearing topic whole
Most field topic opened start promise break barrier
Up sooner later reduced creating intelligence intelligent algorithm
AI probably research area prominent end many people dreaming basically Do I mean
I could fit evolutionary algorithm neural network lately semantic
The main hindrance everything computer shifting bit
I probably spreading prejustice foolery materialist fundamental problem shifting bit probably human brain
It simply might problem complexity
Well
I willing start discussion besides syntax semantics quite general topic
Spending much time definitely keep one solving specific problem mentioned answer
Tackling much effective help keep mind fundamental barrier yet able break

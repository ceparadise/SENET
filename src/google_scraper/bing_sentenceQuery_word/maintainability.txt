Reliability wellspring RAM system attribute availability maintainability
Reliability first practiced early day National Aeronautics Space Administration NASA Robert Lusser working Wernher von Braun rocketry program developed known Lusser Law
Lusser Law state reliability system equal product reliability component equates weakest link concept
The term reliability often used overarching concept includes availability maintainability
Reliability purest form concerned probability failure occurring specified time interval whereas availability measure something state mission capable ready tasked available
Maintainability parameter concerned system use restored failure also considering concept like preventive maintenance BIT required maintainer skill level support equipment
When dealing availability requirement maintainability requirement must also invoked level repair restoration state must included
Clearly logistics logistic support strategy also closely related dependent variable play availability requirement
This take form sparing strategy maintainer training maintenance manual identification required support equipment
The linkage RAM requirement dependency associated logistics support illustrates RAM requirement direct impact sustainment overall LCC
In simple term RAM requirement considered upper level overarching requirement specified overall system level
It often necessary decompose upper level requirement lower level quantitative requirement Mean Time Between Failure MTBF MTBCF Mean Time To Repair MTTR
These lower level requirement specified system level however allocated subsystem assembly
The common allocation made Line Replaceable Unit LRU unit lowest level repair field often called organic level maintenance
Much discussion focused hardware complex system used today integrated solution consisting hardware software
Because software performance affect system RAM performance requirement software must addressed overall RAM requirement system
The wear accumulated stress mechanism characterize hardware failure cause software failure
Instead software exhibit behavior operator perceive failure
It critical user program office test community contractor agree early constitutes software failure
For example software malfunction often recoverable reboot time reboot may bounded software failure declared
Another issue consider frequency occurrence even software reboot recovers within defined time window give indication software stability
User perception constitutes software failure surely influenced need reboot frequency glitch operating software
One approach assessing software fitness use comprehensive model determine current readiness software shipment meet customer requirement
Such model need address quantitative parameter process element
In addition method organize streamline existing quality reliability data simple metric visualization applicable across product release
A novel quantitative software readiness criterion model developed support objective effective decision making product shipment

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
This question already answer I used think I knew I really started thinking maintainable exactly make code maintainable
To code must maintainable mean expect revisit code make sort change future
Code always changeable matter state
So mean code need easy change
However code would need directly change change adapt free automatically
I also seen code maintainability used interchangeably coding standard
Using consistent coding pattern style really make code maintainable
More readable consistent
Sure improve maintainability
The I try think confused I get
Anyone proper explanation
This question asked already answer
If answer fully address question please
Maintainability binary property either maintainable
It continuum
Roughly speaking maintainability inversely proportional amount time take developer make change risk change break something
Improving readability coupling consistency contribute maintainability wo take long make given change
Maintainability easier recognize absence like something thought take hour end taking week
Coding standard help code base consistent therefore easier grok code base contains multiple coding style
Something easier understand easier maintain
To maintainable code really mean code read like book well documented
Maintainable code unit needed tested change made introduces effect caught quickly early code even checked
To maintainable code take advantage quirky language feature programming population aware
simple example using instead temporary variable author think cool
Maintainable code also implement sound architectural principle etc
It us known design pattern algorithm solve appropriate problem
Code maintainability synergy realized apply coding axiom rule thumb principle etc
It art science
To extent cooked appropriate amount thing code base maintainable
Code maintainable able change
However acid test maintainability attempting change code
To extent code resists resist interaction defines maintainability
Through application software principle guideline ever maybe never heard
For example For good maintainability one must consider time every level code apply appropriate mix
Further I emphasize enough principle work best well perhaps alone
Several year ago two thing came together
A set program literally unmaintainable discovery Steve McConnell
This book bible rewriting code Find road Damascus
It target rich environment
I overstate good book learning fundamental software development principle
Maintainable code code exhibit high cohesion low coupling
Cohesion measure related readable understandable code
Coupling measure related code low coupling mean changing A something affect B us A
Generally lower coupling mean lower cohesion vice versa developer need find appropriate balance two
Maintainability measure ease modify code higher maintainability mean le time make change
Coding standard way achieve high maintainability developed result previous experience universal dependent developer preference
Ask question
may say How hard understand wrote
How hard understand wrote
In unfortunate event everybody team unavailable fix must get trough hour guy available job summer intern likely succeed
And And best This le maintenance
The latter transforming application product maybe need pretty typical raise time
Best Practices Are meant make code survive longer
Coding pattern particular help maintenance making code reading le le discovery
They obviously used caution never heck
Chances relate someone usage pattern advantage maintainability using right
But stay assured way comparing different solution permitting faster response time case maintenance theoretically sound
I surprised one mentioned
A high complexity metric real code smell come maintainability
It sometimes necessary routine complex usually indicates code really hard maintain
Looking another way All code maintainable
The differentiating factor boil effort required maintain code amount technical debt code represents given state
Well factored code requires little effort maintain need modify impose significant resourcing cost
Code difficult read clever good poorly factored suite intention written type code incur higher cost maintain cost benefit make expedient avoid direct maintenance
Failing maintain poor code greatly increase technical debt increase likelihood code eventually considered costly maintain
Labeling code maintainable v result significant loss company result stigma project failure following developer around like bad smell year
Changing language effort le perception maintainability useful longer term helping focus effort problem becomes difficult manage
When working developer need assistance understanding maintainability mean I ask If application crash AM get called bed fix code would want look
You surprised change people point view
maintaining code mean taking code making change fix bug add feature maintainable code make process easier making code maintainable mean making easy understand descriptive variable name comment documentation help making change easy make pattern make easier depends actual need I defined maintainability measure effort required change functionality application software
A measure must include time resource expertise
In general software development manager familiar definition applies creating software
The term applies enhancement well bug fix
It might also said maintainable code designed leveraged
It take effort create maintainable software
For worth I recently started blog subject
Maintainable extent subjective
However code written le writer ego mind recognition point someone likely revisit code modify reason currently undefined
Very codebases stay static year end
What one person considers maintainable may different another view respect quality I think include We discussion subject documentation commentary time time
Code whose remit logic easy follow part easy update required caveat original design consideration ime never documented adequately

In process automatically analyzing behavior computer program regarding property correctness robustness safety liveness
Program analysis focus two major area
The first focus improving program performance reducing resource usage latter focus ensuring program supposed
Program analysis performed without executing program runtime combination
In context program correctness static analysis discover vulnerability development phase program
These vulnerability easier correct one found testing phase since static analysis lead root vulnerability
Due many form static analysis computationally undecidable mechanism always terminate right answer either sometimes return false negative problem found code fact problem false positive never return wrong answer sometimes never terminate
Despite limitation first type mechanism might reduce number vulnerability second sometimes give strong assurance lack certain class vulnerability
Incorrect optimization highly undesirable
So context program optimization two main strategy handle computationally undecidable analysis However also third strategy sometimes applicable language completely specified
An optimizing compiler liberty generate code anything runtime even crash encounter source code whose semantics unspecified language standard use
The purpose analysis obtain information function called various point execution program
The collected information represented CFG node instruction program edge represent flow control
By identifying code block loop CFG becomes starting point compiler made optimization
analysis technique designed gather information value point program change time
This technique often used compiler optimize code
One known example analysis consists considering variable contain user supplied data considered tainted
insecure preventing variable used sanitized
This technique often used prevent attack
Taint checking done statically dynamically
Abstract interpretation allows extract information possible execution program without actually executing program
This information used compiler look possible optimization certifying program certain class bug
Type system associate type program fulfill certain requirement
Their purpose select subset program language considered correct according property
Type checking used programming limit programming object used
This done compiler interpreter
Type checking also help preventing vulnerability ensuring signed value attributed unsigned variable
Type checking done statically compile time dynamically runtime combination
Static type information either explicitly provided type annotation source code also used optimization replacing unboxed array
Effect system formal system designed represent effect executing function method
An effect codifies done done usually referred effect kind region respectively
Model checking refers strict formal automated way check context mean formal model piece code though context model piece hardware complies given specification
Due inherent finite state nature code specification code convertible logical formula possible check system violates specification using efficient algorithmic method
Dynamic analysis use runtime knowledge program increase precision analysis also providing runtime protection analyze single execution problem might degrade program performance due runtime check
Software tested ensure quality performs supposed reliable manner create conflict software may function alongside
The test performed executing program input evaluating behavior produced output
Even security requirement specified additional performed ensure attacker tamper software steal information disrupt software normal operation use pivot attack user
Program monitoring record log different kind information program resource usage event interaction reviewed find abnormal behavior even pinpoint caused abnormal behavior
Furthermore used perform security audit
Automated monitoring program sometimes referred
For given subset program behavior program slicing consists reducing program minimum form still produce selected behavior
The reduced program called slice faithful representation original program within domain specified behavior subset
Generally finding slice unsolvable problem specifying target behavior subset value set variable possible obtain approximate slice using algorithm
These slice usually used developer debugging locate source error

In term project management scope work work flow concept reserve analysis actually refers specific often implemented project management team project management team leader leader purpose helping better maintain manage project may guise respective time
Specifically speaking technique reserve analysis particular analytical technique used purpose making complete thorough determination entirety specific exact feature many case relationship individual project related component currently exist part previously determined project management plan
The purpose implementation reserve analysis establishment used purpose establishing schedule estimated cost budget well complete assigned allocated project

What happens one activity go budget
How mitigate cost risk associated critical activity
Reserve Analysis hold key project answer
Reserve Analysis one technique used determine project budget
During Reserve Analysis project analyzed cost overrun point view buffer placed appropriate place
These buffer called Contingency Management Reserves

For example may Contingency Reserve lack skilled human resource certain technology
By looking able get category require contingency reserve

Every project hit unidentified risk
The Management Reserve protects project critter
Regardless type reserve amount buffer proportional cost risk foreseen project individual activity
The norm within organization may also dictate level buffering applicable
There prescribed method perform Reserve Analysis
However guiding principle buffer pad according risk level identified project individual activity
In article use guiding principle Reserve Analysis
After created project estimated activity duration resource might realize project similar previous project successfully completed
The risk associated project low critical piece need extra cost buffering
In case might decide pad activity cost estimate percent across board
Many organization set policy determine degree buffering
Now suppose identified activity critical path need give extra protection
In case would provide higher cost buffer activity activity critical path
It common critical path project change course project
Therefore
For example might developing component client
If contract specifies fixed time may want utilize extra cost buffer ensure required possible
Alternatively may want pad activity percent activity percent
Reserve Analysis done isolation determine project budget

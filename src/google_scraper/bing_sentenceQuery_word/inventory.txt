Managing inventory lab big task
Although easily forgotten remains one single effective way reduce cost improve productivity
To help folk put together handy guide lab inventory management
No matter size lab controlling inventory one important thing make everything run smoothly
Monitoring consumable supply reagent lab equipment instrument big task
But efficiently increase productivity reduce cost
Stretching lab budget improving efficiency reality simple yet creative tip
Whether working simplify inventory process creating starting point essential
Take stock everything I mean everything
You old fashioned way pen paper software
Whichever choose make sure every item accounted
This initial inventory
Once completed begin taking stock thing needed versus
Now finished list time evaluate could use le
While carefully consider every aspect daily routine
What product used often
How many used per week per month
Thinking back month many time item
Does current project require additional stock beyond current level
Have ever throw away supply reached expiration date
Asking question start render plan action
It great idea take note point reference go back
Now time put finding work
Create new list spreadsheet outlining product continue use
Note minimum amount lab keep
This become threshold
Once supply reduced threshold would set time
If automate process I recommend
Take advantage free lab management software product market
This also want ass possibility reduction
You might notice upon closer inspection supply continue sit shelf
Although I strongly recommend ordering bulk save cash always wise capacity use
The cost storage one manager miss
Think every square foot storage facility like parking garage
You would want maximize amount car park get money
You also want make sure go also go
A car parked space long period time would yield profit turning car frequently especially event whole different story
So like parking garage want make sure inventory used worthy space taking
Purchasing excess using lot space lab supply used wasteful costly
Once planned lab inventory stocking level consider early go
Careful planning add efficiency lab
For instance supply easy access placed area properly stored
You might put commonly used item together product similar expiration date together
Grouping inventory frequency use expiration date type creates organized system easy retrieve
A great way use
You place barcode location assignment individual shelf area storage facility
When stocking supply order correlating barcodes applied product scanned appropriate location
Whenever item removed scanned stocking level automatically removed inventory
This keep track stocking level location easily quickly
However automation always cost effective necessary
A simple map show layout stocking room product
Keeping spreadsheet posted manually add subtract supply used quite handy
Although automation make seamless sometimes good ol pencil paper plenty
You might also considering mounting chalk board white board wall keeping track way
Store possible
If budget allows invest dispensing bin system
They great way protect inventory dust debris also make retrieval quick easy
Believe
Constantly opening closing cardboard box mention risk spill annoying inefficient
Every second count
The time save stocking room time spent lab
Properly storing lab equipment instrument also priority item list
Keep mind equipment really push budget limit due maintenance calibration cost
It would shame equipment stored properly causing premature failure damage
Although seems pretty straight forward thing consider storing equipment
Now worked stocking level time order
You leverage product stocking larger quantity get better deal
I strongly suggest reaching directly inquire bulk pricing discount program reduce cost
Standing order great way free space lab allowing supplier handle regularly scheduled order fulfillment
Don discouraged small pack size quantity
Take couple minute contact supplier ask case quantity available
Many vendor happily put together custom order size meet requirement
Remember couple minute time request information really save lot money
Stretch budget leveraging buying power
Trust
We mind
This typically part lab inventory process deserves mention
It great idea make lab equipment service calibration part inventory management process
Make list every piece equipment requires service put together schedule following manufacturer recommendation
Keep checklist handy equipment stored check anytime completing inventory audit
This act reminder keep service warn upcoming schedule
Properly maintaining lab equipment save lot hassle even money
I highly suggest making part inventory routine
Lab supply thing keeping close track
Maintaining good record ensuring safe storage key running productive lab
I could write hour proper allocation document note I focus cost record
Keep ALL receipt
This seems pointless mention generally understood
However I tell important
Other keeping track expense receipt valuable tool recalling product number supplier purchased
I recommend creating digital copy every invoice saving within lab software use even external hard drive
Hard copy kept well
filing cabinet great way protect important document
One lock safely secure sensitive information bad idea either
How relevant lab inventory management
Simple
Inventory record weekly monthly basis roll stocking level check
Make checklist yes I like list item keep record
While conducting stocking level audit also run record make sure everything order
Check missing invoice ensure data collected verify signature list go
Whatever lab requires keep good record making item inventory list make sure always snuff
To make entire process achievable would great idea assign team member individual responsibility
For example could assign one lab technician duty stocking new order another assigned task inventorying stocking level
Other member team could placed charge equipment service schedule
I would highly recommend conducting quick meeting decide disperse duty
Explain everyone goal new process main priority exactly procedure conducting
Every person team strong understanding goal achieve
Getting everyone page one single best way make sure lab inventory management system run flawlessly
This step go beyond weekly monthly inventory replenishment count likely conduct
Developing following inventory audit schedule great way follow team make sure process running
You already know coming
Create list
Yes
Another list
But one really simple
Just jot key component inventory process
Decide often like complete audit
You might decide conduct quarterly even monthly feeling ambitious
Use list guide inspect element lab inventory process
Make sure stocking level maintained appropriately ensure costly waste make sure record properly kept inspect equipment maintenance compliance check expiration date supply
Of course might look item audit
An audit great way keep track everything glance
It also great way keep everyone team honest
You delegate every part inventory management process without proper never know effective effort
Every laboratory different requirement
Some stock others regardless amount supply always potential trim fat make inventory management efficient

learn share knowledge build career
I would like ask rather general introductory kind question regarding inventory management
So I wondering anyone SO worked past inventory supply chain procurement management setting
What typical problem challenge one might find field computer science mainly algorithm data structure optimization employed deal
Could relevant operational research queue theory etc
I directly related field would need know CS applied domain
An internet search produce vague result I would greatly appreciate insight educated advice specific online resource even example
I hope ok ask high level question
Many thanks advance Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
I experience warehouse management system
Much sophisticated CS point view juicy optimization problem CS applied
For example reduce time spent pick order go warehouse collect good order desireable find shortest way go place warehouse boil traveling salesman problem
Another place CS applied inventory taking clever software product
INVENT Xpert allow random sample inventory taking reach accuracy required law mean instead going storage location count quantity stored small percentage location actually counted
This general question You probably need knowledge distributed computing depends big operation Replicating Databases knowledge traveling agent kind problem know better else dependent problem need solve
I think explain purpose question narrow answer something might helpful also many product requires lot customization hold need field
What typical problem It common multiple updating specific database time locking update procedure lose money customer
Database concurrency issue significant system work
Test real load
If expect different widget warehouse expect day day Thanksgiving get hit second hour particular widget test real data real volume end test item quantity turn count ca even one
Make sure addressed two issue way trustworthy system

Learn something new every day email LIFO acronym usually stand respectively last first first first
Both term used wide variety situation determine order something handled luggage put removed storage bay determining employee laid
One term special significance area control accounting employment
A company operates FIFO principle policy displaying selling old stock selling newly acquired stock
Such policy make sense business sell fresh food item may go fashion
Grocery store example often refrigerated case make easy stock item back pushing older product forward shopper likely see buy
By rotating stock way likely le inventory waste food likely purchased go bad example
In LIFO FIFO two different way valuing company inventory
This valuation key determining tax company
It also important investor understand accountant determined value company inventory case method may used increase decrease company reported profit
Investors use information make decision regarding company prospect
When using FIFO method base valuation assumption first good sold first good company bought created resale
This always case however company may stock inventory contains newer older item
Since cost produce good often rise time business valued according method profitable least paper selling price good may significantly higher inventory value
If cost US Dollars USD per item produce first good USD per item make later one USD used cost good sold method
This mean inventory sold USD per item appears company making money based assumption le expensive make item sold first
The LIFO cost accounting strategy hand value inventory assuming last good produced first good sold
This typically raise value stock accountant base valuation recent price
It also typically lower profitability little inflation gap original cost item selling price
The advantage method cost accounting lowered profitability mean lower tax business
LIFO legal tax purpose country including United Kingdom
Some business use either method assessing value inventory may instead base value average cost item
Accountants add actual cost item together divide number item stock
The accountant assigns value item add together determine value business inventory
For computer programmer LIFO FIFO refer way data handled data structure
Different operation require data accessed different way whether randomly sequentially
Two type sequential data structure stack queue follow LIFO FIFO principle respectively
A stack data structure imagined like stack paper new data always added top stack
When data removed stack also taken top
In word processing program Undo function us type structure recently made change first one removed
A queue operates principle
Data always added end queue removed beginning
For example number people office want print using printer software would put request queue handle basis
The term LIFO also associated specifically determining employee laid organization downsizing
Using method people last hired first let go also sometimes known FILO
The employee remain experience therefore could argued best job
This method criticized ignoring job performance however discriminatory younger worker
Although used many industry method downsizing commonly associated education teacher layoff required law place
FIFO additional meaning fly fly among employer
The term refers practice bringing worker geographical area work flying home break
Unlike traditional job transfer family member accompany worker job site
Employers offer arrangement typically need trained employee job site remote area example mining often make use FIFO schedule
The worker may work long hour block time return home several day rest time family
With regard stock control lower level corresponding pastel system anyone say cause may

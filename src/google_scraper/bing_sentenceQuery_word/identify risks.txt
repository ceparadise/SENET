When I small I got tricked chain letter written friend
But chain letter stop era
It brings adult life well people like send chain letter Facebook account delete letter
It usually say forward particular message email people account deleted people really believe

Virus today spread document file well especially PDF document
Last time people advice simply execute EXE file today world today technology document file also avoided
It best use scan first opening single file feel suspicious

I sure whether encountered Mousetrapping Malware trap web browser particular website
If try type another website automatically redirect back
If try clicking navigation button also redirect back
If try close browser set homepage website never get threat unless remove

To really honest obfuscated Spam spam mail
It obfuscated way look like spamming message trick potential victim clicking
Spam mail today look genuine careful might fall offering

Pharming work le like phishing little tricky
There two type pharming one DNS poisoning DNS compromised traffic redirected attacker DNS
The type pharming edit HOST file even typed web browser still redirect another site
One thing similar equally dangerous

Crimeware form Malware take control computer commit computer crime
Instead hacker committing crime plant Trojan whatever Malware called order commit crime instead
This make hacker clean whatever crime done

How Identify Risk Factors Your Project How Assess Your Project Stakeholders Power Interest How Use Stakeholder Register Template How Gather Ideas Projects Handling Administrative Issues End Your Project A risk factor situation may give rise one project risk
A risk factor cause miss product schedule resource target
However increase chance something may happen cause miss one
For example The fact organization undertaken project similar present one risk factor
Because prior experience may overlook activity need perform may underestimate time resource need perform
Having prior experience guarantee problem increase chance may
Start manage risk outset project continue throughout performance
At point project identify risk recognizing project risk factor
Use project phase well overall project plan help identify risk factor
All project progress following four life cycle stage stage present new risk factor project Starting project Organizing preparing Carrying work Closing project Here example possible risk factor may arise stage
Here risk factor different part project plan may suggest

Ensuring adequate timely risk identification performed responsibility owner owner first participant project
The sooner risk identified sooner plan made mitigate manage
Assigning risk identification process contractor individual member project staff rarely successful may considered way achieve appearance risk identification without actually
It important however project management personnel receive specific training risk management methodology
This training cover risk analysis technique also managerial skill needed interpret risk assessment
Because owner may lack specific expertise experience identify risk project without assistance responsibility DOE project director ensure significant risk identified integrated project team IPT
The actual identification risk may carried owner representative contractor internal external consultant advisor
The risk identification function left chance explicitly covered number project document Statement work SOW Work breakdown structure WBS Budget Schedule Acquisition plan Execution plan
There number method use risk identification
Comprehensive database event past project helpful however knowledge frequently lie buried people mind access involves brainstorming session project team significant subset
In addition technical expertise experience personal contact group dynamic key successful risk identification
Project team participation interaction needed encourage open communication trust essential effective risk identification without team member reluctant raise risk concern open forum
While smaller specialized group perform risk assessment risk analysis effective ongoing risk identification requires input entire project team others outside
Risk identification one reason early activation IPT essential project success
The risk identification process project typically one brainstorming usual rule brainstorming apply The full project team actively involved
Potential risk identified member project team
No criticism suggestion permitted
Any potential risk identified anyone recorded regardless whether member group consider significant
All potential risk identified brainstorming documented followed IPT
The objective risk identification identify possible risk eliminate risk consideration develop solution mitigating function carried risk assessment risk mitigation step
Some documentation material used risk identification become available include Sponsor mission objective strategy project goal achieve strategy SOW Project justification project benefit present worth rate return etc
WBS Project performance specification technical specification Project schedule milestone Project financing plan Project procurement plan Project execution plan Project benefit projection Project cost estimate Project environmental impact statement Regulations congressional report may affect project News article project viewed regulator politician public Historical safety performance
The risk identification process need repeated source information change new information becomes available
There many way approach risk identification
Two possible approach identify root cause identify undesirable event thing go wrong identify potential impact project identify essential function project must perform goal must reach considered successful identify possible mode function might fail perform
Both approach work project team may find easier identify factor critical success work backward identify thing go wrong one
Risk identification performed early project starting preproject planning even preliminary concept approved continue project completed
Risk identification exact science therefore ongoing process throughout project especially enters new phase new personnel contractor bring different experience viewpoint risk identification
For reason DOE project director ensure project risk management plan provides periodic update
The goal risk identification avoid omission also avoid opposite distracted factor root cause symptom
Treating symptom rather root cause give appearance activity solve problem
Unfortunately identification symptom far easier identification root cause
Project owner ensure risk identification process go beyond symptom
While outside disinterested reviewer sometimes help perform function following section describe method used project personnel identify risk cause
Following initial risk identification phase project director working list risk identified potentially affecting project
From list project director differentiate seem minor require attention require qualitative analysis quantitative analysis active mitigation management
This process requires qualitative assessment magnitude seriousness identified risk
Various method developed ass failure physical equipment system also applied one form another project risk
The commonly used risk tool shown two two matrix allows assigning risk one four quadrant based qualitative assessment relative impact high low likelihood occurrence high low
Risks upper right quadrant Risk Screening Based Impact Probability need attention
Finer gradation impact example high high medium low low five five matrix allow nuanced consideration attention needed
Risks characterized low impact low likelihood occurrence essentially negligible usually eliminated active consideration
The main concern owner project director monitor factor sufficiently determine impact likelihood increase
Risks characterized high impact high likelihood occurrence often cause project terminated fail continued spite risk
In situation owner management must determine project terminated project mission critical potential benefit great taking risk justified
Risk management imply risk taken mean risk taken calculated risk
For example owner may decide proceed reasonable expectation enough engineering management effort reduce either impact likelihood event risk become either low impact high probability low probability high impact
Often decision contingent achieving necessary risk reduction deadline
risk largely due uncertainty number element may individually minor risk aggregate could amount significant risk
These include uncertainty concerning actual cost labor material steel actual duration activity delivery equipment productivity workforce change due design development owner preference uncertainty typically considered lie within natural variability project planning design construction include catastrophic event radical design change
Each uncertainty taken alone would little impact project
However taken together possibility many estimate factor would prove optimistic leading cumulative effect performance shortfall schedule overrun cost overrun
Methods dealing risk include Provision adequate contingency safety factor budget schedule contingency discussed
Improvement work process order reduce uncertainty
Prefabrication major component avoid uncertainty construction job site one example changing normal process reduce risk although example change may also introduce new risk transportation component job site thus resolution one risk may give rise another
By definition event rare occurrence therefore difficult assign probability based historical record
Data exist subjective estimate probability necessary
However objective scientific determination accurate probability rare event determination management action taken monitor mitigate manage risk
For example certain risk identified management determines specific mitigation action taken risk likelihood occurring precise characterization probability unnecessary issue whether assessed le One important us good risk analysis determine apply management resource leave alone management resource unlimited
One approach break uncertainty manageable part
Pareto diagram one way show source uncertainty impact descending order
This form presentation make explicit activity greatest effect project completion date cost therefore require greatest management attention
The project director manager must determine whether event truly root cause simply work package activity may reflect underlying cause symptom
The resulting analysis provide guidance manager reduce mitigate buffer otherwise manage source uncertainty
As simple illustration suppose interested determining work package greatest effect uncertainty total cost
First estimate uncertainty variance cost individual work package
Second estimate correlation association pair work package
Then elementary theory Benjamin Cornell sensitivity uncertainty total project cost respect work package proportional combination activity uncertainty correlation activity
That uncertainty total cost affected uncertainty work package also much work package affect affected others
As elementary example uncertainty cost construction project may sensitive outdoor activity indoor activity unusually bad weather cause number outdoor activity run budget schedule simultaneously whereas indoor activity typically linked tightly weather
By tabulating value work package sorting largest smallest identify work package largest sensitivity project manager give highest priority
If project say work package sort according largest value sensitivity plot Pareto diagram shown
The absolute value sensitivity importance concern relative value
In project risk assessment failure significant event sponsor want budget overrun schedule overrun failure meet scope quality mission performance objective
While risk may arise specific cause may also result general environmental condition limited specific time place pervasive throughout project
The objective failure mode effect analysis identification root common cause may affect project whole
Often identification facilitated methodically considering project function function All probability distribution may characterized moment
theory use second moment probability mean variance covariance correlation coefficient instead full probability distribution function
As probability distribution subjective therefore capable precise definition approximate method greatly simplify many calculation importantly provide risk analyst insight effect uncertainty project outcome
Pareto diagram
try avoid omission
Identification potential risk turn upon assessment negligible waste time however failure identify potential risk turn serious threat project
Therefore project director err side caution identifying possible risk
Failure mode effect analysis FMEA discipline methodology assist identifying assessing risk qualitatively
It method ranking risk investigation however method quantifying risk probabilistic basis Breyfogle
FMEA typically based subjective assessment relative magnitude impact risk event project often scale multiplied relative likelihood risk event occur also scale
In addition third parameter may included ass degree warning project regarding actual occurrence risk event scale
This third parameter may give management support establishing early warning indicator specific serious risk might otherwise established
The purpose assigning value significant risk rank risk set priority subsequent quantitative analysis significant risk
In absence quantitative factor sensitivity analysis failure mode better root cause used rank risk
One prepare Pareto chart show risk ordered possible impact combination impact likelihood occurrence
Then risk mitigation effort first address failure mode root cause highest impact work
The three likelihood leading
For example project construction facility flood plain area poor drainage failure mode could flooding work site
Project management affect frequency flood risk management must focus trying reduce severity impact flood
If control method buy flood insurance evacuate personnel abandon site water rise measuring height water Nilometer method may sufficient indicator
If control method reduce severity loss placing sandbag around perimeter renting pump measuring water height may little impact mitigation effort measuring rainfall across watershed may appropriate allows time implement control
If control method build cofferdam around site constructing anything else choice leading indicator may irrelevant
Efforts mitigate risk focus impact likelihood detectability serious risk root cause try reduce factor risk becomes low lower next higher risk
As process continues important risk reduced number risk essentially number risk lower first group
The first group require specific management action may require constant monitoring attention throughout project
The second group monitored lower priority frequency
The first group considered critical group much like activity network schedule second group noncritical group must watched primarily see none risk group become critical
It emphasized form risk assessment qualitative relative quantitative absolute
It primarily distinguishing risk require management high impact high likelihood risk appear require low impact low likelihood
It clearly understood quantitative assessment overall risk total project The severity factor estimated term loss dollar likelihood occurrence probability analysis risk versus control method
The analysis identifies risk priority methodical way help direct risk management activity
It left judgment project engineer designer manager determine appropriate risk mitigation control measure achieve acceptable level risk
Note especially risk low likelihood occurrence high severity may require management action
Due change project condition perception even risk appear low impact high likelihood one time may appear differently another
Therefore owner representative responsibility reevaluate failure mode effect periodically ensure risk previously considered negligible increased either impact likelihood level requiring management attention
The Project Definition Rating Index PDRI example additive qualitative risk assessment tool CII
The PDRI used project planning help project team ass project scope definition identify risk element subsequently develop mitigation plan
It includes detailed description issue weighted checklist project scope definition element jog memory project team participant
It provides mean ass risk various stage project planning process focus effort area need additional definition
The PDRI facilitates project team assessment risk project scope cost schedule
Each risk element PDRI series five predetermined weight
Once weight element determined added obtain score entire project
This score statistically correlated project performance estimate level certainty project baseline
After risk factor assessed qualitatively desirable quantify determined screening activity significant
It repeated often purpose risk assessment better able mitigate manage project compute project risk value
The assessment risk attributed element completely project management force majeure act God political instability action necessary reach understanding total project risk risk assessment viewed step toward identifying active measure manage risk even considered outside control project manager support passive attitude toward risk inevitable
It often desirable combine various identified characterized risk element single quantitative project risk estimate
Owners may also interested knowing total risk level project order compare different project determine risk project portfolio
See discussion program risk project portfolio
This estimate overall project risk may used input decision whether execute project rational basis setting contingency set priority risk mitigation
While probabilistic risk assessment method certainly useful determining contingency amount cover various process uncertainty simple computation method often good even better complex method application discussed
Owner representative proficient simple statistical approach computing risk probability order able check number given consultant contractor
When addressing probabilistic risk assessment project director keep mind objective mitigate manage project risk quantitative risk assessment part process help achieve objective
There many available method tool quantitatively combining assessing risk
Some frequently used method discussed briefly
Multivariate statistical model project cost duration derived historical data
Also known regression analysis statistical model one two method analysis explicitly cited OMB Circular No
OMB
The model typically either parametric contain enough detail validate engineering estimate project network
These method objective rely subjective probability distribution elicited possibly biased project advocate
Analysts build linear nonlinear statistical model based data multiple past project compare project question model
The use statistical model desirable independent benchmark evaluating cost schedule factor specific project statistically based method require large database project many owner perform enough project expend effort create database
Owners performed many project developed usable historical project database nity improve competence project program management organizing data
Computational method resampling bootstrapping also used data insufficient direct statistical method
The bootstrap method widely used statistical process originally developed Efron Tibshirani create proxy universe replication sampling replacement original sample
Bootstrapping used estimate confidence level limited sample applicable developing point estimate
Event tree also known fault tree probability tree commonly used reliability study probabilistic risk assessment example nuclear power plant NASA space probe failure mode effect analysis
The result evaluation probability various outcome given fault failure
Each event tree show particular event top condition causing event leading determination likelihood event
These method adapted project cost schedule performance risk assessment
Projects tightly coupled activity well described conventional project network model prohibit iteration feedback
Efforts apply conventional method project lead incorrect conclusion counterproductive decision project failure
In contrast system dynamic model Forrester describe explain project behavior performance driven feedback loop delay nonlinear relationship process resource management
System dynamic model used clarify test project participant assumption well design test proposed project improvement managerial policy
Because system dynamic model based dynamic feedback model also used evaluate impact various failure mode root cause particularly case root cause identified ripple effect impact difficult estimate confidence
System dynamic model effectively used project evaluation planning risk assessment Cooper Lyneis Cooper Els Ford Sterman
Although use model standard practice project planning risk management significantly help owner improve understanding project risk
Sensitivity analysis result quantitative risk analysis highly desirable
A sensitivity coefficient derivative change outcome respect change input
Even probability particular risk determined precisely sensitivity analysis used determine variable greatest influence risk
Because primary function risk analysis break problem essential element addressed management sensitivity analysis useful determining decision manager make get desired avoid undesired result
In absence hard data sensitivity analysis useful assessing validity risk model
Project simulation group enactment simulation operation manager project participant perform project activity virtual environment undertaking project
This type simulation may may supported computer emphasis computer model rather interaction participant effect interaction project outcome
For reason project simulation good team building project actually start
They inexpensive cost generally comparable cost technique cited long run compared typical approach jumping major project little preparation personnel working relationship
Engineering construction contractor developed project simulation method Halpin Martinez owner develop specify contractor perform simulation project start conjunction preproject planning effort Stochastic simulation model computerized probabilistic simulation computational solution typically use random number generator draw variate probability distribution
Because computer simulation performed random number method also called Monte Carlo simulation
The objective simulation find uncertainty empirical probability distribution variable based assumed uncertainty subjective probability distribution set variable ship dependent independent variable complex analytical solution
Thus iteration random simulation may considered experiment large number experiment give insight probability various outcome
Monte Carlo simulation typically used combine risk multiple risk factor useful determine whether total risk project great allow proceed determine appropriate amount contingency
This technique second two method explicitly cited OMB Circular No
OMB
Stochastic simulation differ multivariate statistical model typically based hard data
They useful absence real data based subjective assessment probability distribution require large database previous project information
An weakness method subjective assessment probability distribution often lack credibility may influenced bias
This overcome degree carefully structured application expert judgment Keemey von Winterfeldt
As case computer method quantitative risk analysis discussed validity method lie entirely validity probabilistic model
Monte Carlo simulation versatile applied virtually probabilistic model
However validity result may sometimes suspect due following factor The independent variable may actually independent The number iteration simulation may insufficient produce statistically valid result The probability distribution assumed independent variable subjective may biased provided project proponent
It certainly possible develop cost model example using causal parameter totally independent
However many risk analysis based model simply adopt standard engineering additive cost model total cost sum work package cost
The simulation simply add uncertainty associated work package may inaccurate work package necessarily independent
It computationally much easier perform Monte Carlo simulation analyst avoids need consider interaction variable simply assuming variable independent however analysis without consideration common mode failure lead estimation total project risk
In project risk assessment common mode could event environmental condition would cause many cost variable tend increase decrease simultaneously
It widely recognized single event cause effect number system ripple effect
If event occurs cost system increase whereas occur remain within budget
Thus affected cost definitely statistically independent
Collaboration people conversant specific risk project familiar probabilistic method typically required reduce bias produce realistic quantification project risk
Project owner ensure probabilistic input objective unbiased possible reason choosing specific probability distribution adequately documented
As method use stochastic simulation requires quality control
The owner policy procedure Monte Carlo simulation include caution project director manager limitation method commonly applied
The project director generally specialist Monte Carlo simulation need understand advantage limitation approach
This particularly true Monte Carlo simulation readily available common spreadsheet software used people little knowledge statistic
A project director know enough able critically evaluate stochastic simulation result plausibility accept result come computer
It common Monte Carlo simulation use far fewer iteration minimum normally required get statistically valid answer
But simulation insufficient iteration may underestimate probability tail distribution risk
See example Alder Feldman Taggo
Therefore simulation fewer random sample may indicate le risk one iteration
There mathematical formula Breyfogle used compute minimum number iteration acceptable confidence limit mean value tail distribution
If consultant contractor performing Monte Carlo simulation risk assessment would prudent owner project director review confidence limit value computed using Monte Carlo simulation ensure sufficient number iteration performed
The use Monte Carlo technique mathematically combining risk individual work package single project risk number obscure fact objective manage risk
As typically used Monte Carlo simulation tend focused total risk probability sensitivity analysis risk prioritization assessing possible outcome different proposed risk management policy
Additive model name implies combination risk factor based simple addition
An example summation cost element generate total project cost summation activity duration generate total project duration
These model relatively simple program based summation moment derived probability theory combine risk dependent well independent variable
If objective simply find probability distribution project cost estimate sum number work package activity stochastic simulation unnecessary
One advantage simple additive model easily understood usually obvious activity contribute total project uncertainty
This method basis program evaluation review technique PERT determining uncertainty project completion time
In project cost estimating total cost simply sum cost WBS work package
This purely linear relationship
Therefore estimating uncertainty total cost requires summing uncertainty individual cost account modified dependency
Probability theory tell u compute moment probability distribution total project cost summing moment uncertainty individual cost account Burlington May Hald
The number moment approximated finite number
This common method approximation example truncation Taylor Series one term order gain linear equation
The approach Benjamin Cornell us first two moment mean variance neglect third skewness higher
The approach deal full probability distribution us mean variance covariance first two moment characterize uncertainty
This approximation justified difficult even impossible estimate higher moment skewness kurtosis etc
accuracy even one possession large historical database
In case risk assessment probability distribution largely subjective based judgment experience rather hard data
There little point making highly precise computer calculation number estimated accurately anyway
There additional advantage approach Priorities risk mitigation obtained Pareto analysis using uncertainty individual risk factor correlation risk factor
Sensitivity analysis easily performed
As project progress estimate uncertainty future cost account activity readily revised based past performance project
This one method useful property
By comparing actual performance completed work package activity milestone prior estimated uncertainty one obtains revised estimate work package activity milestone yet come
Through analysis project director use information experience actual project revise estimate work go
This approach valuable tool program manager project director required report updated revised cost completion including confidence bound estimate every reporting period
Because method look forward instead backward project management method including earned value analysis unfavorable revision either expected cost completion uncertainty cost completion trigger management action
Conversely favorable revision either expected cost completion uncertainty cost could allow management reserve reallocated project greater need
See discussion managing risk project portfolio
The method provides simple convenient method adjustment risk hence adjustment required contingency project proceeds data obtained well badly performing
The objective approach react soon possible information recent project performance tends confirm refute current estimate
The key control parameter estimated cost time completion
For example best estimate cost completion updated recent progress information higher original estimate assuming scope change either risk overrunning budget greater originally estimated program management corrective action may needed bring project back target
Conversely updated best estimate cost completion lower original estimate required contingency decreased
In approach estimate future work package updated actual cost completed work package become available cost reporting system
Summary Risk Analysis Tools Tool Characteristics probability Qualitative simple use frequently used expanded three dimension combined FMEA Pareto diagram Simple qualitative method prioritizing risk element Failure mode effect analysis FMEA Qualitative used initial screening effective team environment Project Definition Rating Index Qualitative used project planning effective team environment Multivariate statistical model Quantitative requires historical database Event tree Quantitative rarely used risk analysis System dynamic model Both qualitative quantitative rarely used effective requires skilled modeler Sensitivity analysis Quantitative useful regardless process used useful absence hard data Project simulation Both qualitative quantitative useful team building expensive implement Stochastic simulation Quantitative frequently used often misused limitation must made clear Additive model Quantitative adjusted project progress provides summary qualitative quantitative method risk analysis reviewed section
Although additive model lack computational complexity stochastic risk assessment technique practical application adequate
From standpoint owner purpose project risk assessment minimize impact uncertainty project
How best accomplished vary circumstance general simple direct method proven self practice
This discount value stochastic model application need considered term contribution risk management
Probabilistic simulation particular value data sparse full range possible adverse event easily inferred
Provided sufficient number simulation performed boundary total project risk established
However vast majority project committee collective experience simpler model useful generating risk estimate used project management
Effective risk management essential success large project built operated Department Energy DOE particularly project characterize much mission
To enhance DOE risk management effort department asked NRC prepare summary effective practice used leading owner organization
The study primary objective provide DOE project manager basic understanding project owner risk management role effective oversight risk management activity delegated contractor

field computer science artificial intelligence concerned interaction computer human natural language particular concerned programming computer fruitfully process large natural language data
Challenges natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition natural language understanding natural language generation
The history NLP generally started although work found earlier period
In published article titled proposed called criterion intelligence
The involved fully sixty Russian sentence English
The author claimed within three five year machine translation would solved problem
However real progress much slower found research failed fulfill expectation funding machine translation dramatically reduced
Little research machine translation conducted late first system developed
Some notably successful NLP system developed natural language system working restricted restricted vocabulary simulation written
Using almost information human thought emotion ELIZA sometimes provided startlingly interaction
When patient exceeded small knowledge base ELIZA might provide generic response example responding My head hurt Why say head hurt
During many programmer began write conceptual ontology structured information data

During time many written including
Up NLP system based complex set rule
Starting late however revolution NLP introduction algorithm language processing
This due steady increase computational power see gradual lessening dominance theory linguistics
whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged sort underlies approach language processing
Some machine learning algorithm produced system hard rule similar existing rule
However introduced use NLP increasingly research focused make soft decision based attaching weight feature making input data
The upon many system rely example statistical model
Such model generally robust given unfamiliar input especially input contains error common data produce reliable result integrated larger system comprising multiple subtasks
Many notable early success occurred field due especially work IBM Research successively complicated statistical model developed
These system able take advantage existing multilingual produced result law calling translation governmental proceeding official language corresponding system government
However system depended corpus specifically developed task implemented system often continues major limitation success system
As result great deal research gone method effectively learning limited amount data
Recent research increasingly focused algorithm
Such algorithm able learn data desired answer using combination annotated data
Generally task much difficult typically produce le accurate result given amount input data
However enormous amount data available including among thing entire content often make inferior result
In recent year flurry result showing technique achieving result many natural language task example language modeling parsing many others
Since statistical revolution late mid much Natural Language Processing research relied heavily
Formerly many task typically involved direct hand coding rule general robust natural language variation
The paradigm call instead using automatically learn rule analysis large typical example plural corpus set document possibly human computer annotation
Many different class machine learning algorithm applied NLP task
These algorithm take input large set feature generated input data
Some algorithm produced system hard rule similar system rule common
Increasingly however research focused make soft decision based attaching weight input feature
Such model advantage express relative certainty many different possible answer rather one producing reliable result model included component larger system
Systems based algorithm many advantage rule The following list commonly researched task NLP
Note task direct application others commonly serve subtasks used aid solving larger task
Though NLP task obviously closely intertwined frequently convenience subdivided category

A software performs programming language another
There two basic language processing software follows

A software program designed used perform task processing program code machine code
Language processor found language
There type main type language processor
The difference interpreter translator interpreter telling computer interpreting program code computer
A translator take program code convert machine code allowing computer read machine code
The interpreter tell computer translator let computer figure


In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

The performance CPU affected number core clock speed memory
There different type volatile memory
Computers require input hardware processing hardware output hardware
The hardware defines computer
Without computer could function
The CPU memory work together run program

The GPU responsible handling image free CPU task
CPU memory speed affect overall speed computer
If one significantly slower slow others
test used ass performance computer
Different type benchmark software used different kind application might want computer
It difficult ass performance CPU computer might excel task well others

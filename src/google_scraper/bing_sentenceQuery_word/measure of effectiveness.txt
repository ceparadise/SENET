often measurable ability avoid wasting material energy effort money time something producing desired result
In general sense ability thing well successfully without waste
In mathematical scientific term measure extent input well used intended task function output
It often specifically comprises capability specific application effort produce specific outcome minimum amount quantity waste expense unnecessary effort
Efficiency course refers different input output different field industry
Efficiency often confused
In general efficiency measurable concept quantitatively determined ratio useful output total input
Effectiveness simpler concept able achieve desired result expressed quantitatively usually require complicated mathematics addition
Efficiency often expressed percentage result could ideally expected example energy lost due friction cause case fuel input would used produce desired result
This always apply even case efficiency assigned numerical value

A common confusing way distinguishing efficiency effectiveness saying Efficiency thing right effectiveness right thing
This saying indirectly emphasizes selection objective production process important quality process
This saying popular business however obscures common sense effectiveness produce following mnemonic Efficiency thing right effectiveness getting thing done
This make clear effectiveness example large production number also achieved inefficient process example worker willing used working longer hour greater physical effort company country forced
Similarly company achieve effectiveness example large production number inefficient process afford use energy per product example energy price labor cost lower competitor
For example one may measure directly two object communicating downloading music directly computer mobile device efficient using mobile device microphone record music sound come computer speaker
Efficiency often measured ratio useful output total input expressed mathematical formula amount useful output product produced per amount cost resource consumed
This may correspond percentage product consumables quantified compatible unit consumables transformed product via conservative process
For example analysis product may amount useful work output consumable amount heat input
Due never greater efficiency never greater fact must even le finite temperature

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I wondering standard way measuring sortedness array
Would array median number possible inversion considered maximally unsorted
By I mean basically far possible either sorted reverse sorted
No depends application
The measure sortedness often refered function N R N collection finite sequence distinct nonnegative integer
The survey Wood list discus different measure disorder context adaptive sorting algorithm
The number inversion might work case sometimes insufficient
An example given sequence n quadratic number inversion consists two ascending run
It nearly sorted captured inversion
Mannila axiomatizes presortedness focus algorithm follows paraphrasing
Let totally ordered set
Then mapping sequence distinct element natural satisfies condition
If X sorted X
If X Y X Y j X Y
If X subsequence Y X Y
If j X Y X Y X Y
X X X E X
Examples measure Note random distribution using measure defined
make sequence sorted le likely
These called distribution Ch
Example special case distribution
The weight parametric constant fulfill Pr X X Y Y
Note defines uniform distribution
Since possible sample permutation
measure efficiently body work useful practice benchmarking sorting algorithm

In computing world concept virtual machine used solve many problem
From partitioning machine creating independent programming language creating operating system concept virtual machine proven powerful tool shaping computer
However idea always clear everyone mid idea put practice
Around researcher IBM attempting measure actual effectiveness new idea computer science field
The researcher needed way shut new feature could measure performance machine option
These researcher based IBM Yorktown Research center
They devised scheme needed able partition machine smaller piece
These piece needed able manage resource researcher could test many different condition system time without altering piece system
They believed implementation virtual machine could work extremely well experiment
After experiment IBM eventually went developed implementation notion virtual machine began selling real world Operating System multiple user environment
Many business university use Operating System allows share power resource available mainframe computer many people
Each user virtual machine work within thereby sharing resource every user without affecting user
This machine known IBM System IBM System
These machine make use IBM operating system collectively referred VM lineage
This implementation virtual machine proven quite powerful machine still sold today
The idea virtual machine since used solve many computing problem
Problems computer program portability operating system design
One first implementation utilize virtual machine address problem Unix operating system
The Unix operating system spawned paper published Denise Richie Ken Thompson Bell Labs
Their idea Unix operating system quickly adapted computer used university
From university quickly spread commercial computer industry graduating student
From IEEE standard board began POSIX Portable Operating System project provide standard Unix Library function
The idea software producer could write program code using standard library function port code Unix system
In IEEE POSIX project published Information Technology Portable Operating System Interface
This specified standard Unix shell utility routine formalized specification Unix Application Interface enabling Unix process operate separate virtual machine
One problem plagued programmer many year idea creating truly portable computer program
In word programmer want write one program work platform
In mid idea nearly made possible utilizing idea virtual machine create Java programming language
The idea Java programming language however new idea
It actually thought late gentleman named Bill Joy
Joy thought creating language would merge best feature MESA Other project like Sun however intervened would many year idea became reality
By early Joy getting tired huge program
In late Joy wrote paper called outlined pitch Sun engineer produce object environment based
Around time James Gosling working several month SGML editor called Imagination using
Due frustration Imagination project Oak programming language created
Patrick Naughton started Green Project December
Naughton defined project effort fewer thing better
That December recruited Gosling Mike Sheridan help start project
Joy showed paper work began graphic user interface issue several month In April Green Project Naughton Gosling Sheridan settled smart consumer electronics delivery platform Gosling started working heavily Oak programming language
Gosling wrote original compiler C Naughton Gosling Sheridan wrote also Oak running first program August
By fall cross PDA remote control ready This demoed Scott McNealy Sun president October
Following Green Project set First Person wholly owned Sun subsidiary
In early Green team heard request proposal settop box operating system
First Person quickly shifted focus smart consumer electronics box OS market placed bid
Fortuitously Sun lost bid
First Person continued work settop box early concluded like smart consumer electronics settop box hype reality
Without market seen First Person rolled back Sun
However around time realized requirement smart consumer electronics settop box software small platform independent secure reliable code requirement nascent web
For third time project redirected time web
A prototype browser called WebRunner written Patrick Naughton
After additional work Naughton Jonathan Payne browser became HotJava
In Oak renamed Java
In May first Java Development Kit JDK alpha released
Since time several revision leading current version JDK

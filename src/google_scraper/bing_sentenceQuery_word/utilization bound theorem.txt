Besides classical ca comparison sort faster n logn lower bound know algorithm
I ca seem dig via google scholar yet must exist
I especially interested polynomial time algorithm
proof ca solve polynomial time unless P NP
Thanks

Partial order theory widely employed computer science particularly logic formal method programming language static analysis
But partial order theory intertwined field like topology zoo definition concept attached area
Not commonly used computer science
In article I summarized fragment partial order theory commonly used computer science particular home fragment static analysis
Topics covered include preorders equivalence relation total order partial order semilattices lattice bounded lattice complete lattice monotonicity fixed point Kleene fixed point theorem
At end find natural liftings partial order lattice across power set Cartesian product sequence function space
Where applicable formal definition transliterated Haskell
If interested partial order theory static analysis check appendix It comprehensive
The header Haskell code file And ghc extension used A binary relation set X iff relation reflexive transitive
A binary relation R x R x x
A binary relation R R b b R c implies R c
An preorder also symmetric
A binary relation R R b implies b R
An equivalence relation divide set S equivalence class
The element x x The set equivalence class X relation set
Every preorder induces natural equivalence relation A preorder antisymmetric
A set X equipped partial order often described pair X
A binary relation R R b b R implies b
In Haskell define partial order type class A binary relation total transitive antisymmetric
A binary relation R two value b R b b R
Totality implies reflexivity mean every total order also partial order
A poset two element b greatest lower bound denoted b
The greatest lower bound b largest element still le
In lattice greatest lower bound must unique
The greatest lower bound b also called b
The following property A poset two element b least upper bound denoted b
The least upper bound b smallest element still greater
In lattice least upper bound must unique
The least upper bound b also called b
The following property If poset meet semilattice join semilattice poset also
In Haskell lattice partial order meet join defined A lattice L exists maximum element top minimum element bottom set L
For element x lattice must case In Haskell type class bounded lattice defines top bottom A lattice L every possibly infinite subset S L least upper bound sup S greatest lower bound inf S
Every complete lattice L bounded lattice Given posets X Y function f X Y x x implies f x f x
To define continuous function first need define function application across set
Given function f X Y S X f x x S
Alternately f f
In text function application notationally distinguished ordinary function application
Given lattice X Y function f X Y S X implies f sup S sup
function also monotonic
Given function f X X x f x f x
With respect monotonic function f X X complete lattice X divide set X region It useful distinguish least greatest fixed point The following property hold region I recommend proving property short exercise
Given monotonic function f L L lattice L starting point x L set K x The notation mean iterated function composition If x Asc f ascending order chain K x since x x x Asc f
In Haskell infinite list represents Kleene chain starting bottom On lattice Kleene fixed point theorem say Moreover lattice finite height exists natural n lfp f
This fact lead simple algorithm computing fixed point
The function look first element sequence repeat neighbor So least fixed point function look stable point Kleene sequence There several natural liftings posets lattice across foundational discrete data structure flat set power set Cartesian product sum sequence function
Given set S pointed poset contains bottom And pointed poset contains top If S poset order extended pointing lattice In Haskell Given set S lift S L x iff In Haskell Given collection posets naturally lift partial order poset If posets lattice resulting poset lattice default
To make lattice must pointed
Given lattice natural Cartesian product lattice In Haskell Given poset L natural sequence poset As sum sequence must pointed become lattice
That sequence greater lesser sequence sequence different length always incomparable
In Haskell Given set S subset S form lattice inclusion P S
Given partial order X define preordered set P X Why partial order
Consider set natural number natural total order
Under regime yet violates antisymmetry
Of course possible lift preorder partial order equivalence class
Alternatively set canonicalized equivalence class represented single distinguished member
If preorder also partial order possible lift partial order equivalence class preorder
Given preordered set X natural partial order equivalence class poset b iff b b Given lattice Y set X natural lattice lattice X Y In Haskell This post scratch surface order theory leaf even application computer science
The two biggest omission reserved future post ordinal Scott domain theory
The ordinal extend natural number transfinite arithmetic provide powerful structure
That structure powerful mechanism reasoning program termination
Scott domain theory give meaningful interpretation infinitely recursive domain equation arise denotational semantics
If like learn Haskell I recommend And using Haskell I recommend

My computer science teacher say Big O upper bound lower bound
When I look graph algorithm mapped using BigO though upper bound
The upper limit go forever
So mean say upper bound context BigO
BigO simply put measure algorithm complexity
In best case scenario even worst algorithm may finished one
However different operation different complexity
These complexity could considered upper bound
An algorithm different running duration based size data handling
As example let consider simple data structure could implemented number way let use array decide want search structure piece data
The number operation based size collection data
Let assume element structure
A typical array worst case iterate entire collection meaning perform operation resulting complexity
Let assume data sorted could perform binary search resulting operation reducing complexity
It could still completed one operation approached infinite number complexity would approach infinite execution time
This probably seeing class
Different algorithm complexity approach infinite execution level different rate n
n log n
Edit As per comment noted change amount data also reflected change execution time based complexity
O algorithm change logarithmic one change logarithmic manner linear algorithm linearly etc
Essentially doubling amount data may NOT double execution time
You may quadruple increase smaller larger factor
For complex example work required figure complexity course general idea The worst case give u upper bound performance
Analyzing worst case guarantee never perform worse determine

Rate monotonic scheduling look run modeling thread system determines much time needed meet guarantee set thread question
proved set periodic task unique period feasible schedule always meet deadline exists utilization specific bound depending number task
The schedulability test RMS computation time release period deadline one period later number process scheduled
For example two process
When number process tends towards expression tend towards Therefore rough estimate RMS meet deadline CPU utilization le
The CPU dedicated non task
It known randomly generated periodic task system meet deadline utilization le however fact depends knowing exact task statistic period deadline guaranteed task set

The algorithm also optimal equal period deadline fact case algorithm identical addition deadline monotonic scheduling optimal deadline le period
For task model deadline greater period Audsley algorithm endowed exact schedulability test model find optimal priority assignment
In many practical application resource shared unmodified subject hazard
In practice solved disabling preemption
Alternative method use avoid sharing across thread different priority
This resource conflict result first place
Priority inheritance algorithm characterized two parameter
First inheritance lazy essential immediate boost priority conflict
Second inheritance optimistic boost minimum amount pessimistic boost minimum amount In practice mathematical difference term system utilization bound lazy immediate algorithm immediate algorithm efficient implement one used practical system
An example usage basic priority inheritance related reset bug fixed Mars changing creation flag semaphore enable priority inheritance
The utilization The sufficient condition process conclude system schedulable Since system surely schedulable
But remember condition necessary one
So say system higher utilization schedulable scheduling algorithm

We show system task deadline large better result obtained making task deadline harmonic
The paper proposes novel solution feasibility problem periodic task system assumption composite deadline providing utilization based exact test upper bound complexity

I given question Consider system running ten task one task
Assume task issue operation every millisecond CPU computing operation take millisecond complete
Also assume overhead millisecond process long running task Describe CPU utilization scheduler
The time quantum millisecond b
The time quantum millisecond I found answer The time quantum millisecond Irrespective process scheduled scheduler incurs millisecond cost every
This result CPU utilization
The time quantum millisecond The task incur context switch using millisecond time quantum
The time required cycle process therefore task executes incur context switch task whereas bound task executes millisecond incurring context switch
The CPU utilization therefore
My question person deriving formula CPU Utilization
I ca seem stand getting number
For first case every task us work switch thus spending every msec work
For second case similar msec spent go task actual work
This best possible explanation problem I going question
understood In first case time quantum msec think gantt chart bound process come let call followed CPU bound
total context switch effective work done CPU msec ie CPU utilization way case switch last one CPU bound process consider msec time
effective time cpu worked
CPU utilization I confused beyond belief reason question looking answer I finally understood carefully looking link given another user
There formula I could find book maybe I missed version answer kind style WARNING This probably wrong maybe show I went wrong
process process context switch b process process context switch By posting answer agree

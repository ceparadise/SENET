In part responsible loading
It one essential stage process starting program place program memory prepares execution
Loading program involves reading content containing program instruction memory carrying required preparatory task prepare executable running
Once loading complete operating system start program passing control loaded program code
All operating system support program loading loader apart highly specialized computer system fixed set specialized program
typically loader instead code executes directly ROM
In order load operating system part specialized used
In many operating system loader permanently resident memory although operating system support may allow loader located region memory
In case operating system support virtual memory loader may actually copy content executable file memory rather may simply declare virtual memory subsystem mapping region memory allocated contain running program code content associated executable file
See
The virtual memory subsystem made aware page region memory need filled demand program execution actually hit area unfilled memory
This may mean part program code actually copied memory actually used unused code may never loaded memory
In loader
The Unix loader task include In loader function contained following Some operating system need adjust address pointer executable compensate variation address loading start
The operating system need relocating loader program always loaded location address space pointer absolute address rather offset program
Some example IBM mainframe descendant including mainframe
In descendant system privileged operating system facility called IEWFETCH internal component OS Supervisor whereas LOADER application perform many function plus Linkage Editor entirely external OS Supervisor although certainly us many Supervisor service
IEWFETCH utilizes highly specialized theoretically possible load relocate entire executable within one revolution DASD medium m maximum m average legacy rpm drive
For load module exceed track size also possible load relocate entire module without losing revolution medium
IEWFETCH also incorporates facility overlay structure facilitates running potentially large executables minimum memory model small KB version OS KB KB common
The OS always resident portion Supervisor formatted way compatible version IEWFETCH
Unlike normal executables OS nucleus scatter loaded part nucleus loaded different portion memory particular certain system table required reside initial KB table code may reside elsewhere
The system application named IEWL
IEWL main function associate load module executable program object module output say assembler compiler including automatic call library language function format may efficiently loaded IEWFETCH
There large number editing option conventional application commonly employed
The load module format includes initial text record followed immediately relocation control record text record followed instance text record relocation control record pair end module
The text record usually large relocation control record small IEWFETCH three relocation control record buffer fixed byte smaller relocation control record certainly possible byte maximum possible IEWL ensures limitation complied inserting additional relocation record required next text record necessary special case sequence record may text record relocation record control record text record
A special byte within relocation control record buffer used disabled bit spin communication area initialized unique value
The Read CCW relocation control record Program Controlled Interrupt bit set
The processor thereby notified CCW accessed channel via special exit
At point processor enters disabled bit spin loop sometimes called shortest loop world
Once byte changed initialized value processor instantaneously know reading relocation control record completed bit spin terminated relocation may proceed synchronously rotation medium relocation occurs gap within medium relocation control record next text record
If relocation text record completed NOP CCW changed TIC loading relocating proceed using next buffer
If channel encounter NOP CCW channel program terminate restarted IEWFETCH via another special IOS exit
The three buffer continuous circular queue pointing next last pointing first three buffer constantly reused loading relocating proceeds
IEWFETCH thereby load relocate load module practical size minimum possible time
another type loader load link like already loaded running program

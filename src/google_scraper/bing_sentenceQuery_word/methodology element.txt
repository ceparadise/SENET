In serf element two principal operation The order element come stack give rise alternative name
Additionally operation may give access top without modifying stack
The name stack type structure come analogy set physical item stacked top make easy take item top stack getting item deeper stack may require taking multiple item first
Considered abstractly sequential collection push pop operation occur one end structure referred stack
This make possible implement stack pointer top element
A stack may implemented bounded capacity
If stack full contain enough space accept entity pushed stack considered state
The pop operation remove item top stack
Stacks entered computer science literature used term bury unbury mean calling returning subroutine
Subroutines already implemented proposed idea filed patent March Bauer received invention stack principle
The concept developed independently Australian first half
Stacks often described analogy stack plate cafeteria
Clean plate placed top stack pushing already
When plate removed stack one pop become new top
In many implementation stack operation push pop
An example top stack observes element without removing stack
Since done pop push data essential
An underflow condition occur stack top operation stack empty pop
Also implementation often function return whether stack empty
A stack easily implemented either
What identifies data structure stack either case implementation interface user allowed pop push item onto array linked list helper operation
The following demonstrate implementation using
An array used implement bounded stack follows
The first element usually bottom resulting first element pushed onto stack last element popped
The program must keep track size length stack using variable record number item pushed far therefore pointing place array next element inserted assuming index convention
Thus stack effectively implemented structure The operation add element increment index checking overflow Similarly decrement index checking underflow return item previously top one Using possible implement stack grow shrink much needed
The size stack simply size dynamic array efficient implementation stack since adding item removing item end dynamic array requires amortized O time
Another option implementing stack use
A stack pointer head list perhaps counter keep track size list Pushing popping item happens head list overflow possible implementation unless memory exhausted Some language make stack operation push pop available standard type
Some language notably family including designed around stack directly visible manipulated programmer
The following example manipulating stack Lisp interpreter prompt line starting interpreter response expression Several container type operation LIFO semantics additionally template class adapts existing container provide restricted operation
PHP class
Java library contains class specialization
Following example program language using class
A common use stack architecture level mean allocating accessing memory
A typical stack area computer memory fixed origin variable size
Initially size stack zero
A usually form hardware register point recently referenced location stack stack size zero stack pointer point origin stack
The two operation applicable stack There many variation basic principle stack operation
Every stack fixed location memory begin
As data item added stack stack pointer displaced indicate current extent stack expands away origin
Stack pointer may point origin stack limited range address either origin depending direction stack grows however stack pointer cross origin stack
In word origin stack address stack grows downwards towards address stack pointer must never incremented beyond etc
If pop operation stack cause stack pointer move past origin stack occurs
If push operation cause stack pointer increment decrement beyond maximum extent stack occurs
Some environment rely heavily stack may provide additional operation example Stacks often visualized growing bottom like stack
They may also visualized growing left right topmost becomes rightmost even growing top bottom
The important feature bottom stack fixed position
The illustration section example growth visualization top stack bottom since stack top item pushed popped
A move first element third position second first third second
Here two equivalent visualization process A stack usually represented computer block memory cell bottom fixed location stack pointer holding address current top cell stack
The top bottom terminology used irrespective whether stack actually grows towards lower memory address towards higher memory address
Pushing item stack adjusts stack pointer size item either decrementing incrementing depending direction stack grows memory pointing next cell copy new top item stack area
Depending exact implementation end push operation stack pointer may point next unused location stack may point topmost item stack
If stack point current topmost item stack pointer updated new item pushed onto stack point next available location stack updated new item pushed onto stack
Popping stack simply inverse pushing
The topmost item stack removed stack pointer updated opposite order used push operation
Many design including dedicated register use stack pointer dedicated call return push pop instruction implicitly update dedicated register thus increasing density
Some CISC processor like also typically stack pointer well
In contrast CPU design dedicated stack instruction therefore register may used stack pointer needed
The architecture example set register organised stack direct access individual register relative current top also possible
As machine general implicit argument allows small footprint good usage also prevents type optimization possible processor permitting two three operand
A stack structure also make implementation somewhat complex implement although still feasible exemplified modern implementation
example architecture using within another strategy avoid use slow main memory function argument return value
There also number small microprocessor implement stack directly hardware stack directly accessible
Examples line
Many microprocessor used implement programming language level
Stacks also used basis number mainframe mini computer
Such machine called famous
Calculators employing use stack structure hold value
Expressions represented prefix postfix infix notation conversion one form another may accomplished using stack
Many compiler use stack parsing syntax expression program block etc
translating low level code
Most programming language allowing parsed stack based machine
Another important application stack
Consider simple example finding correct path maze
There series point starting point destination
We start one point
To reach final destination several path
Suppose choose random path
After following certain path realise path chosen wrong
So need find way return beginning path
This done use stack
With help stack remember point reached
This done pushing point stack
In case end wrong path pop last point stack thus return last point continue quest find right path
This called backtracking
The prototypical example backtracking algorithm find vertex graph reached specified starting vertex
Other application backtracking involve searching space represent potential solution optimization problem
technique performing backtracking search without exhaustively searching potential solution space
A number meaning define basic operation adding two number printing character taking argument stack placing return value back stack
For example return stack operand stack also graphic state stack dictionary stack
Many also including
Almost way receive parameter return special stack hold information calling nesting order switch context called function restore caller function calling finish
The function follow runtime protocol caller callee save argument return value stack
Stacks important way supporting nested function call
This type stack used implicitly compiler support CALL RETURN statement equivalent manipulated directly programmer
Some programming language use stack store data local procedure
Space local data item allocated stack procedure entered deallocated procedure exit
The typically implemented way
Using stack data procedure call important security implication see programmer must aware order avoid introducing serious security bug program
Several use stack separate usual function call stack programming language principle organize information
These include Some computing environment use stack way may make vulnerable security breach attack
Programmers working environment must take special care avoid pitfall implementation
For example programming language use common stack store data local called procedure linking information allows procedure return caller
This mean program move data stack contains critical return address procedure call
If data moved wrong location stack oversized data item moved stack location large enough contain return information procedure call may corrupted causing program fail
Malicious party may attempt attack take advantage type implementation providing oversized data input program check length input
Such program may copy data entirety location stack may change return address procedure called
An attacker experiment find specific type data provided program return address current procedure reset point area within stack within data provided attacker turn contains instruction carry unauthorized operation
This type attack variation attack extremely frequent source security breach software mainly popular compiler use shared stack data procedure call verify length data item
Frequently programmer write code verify size data item either oversized undersized data item copied stack security breach may occur

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I currently hard time understanding author using word correctly paper classified BS
Hence I set get better feeling correct use word I even confused First I look state Methodology systematic theoretical analysis method applied field study theoretical analysis body method principle associated branch knowledge
This sentence followed second sentence reference paper
Irny far I could see state something contracting Methodology generally guideline solving problem specific component phase task method technique tool two source given Even though I think wikipedia description identical understanding term reference confusion
I asked help
Here say body method rule postulate employed discipline particular procedure set procedure analysis principle procedure inquiry particular field Oxford say discipline branch knowledge I would interpret thing like math sociology computer science psychology thing like UML modeling crossword solving method solving problem even sticking together method solve problem
This match part definition
And give weird example Â solving crossword puzzle usual methodology begin filling answer I reasonably sure ofÂ Maybe bracket indicate chose poor example consider crossword discipline case
It obviously qualify case example analyse method used crossword domain
Sadly Oxford defines term system method used particular area study activity methodology investigating concept focal point Which used problem theorecial study method field
Only Methodology buzzword section wikipedia seems back understanding term Many recent us word methodology mistakenly treat synonym method body method
Doing shift away true epistemological meaning reduces procedure set tool instrument outcome
A methodology design process carrying research development procedure instrument thing
Using synonym method set method lead misinterpretation undermines proper analysis go designing research
Is understanding methodology name suggests logic behind method consequently must deal topic per se address meta level used method wrong
For particular academic problem CS Is combination general priciples rule part standard creating particular type operating system methodology
used AUTOSAR
Such principle rule govern describe communication mechanism memory access method scheduling like
I would call body method hence must buzzword
My Sixth edition Oxford say Science method body method used particular branch activity So current version dumped actual meaning used weird body method definition
I happy source bringing clarity mess
Do worry ca answer CS specific question general purpose answer may well good
Words fixed meaning dictionary follow usage
That happening
The word turn branch philosophy dealing knowledge
This classical meaning discus WP encyclopedia dictionary list meaning given word
It also one definition say analysis principle procedure inquiry particular field Now language evolves addition meaning sense second meaning developing
This new meaning noted
Now every language evolution clearly written point view see section
The go say Etymologically refers study method
Thus use synonym simple term
Well sod Hades
It clear thus considered acceptable
Since exists also word method one could argue use methodology full epistemological meaning definition Merriam Webster discourse science method
In practice lot people use two word almost interchangeably
There reason method rather narrow descriptive flavor methodology invokes knowledge fundamental principle logic science whatever else pertinent case specific method descend
So write methodology followed paper mean refer fact aware philosophical epistemological foundation weakness method
Even aware sense make u afterwards claim employed widely used method using word methodology accept responsibility clear opinion way even really
One meaning methodology synonym method
That used technical literature common use
Another meaning study method
And yet another body method particular field
You find writer celebrated expert craft use word meaning question technical usage versus casual usage
As writes language defined usage evolves constantly
Nevertheless writer expectation reader mind also primarily expectation commissioning editor gatekeeper publication
If descriptivist may work order get published
If style guide work must work
Your goal get paper published fighting change publisher style guide different separate battle mix
So find whether using methodology method paradigm read comparable paper target journal see commonly used context analagous
If clear ask contact editor journal
Maybe strictness definition
Maybe I friend speak Greek
But I always understood log part declension
So methodology would regard part method
Given discussing methodology writer go great detail definition seems fit
Part I treat log synonym part used independently English
Consider log tree tree sliced slice part log
A timelog datalog essentially bunch separate entry single document
You find lot similar use Some thought I think lot recent use methodology stem bigger word therefore sounding sophisticated intellectual
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

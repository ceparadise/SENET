Agile method collection different technique practice share value basic principle
provides coverage important concept issue trend technology agile software
This Premier Reference Source present research instruction used develop implement software quickly small iteration cycle close cooperation customer adaptive way
It comprehensive guide help researcher practitioner agile software development process avoid risk project failure frequently encountered traditional software project
The many academic area covered publication include limited I happy see editor succeeded collecting chapter build upon one another importantly form coherent whole addressing relevant issue people management coding including experience collected industry
And addressed perspective software quality
Agile method drastically alter software development process
Agile software process extreme programming XP Scrum rely best practice considered improve software development quality
It said best practice aim induce software quality assurance SQA project hand
Proponents agile method claim nature method quality agile software project natural outcome applied method
As consequence agile software development quality assurance ASDQA le embedded agile software process SQA practice integrated across entire development requirement final release
Thus agile method introduce different perspective QA software development
Agile practice expected handle unstable volatile requirement throughout development lifecycle deliver software fewer defect error shorter timeframes predefined budget constraint
The iterative incremental way development allows customer requirement revision mechanism customer active participation process
Customer participation provides needed feedback mechanism ensuring customer perceived satisfaction final product
It also known agile method make key business user strong partner assuring quality
Rather completely leaving quality professional agile project make key user responsible ensuring application fit purpose
Agile development embrace test driven development test first design coming arena good practice introducing mainstream development minimizing error defect final product
Some practises simple planning designing pair programming short iteration cycle small release continuous integration common code ownership metaphor potentially reinforce quality assurance
It interesting note previously mentioned practice cover support significant extent total quality management TQM see Crosby Deming Feigenbaum Ishikawa Juran Gryna referenced Chapter II
We remind reader TQM system comprises four key common element customer focus process improvement human side quality measurement analysis
Agile method deal one way another four element
Many report support evangelize advantage agile method respect quality assurance even term avoided coming traditional bureaucratic development
Is
For example case agile method assure quality default software developer need concerned quality issue quality planning quality audit quality report
Proponents agile method must provide convincing answer question quality software produced evidence support superiority agile quality There little published work focus agile software development quality issue
In particular literature gap providing critical view agile quality pinpointing area agile method strong also area need improvement
This book pursues ambitious goal attempt provide answer question issue previously raised

It precisely quality point view book look agile method
The area wide entail many facet book attempt clarify including Book chapter provide theoretical discussion ASDQA issue result lesson practical ASDQA application
Eventually book expected provide successful quality management tip help participant agile software development process avoid risk project failure frequently encountered traditional software project
Because task extremely difficult given variety agile method relatively limited time exercised scattered often vague information regarding agile quality field book could edited written small group
The book take form collection edited chapter
Authors chapter cover kind activity related agile method academician practitioner consultant involved heavily practicing researching teaching agile method
Authors come almost world North America Europe Asia Africa employed kind organization involved agile development university research institute small large agile company
This book made chapter organized four section
Section title following Section I Introduction Agile Methods Quality Section II Quality within Agile Development Section III Quality within Agile Process Management Section IV Agile Methods Quality Field Experience Section I Introduction Agile Methods Quality provides framework rest book
It particularly useful reader familiar aspect agile method
It review agile method compare traditional approach
Section I start posing question quality achieved potential problem agile method today
It also start propose solution certain identified issue
Section II Quality within Agile Development examines quality pursued throughout software development
It give flavour developer achieve quality agile fashion
Chapters section review quality assurance specifying requirement handling defect user interface designed implemented
Section III Quality within Agile Process Management examines quality pursued throughout handling agile software process
This section deal activity run parallel development prepare development team effective work
It give flavour manager achieve quality agile fashion
Two chapter Section review quality assurance managing agile software configuration agile people managed
Finally critical theme future addressed namely education next generation agile developer manager ASDQA issue
Section IV Agile Methods Quality Field Experience provides feedback agile method application
Although chapter try capture experience agile project incorporate theoretical framework chapter section come right agile company
Interestingly two Chapters come quite large company signalling expansion agile method realm traditional software development
Chapters provide invaluable information agile project management quality measurement test driven development finally lesson learned ASDQA real world application
A brief description chapter follows
Chapters organized according section belong
Section I Introduction Agile Methods Quality In Chapter I Ernest Mnkandla Barry Dwolatzky South Africa analyze define agile methodology software development
They taking software quality assurance perspective
The chapter start defining agile methodology three perspective theoretical definition functional nition contextualized definition
Next brief review traditional understanding quality assurance given author proceeds certain innovation agility added world quality
Doing text provides understanding agile methodology quality along expectation future field
An analysis framework used objectively analyzing comparing agile methodology
The framework illustrated applying three specific agile methodology
In Chapter II Eleni Berki Finland Kerstin Siakas Greece Elli Georgiadou UK provide discussion analysis quality characteristic agile information system develop ment process
They question ASDQA exposing concern regarding applicability suitability agile method different organisational national culture
They argue based recent literature review published report agile Methodologies
A unique feature chapter author draw experience different European country Denmark England Finland Greece diverse academic work value information system development ISD industrial practice based different principle
They relate compare traditional agile managed measured ISD process explore human dynamic affect success consensus acceptance software system propose critical framework reflecting suitability applicability agile method development management quality software system
To achieve author examine different European perception quality agile paradigm compare contrast quality perception established ISD methodological paradigm
In Chapter III Tom Gilb Norway proposes quantification agile process reinforce ASDQA
He claim agile method could benefit using quantified approach across entire implementation process throughout development production delivery
He discus thing quantification requirement design estimation measurement delivered result
He outline main benefit adopting approach identifying communication requirement feedback progress tracking area probable benefit
The chapter present benefit quantification proposes specific quantification approach Planguage finally describes successful case study quantifying quality Norwegian organization
Section II Quality within Agile Development In chapter Vagelis Monochristou Maro Vlachopoulou Greece review quality assurance requirement specification development phase
Such phase known give lot problem injects hard detect correct defect documentation software
The author discus several approach suggest way managing requirement software requirement specification use case interaction design scenario etc
They emphasize fact many real user requirement appear development phase following initial one
One way cope situation involve development phase well
When provided insight various developed update requirement
However accommodate role within development cycle software organization must take approach
Agile method alternative approach iterative incremental way development propose
Allowing iteration gradual system building user requirement revision mechanism active user participation encouraged supported throughout development system
User story agile answer problem thoroughly discussed illustrated chapter
Although previous chapter told u capture avoid problem user requirement defect still injected software code
In agile software development maintenance phase allows continuous improvement software system removing quality defect refactoring
However schedule constraint quality defect removed one refactoring phase
Documentation quality defect found automated manual discovery activity pair programming necessary avoid waste time rediscovering later phase
However lack documentation handling existing quality defect refactoring activity typical problem agile software maintenance
In order understand reason modifying code one must consult either proprietary documentation software versioning system
Rech Germany author chapter describes process sustainable discovery handling treatment quality defect software His proposed tool assuring quality context annotation language capable register information quality defect found source code representing defect treatment activity software
One additional benefit using annotation language also useful testing inspection activity
In chapter Atif Memon Qing Xie USA adopt strong approach assuring quality developing agile mode
They discus need new agile testing mechanism neatly integrated agile software propose new concentric technique effectively utilizes resource iterative development
They call inner loop testing applied code software
The second loop called smoke testing operates build
The outermost loop called loop executed major version software available
The author illustrate approach critical part today software system namely graphical user interface GUI
They choose GUI GUI development quite suitable agile development rapid testing system particularly challenging
They describe detail GUI model used implement technique
Section III Quality within Agile Process Management Chapters section focus project activity parallel development software configuration management SCM essential part software process
Because frequent change multiple iteration software version SCM particular importance agile project
In chapter Lars Bendix Ekman Sweden discus peculiarity agile SCM argue SCM need done differently extended fashion traditional development
They also define way quality assured application SCM
To first provide brief introduction focal SCM principle list number typical agile activity related SCM
Next explain reader possible define certain general SCM guideline support strengthen typical agile activity
They describe characteristic agile method necessary order take full advantage SCM consequence better assure quality
Following proposed guideline agile project obtain best result SCM according agile method applies project particular context
This chapter deal completely different process issue previous chapter namely management human resource involved agile development
Panagiotis Sfetsos Ioannis Stamelos Greece argue human factor still critical success software engineering general

concept design system one existing
A known system communicable unforgeable authority
It refers value along associated set
A must use capability access object
security refers principle designing user program directly share capability according operating system infrastructure necessary make transaction efficient secure
security contrasted approach us
Although operating system implement facility resembles capability typically provide enough support allow exchange capability among possibly mutually untrusting entity primary mean granting distributing access right throughout system
A system contrast designed goal mind
Capabilities discussed article confused
The latter privilege transferred process
Capabilities achieve objective improving system security used place forgeable
A forgeable reference example identifies object specify access right appropriate object user program hold reference
Consequently attempt access referenced object must validated operating system based requesting program typically via use ACL
Instead system capability mere fact user program posse capability entitles use referenced object accordance right specified capability
In theory system capability remove need access control list similar mechanism giving entity capability actually need
A capability typically implemented consists section specifies access right section uniquely identifies object accessed
The user access data structure object directly instead via
In practice used much like traditional operating system traditional handle access every object system
Capabilities typically stored operating system list mechanism place prevent program directly modifying content capability forge access right change object point
Some system also based hardware support capability
Programs possessing capability perform function passing program converting version deleting
The operating system must ensure specific operation occur capability system order maintain integrity security policy
A defined protected reference virtue possession user process grant process capability hence name interact object certain way
Those way might include reading data associated object modifying object executing data object process conceivable access right
The capability logically consists reference uniquely identifies particular object set one right
Suppose user process memory space exists following string Although identifies unique object system specify access right hence capability
Suppose instead following two value This identifies object along set access right
It however still capability user process value say nothing whether access would actually legitimate
Now suppose user program successfully executes following statement The variable contains index file descriptor process file descriptor table
This file descriptor capability
Its existence process file descriptor table sufficient know process indeed legitimate access object
A key feature arrangement file descriptor table directly manipulated user program
In traditional operating system program often communicate storage using reference like first two example
Path name often passed parameter sent via socket stored disk
These reference capability must validated used
In system central question whose given reference evaluated
This becomes critical issue especially process must act behalf two different entity
They become susceptible programming error known frequently resulting
In system capability passed process storage using mechanism known operating system maintain integrity capability
One novel approach solving problem involves use operating system
This realised
See
In system need entity discarded capability invalidated hence require mechanism restore capability later time
The operating system maintains integrity security capability contained within storage volatile nonvolatile time part performing task rather requiring user program case operating system
Because user program relieved responsibility need trust reproduce legal capability validate request access using mechanism
POSIX draft specifies concept permission called capability
However POSIX capability differ capability capability associated object process capability listen TCP port
In contrast Capsicum capability FreeBSD Linux hybridize true model UNIX design POSIX API
Capsicum capability refined form file descriptor delegable right process additional object type beyond classic POSIX process referenced via capability
In Capsicum capability mode process unable utilize global namespaces filesystem namespace look object must instead inherit delegated
Research commercial system employing security include following currently used POSIX capability Linux

With advent computer system distribute capability component machine configuration among several user several task new dimension added problem safeguarding classified information
The basic problem associated machine processing classified information new
They encountered mode operation recently use remote system method used safeguard information system part extension traditional manual mean handling classified document
The increasingly widespread use system introduced new complexity problem
Moreover use system focused attention broader issue using computer regardless configuration store process classified information
system distribute resource computer system memory space arithmetic unit peripheral equipment channel among number simultaneous user
The term includes system commonly called two processor share primary memory
The principle distinction among system whether user must present terminal example interact job whether job execute autonomously multiprogrammed remote batch
allows many people use complex computer equipment concurrently
The user generally although necessarily geographically separated central processing equipment interact machine via remote terminal console
Each user program executed order period time necessarily completion
The central processing equipment devotes resource servicing user turn resuming left previous processing cycle
Due speed modern computer individual user rarely aware receiving fraction system attention job fragmented piece processing
Multiprogramming technique accomplished
Several job simultaneously resident system handled various system component maximize efficient utilization entire configuration
The operating system switch control one job another way advantage taken powerful expensive resource
In practice one basic feature multiprogramming prevent job demanding large amount time input output function job tying central processor accomplished usually allowing job execute input output operation required point another job begin execute concurrently request
On hand system regularly interrupt job turn allowing execute interval time determined computer system rather structure job
Systems incorporating capability type enumerated represent latest advance computer technology
Basically intended provide efficient utilization expensive computing facility widest range user
A single system able handle several user several set data simultaneously contributing economical operation
In addition direct advantage vastly improved resource utilization greatly increased economy operation drastically reduce service time enable user little formal knowledge programming interact directly machine extend computing capability many smaller installation would unable support dedicated machine
This study receiving impetus concern generated increasing number system addressed computer system may process classified material
Methods developed insure security system applicable kind computing system
The wide use computer military defense installation long necessitated application rule regulation
A basic principle underlying security computer system traditionally removing entire system physical environment penetrability acceptably minimized
The increasing use system equipment component user access terminal widely spread geographically introduced new complexity issue
These problem amenable solution elementary safeguard physical isolation
In one sense expanded problem security provoked system might viewed price one pay advantage system offer
However viewing question aspect simplistic tradeoff obscures fundamental issue
First security problem unique one type computer system configuration applies across spectrum computational technology
While present paper frame discussion term multiprogramming really dealing system configuration security computational technology served catalyst focusing attention problem protecting classified information resident computer system
Secondly system problem security admittedly acute present must designed protect user interference another user system must provide sort privacy protection user wish preserve integrity data program
Thus designer manufacturer system concerned fundamental problem protecting information
In protecting classified information difference degree new surface problem basic issue generally equivalent
The solution manufacturer design hardware software must augmented refined provide additional level protection demanded machine functioning security environment
The recommendation Defense Science Board Task Force Computer Security represent compilation technique procedure considered separately combination designing adopting data processing system provide security user privacy
The solution specific problem intended flexible adaptive need installation rather oriented one application environment
It intended general guideline Report use DOD component government installation contractor
There several way computer system physically operationally organized serve user
The security control depend configuration sensitivity data processed system
The following discussion present two way viewing physical operational configuration
The organization central processing facility batch processing arrangement access capability local remote interaction depicted Fig

Simple batch processing historical still prevalent mode operation wherein number job transaction grouped processed unit
The batch usually manually organized part individual job processed completion order received machine
An important characteristic batched system integrated file management system memory medium system need management awareness job job
Sensitive material erased removed computer quickly relatively cheaply mass memory medium containing sensitive information physically separated system secured protection
This characteristic explains solution problem treating urgent past
In multiprogramming hand job organized processed system according algorithm designed maximize efficiency total system handling complete set transaction
In system element physically located within computer central facility system unit geographically distant central processor connected communication line
Another way viewing type system shown Fig
based level computing capability available user
Type I enable user execute limited application program embedded system available alteration change
He selects execution one available application program
He may able couple several program together automatic execution sequence insert parameter selected program
Type II provide user programming capability term input language symbol result direct execution within computer operation denote
Such symbol used construct internal machine language program subsequently executed upon command user
Thus user obtain control machine directly buffered interpretive software
Type III provide user programming capability term language execute compiler embedded system
The instruction compiler translated assembly language basic machine language program
Program execution controlled user however available limited compiler language
Type IV give user extensive unrestrained programming capability
Not execute program written standard compiler language also create new programming language write compiler embed within system
This give user intimate interaction control machine complete resource excepting course resource prohibited safeguard memory protection base register control hardware control
In principle combination equipment configuration Fig
operational capability Fig
exist
In practice possible combination implemented possibility would provide useful operational characteristic
By nature computer system bring together series vulnerability
There human vulnerability throughout individual act accidentally deliberately jeopardize system information protection capability
Hardware vulnerability shared among computer communication facility remote unit console
There software vulnerability level machine operating system supporting software vulnerability organization protection system access control user identification authentication etc
How serious one might depends sensitivity classification information handled class user computational capability available user operating environment skill system designed capability potential attacker system
These point vulnerability applicable industrial environment handling proprietary information government installation processing classified data
This Report concerned directly latter sufficient acknowledge entire range issue considered also civil side work relevant
The design secure system must provide protection various type vulnerability
These fall three major category accidental disclosure deliberate penetration physical attack
A failure component equipment software subsystem resulting exposure information violation element system
Accidental disclosure frequently result failure hardware software
Such failure involve coupling information one user computer program another user clobbering information rendering file program unusable defeat circumvention security measure unintended change security status user file terminal
Accidental disclosure may also occur improper action machine operating maintenance personnel without deliberate intent
A deliberate covert attempt obtain information contained system cause system operate advantage threatening party manipulate system render unreliable unusable legitimate operator
Deliberate effort penetrate secure system either active passive
method include wire tapping monitoring electromagnetic emanation
infiltration attempt enter system obtain data file interfere data file system
One method accomplishing active infiltration legitimate user penetrate portion system authorization
The design problem one preventing access file someone aware access control mechanism knowledge desire manipulate advantage
For example access control code number user pick number gained access file begin interacting order learn content
Another class active infiltration technique involves exploitation entry point system control facility permit direct access file
entry point often created deliberately design development stage simplify insertion authorized program change legitimate system programmer intent closing prior operational use
Unauthorized entry point created system programmer wish provide mean bypassing internal security control thus subverting system
There also risk implicit may exist incomplete system loophole protection mechanism
For example might possible find unusual combination system control variable create entry path around safeguard
Another potential mode active infiltration use special terminal illegally tied communication system
Such terminal used intercept information flowing legitimate terminal central processor manipulate system
For example legitimate signal intercepted cancelled illegal terminal take interaction processor
Or illegal terminal maintain activity period legitimate user inactive still maintaining open line
Finally illegal terminal might drain output directed legitimate terminal pas error message place delay detection
Active infiltration also agent operating within secure organization
This technique may restricted taking advantage system protection inadequacy order commit act appear accidental disruptive system user could result acquisition classified information
At extreme agent may actively seek obtain removable file create trap door exploited later date Finally agent might placed organization simply learn system operation installation obtain piece information come way without particularly covert attempt part subversion
In passive subversion mean applied monitor information resident within system transmitted communication line without corollary attempt interfere manipulate system
The obvious method passive infiltration wire tap
If communication remote terminal central processor unprotected circuit problem applying wire tap computer line similar bugging telephone call
It also possible monitor electromagnetic emanation radiated electronic circuit characterize much equipment used computational system
Energy given form remotely recorded without gain physical access system component communication line
The possibility successful exploitation technique must always considered
Overt assault attack upon physical environment mob action type vulnerability outside scope Report
The system designer must aware point vulnerability may thought leakage point must provide adequate mechanism counteract accidental deliberate event
The specific leakage point touched upon foregoing discussion classified five group physical surroundings hardware software communication link organizational personnel procedure
The overall safeguarding information computer system regardless configuration achieved combination protection feature aimed different area leakage point
Procedures regulation doctrine area already established within DOD therefore within purview Task Force
However overlap various area application security control computer system raise new aspect old problem issue discussed
An overview threat point depicted Fig

Security control applied safeguard physical equipment apply computer equipment terminal also removable item printout magnetic tape magnetic disc pack punchcards etc
Adequate DOD regulation exist dissemination control storage accountability classified removable item
Therefore security measure element system examined Report unless unique consideration
The following general guideline apply physical protection
b Physical protection must continuous time threat posed possibility physical tampering equipment likelihood classified information stored within computer system even operating
c Remote terminal device must afforded physical protection commensurate classification sensitivity information handled
While responsibility instituting maintaining physical protection measure normally assigned organization control terminal advisable central authority establish uniform physical security standard specific protection measure regulation terminal given system insure specified security level achieved entire system
Terminal protection important order If part computer system magnetic disc file copy printout contain unusually sensitive data
must physically isolated maintenance procedure may necessary physically separate independently control access
In case may practical provide direct remote visual surveillance area
If visual surveillance used must designed installed manner used highly sensitive material intended protect
Hardware portion system subject malfunction result directly leak cause failure security protection mechanism elsewhere system including inducing software malfunction
In addition properly operating equipment susceptible tapped otherwise exploited
The type failure directly affect security include malfunctioning circuit protection bound register memory protect privileged mode operation priority interrupt
Any hardware failure potentially affect security control error memory
Both active passive penetration technique used hardware leakage point
In passive mode intervener may attempt monitor system tapping communication line monitoring compromising emanation
Wholly isolated system physically shielded eliminate emanation beyond limit secure installation geographically dispersed system comprehensive shielding difficult expensive
Currently practical solution used protect communication system
The problem emanation security covered existing regulation new aspect problem raised modern computing system
It emphasized however control spurious emanation must applied main computing center remote equipment well
Although difficult accomplish possibility exists covert monitoring device installed within central processor
The problem computer hardware involved complexity easy knowledgeable person incorporate necessary equipment way make detection difficult
His capability assumes access equipment manufacture major maintenance
Equipment also vulnerable deliberate accidental rewiring maintenance personnel installed hardware appears function normally fact change protection mechanism
Remote console also present potential radiation vulnerability
Moreover possibility recording device might attached console pirate information
Other remote peripheral equipment present danger
Printer ribbon platen may bear impression analyzed removable storage medium magnetic tape disc pack even punchcards stolen least removed long enough copied
Erasure standard magnetic medium within scope Task Force review establish
However system designer aware phenomenon retentivity magnetic material inadequately understood threat system security
Software leakage point include vulnerability directly related software computer system
Of special concern operating system supplementary program support operating system contain software safeguard
Weaknesses result improper design failure check adequately combination circumstance lead unpredictable consequence
More serious however fact operating system large complex structure thus impossible exhaustively test every conceivable set condition might arise
Unanticipated behavior triggered particular user program rare combination user action
Malfunctions might disrupt particular user file program might risk security serious implication system reliability utility
On hand operating system malfunction might couple information one program user another clobber information system including information within operating system software change classification user file program
Thus malfunction system software represent potentially serious security risk
Conceivably clever attacker might establish capability induce software malfunction deliberately hiding beneath apparently genuine trouble agent may able tap file interfere system operation long period without detection
The security safeguard provided operating system software include access control user identification memory bound control etc
As result hardware malfunction especially transient one control become inoperative
Thus internal check necessary insure protection operative
Even done simultaneous failure protection feature check mechanism must always regarded possibility
With proper design awareness risk appears possible reduce probability undetected failure software safeguard acceptable level
Probably serious risk system software incomplete design sense inadvertent loophole exist protective barrier foreseen designer
Thus unusual action part user unusual way program behave induce loophole
There may result security breach suspension modification software safeguard perhaps undetected wholesale clobbering internal program data file
It conceivable attacker could mount deliberate search loophole expectation exploiting acquire information either system system detail information safe guard
The communication linking central processor switching center remote terminal present potential vulnerability
Wiretapping may employed steal information land line radio intercept equipment microwave link
Techniques intercepting compromising emanation may employed communication equipment even readily central processor terminal equipment
For example crosstalk communication line within switching central present vulnerability
Lastly switch gear subject error link central processor wrong user terminal
There two prime organizational leakage point personnel security clearance institutional operating procedure
The first concern structure administration mechanism national apparatus granting personnel security clearance
It accepted adequate standard technique exist used cognizant authority insure reliability cleared
This however relieve system designer severe obligation incorporate technique minimize damage done subversive individual working within secure organization
A secure system must based concept isolating given individual element system need access
In past accomplished denying physical access anyone without security clearance appropriate level
In system future population user ranging uncleared highest clearance level interact system simultaneously
This place heavy burden overall security control apparatus insure control mechanism incorporated computer system properly informed clearance restriction applicable user
The machine system must designed apply user access restriction reliably
In installation may feasible reserve certain terminal highly classified highly sensitive restricted work terminal used exclusively le sensitive operation
Conversely installation terminal used degree classification sensitivity depending clearance need user given moment
In either case authentication verification mechanism built machine system relied upon degree data personnel operational characteristic provided security apparatus accurate
The second element organizational leakage point concern institutional operating procedure
The consequence inadequate organizational procedure haphazard application unsupervised use severe malfunction
Procedures include insertion clearance status information security checking mechanism machine system method authenticating user receipting classified information scheduling computing operation maintenance period provision storing keeping track removable storage medium handling printed machine output report monitoring control record security apparatus function whose purpose insure reliable unobtrusive operation security control viewpoint
Procedural shortcoming represent area potential weakness exploited manipulated provide agent innumerable opportunity system subversion
Thus installation operating procedure dual function providing overall management efficiency providing administrative bridge security control apparatus computing system user
The Task Force specific comment make respect personnel security issue note control movement people must include control access remote terminal handle classified information even intermittently
The machine room staff must capability responsibility control movement personnel within central computing area order insure authorized individual operate equipment located access removable storage medium access machine part ordinarily open casual inspection
In dealing threat system security various leakage point considered individually
Almost imaginable deliberate attempt exploit weakness necessarily involve combination factor
Deliberate act mounted system take advantage create leakage point would usually require system design shortcoming either unforeseen undetected placement someone position initiate action
Thus espionage activity based exploiting combination deficiency circumstance
A software leak may caused hardware malfunction
The capability tap tamper hardware may enhanced deficiency software checking routine
A minor ostensibly acceptable weakness one area combination similar shortcoming seemingly unrelated activity may add serious potential system subversion
The system designer must aware totality potential leakage point system order create prescribe technique procedure block entry exploitation
The security problem specific computer system must solved basis employing best judgment team consisting system programmer technical hardware communication specialist security expert
This Report address multitude detail arise operation particular computer system individual installation
Instead intended Report provide guideline responsible designing certifying given system satisfactory security control procedure
On hand security control described Parts B D markedly reduce probability undetected attempt penetrate computer system succeed
This Report address difficult security control situation system serving geographically distributed user
Where circumstance warrant lesser set control may satisfactory intended case prohibition implementing system lesser set safeguard
The recommendation framed provide maximum latitude freedom action adapting idea specific installation
The Government classifies defense information within well defined long established structure
Although might desirable computer point view modify rule would equivalent tailoring structure fit computer operation would constitute inappropriate recommendation
Obviously constraint secure computer system must consonant existing security classification structure
A second constraint least initially assumption general tenet existing familiar manual security control procedure prevail
For example Task Force recommendation require secure computer system identify user also user establish prove authenticity furthermore asked receipt simple response classified information made available type terminal
This desirable feature consideration system accountability also point view protection user
It conceivable error computer system might result allegation given user certain information fact
In formulating recommendation Task Force recognized following general characteristic desirable secure system
The system convenient mechanism procedure maintaining condition shifting job assignment issuance withdrawal clearance change parameter transfer personnel one duty assignment another etc
The system changing operational condition particularly time emergency
While aspect security control per se important system responsive deny service completely class user total system load increase
It may prove desirable design special emergency feature system suspend modify security control impose special restriction grant broad access privilege designated individual facilitate rapid change security parameter
The system
It must provide record security control supervisor system performance security safeguard user activity monitored
This implies manual automatic monitoring facility desirable
The system security point view
It ought sense system fulfill security control make proper decision grant access pas internal withhold information user uncertain ideally continue provide service verified user
A fallback independent set security safeguard must available function provide best level security possible degraded condition system continue operation
The system point view security control
The record audit control visual display manual input used monitor system supplemented capability make appropriate modification operational status system event catastrophic system failure degradation performance change workload condition crisis etc
The system security control adjusted reflect change classification sensitivity file operation need local installation
There convenient mechanism whereby special security control needed particular user embedded easily system
Thus security control problem ideally must solved generality economy
It would costly treat installation individual instance conceive appropriate set unique safeguard
The system must must deny service user
In time crisis urgent need system must self protecting reject effort capture thus make unavailable legitimate user
This point bear number kind internal record system must keep implies form rationing algorithm must incorporated penetration would capture specified share system capability
system must automatically assure
It must violate safeguard deliberately attempt illegal operation monitor communication continuity monitor user action short time basis
The Task Force identified several aspect secure computer system currently impractical impossible ass
In present state computer technology impossible completely anticipate much le specify hardware failure mode software design error omission seriously failure mode hardware malfunction lead software malfunction Existing commercial machine minimum redundancy circuit thus military application may unsatisfactory hardware facility assist control malfunction
Furthermore present state knowledge difficult predict probability failure complex hardware software configuration thus redundancy important design concept
Because failure mode probability occurrence completely cataloged stated difficult arrive overall probability accidental divulgence classified information system
Therefore difficult make quantitative measurement security system also difficult design priori absolute demonstrable security
Since security risk probability present manual system well known difficult determine whether given design secure computer system well better corresponding manual arrangement
This issue likely raise considerable discussion time official policy decision security control computer system must made
As described computer system differ widely capability make available user
In sophisticated highest security risk case user construct new program new programming language console
embed new language computer system use
In computer system
offering broadest capability user
security problem risk considerably greater user following two class must served simultaneously It opinion Task Force unwise present time attempt accommodate class user simultaneously
However recognized many installation operational need serve uncleared cleared user recommendation addressed point presented Parts B Unfortunately easy time estimate cost security control computer system
Only computer system currently operation attempt provide service broad base user working classified information
While system serving practical need user product research effort good data reflecting incremental cost adding security control system operating yet available
In computer system designed application capability present order make system work also applicable provision security control
In computing system facility security control would specially installed
Thus Task Force give accurate estimate cost security
It depend age software hardware certainly security control cheapest considered system architecture prior hardware software design
In opinion investment security control give good return tighter accurate accountability dissemination classified information improved system reliability
The cost may depend workload installation
If classified operation accommodated single computer unclassified operation second computer least expensive way maintain integrity classified information may retain machine
Such configuration present operational inefficiency user need work classified unclassified data base concept dual installation one machine working clear second machine fully protected summarily rejected
There many term commonly used connection security control usage completely standardized
Terms used throughout Report defined group certain term especially one defined appropriate place text
The privilege granted individual basis prescribed investigative procedure formal access classified information access necessary work
The three formal national clearance
However also expedient computer point view recognize fourth level clearance
A clearance necessary sufficient condition access classified information
By extension concept clearance applied also equipment
For example computer terminal spoken given level clearance implied certain investigative procedure test established corresponding level classified information safely transmitted terminal
When referring aggregation equipment together management control procedure time used
An administrative action certifying given individual requires access specified classified information order perform assigned duty
The combination clearance constitutes necessary sufficient condition granting access classified information
The act identifying sensitivity defense information ascertaining potential level damage interest United States information divulged unfriendly foreign agent
The classification formation formally defined Executive Order
There three formal level national classification expedient computer point view also consider fourth level classification
The identifier associated item classified information indicating level classification special status generically called label
Category Compartment
Classified defense information segregated entrusted particular agency organizational group safeguarding
For example portion defense classified information concern nuclear matter entrusted Atomic Energy Commission responsible establishing promulgating rule regulation safeguarding controlling dissemination
Classified information special category normally identified special marking label letter AEC information whether classified Confidential Secret Top Secret collectively identified
It often called note use classification extended sense formal usage word
Sometimes special investigative procedure stipulated granting access information special category
Thus formally three broadly defined national clearance level practice structure within level
In part reflects separation information special category part fact many different agency authorized grant clearance
For example individual functioning within AEC domain cleared Top Secret said authorized access Top Secret information entrusted AEC safeguarding identified special category Q
These special type clearance given level always specifically identified unique additional marking label
A special letter word phrase sentence marking combination thereof label classified material special category hence subject additional access control
Thus caveat indicator special subset information within one level classification
The caveat may juxtaposed classification label may appear sometimes appear explicitly inferred
Particular kind caveat Access Control Labels
A group word imposes additional restriction classified information used disseminated divulged label additional mean controlling access
Examples No Foreign Dissemination
Eyes Only Not Releasable Outside Department Defense
A group word conveys recipient information additional guidance information may disseminated controlled transmitted protected utilized
Examples Limited Distribution Special Handling Required Group Excluded Automatic Downgrading Declassification
An individual clearance authorization granting access classified information contained computer system
By extension term applied equipment case implies necessary safeguard present enable equipment store process information many level classification caveated many different way
For purpose Report
convenient introduce new term
It composite term reflecting level classification
caveat including codewords label requirement together indicator establishing access restriction information access privilege individual
By extension concept applied equipment
indicates class information stored processed
Thus security flag contains information necessary control access
One security flag considered equal higher second requestor first flag authorized access information second flag
The totality information user file terminal communication computer system requires order exercise security control information contains
Included thing user name clearance authorization physical location terminal location clearance file classification dissemination restriction
Thus set security parameter particularizes generalized security control system specific equipment configuration class information class user given installation
The policy recommendation follow intended provide security skeleton around specific secure computer system may built
Additionally recommendation set forth responsibility function personnel needed evaluate supervise operate secure system
This new field Report represents first major attempt codify principle
In case rationale behind specific recommendation appropriate example presented Comment
Automatic data processing system shall accommodate without exception responsibility individual ensure certain official information affecting national defense protected unauthorized disclosure pursuant Executive Order Amended Safeguarding Official Information Interests Defense United States
A computer system shall grant access classified information person determine official duty require access received proper security clearance authorization
The mean employed achieve system security objective shall based combination software hardware procedural measure sufficient assure suitable protection classification category resident system
To maximum extent possible policy procedure incorporated achieve system security shall unclassified
However specific key password authentication word specifically designated sensitive procedure shall require classification
Depending upon nature individual computing installation following category personnel associated
It recognized given individual may one responsibility either simultaneously different time perform one function
It also recognized scope responsibility may imply substantial organizational group function
The head department agency responsible proper operation secured computer system
Any individual interacts directly computer system virtue inserting information system accepting information
Information considered include computer program data
An individual designated responsible overall management system resource physical resource system personnel attached
An individual designated appropriate authority verify certify security measure given computer system operation meet applicable current criterion handling classified information establish maximum security level system part operate
An individual designated Responsible Authority specifically responsible proper verification personnel clearance authorization determination operational system security status including terminal surveillance maintenance system security insertion security parameter computing system well general system matter security assurance

A series test inspection establish safeguard designed hardware software system operative function intended collectively constitute acceptable control safeguarding classified information
Production model given design need tested verify safeguard present properly functioning
It recommended certification performed agency special team part using agency separate design maintenance group
Specifications procedure test inspection subsequent certification review must produced part design certification process
A series test inspection performed according specification established design certification phase insure required set security safeguard hardware software procedural fact present operational installed equipment communication link carry classified information remote terminal computer
This certification must also examine operational procedure administrative structure organization control equipment must establish procedural administrative environment supplement complement hardware software safeguard physical safeguard appropriate
It anticipated certification review extensive thorough time installation system
Installation certification probably conducted special team necessarily control Responsible Authority
Ideally System Security Officer participate certification becomes familiar safeguard system process intent certification order conduct subsequent certification
Some level recertification must accomplished periodically
indicated operational circumstance
These instance follows Depending upon system malfunctioned remedial action taken recertification procedure desirable security control fully functioning
The responsibility determining recertification test inspection necessary rest System Security Officer although may solicit expert opinion System Maintenance Personnel System Administrator
As system malfunction level recertification undoubtedly necessary modification made computing equipment system software
The scope depth test inspection reflect maintenance performed change made
The ultimate judgment recertification procedure necessary must responsibility System Security Officer although may solicit expert opinion
For sufficiently extensive modification maintenance recertification procedure may well approximate extensive set test inspection made time initial installation
The necessary operational security parameter overall system portion shall inserted system System Security Officer
Information shall passed accepted portion system security level commensurate security parameter portion system
The use uncleared person terminal certified highly classified information permissible without need recertification long precaution escorting continuous surveillance prevent tampering etc
taken prevent subversion security mechanism needed previously certified effective protect stipulated classification terminal

An explicit report change shall made certifying authority particular system addition normal manual automatic logging system transaction
Equipment associated material medium containing copy program used handling classified information must continuously protected unauthorized change commensurate security level recently certified
Copies operating software classified used actual insertion system generate program insertion system need subject requirement
It important understand present technology protecting classified information system
Present technology offer way absolutely protect information computer operating system security threat posed human being around
As consequence procedural administrative safeguard must applied computer center supplement protection available hardware software
As could observed policy recommendation two type environment secure computing system operate
One environment consisting cleared user function physically protected terminal connected physically protected computing central protected communication circuit
The main security problem largely one maintaining data program integrity individual user
An inadvertent divergence classified information system analogous cleared person finding classified document authorized access
The type environment one mixture uncleared user working unprotected console connected computing central unprotected communication circuit cleared user protected console protected communication line
The security problem system must able withstand effort penetrate inside outside
For purpose Report term used indicate security controlled computing system operate wholly different realistic environment
From technical point view secure closed system one acceptably resistant external attack accidental disclosure internal subversion denial use legitimate user presenting difficult problem provided contemporary technology secure open system provided contemporary technology
In fact special concern risk compromise classified information vulnerability open system potential penetration today b The state system design large software system frequent change system expected
c Certification system fully developed technique detail thoroughly worked
System failure mode thoroughly understood cataloged protected
e Large hardware complex absolutely guaranteed
Since adequate control provided technology alone necessary rely combination hardware software procedural safeguard
Thus recommendation refer issue already discussed Part B
The precise mix control safeguard necessary given case depend operational environment sensitivity information class user type service rendered noted
We believe recommendation necessary sufficient closed secure system
However sufficiency open system guaranteed abstract
Only intelligent adaptation specific open environment utilizing experience closed system extremely objective stringent testing evaluation adequacy established specific open system
Central processor hardware must provide following mechanism depending class service render user user isolation supervisory software protection assurance unanticipated condition
Each user worker program must isolated program computing system
The currently known principal hardware mechanism isolating program include register various form hardware checking circuit assure memory address generated within processor fact restricted permitted program particular user
In addition contemporary machine provide memory protection register bound register storage lock
The characteristic system software determine whether hardware feature required system provide user capability Type I Fig
full programming capability interpretive mode restricted set language compiler Types II III Fig

Sometimes hardware feature necessary principle practical matter use relevant hardware feature greatly simplifies achievement isolation
It recommended hardware mechanism required system Types I II III Fig

It recommended isolation hardware mandatory system provide extensive programming capability user language compiler choice including machine language computer Type IV Fig

While many contemporary machine designed environment incorporate hardware safeguard provide user isolation little internal hardware guard malfunction
Older machine operating security controlling mode may able fully meet recommendation
To extent user isolation achieved mean hardware mechanism exchanged isolation via software mechanism
This done caution protection mechanism effected must safeguarded collapse due hardware software malfunction
The objective Supervisor protection deny user program ability penetrate Supervisor contains security control safeguard without detection Supervisor
A user program might attempt subversion purpose manipulating supervisory information way disable security control barrier system deny service user
It recommended computer system provide programming via interpretation via limited language compiler system provide extensive programming capability Types II III IV Fig
incorporate hardware technique effect providing least two distinct operating state user state supervisor state also called worker slave master privileged respectively
Any hardware configuration acceptable create one internal operating state penetrated software user program execute
In machine able execute instruction including affect security control
In user state instruction initiate input output operation reference file attempt modify register used isolate user protect Supervisor attempt suspend modify security control must executed
Thus user state user program able execute certain instruction operation prohibited
Entrance supervisor state must hardware controlled
This frequently established providing facility detect special instruction creating hardware mean interrupt signal return computing system supervisor state
If user program attempt execute prohibited instruction attempt must thwarted immediately suspending user program returning control Supervisor
Furthermore user program attempt execute undefined instruction must thwarted immediately suspending execution user program returning control Supervisor
Since virtually impossible determine every situation whether computing system working designed obvious machine operating properly doubtful utility also pose grave risk security information handled
Thus desirable incorporate safeguard protect system unanticipated condition might arise
As minimum condition mandatory computer produce known response possible instruction legal one specifically machine repertoire undefined one together possible combination tag modifier whether legal
The software system includes Supervisor language processor compiler assembler etc
program library utility program sort program file copying program
The design computer system must consider software component system well hardware software run
While Supervisor sort required type system enumerated Fig
broad range user software capability inherent system Types III IV implies much complex Supervisor required
With respect language processor utility program little said assistance design development secure system
In Type III system permitting programming via limited language certified compiler care thoroughness language processor examined prior approval limit threat user system might able mount classified information contains
A careful analysis language translator particularly assumption made regarding execution environment user program essential four type computing system
Assembly language processor impose particularly difficult problem manifold opportunity user create seemingly safe instruction sequence turn construct executable instruction sequence designed disrupt service security control operating system
Little said language processor utility program except require thoroughly tested user agency correct operation detection rejection incorrect sequence instruction error
As recommended earlier respect hardware language processor provide maximum extent possible known response various error condition
Comment This discussion applies structure software component
Additional safeguard misuse software malfunction incorporated appropriate procedural control
Examination software really aspect certification conceivable technical expertise implied examination testing software efficiently done certifying group
The detailed structure Supervisor computer system function hardware configuration type service provided system user
Because variety Supervisors fact system delivered manufacturer Supervisor difficult specify requirement detail
In general however software design clean sense modular possible
There aspect Supervisor design sufficiently important qualify requirement
It recommended Supervisors designed system include following feature
As much Supervisor possible must run user state opposed supervisor state part Supervisor much freedom machine need job
This provide Supervisor protection given user program faulty programming machine error
Supervisor function separated individual module explicit communication module
Each module must fully described flowchart assist security analysis

The Supervisor must assure extent technically feasible classified information remain residue either primary secondary storage
This includes form secondary storage magnetic drum magnetic disc magnetic tape well primary core store register
One technique Supervisor erase segment primary core storage making segment available another program

The Supervisor must provision bringing computing system operational status orderly manner
There also must provision orderly shutdown system including feature automatic logging user access closure file classified information
Furthermore must possible system personnel working control console selected user deny access given user terminal attempt access system improper authorization detected

The Supervisor must certified capability control access file
This point critical treated separately
In computer system access system access information file program contained system must separately controlled
If system computer operating local opposed remote access operation personnel visually identify individual granting access system
Furthermore operation people perform whatever verification procedure necessary releasing particular file program user
Alternatively user information authentication word access protocol must protected punchcard form arrangement made card deck read visual surveillance owner immediately returned
For remote batch computer system function must performed mechanism system software hardware
In system user must announce system procedure requires standard identification accounting information specific user authentication step computer system verify identity individual terminal
For system permanent protected communication link physical control access terminal may used lieu authentication
In case responsibility authentication transferred administrative jurisdiction cognizance terminal
For system utilize communication link physical access control undesirable password scheme equivalent must used provide authentication
Authentication word technique must classified protected user accordance highest level information permit access
Authentication word technique must obtained approved source alternatively must generated distributed cognizance System Security Officer approved technique
Specifically user generate password
Depending sensitivity information operating condition circuit noise interruption etc
contained within system user may required reauthenticate time time single terminal session
Authentication word must changed frequently prescribed approved issuing source
Provided technique approved appropriate cognizant agency used system utilized generate authentication word provided output available designated terminal procedure carried cognizance System Security Officer
The Supervisor software must constructed user identification authentication word list maintained part normal operation system terminal designated System Security Officer sole responsibility list
The fact user granted access system imply authorization access classified file data program contained system
For example may authorized perform online computation file processing
Before user given access classified file user clearance level access privilege must checked access restriction file
If information file delivered user terminal terminal designated status designated terminal must also verified
To computer system must internal catalog user clearance level access privilege well catalog characteristic terminal connected system
Each file must marked clearance restriction use
Finally must explicit separate capability update internal catalog
If responsibility maintaining catalog divided among several people must restricted part responsible
A user must able acquire information security control file access denied reason
Assuming inadvertence part user system assist identifying mistake procedural error
However system log record unsuccessful attempt access classified file
Because system vulnerable security threat posed operation maintenance personnel strongly recommended system handling extremely sensitive information software hardware maintenance performed joint action two person
In particular debugging Supervisor software expressly prohibited except storage device containing classified file needed performance maintenance physically electrically disconnected maintenance personnel access system
In order maintain good security control recommended modification installed system software currently operation done specifically designated terminal system software maintenance personnel assigned unique access privilege including authentication word permit access test file system function etc
action specially privileged console continuous positive control responsible individual maintains written log console use including positive identification individual using
Such special log addition automatic logging performed system
The system designed assist user determining appropriate classification applicable caveat new file
In many case determined algorithmically computer consideration classification caveat file referenced program utilized create file input
In case determined user
Whenever user notified system based internal information assigned tentative classification status newly created file must indicate verified accepts status desire change
If user chooses change classification either raising lowering add remove caveat system record transaction log specially note review System Security Officer
In either case action must recorded system log
If classification lowered caveat removed file must released user System Security Officer verified new status correct
In operational situation may prudent limit downgrading authorization user entitled write file
When new file created combining information existing file adding interpretation combined result conceivable purely algorithmically determined maximum classification caveat may exceed user access privilege
In case access control mechanism must designed withhold information user bring situation attention System Security Officer
It recommended software trap incorporated detect input output information identified security flag exceeds authorized either user terminal file specified job
Such condition must immediately suspend service terminal notify System Security Officer record event system log
Typically Supervisor designed receive remote input information terminal originates job correspondingly output information terminal
If operational requirement dictate otherwise
Supervisor must designed identify authenticate terminal user originating one information exchanged
As user Job actually run computer carry security flag initially determined security flag user terminal work unless user specifically designates otherwise beginning job
In either case job unfolds security flag may modified automatically system reflect security flag file information file program used
The job flag need limited terminal flag
For example individual cleared Top Secret might run entirely Top Secret secret job Secret terminal Top Secret input output terminal output
example might directed Top Secret printer
A situation might common remotely initiated batch operation deception indicated since user cleared job even though terminal
The basic point security flag user absolute limit access privilege unless program question certified access higher security flag produce information exceed flag user
The access control limitation outlined represented shown Fig

It read user device flag greater equal input job output flag
It may prove difficult specific case certify program access highly classified information produce result lower level
If strongly recommended user job never allowed access information either data program whose security flag exceeds user
Since part Supervisor run user state user program access case accounting control file must excluded restriction
In principle following item carry security flag user terminal job program job data file data input output
The question job user run possible circumstance become complex
Unfortunately Supervisor determine user privilege algorithmically exert judgment
Thus issue must examined carefully operational environment appropriate rule formulated match user need security restriction installation
It possible demonstrate many computer system may safe direct user attack terminal proving particular component effective blocking attack various kind
However recurring question risk inadvertent disclosure classified information software hardware combination failure case would necessary prove single failure combination failure occur
Since complete within present state art particularly existing computer system recommended system designer estimate probability occurrence single failure combination failure could result disclosure classified information
Based information Responsible Authority determine whether risk probability acceptable
If decision risk great used system certification made accordingly
A system functioning segregated mode requires user cleared specified level terminal physically protected level communication line secure level
If within level classification special caveat information introduced new determination must made whether risk consequence exposure special caveat information cleared authorized person operating within system warrant segregated operation entire system special caveat level
If classification level system certified function hierarchically subsumes level classification authorized user system may execute program lower level classification
However scheduled mode system establishes level classification mutually exclusive level user restricted program classified current mode system
Fig
illustrates relation
Access may may authorized depending relation Special Category given national classification
The concept segregated operational mode requires user various clearance level scheduled separately
In addition special control needed assure highly classified caveated material become accessible classification differently caveated mode begin operation The precise procedure mechanism necessary change operational status system must tailored precise configuration
The following step representative procedure necessary maintain segregation system status change
b Before file device made available user restricted access privilege using must sanitized checked approved procedure classified information highly classified restricted access appropriate new mode operation
c Each user must notified change operational status system whether scheduled
This notification transmitted prior change active terminal able access system new mode operation
However terminal authorized access system new mode given information specific classification status new mode
A change mode operation must accomplished recessing logging appropriate active user forcing new procedure including authentication new level
A change operational status system obviously inconvenience user
While required terminate work completely required momentarily suspend operation change status new accomplished
To maximum extent possible procedure changing status machine designed user convenience mind
Since operational clearance status system change segregated style operation user granted access system must informed system current status
e When initiating new operational mode terminal work area cleared receive information forthcoming level operation must disconnected communication link computer certified electronic switching unplugging manual operation switch
f When initiating new operational mode special software relevant new mode must replace previous mode
g In event failure Supervisor software hardware resulting operational malfunction system must restarted appropriate clearance level approved restart procedure part returning operational status mode
Depending upon nature malfunction may necessary verify security flag data file order assure malfunction affect
The recommendation indicate general way required additional issue following must considered
b The disabling read head magnetic disc device may required
c Appropriate key lock may needed operator assured certain action taken action lock must electrically reported
Checklists helpful assure system operating personnel methodically verify step process
e Storage classified material punchcards printed paper magnetic tape must provided
f Printers punchcard equipment must sanitized running blank paper blank card ribbon must changed protected
g Positive control procedure used assure magnetic tape magnetic disc pack containing classified information one level classification special category accidentally used inappropriate level
h There must detailed instruction system operating personnel mode relative thing console action online file status procedure mode shut mode initiation message insertion via console typewriter etc
There must continuous surveillance operation area fully cleared personnel
It possible consider explicitly change must take place computer system change operational clearance level
In general recommendation given parallel practice common existing security doctrine
At particular installation System Security Officer aware level classification special access category system must able formulate detailed procedure shifting operational mode system one another
Any communication line pass classified information terminal central computer facility computer system must protected accordance communication security method
They may include provision approved secure cable terminal central location approved cryptographic equipment
Intelligent deception link spoofing must possible
There may operational requirement maintain continuity service remote user spite communication circuit failure
If must emergency provision procedure establishing alternate channel remote location action must accomplished properly cleared authorized individual accordance established operating procedure secure communication
If computer system operates environment wherein reasonable probability one terminal captured essential employ technique cryptographic isolation use unique key terminal
In event capture confines operational information loss captured terminal prevents captor intruding communication link system intercepting classified information intended terminal
Any terminal user gain access classified information central computing facility must physically protected accordance highest classification information processed terminal
Furthermore protection requirement specified cryptographic equipment collocated terminal physical protection must accordance protection requirement specified cryptographic equipment
In addition system closed protection must consistent specified overall system
To guard covert emplacement illegal intelligence sensor recorder terminal maintenance personnel must cleared highest level classified information handled terminal terminal maintenance must performed surveillance appropriately cleared technically knowledgeable person
Because present security doctrine depends heavily upon identification necessary system require positive identification terminal communicates system able interrogate terminal identification time
Certifying computer system secure represents difficult issue
It involves examination safeguard hardware software procedural administrative provided
ideally quantitative estimate probability inadvertent disclosure classified information
It almost impossible identify protect possible failure mode system
Design certification process measuring testing evaluating probable effectiveness operating condition security control feature stable system one whose software hardware completed
In order make measuring process meaningful security protection designed system must quantified maximum extent possible
It strongly recommended design certification performed group responsible design construction maintenance operational system
A suggested procedure given Hardware failure cause incorrect operation inherent check intended detect failure parity check transfer The probability failure hardware upon security control depends Possible software check consistency operation accuracy parameter address used function Combinations data parameter table etc
result incorrect operation Its dependence function operation The probable effect failure Specific test either software electronic made determine function really work specified
b Based determination factor test result make overall estimate probability failure total function
c Based probability failure security function estimate overall probability system security failure would result compromise classified information illegal entry system
The matter overall equipment configuration becomes especially important large system containing many computer either collocated geographically distributed
The overall hardware configuration must examined order establish consequence security control total partial loss major component system
For example controller group magnetic disc fail necessary determine whether crucial segment software would made unavailable security control
Whenever possible security control designed failure portion system invalidate weaken control balance system remaining operational
Conversely design permit rapid simple physical disconnection inoperative portion system
Following point considered
b The loss component may seriously affect operational performance accuracy remainder system shut reason even though significant security control continue function
c Loss communication element system may force shut data critical security control system transferred
If Supervisor software designed monitor operating status remote station sending information loss remote station security threat although incident must reported System Security Officer
e Loss operator console may require associated computer must shut properly controlled alternate location operator control available
At time installation certification administrative procedural environment system function must examined verify support control present complex provides additional control people paper magnetic tape system
Also installation certification communication arrangement must verified secure level spurious emanation must demonstrated acceptable physical protection must shown adequate control remote equipment physical personnel emanation must verified
Complete certification performed changing closed system open system even though may operated segregated mode previously described processing highly sensitive information
After system certified change system must similarly examined incorporated
Such examination required whether change originate either hardware software vendor
After general reliability system established operating successfully reasonable length time limited recertification process performed appropriate interval consisting test inspection intended reveal change surreptitiously made system detect inadvertent change made system maintenance validate continuing performance system security control
The technique used verify system operating correctly importantly used properly
For purpose monitoring security control recommended system contain software automatically record date time least following b All maintenance whatever purpose including name maintenance personnel nature maintenance file accessed c All function including name function point view log operator treated user Each attempt user program access file program authorized including name terminal identification program e All incident including name program user terminal time abort f Any special usage system generation password changing classification modifying security parameter record type transaction including authority person whose cognizance usage conducted terminal used g Groups output operation system performs request user including directs sent terminal one request made including identification file accessed measure amount information read file requesting receiving terminal
Similar information logged input operation create destroy file instruction change file classification security parameter
To extent deemed necessary System Security Officer log record must contain sufficient detail permit reconstruction event indicate unsuccessful attempt penetrate system clearly resulted compromise information security violation
For example repeated unsuccessful attempt gain access system software file promptly reported Supervisor software order alert system operation personnel necessary System Security Officer
The audit trail enable security investigation personnel identify terminal involved user target file program system reaction
In general log complete enough permit System Security Officer monitor system performance periodic basis needed
The data collected system log also aggregated interval provide performance statistic indicate efficacy existing security safeguard develop new improved procedure control
Supplementary manual log kept operator record event following may useful
b Restarts system including detail loading system software checking verification file manual operation taken etc
c All change Supervisor program library system file made way operator console Each running unusually privileged system program e Each instance hardware software maintenance purpose
As mean verifying continued correct operation security safeguard computing system system testing program must inserted system status user program
The function program verify hardware software safeguard operative
At minimum testing program attempt violate security control verify correct response received case
The security testing program must communicate computer system directing information turnaround channel one leaf central processor proper traverse channel controller turn around order verify integrity channel controller well
If test program succeeds attempt violate either hardware software safeguard system shall immediately enter unique degraded operating mode withholds information user community situation assessed appropriate action taken see Part B pp

If user program violates security control running operationally debugging program must immediately suspended System Security Officer notified
Appropriate remedial action must taken verified program returned operational status
If violation occurs debugging application program program accessed file sensitive information sufficient notify user alert System Security Officer record event system log allowing program continue user acknowledges event responds appropriate remedial action
In conflict user program security control especially case open system may advisable interrupt system operation first feasible opportunity run security testing program verify correct functioning security control
As stated earlier simpler create secure system closed environment open one largely inadequacy present state technology
The foregoing recommendation present technique method relevant protecting information open environment may assure security situation
A comment order practicability reducing degree openness mean coping security problem
The system closed uncleared user classified information resident simple possible course action
However may impractical workload population user many installation single computer system required economically serve cleared uncleared user
On hand might also true volume classified volume unclassified work economic solution might separate machine part workload
A modification approach schedule system operate alternately uncleared classified mode appropriate operational procedure sanitize system certify mode
All information within system might rendered unclassified implies internal encryption used
Finally might possible find special configuration hardware could certified secure even open environment processor control management system security control vested completely third independent machine
With respect internal encryption noted principal threat countered recovery information
The threat system denial intelligent deception must countered control
A possible benefit internal encryption may reduces scope system certification manageable proportion
A possible drawback possibility malfunction encryption device permanently freezing information encrypted impenetrable state
Internal encryption could applied primary magnetic core storage also secondary file storage
All program data resident core storage could encrypted form decrypted pas storage processing unit execution
As information returned processing unit storage would reencrypted
Incorporation technique system would protect unauthorized access data resident primary storage
In addition information secondary storage could protected encrypting mechanism connected directly encrypted primary storage way information could transferred primary secondary storage without intermediate stage occurring
The purpose securing secondary storage fashion protect physical access storage device
On hand encryption secondary storage greatly complicates file management problem
In addition continuing research internal encryption device mentioned research requirement include special hardware configuration maintain absolute segregation uncleared user special software configuration automatic recertification procedure used system configuration change comprehensive automatic monitor hardware software security control reliable hardware architecture methodology identifying failure mode accurate prediction failure probability new machine architecture whose security control minimally affect efficiency cost system
Security control computer system especially one problem solution must based system point view
A number problem covered preceding discussion brought together briefly importance system whole
Given present state computer hardware software technology expect even best designed system relatively frequent malfunction
While system designer ingenious attempting arrange safeguard malfunction result serious consequence nonetheless given present lack experience computer system contain security safeguard strongly recommended redundancy incorporated throughout system safeguard
Redundancy might take form duplicate software residing different part memory software check verify hardware check vice versa hardware arrangement information representation duplication procedural check internal catalog security flag audit process monitor performance software hardware function
A particular point note absence parity check memory information transfer permit error perturb disable mislead security control
In absence parity check throughout machine configuration equivalent procedure must incorporated software
As system designer system operator acquire insight behavior configuration new revised certification test developed check one another aspect system behavior
Certification continuing process
It experience designer system even best ingenious design user system find way chaining together action foreseen designer many case lead undesirable disastrous consequence
Therefore order establish confidence security control certification procedure must include phase deliberately attempt penetrate best design conducted technically competent individual part design group operating agency administratively responsible either
During debugging new program testing program new data likelihood error much greater
It inappropriate levy security violation user security error occurring debugging phase dangerous risk agent conceal activity debugging error
Possibilities dealing problem include requiring user state intention debugging mode fact noted possibly authenticated system System Security Officer requiring debugging operate certified interpreter requiring debugging program operate dummy unclassified data reflecting error violation security control back user enforced delay resume work
Each system component individual user operator maintenance person etc
must isolated component system maximum practicable degree except needed job
Strict adherence principle isolation necessary order avoid undesirable unpredictable side effect case failure malfunction particular item system
System design must fault malfunction either equipment Supervisor software readily detectable
The damage resulting fault depends upon importance faulting element security control structure length time fault go undetected unremedied
Intermittent fault may go undetected procedure system system may automatically repeat faulting operation
Faults Supervisor tend subtle immediately detectable general principle desirable design Supervisor fault result gross misbehavior thus facilitating detection
However practice principle difficult apply complexity Supervisor software operational experience indicate general manner given software design fault
Where possible security control designed operator input action recorded automatically log transmitted System Security Officer thus minimizing opportunity operator take undetected hostile action
Also maximum extent possible check security control cross system component manual action checked equipment record software check hardware depend hardware checked
In principle number type depth security control system depend sensitivity information system class user served geographical distribution system nature service system provides user operational situation system support
In several place suggested detailed decision must made System Security Officer consideration sensitivity information classification level involved
The cost providing security control may turn substantially independent factor noted may strongly depend
Thus positive statement gradation security control await design implementation operational experience system
Examples feature whose presence frequency operation completeness checking might subject gradation At several place indicated system must designed aid user behave way helpful convenient
This point must taken lightly
User convenience important aspect achieving security control determines whether user tend find way get around ignore subvert control
Care must exercised create inadvertently system weakness centralizing much responsibility one individual
For example System Security Officer oversees protective feature system well controlling operational security status
Thus broad critical power becomes potential target subversion
Appropriate administrative procedural safeguard plus division responsibility power System Security Office required offset threat
A computer system malfunction way readily noticeable operator thus conceivable security control also malfunction fail without noticeable evidence
All security control must implemented way failure malfunction positively unambiguously transmitted preferably redundant fashion System Security Officer
In addition overall policy guidance technical method must effective set management administrative control procedure governing flow information computer system movement action within system environment people movable component demountable magnetic tape disc
An essential aspect effective control standardization activity need standard throughout system
Their presence make attempt subvert system much visible detectable
The discussion present typical procedure required suggests detail
For necessary provide form recording initiating controlling event definition documentation procedure checklist aiding execution procedure training aid periodic archival summary activity specification limitation personnel responsibility etc
Procedures must established putting system operation must include provision loading fresh certified copy Supervisor software verification correct loading validation system security check inserting relevant security parameter certification system security status System Security Officer
The procedure scheduled shutdown operation must take account proper notification System Security Officer physical protection demountable storage tape disc required orderly closing internal file validation suspension operation terminal demounting copy required part Supervisor software erasure part Supervisor software remaining working storage verification erasure Supervisor disconnection remote communication circuit physical securing power control
An unscheduled shutdown must initiate procedure immediate surveillance recording indicator help ascertain happened needed emergency action case fire water hazard etc
special surveillance physical protection measure guarantee demountable item removed immediate notification System Security Officer special security control example protecting printout including terminal accordance protection rule highest classification handled system situation resolved
If trouble condition caused system shut necessary procedure handle restart including loading new certified copy Supervisor software clearing internal state equipment order clean memory untidiness resulting shutdown verifying correct loading Supervisor validating security control security parameter certifying system security status System Security Officer
File control procedure include identifying cognizant agency file scheduling change file modifying access restriction file giving operator access demountable file moving file computing area handling file including mounting demounting tape disc sanitization file
These procedure must account control circulation storage tape disc use reuse sanitization classification marking entrance release area
Procedures punchcards form printout must cover accountability classification marking storage entrance release area
Additionally manual guide various system document must covered
Personnel control procedure include measure verifying clearance authorization personnel entry area system visual surveillance operating maintenance area logging escorting uncleared visitor
The reporting suspicious behavior security infraction included among personnel control procedure
Various procedure required respect operation remote terminal
These include provision logging user entry terminal area removal hardcopy proper marking hardcopy marked system clearing display securing required orderly shutdown
Procedures must provided authorizing security parameter entered system verifying correct entry changing basis shift day week etc
receiving processing request modify action taken case system emergency external crisis
These include procedure rigid control protection certified copy Supervisor software bearing system security threat system loading Supervisor making change verifying change
All maintenance performed hardware software must covered appropriate procedure including measure surveillance maintenance personnel properly cleared personnel verifying System Administrator adjustment made system configuration manually logging change adjustment made error discovered
Certification procedure embrace various personnel responsibility test inspection performed conduct responsibility System Security Officer etc
The production distribution document control manual guide job procedure must covered appropriate procedure must approved way conducting personnel training
These procedure include provision checklist action required changing mode removal storage paper medium demountable file physical electronic surveillance machine area purging printer running paper purging punchcard equipment running card removal erasure Supervisor software previous mode proper verification thereof loading Supervisor new mode proper verification thereof clearing storage device residual information previous mode carry forward removal print ribbon printer terminal typewriter storage destruction mounting file new mode certification security status new mode
Security control assurance includes procedure reporting anomalous behavior system security infraction monitoring security control including communication assuring continuity security control devolution responsibility case personnel nonavailability auditing user system behavior
The basic multilevel security problem consists determining whether individual particular clearance access quantum classified information given physical environment
While problem exists independently computer system introduction automated decision process requires formal specification decision rule used answer question
This Appendix address one solution problem detailing language defining security clearance structure system given definition automate protect integrity
This system provides classification protection information series authorization check verify impending user action permissible user current operational context
The operating environment proposed system exist discussed certainly vary depending equipment configuration installation
It assumed though operating environment posse following feature Since operating environment discussed detail implementation security system specified level logical processing insures integrity security system
The detail monitoring system System Security Officer observe activity within security system also treated
One important implementation issue covered however nature security system facilitating modification system security parameter minimizing problem separate certification system installation
Because complexity overall scheme controlling access classified formation may full range security control mechanism necessary installation
Furthermore matter precaution would undesirable divulge unnecessarily programming personnel detail security control method
Therefore approach conceive scheme structure security control procedure need described programming personnel
The specific security parameter available programmer must inserted hy local System Security Officer
It proposed computer system contain following information The detail parameter used developed
Certain assumption definition made purpose discussion b Access authorization must verified explicit reference name check organization check check combination check may required security procedure
This addition verification clearance status user requesting access given file
A status must associated user terminal status must associated file information
The word used part security structure language defined semantically equivalent
e The phrase taken mean normal defense clearance Top Secret Secret Confidential Uncleared hierarchical order
The national clearance status individual taken major parameter controlling access classified information
f If individual authorized access information Type A one national clearance level assumed principle granted access Type A information level national clearance
This intended rule following case believe common present manual practice
An individual national clearance Top Secret authorized access say cryptographic information granted Crypto access Secret level
This regarded illegal use clearance control structure
For purpose computer record individual granted say national Top Secret clearance access information Type A automatically assumed cleared Type A information Top Secret level imply however automatically authorized access level Type A information
Thus said national clearance factor distributes special information type
The phrase refer special clearance system compartment special grouping may within special clearance system major minor segment clearance system may specified
h A dissemination label regarded additional mean access control require verification user status
Examples label No Foreign Dissemination Not Releasable Outside Department Defense
An regarded controlling access information rather giving guidance user information may disseminated controlled utilized etc
Examples label Limited Distribution Special Handling Required Downgrading Group
j All name code word assumed unique
The computer system maintain catalog terminal may connected
For terminal maintain following information b Special code word group name name modify clearance level terminal receive class information
c A list user authorized use terminal may ALL
The electrical address
e The permanent identification number
f Physical location including building location room number cognizant agency
g Person responsible terminal perhaps telephone number
The first three item may time date dependent different parameter may specified different period normal working hour holiday weekend night shift
The computer system maintain catalog user authorized access user maintain following information b Special code word grouping word extend access class information date expiration special name
c His agency affiliation
His citizenship
e His agency assignment
f His permanent identification number Social Security
g Special designators explicitly contained first third item
The computer system maintain following information file Its national classification level
b Special name code word compartment name handling label serve control access file
c Access authorization list including one following may required Dissemination label
e Information label
f Background information file example information might desired The system automating multilevel security classification control described entirely table driven
As software implementation used installation using machine
The generation process described creates table used system affect software check
Thus installation personnel need know implement part security control system expected allowed modify
Each installation security control system generation process particularizes security table environment validity consistency check thus minimize recertification security control system
The card deck magnetic tape magnetic disc detailing security control system table produced generation process contain sensitive information resident computer system
As provision made directly classifying accessing information via file system rather special mechanism must provided limit access information responsible authority
vehicle describing computer system parameter affect individual access information
This consists describing relevant parameter individual permitted use system except information dealing security describing relevant parameter terminal may connected system except information dealing security describing relevant security parameter
The Personnel Terminal Definitions discussed since installation dependent within scope Report
process whereby System Security Officer responsible authority specifies Security Control Definition computer system
The computer system process information thing validity checking internal table storage generation thus render system ready actual use
After initial security system generated change Security Control Definition almost case handled directly system without cause regenerating security control system
The Security Control Definition consists five separate specification Security Structure Definition Personnel Security Definition Authorization Group Definition Terminal Security Definition Releasability Definition
specifies dissemination label way processed
It discussed unable determine standardized rigorous order current practice using label
We recommend area explored
Note processing dissemination label depend upon Personnel Definition
For example DoD Only file necessitate ability determine agency individual represents
The four specification Security Control Definition discussed
The reader directed Annex A formal System Access Specification slightly modified Form BNF
In addition language specification necessary specify algorithm processing information
These discussed obvious case
The reader reference Annexes read remainder discussion particularly Annex B contains example Security Component Definitions
The formally defines structure portion security classification control system applicable particular installation question
The language presented Annex A sufficient describe special clearance compartment familiar although actual example demonstrating completeness approach presented level classification
The Security Structure Definition consists number followed merge rule relating different component
A may compartment special gory special access
It reasonable expect change Security Structure Definition necessitate new system generation
The security structure language formally defines set relation among entity including name clearance classification code word label etc
The structure thought defining set decision rule computer system consult wish make decision ing security parameter
It immaterial decision rule actually stored computer present left individual software system designer
Following example Security Component Definition TOP SECRET SECRET CONFIDENTIAL UNCLEARED TOP SECRET TS SECRET S CONFIDENTIAL C UNCLEARED UR UNCLASSIFIED U TS IMPLIES S S IMPLIES C C IMPLIES UR TS ACCESSES TS S ACCESSES S C ACCESSES C UR ACCESSES U NONE NONE NONE TS S C U YIELDS TS S C U YIELDS S C U YIELDS C END The component name specified statement name normally applied classification system compartment special category
It within component listed definition
Note component name clearance name may
allows commonly used abbreviation synonym
The statement internal external particular component question handled way system software
They stipulated separately definition merely assist System Security Officer organizing thought defines security structure
A possible use statement create Universal Privileges discussed use also illustrated Example Annex B
These statement describe hierarchical relationship exist one clearance defined component either another clearance within component clearance another component respectively
This interpreted mean access authorized given clearance implies automatic access unless otherwise limited authorized clearance lower hierarchy
For example individual Top Secret clearance Top Secret implies Secret sense individual cleared Top Secret also access information individual cleared Secret access
Under one operator called access previously defined permit access information labelled
These rule explicitly state relation name clearance security component defined label information security clearance permit access
In many case word used specify clearance label indicating classification information example
The normal classification label file
For example certain security component require information within component handled via special channel fact explicitly stated piece information protected component
In effect required label regarded accessed clearance listed Security Component Definition synonym
The necessity view indicated Crypto example Annex B Example administrative traffic Crypto classification label still confined people must recognized system
Note information dissemination label although required information included present usage neither standardized logically consistent
When usage becomes standardized possible revise slightly scheme described accommodate handle automatically
The statement vehicle describing situation particular clearance requires simultaneous existence existence clearance access authorization see Examples Annex B
Note classification label mentioned since particular label accessed given clearance always determined
discussed fully contain information allows system determine automatically classification information result merging information various classification
Standard logical relationship utilizing Boolean connective permitted
The operator YIELDS mean combination classification label left requires classification label right placed merged information
After complete Security Structure Definition entered computer augmented set Requirement statement automatically constructed follows
For implication statement form either Internal External Structure statement Requirement statement modified conjunction
If previous Requirement statement
one must created
The purpose provide consistency minimization user clearance set
For example individual granted Top Secret clearance already possessing Secret clearance system rightfully expect Secret clearance removed Top Secret granted
Similarly instance interrelated component mandatory clearance mutually coexist another clearance implies see Example Annex B
The system includes capability result following rule In example given mean security officer must remove user Secret clearance adding user Top Secret status system
The system consistency checking mechanism described prevent Top Secret clearance accepted Secret clearance deleted
After Security Component Definitions entered computer preprocessing completed two consistency check made
The first insures clearance referenced defined clearance
The second insures chain exist lead contradiction
For example would form inconsistent set clearance clearance could never granted
The consistency check performed follows clearance Security Structure Definition Form expression called consistency expression consisting clearance tested
b Moving consistency expression left right pick next clearance expression replace conjuncted side Requirements statement clearance Security Component Definition enclosed parenthesis
c Repeat step b time moving next clearance appearing consistency expression next one right one processed clearance consistency expression processed
Assign value next clearance consistency expression one tested consistency rest security structure
e If set assignment made clearance consistency expression result value expression evaluated according normal rule Boolean expression evaluation clearance tested consistent rest Security Structure Definition
f If assignment found make consistency expression clearance tested inconsistent rest Security Structure Definition
The consistency expression inconsistent clearance must output system facilitate correction inconsistency
The consistency check continue look inconsistency particular Security Structure Definition accepted system
The system allow type error Security Structure Definition
After correcting inconsistency entire process Security Structure Definition must restarted beginning
Also complex processing described provision definition new clearance
g Repeat step e f time moving next clearance appearing consistency expression next one right one processed clearance consistency expression processed
provided permit automatic determination classification information produced combination information dissimilar classification see example National Clearances also Examples Annex B
Note relationship including hierarchical one must explicitly stated term classification label software expected infer one classification subsumes another
The actual merge rule processing follows b Simplify resultant merge label following rule Apply merge rule side special merge rule match concatenated label portion thereof replace portion side rule
Treat side merge Boolean expression evaluate according normal rule
If label appears concatenated label set consider expression otherwise
Hence right side substituted left side merge rule left side
In attempting apply step label freely reordered promote simplification
c If simplification result step b repeat step b c
The next step system generation Personnel Security Definition
It possible modify information subsequently use user clearance update language
The processing involved initial system generation subsequent update follows b The granting agency expiration date may specified clearance put user information presently utilized
The cognizant agency neither specified stored
This implies within automated security system Top Secret clearance granted one agency also implies access Top Secret information another agency unless additional label deny access applied information
c On addition deletion user clearance check made user exists addition clearance exists already granted user deletion user fact clearance deleted
At time Personnel Security Definition time granting additional clearance removing existing clearance user consistency check made insure Requirements statement user clearance still satisfied addition deletion new old clearance accomplished follows Notice algorithm used generating set label user clearance permit access explained File Access Processing step b c c deleted
For explicit clearance user granted including new one added excluding old one deleted check see requirement stated Requirements statement Security Component Definition satisfied occurrence absence clearance clearance set generated according normal rule Boolean expression evaluation
Authorization Group Definition occurs system generation time like Personnel Definition also may updated
There special processing explicitly required authorization group
A user authorized use system name authorization group
Updates made via authorization group update language
Under emergency condition may necessary grant user group user unrestricted access file system set file regardless clearance special access category restriction
Rather turning file safeguard system necessitating concern user identification protection terminal etc
especially emergency condition special capability provided within system system security control impaired
The System Security Officer normal Security Component Definition define universal emergency clearance implies clearance category system external requirement
It granted given user first removing clearance prevent clearance inconsistency check granting universal emergency clearance
Obviously number emergency clearance could set subset overall security system simply listing desired one External Structure statement
Universal authorization group defined handle problem overriding system file manipulation access authorization restriction
Membership group authorizes individual take action file permitted access either standing emergency basis
Examples universal authorization universal universal etc
Mechanisms described sufficient accommodating specific situation may arise assuming appropriate universal group predefined
In addition allow routine handling two situation normally requiring special provision
These privilege System Security Officer mechanism
The System Security Officer addition normal clearance status universal authorization authorization list file classification
The file backup program given clearance status handle file provide backup universal authorization enable read file
handled manner similar personnel security information
There exists capability update information
In present specification capability specify terminal access list included list authorized user given terminal
It appears present unnecessary complexity add already burdened system expect physical access terminal processing classified information normally controlled
Further control seems unnecessary desired mechanism similar already specified used
For example special clearance status defined access permitted particular terminal
Each time file created creator may specify individual group individual permitted access file well may
For file author may therefore specify authorization access list associated authorization
If specified default access list assumed fallow It noted syntax authorization specification provides capability removal author name access list
Unless explicitly done however author file permitted unrestricted access file well privilege changing authorization specification classification file
At present deemed necessary provide capability able syntactically distinguish authorization group identifier user identifier
Rather assumed processing algorithm check identifier question master list semantics obvious context
Anyone ability write file principle add information higher classification file
Therefore must way altering classification status file
Whether provided allowing anyone write privilege alter file classification directly requesting original author file alter classification requesting System Security Officer alter classification operational policy decision
The first alternative simplest may operationally desirable second person involved change classification
The mechanism overall scheme provide capability specify separate group individual alter classification file
The system must follow certain procedure attempting determine whether given user may reference particular file information
First user clearance must sufficient permit access file classification determined follows b Obtain set label user clearance permit access
This set may calculated needed time security system update time latter used updating user clearance System Security Officer allowed
c If set label user clearance status permit access contains label file classification status formal security accessing requirement satisfied
The method generating set label user clearance status permit access follows b Initialize null set label user clearance status permit access called
c For entry clearance set Add clearance set clearance category implied particular clearance entry either Internal External Structure statement within Security Component Definition
Delete entry clearance set
Apply identity transformation yield accessible label set delete duplicate
After user clearance status checked successfully permit access file security system must determine whether user satisfies authorization limitation file
This check determines user right specifies type manipulation allowed file question
The process carrying follows b For authorization type starting unrestricted access If authorization unrestricted access user qualifies grant block file authorization type stop processing right
The information block consulted Supervisor every operation order determine whether operation file legal
Thus authorization processing occurs linkage user file clearance status check made result creation data later used Supervisor controlling access file
The universal authorization algorithm consists checking universal group presence user set either explicitly name implicitly membership another group specified member universal group
If user sent set grant associated universal access privilege
Notation Standard Form BNF plus Consider class information called Crypto regarded restriction access national clearance system
Since Crypto information transmitted via special channel labelled administrative traffic without classification label Crypto still confined personnel regarding required label file accessed clearance listed definition
CRYPTO CRYPTO CRYPTO CRP NONE CRP ACCESSES CRP HANDLE VIA SPECIAL CHANNELS NONE CRP REQUIRES TS S NONE END Consider hypothetical refinement national clearance system called DATATEL follows DATATEL III I NONE III IMPLIES II II IMPLIES I III ACCESSES ABLE II ACCESSES BAKER I ACCESSES CHARLIE HANDLE VIA DATATEL CHANNELS ONLY NONE III REQUIRE TS REQUIRES S I REQUIRES C ABLE BAKER CHARLIE YIELDS ABLE BAKER CHARLIE YIELDS BAKER END Now consider hypothetical compartment information within DATATEL structure
It assumed APPLE information labelled carry codeword ALICE
The APPLE definition relates APPLE III DATATEL definition relates III ABLE also Top Secret
Thus system correctly determine proper classification label APPLE information TOP SECRET ABLE ALICE
Note also information two required label rule precedence must specified handle situation

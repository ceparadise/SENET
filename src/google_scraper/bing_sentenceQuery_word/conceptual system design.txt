A capture idea represents entity relationship
A conceptual model field special case general
To distinguish type model also known
Conceptual modeling confused modeling discipline physical modelling
The conceptual model explicitly chosen independent design implementation concern example concurrency data storage
The aim conceptual model express meaning term concept used domain expert discus problem find correct relationship different concept
The conceptual model attempt clarify meaning various usually ambiguous term ensure problem different interpretation term concept occur
Such differing interpretation could easily cause confusion amongst stakeholder especially responsible designing implementing solution conceptual model provides key artifact business understanding clarity
Once domain concept modeled model becomes basis subsequent development application domain
The concept conceptual model mapped physical design implementation construct using either manual
The realization conceptual model many domain combined coherent platform
A conceptual model described using various notation object modelling
In UML notation conceptual model often described represent concept represent relationship concept association represent role type taken instance modelled concept various situation
In ER notation conceptual model described ER Diagram entity represent concept represent relationship concept
Regardless notation used important compromise richness clarity business meaning depicted conceptual model expressing directly form influenced design implementation concern
This often used defining different process particular company institute

A system composed
idea concept
In context taken mean interrelated interworking set object
A conceptual system
Such system may related topic formal individual
Conceptual system may found within human mind work art fiction within academic world
Indeed article may understood conceptual system includes set interrelated concept
Broadly conceptual system includes range value idea belief conceptual system said
In conceptual system may refer individual world
In human conceptual system may understood kind world
In science many form conceptual system including law theory model
Those conceptual system may developed
The idea human mind might contain conceptual system go back least far Kelly
More recently many scholar discus conceptual system importance understanding

On personal level human mind generally held contain wide range conceptual system although well organized
Indeed mind full conflicting mental model make decision making unreliable particularly complex situation
Within academic literature theory may understood conceptual system
Conceptual system generally held greater value useful based research systemically interrelated
Generally validity may also described term internal conceptual system system

Coherence may tested individual academic theory
Correspondence generally tested condition
The conceptual system may said model physical social system serve guide individual behavior academic research
Examples conceptual system include A mental symbol typically associated corresponding representation denotes object given entity relationship
Concepts abstract omit thing treating identical
They universal apply equally everything extension
Concepts also basic element much way basic element
Unlike particular image individual object concept visualized
Because individual perception concept discursive result
They thought designated mean
Words concept
Words sign concept
A conceptual model representation phenomenon data theory logical mathematical object table formula axiom system rule inference etc
A conceptual model set expression model denote aspect modeled object
Here deliberately vague expression constructed model particularly logical structure formula model actually
In fact made assumption model encoded although briefly address issue
Moreover definition given oblivious whether two expression really denote thing
Note notion ontology different weaker ontology sometimes understood philosophy sense claim expression actually denote anything exists use Quine formulation
For example stochastic model stock price includes ontology sample space random variable mean variance stock price various regression coefficient etc
Models represented unit vector Hilbert space include ontology operator etc
It possible observables state quantum mechanic physically real electron model adopting purely formal notion ontology avoid altogether question
A used research outline possible course action present preferred approach project
It also defined organization idea achieve purpose The framework built set linked planned existing function relationship
A conceptual framework might computing term thought
For example conceptual framework accounting seek identify nature subject purpose broad content financial reporting qualitative characteristic financial information posse

Humans done amazing thing last couple century
We managed understand world scientifically staggering way smallest thing universe like quark make proton neutron largest observed cosmic structure Borealis Great Wall
We strong understanding universe work lot come way human think largely something called abstraction
An occurs take something real represent different often simpler form
Let say sitting math class begin learning algebra
Suddenly instead number math letter
You multiply variable variable get variable
These letter represent number
This example abstraction substituting something real something represents simpler way
Humans love represent one thing another
That Jesus spoke parable author use metaphor simile
When use one thing represent another easier understand
And basis way representing particular concept set concept help people understand simulate subject model
Often drawn diagram conceptual model show relationship factor flow data process
For example might conceptual model showing evening structured school day
Maybe homework first take break every hour total three hour eat dinner watching TV hour finally beginning bedtime routine
You could draw conceptual model diagram like The main characteristic goal conceptual model follows When applied scientific setting first characteristic important
The conceptual model improve understanding subject modeled
After greater understanding goal science
Conceptual model science simplified way explaining portraying concept helping boil complex idea make easier understand
However problem limitation conceptual model
Conceptual model tend simplified purposely simplified make useful
However simpler mean always perfectly accurate
Sometimes real world complicated conceptual model allows
But even true conceptual model good starting point

Another weakness conceptual model stretch truth make something understandable
For example people first learn atom shown model atom contain proton neutron center electron orbiting around outside
This make atom look lot like solar system nice simple circle
But truth electron move seemingly random way nowhere near neatly model show
The truth often little different shown conceptual model
Despite limitation conceptual model still extremely useful helped people better understand universe
Modeling big part science
The way scientist actually explain world take piece time
If try understand everything may become confusing overwhelming
For example scientist might come conceptual model explain cloud form
Then scientist might come model show water move along river model explain evaporation work
When put model together come wider conceptual model showing water cycle water move cloud river sea
Each individual model combined give u full understanding world
Models also used science education
You create graphic conceptual model scientific idea student often find much simpler understand
It easier grasp water cycle diagram solely listening teacher talk entire class
Even scientific method relies abstraction
The process scientist use learn world conceptual model
A way simplifying concept set concept make subject idea easier understand simulate
It show factor related outline flow process data
Conceptual model improve people understanding subject modeled communicate detail people
They also provide point reference design work useful documentation future
The main weakness conceptual model usually simpler reality stretch truth oversimplification
However central human mind work led lot scientific advance last year

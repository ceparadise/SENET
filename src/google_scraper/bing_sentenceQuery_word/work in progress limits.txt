Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Presenting something order obtain early feedback help crystallize idea
Unfortunately many graduate student need help getting hurdle presenting early research even research group
I giving talk presenting graduate student I like get input sort advice I give help willing share work
I concerned work stolen presentation occur locally
I like know get student present work best
Here
I grateful input see useful
It sound question use word one deterrent unwillingness student present
Since research group I assuming scooped something need worry
So real reason feel afraid seeming clueless knowing answer someone else find minute start presenting people deeming idea uninteresting
In word
One important transition grad student go point realize actually play research world make contribution
This often come first paper get published also happen first time talk senior researcher realize know person topic interest even first time prove brand new result
One advice might give talk show sausage made show initial idea might
That give model work
At least give example winding path research project take
A second advice give remember likely one know much problem
They may internalize yet repeated reminder might help When actually give talk Sylvain advice good however I think rule applies since research group probably outside expert probably generic audience
But I mention line I heard yesterday context journalism applies well talk inexperienced people Do overestimate audience knowledge underestimate intelligence
In word provide background need
But prove teeny little lemma scratch
I would advised follows Of course risk getting idea stolen risk keep sharing losing large part enjoyment scientific endeavour
In following student The WWH What
Why
How
approach always good structure presentation work progress
My opinion best first describe precise problem dealing
To contrary giving first broad context risk lose audience quickly
If start something focused people listens saying
The next step ass interest problem
Not interest work done solve important address issue
It time present YOUR work technique tool idea work
It also time ask help need help
Also keep mind third rule talk everybody people broad area last third expert put technicality
Presenting idea clear indeed difficult even faculty I think
In past used proceed step student
As second step formal talk according structured WWH rule called doctoral seminar
In seminar student presented almost finished work progress
For first step informal lunch talk student early stage idea
Typically consists bunch people eating pizza sitting front whiteboard projector screen listening student wanted formalized idea
I asked PhD talk prepare slide formal thing written next natural language sentence explaining thoroughly formal thing
The whiteboard used rewriting thing together student faculty
Each speaker limited time idea first talk try make thing precise come back next round week etc
We stopped sometimes people approach lead trouble think issue instance

Do team member long list uncompleted task end day
Do feel team result good could
Do think team might suffering multitasking
How deal improve team performance
You solve problem easily using WIP limit
Limiting amount Work Progress help team keep steady pace make sure one ever overwhelmed
Work Progress Limits help manage achieve good workflow
One core property Kanban Work Progress limited
Limiting WIP match team development capacity
Generally set WIP limit per column workflow stage
However also acceptable establish limit per person team
Setting WIP limit given column mean absolutely put another task column
Rather mean limit exceeded whole team take responsibility understanding situation occurred improve prevent happening
First setting Kanban WIP limit ask two critical question Remember secret formula setting accurate Work Progress limit
It common situation limit wrong beginning
You expect WIP limit stay currently defined long
They need adjusted
Therefore put much effort setting initial limit
A WIP limit help team focus correct decision completion quality
Moreover allows reduce multitasking task switching avoid distraction attain regular flow work predictable delivery measure real amount task done given time receive feedback limit waste due rework incorrect assumption enable pull model
Limiting Work Progress definitely solve problem team facing
However mean pretty much guaranteed fall victim time waster
Without WIP limit progress process improvement much slower
Teams imposed practice beginning reported growth capability delivered superior business result
A professional Kanban board solution allow easily customize board template well set Work Progress Limits
Kanban Tool provides possibility

Michael J Australia Friend Aeon Ideas change world Please support u continue work Ideas change world Please support u continue work Become Friend Aeon save article enjoy exclusive benefit Brought word Edited We live golden age technological medical scientific social progress
Look computer
Look phone
Twenty year ago internet creaky machine geek
Now imagine life without
We verge medical breakthrough would seemed like magic half century ago cloned organ therapy repair DNA
Even life expectancy rich country improving five hour day
A
Surely immortality something like around corner
The notion world one accelerating advance dominant seems churlish challenge
Almost every week read new hope cancer sufferer development lab might lead new cure talk new era space tourism fly round world hour
Yet moment thought tell u vision unparalleled innovation right many breathless report progress fact mere hype speculation even fantasy
Yet age speculation matched reality
It spluttered halt year ago
Most happened since merely incremental improvement upon came
That true age innovation I call Golden Quarter ran approximately
Just everything defines modern world either came seed sown time
The Pill
Electronics
Computers birth internet
Nuclear power
Television
Antibiotics
Space travel
Civil right
There
Feminism
Teenagers
The Green Revolution agriculture
Decolonisation
Popular music
Mass aviation
The birth gay right movement
Cheap reliable safe automobile
train
We put man Moon sent probe Mars beat smallpox discovered key life
The Golden Quarter unique period le single human generation time innovation appeared running mix dragster fuel dilithium crystal
Today progress defined almost entirely often banal improvement information technology
The US economist Tyler Cowen essay argues US least technological plateau reached
Sure phone great able fly across Atlantic eight hour eliminating smallpox
As US technologist Peter Thiel put We wanted flying car got Economists describe extraordinary period term increase wealth
After Second World War came boom US Europe rocketed
New industrial powerhouse arose ash Japan
Germany experienced
Even Communist world got richer
This growth attributed massive postwar government stimulus plus happy nexus low fuel price population growth high Cold War military spending
But alongside extraordinary burst human ingenuity societal change
This commented upon le often perhaps obvious maybe seen simple consequence economics
We saw biggest advance science technology biologist physicist material scientist better time working
But also saw shift social attitude every bit profound
In even enlightened society attitude race sexuality woman right would consider antediluvian
By old prejudice back foot
Simply put world changed
ut surely progress today real
Well take look around
Look airliner see basically updated version one flying slightly quieter Tristars better avionics
In regular airliner took eight hour fly London New York still
And one airliner could trip three hour
Now Concorde dead
Our car faster safer use le fuel paradigm shift
And yes living longer disappointingly little recent breakthrough
Since US Federal Government spent billion President Richard Nixon dubbed War Cancer
Far spent globally wealthy nation boasting body
Despite billion investment war spectacular failure
In US death rate kind cancer dropped per cent period according National Center Health Statistics
Even strip confounding variable age people living long enough get cancer better diagnosis blunt fact kind cancer chance much better
In many case treatment pretty much
After dizzying breakthrough century physic seems ground halt For past year science writer I covered extraordinary medical advance gene therapy cloned replacement organ therapy technology promised genomics tailored medicine
None new treatment yet routinely available
The paralyzed still walk blind still see
The human genome decoded one Quarter triumph nearly year ago still waiting see benefit time confidently asserted decade away
We still real idea treat chronic addiction dementia
The recent history psychiatric medicine according one eminent British psychiatrist I spoke history placebo
And recent advance longevity come simple expedient getting people give smoking eat better take drug control blood pressure
There new Green Revolution
We still drive steel car powered burning petroleum spirit worse diesel
There new material revolution since Golden Quarter advance plastic new alloy composite material
After dizzying breakthrough century physic seems Higgs boson aside ground halt
String Theory apparently best hope reconciling Albert Einstein Quantum world yet one idea even testable
And nobody Moon year
Why progress stopped
Why matter start dying ember Second World War
ne explanation Golden Age simple result economic growth technological spinoffs Second World War
It certainly true war sped development several weaponisable technology medical advance
The Apollo space programme probably could happened without aerospace engineer Wernher Von Braun ballistic missile
But penicillin jet engine even nuclear bomb drawing board first shot fired
They would happened anyway
Conflict spur innovation Cold War played part would never got Moon without
But someone pay everything
The economic boom came end collapse Bretton Woods trading agreement oil shock
So great age innovation
Case closed might say
And yet something quite fit
The recession temporary came soon enough
What term Gross World Product world two three time richer
There enough money new Apollo new Concorde new Green Revolution
So rapid economic growth drove innovation done since
In Cowen argues progress ground halt fruit plucked
These fruit include cultivation unused land mass education capitalisation technologist scientific breakthrough made century
It possible advance saw period similarly quick win progress much harder
Going jet perhaps easier going today aircraft something much better
But history suggests explanation fanciful
During period technological scientific expansion often seemed plateau reached new discovery shatter old paradigm completely
The famous example Lord Kelvin declared physic le year Einstein proved comprehensively wrong
As late turn century still unclear powered aircraft would develop several competing theory left floundering wake Wright brother triumph one saw coming
Lack money reason innovation stalled
What money might however
Capitalism great engine progress
It capitalism century built road railway steam engine telegraph another golden era
Capital drove industrial revolution
Now wealth concentrated hand tiny elite
A report Credit Suisse October found richest per cent human half world asset
That consequence
Firstly lot spend money today golden age philanthropy century
The superyachts fast car private jet gewgaw Planet Rich simply exist people Andrew Carnegie walked earth though doubt nice frippery much advance frontier knowledge
Furthermore French economist Thomas Piketty pointed money begets money time recent history
When wealth accumulates spectacularly nothing le impetus invest genuine innovation
new ideal render product obsolete fast possible During Golden Quarter inequality world economic powerhouse remarkably declining
In UK trend levelled year later reach historic low point
Is possible could relationship equality innovation
Here sketch might work
As success come defined amount money one generate short term progress turn defined making thing better rendering obsolete rapidly possible next iteration phone car operating system sold willing market
In particular share price almost entirely dependent growth opposed market share profit obsolescence becomes important driver innovation
Half century ago maker telephone TVs car prospered building product buyer knew least believed would last many year
No one sell smartphone basis today new ideal render product obsolete fast possible
Thus purpose iPhone better iPhone make aspirational people buy new iPhone feel better
In unequal society aspiration becomes powerful force
This new paradoxical result true innovation opposed marketing proxy stymied
In venture capital willing take risk particularly emerging electronic technology
Now conservative funding offer incremental improvement gone
But inequality failure capital
During Golden Quarter saw boom public spending research innovation
The taxpayer Europe US elsewhere replaced great venture capitalist
And find nearly advance period came either university popular movement
The first electronic computer came lab IBM university Manchester Pennsylvania
Even analytical engine Charles Babbage directly funded British government
The early internet came University California Bell Xerox
Later world wide web arose Apple Microsoft CERN wholly public institution
In short great advance medicine material aviation spaceflight nearly public investment
But since assumption made private sector best place innovate
The story past four decade might seem cast doubt belief
And yet pin stagnation ingenuity decline public funding
Tax spending research development general increased real relative term industrialised nation even since end Golden Quarter
There must another reason increased investment paying dividend
ould missing part jigsaw attitude towards risk
Nothing ventured nothing gained saying go
Many achievement Golden Quarter attempted
The assault smallpox spearheaded worldwide vaccination campaign probably killed several thousand people though saved ten million
In new medicine rushed market
Not worked thalidomide disastrous consequence
But overall result medical boom brought huge benefit million
Today impossible
The time new drug candidate gain approval US rose le eight year nearly year
Many promising new treatment take year reach market
In several medical charity research institute UK accused clinical regulation stifling medical advance
It would exaggeration say people dying cause making medicine safer
become potent weapon war progress front
In Swiss genetic engineer Ingo Potrykus developed variety rice grain rather leaf contain large concentration Vitamin A
Deficiency vitamin cause blindness death among hundred thousand every year developing world
And yet thanks campaign fundamentalist world seen benefit invention
Apollo happen today want go Moon risk would unacceptable In energy sector civilian nuclear technology hobbled series disaster including Three Mile Island killed one Chernobyl killed dozen
These incident caused global hiatus research could given u safe cheap energy
The climate change crisis might kill million one price paying year
Apollo almost certainly happen today
That people interested going Moon risk calculated chance astronaut dying would unacceptable
Boeing took huge risk developed extraordinary machine went drawing board flight five year
Its modern equivalent Airbus slightly larger slightly slower first flew project
Scientists technologist generally celebrated year ago people remembered world like penicillin vaccination modern dentistry affordable car TV
Now distrustful suspicious forgotten dreadful world Quarter
could world Alzheimer treatable clean nuclear power ended threat climate change cancer back foot Risk played part massive postwar shift social attitude
People often young prepared take huge physical risk right wrong world
The early civil right protestors faced tear gas worse
In feminist faced social ridicule medium approbation violent hostility
Now mirroring incremental change seen technology social progress often find blind alleyway political correctness
Student body used hotbed dissent even revolution today youth interested policing language stifling debate counter prevailing wisdom
Forty year ago burgeoning medium allowed dissent flower
Today different social medium seems despite democratic appearance enforcing climate timidity encouraging groupthink
oes really matter
So white heat technological progress cooling bit
The world general far safer healthier wealthier ever
The recent past grim distant past disgusting
As Steven Pinker others argued level violence human society declining since well Golden Quarter continued decline since
We living longer
Civil right become entrenched gay marriage legalised across world racist thinking met widespread revulsion
The world better
And yes seen impressive technological advance
The modern internet wonder impressive many way Apollo
We might lost Concorde fly across Atlantic couple day wage remarkable
vision future often improbable spacecraft flying car even Los Angeles Rick Deckard use payphone call Rachael
But could much better
If pace change continued could living world Alzheimer treatable clean nuclear power ended threat climate change brilliance genetics used bring benefit cheap healthy food bottom billion cancer really back foot
Forget colony Moon Golden Quarter become Golden Century battery magic smartphone might even last day

Insanity thing expecting different Considering classic Einstein quote education could ever accuse coalition government asking school improve result continuing practice using framework
What tasked though improving standard year getting grip unprecedented level educational reform real challenge u education
Of reform biggest likely Progress performance measure met quiet approval profession
Progress significant implication secondary school across country particularly curriculum design staffing structure teacher mindset concerned
But look wider implication actually calculate Progress score look like
If new Progress I written previously SecEd new measure including depth structure reason behind move away current five C GCSE benchmark see information link
However table show basic framework Progress structured term combination subject within
If done Progress homework know among student eight subject English math long student take English language literature best score feature basket
You also understand subject fill basket come following core additional science biology chemistry physic computer science history geography foreign language
Additionally student option taking three vocational qualification GCSE equivalent three feature headline figure opposed current system two count
These vocational qualification feature basket must taken approved list
For school leader useful think student might scored Progress performance measure allow school ascertain current curriculum structure set meet new demand
So Progress score calculated
First need work Attainment score using table
The next table example student taken eight qualification fill Progress basket
So Attainment student score
Let imagine student key stage Average Points Score APS Level
This would probably mean expected Attainment score would point new system projected target grade issued Department Education using data similar ability student three year previous see previous article detail aspect
To calculate Progress subtract student expected Attainment score actual Attainment score divide number eight subject taken math English counting double
This mean calculation student would
And divided brings u
The Progress score would calculated adding individual Progress score year student dividing number cohort
If school dip probably trigger inspection anticipated level new floor standard
So introduction Progress important school curriculum model
The significant aspect school leader need consider English Baccalaureate subject fall within basket
If school implement curriculum student take qualification feature basket zero scored slot
The happen student take six seven qualification total
However circumstance Attainment score still divided
As result student scoring zero slot significant impact individual Progress score whole school well
So real term school need look
To take example vocational qualification science delivered significant group student time student taking three subject fall within basket empty slot therefore lower Progress score
This mean across country school need carefully consider whether continue offer vocational science qualification student whether go back traditional core additional science offer
Schools also need decide arrange option process key stage
If process enables student select group subject include EBacc subject basket risk student score zero slot therefore Progress score lower
By structuring main accountability measure way government ensured vast majority school deliver academic core student includes English math along least three EBacc subject
This may well aspect accountability measure educationalist disagree given limit subject student able opt progress key stage
Others would argue enabling student study three vocational subject let forget challenging Report still opportunity study broad range subject
Some school leader inevitably find difficult conversation parent student currently year especially expecting able completely free choice key stage qualification
There equally difficult decision school make already embarked key stage student
Many school started key stage qualification current year student September curriculum model may well include vocational science course example might include EBacc subject basket
These school facing dilemma whether continue course potentially score lower Progress score reform come effect whether try adapt curriculum model
Rightly wrongly many u education preoccupied getting student crucial C D grade borderline order service requirement current five C accountability system
We need shed obsession C borderline ensure devoting equitable amount time resource every student achieving best grade possible
Whether wholeheartedly agree recent accountability reform undeniable shift towards system equitable towards student encourages school squeeze every last drop potential student surely must seen good thing

We demonstrate example
A function may also give back value like output
For example function short give back largest argument must number
The function friend behaves similarly function return smallest argument
Functions combined create complicated expression
You limited using function Python
In lesson learn define new function
If call function enough argument input many argument get error

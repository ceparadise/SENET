I Googled long time I still understand work explanation technical illustration make clearer
My primary confusion virtual memory
I hope question good explanation people ask question find Google
I admit two concept seem quite complicated similar beginning
Sometimes also taught confusingly
A good reference opinion found For sake completion I try explain I guarantee correctness I developed OS month
Segmentation older concept opinion confusing
Segmentation work name say
A segment continuous block memory specific size
To access memory within segment need
This make total two address component fact stored two register
One idea segmentation enlarge memory register
The sort protection elaborate one paging
Because use two register access memory split memory chunk said called segment
Consider memory
This split bit register segment byte
Of course also bit register offset
Addressing byte bit quite useless decided segment overlap I think also performance programming reason back
The following formula used access memory segmentation This mean segment time offset
This also mean address accessed many way
also
This segmentation old day
If look assembler program try something see even called register assembler CS DS code segment data segment
Later called GDT introduced
This global table specific position RAM segment number memory address several option segment given
This brings u nearer concept paging still
So programmer decide segment start
A new concept also GDT one could decide long segment
So segment long bit register limit could defined programmer
You could overlapping segment also purely separated segment
When accessing A B still two register used accessing memory A entry GDT
So look entry GDT see memory location segment start large
We check B offset within allowed memory area
Now paging different newer segmentation approach paging page fixed size
So limit longer programmable page currently
Furthermore unlike segmentation logical address space continuous without physical address continuous
Paging also us table look stuff still split logical address part
The first part number entry page table second part offset
However offset fixed length bit access
You also two part multiple page table used
Two level page table quite common system I think even three level page table common
I hope I able explain least bit I think exaplanation also confusing
Best thing dive kernel programming try implement basic stuff booting OS
Then find everything due backwards compability everything still modern PCs
I direct Segmentation starting die
I suspect paging well future
Edit Let add clarification Segmentation paging two difference mean memory management typically two thing
At risk oversimplification Segmentation allows process access memory natural pointer size would allow
Paging allows process access memory system physically support
Segments The bit system
That allows addressing memory
Late system much memory
A process could map different segment physical memory
A process could access memory could change memory could access within
The successor brought segmenting high art
Using even complex system base register process could access larger area memory
Paging Is system process see continuous relatively range memory address divided page
For example VAX processor bit address allowing access memory theoretically computer typically memory
A process could access much memory system physically plus multiple process
These system presented continuous range memory process virtual memory divided page around byte defined set table mapped disk storage
If process accessed page memory triggered hardware exception
The operating system would intercept exception allocate new page physical memory load memory disk restart instruction
If operating system needed memory handle request would page memory already loaded
If data read usually would loaded executable image would paged
The page could marked invalid
If memory page would written page file storage needed
The Intel chip introduced bizarre system combined segment paging
Segments used data protection
The processor mode away

A contiguous block described single entry
It smallest unit data memory management virtual memory
Similarly smallest contiguous block memory page mapped operating system
A transfer page main memory auxiliary store hard disk drive referred swapping
Page size usually determined processor architecture
Traditionally page system uniform size example
However processor design often allow two sometimes simultaneous page size due benefit
There several point factor choosing best page size
Most operating system allow program discover page size runtime
This allows program use memory efficiently aligning allocation size reducing overall internal fragmentation page
system may use system function illustrated following example written programming language
In many Unix system command line utility used
For example return page size byte
operating system family may use system function
Some support multiple page size including page significantly larger standard page size
The available page size depend instruction set architecture processor type operating addressing mode
The operating system selects one size size supported architecture
Note processor implement defined larger page size
This support larger page known Linux terminology allows best world reducing pressure sometimes increasing speed much depending application allocation size large allocation still keeping memory usage reasonable level small allocation
Starting processor support MiB page called MiB page using addition standard KiB page newer processor newer processor later processor use GiB page
support many eight different page size KiB MiB architecture similar feature
Larger page despite available processor used contemporary common use except application application typically found large server operating system
Commonly use requires elevated privilege cooperation application making large allocation usually setting flag ask operating system huge page manual administrator configuration operating system commonly sometimes design page disk
However support multiple page size
Each individual process provide hint operating system automatically use largest page size possible given region address space
supported huge page several architecture since series via filesystem without hugetlbfs since
newer support huge page name page
support large page internally expose application
beginning version support large page
FreeBSD feature superpages
Note recently Linux application needed modified order use huge page
The kernel introduced support transparent use huge page
On Linux kernel supporting transparent huge page well FreeBSD Solaris application take advantage huge page automatically without need modification

In scheme computer store retrieves data use
In scheme operating system retrieves data secondary storage called
Paging important part implementation modern operating system using secondary storage let program exceed size available physical memory
For simplicity main memory called RAM acronym secondary storage called disk shorthand concept depend whether term apply literally specific computer system
introduced paging first mass market memory page concept computer architecture regardless whether page moved RAM disk
For example instruction bit comprised memory address selected one word
This zone memory called
This use term rare
In swapping early virtual memory technique
An entire program would RAM disk another one would
A program would current execution would suspended RAM use another program
A program might include multiple occupy memory different time
Overlays method paging RAM disk merely minimizing program use RAM
Subsequent architecture used individual program segment became unit exchanged disk RAM
A segment program entire code segment data segment sometimes large data structure
These segment resident RAM requiring additional computation movement remedy
The invention let processor operate arbitrary page anywhere RAM seemingly contiguous space
These page became unit exchanged disk RAM
When program try reference page currently present RAM processor treat invalid memory reference transfer control program operating system
The operating system must When page frame use operating system must select page frame reuse page program need
If evicted page frame program hold data program modified since read RAM word become dirty must written disk freed
If program later reference evicted page another page fault occurs page must read back RAM
The method operating system us select page frame reuse important efficiency
The operating system predicts page frame least likely needed soon often LRU algorithm algorithm based program
To increase responsiveness paging system may predict page needed soon preemptively loading RAM program reference
After completing initialization program operate small number code data page compared total memory program requires
The page frequently accessed called
When working set small percentage system total number page virtual memory system work efficiently insignificant amount computing spent resolving page fault
As working set grows resolving page fault remains manageable growth reach critical point
Then fault go dramatically time spent resolving overwhelms time spent computing program written
This condition referred
Thrashing occurs program work huge data structure large working set cause continual page fault drastically slow system
Satisfying page fault may require freeing page soon disk
Thrashing also used context virtual memory system example describe issue computing networking
A worst case imagined comparable mainframe
An execute instruction crossing page boundary could point move instruction also cross page boundary set move data source cross page boundary target cross page boundary
This single instruction reference eight page RAM cause page fault
If operating system could allocate eight page program remedying page fault would discard another page instruction need restart instruction would fault
To decrease excessive paging resolve thrashing problem user increase number page available per program either running fewer program concurrently increasing amount RAM computer
In environment many user may execute program written code data separate page
To minimize use RAM user share single copy program
Each process set page address code point single shared copy page address data point different physical page process
The first computer support paging jointly developed
The machine associative memory one entry word page
The Supervisor handled interruption managed transfer page core drum order provide store program
Paging feature since
Windows creates named use swap file
It generally found may appear elsewhere typically WINDOWS directory
Its size depends much swap space system setting selected user Enhanced Virtual Memory
If user move deletes file appear next time Windows started The permanent swap file corrupt
The user prompted choose whether delete file whether exists
use similar file setting located Control Panel System Performance tab Virtual Memory
Windows automatically set size page file start size physical memory expand physical memory necessary
If user run application system low physical memory preferable manually set size value higher default
The file used paging family
The default location page file root directory partition Windows installed
Windows configured use free space available drive pagefiles
It required however boot partition
drive containing Windows directory pagefile system configured write either kernel full memory dump
Windows us paging file temporary storage memory dump
When system rebooted Windows copy memory dump pagefile separate file free space used pagefile
In default configuration Windows pagefile allowed expand beyond initial allocation necessary
If happens gradually become heavily potentially cause performance problem
The common advice given avoid set single locked pagefile size Windows expand
However pagefile expands filled default configuration total amount physical memory
Thus total demand virtual memory must exceed computer physical memory pagefile expand
The fragmentation pagefile occurs expands temporary
As soon expanded region longer use next reboot sooner additional disk space allocation freed pagefile back original state
Locking pagefile size problematic Windows application request memory total size physical memory pagefile leading failed request allocate memory may cause application system process fail
Also pagefile rarely read written sequential order performance advantage completely sequential page file minimal
However large pagefile generally allows use application penalty beside using disk space
While fragmented pagefile may issue fragmentation variable size page file time create number fragmented block drive causing file become fragmented
For reason contiguous pagefile better providing size allocated large enough accommodate need application
The required disk space may easily allocated system recent specification
system GB memory GB pagefile GB disk drive system GB memory GB pagefile TB disk space
In example system using disk space pagefile maximum
page file also occasionally recommended improve performance Windows system chronically using much memory total physical memory
This view ignores fact aside temporary result expansion pagefile become fragmented time
In general performance concern related pagefile access much effectively dealt adding physical memory
system operating system use term swap describe act moving memory page RAM disk region disk page stored
In system common dedicate entire partition hard disk swapping
These partition called
Many system entire hard drive dedicated swapping separate data drive containing swap partition
A hard drive dedicated swapping called swap drive scratch drive
Some system support swapping swap partition others also support swapping file
The Linux kernel support virtually unlimited number swap backends device file supporting time assignment backend priority
When kernel need swap page physical memory us backend available free space
If multiple swap backends assigned priority used fashion somewhat similar storage layout providing improved performance long underlying device efficiently accessed parallel
From perspective swap file version later Linux kernel virtually fast swap partition limitation swap file contiguously allocated underlying file system
To increase performance swap file kernel keep map placed underlying device access directly thus bypassing cache avoiding filesystem overhead
Regardless recommends swap partition used
When residing HDDs rotational magnetic medium device one benefit using swap partition ability place contiguous HDD area provide higher data throughput faster seek time
However administrative flexibility swap file outweigh certain advantage swap partition
For example swap file placed mounted file system set desired size added changed needed
Swap partition flexible enlarged without using partitioning tool introduce various complexity potential downtime
When system memory highly insufficient current task large portion memory activity go slow swap system become practically unable execute task even CPU idle
When every process waiting swap system considered
Swap death happen due incorrectly configured
The original description swapping death problem relates memory X swap every keystroke requires Linux read swap processed system practically unresponsive even actually executing task normally
us multiple swap file
The default installation place root partition though possible place instead separate partition device
introduced new system allocating RAM defragmenting physical memory
It still us flat shared address space defragmented
It based paging memory allows swapping
Paging implemented may lock system physical memory used
Swap memory could activated deactivated moment allowing user choose use physical RAM
The backing store virtual memory operating system typically many order slower
Additionally using mechanical storage device introduces several millisecond hard disk
Therefore desirable reduce eliminate swapping practical
Some operating system offer setting influence kernel decision
Many operating system example allow using multiple storage device swap space parallel increase performance
In older virtual memory operating system space swap backing store reserved program allocate memory runtime data
Operating system vendor typically issue guideline much swap space allocated
Paging one way allowing size address used process process virtual address space logical address space different amount main memory actually installed particular computer physical address space
In system size process virtual address space much larger available main memory
For example A computer true addressing may addressable unit RAM installed
An example processor without PAE
In case processor able address RAM installed
However even case paging used create virtual memory GB
For instance many program may running concurrently
Together may require GB RAM
A paging system make efficient decision memory relegate secondary storage leading best use installed RAM
Although processor example address RAM beyond GB operating system may provide service program envision larger memory file grow beyond limit installed RAM
The operating system let program manipulate data file arbitrarily using paging bring part file RAM necessary
A computer main memory larger virtual address space process machine system using processor
This nullifies significant advantage virtual memory since single process use main memory amount virtual address space
Such system often use paging technique obtain secondary benefit The size cumulative total virtual address space still limited amount secondary storage available

Suppose I system logical physical address space page size byte
For simplicity ignore bit page table
How many section logical address divided many bit section
The logical address divided three section one section outer page one inner page one offset
The outer page section contains bit
The inner page contains bit
The offset section contain bit
Is right
Will structure page table level
How would I convert logical address physical address
I think need page table level
Here page table look like
This picture
Each page system need bottom bit virtual logical address index physical page
The number bit needed level calculated follows The size page page table entry byte fit entry per page need bit logical address level table
Walking tree work like
There register pointer top page
At level take pointer top page take bit logical address multiply use byte offset page
You read page table entry give pointer top page page table next level deep tree
In case page table entry
need space store physical pointer aligned page
Your physical address bit know bottom bit page aligned page table entry need least bit even leaving bit
And problem even told worry control bit
So I think get away page table containing
It might realistic assume would need room expansion either increase number control bit increase size physical address space might want
byte page table could contain entry
So bit calculation
If assuming page table entry requires byte instead byte could fit entry page table would take bit logical address
So case bit offset bottom multiple level depending choice bit
So level table offset cover bit logical address
I think need one level
The top level page full bit left top logical address

To basic approach providing virtual memory paging segmentation
Paging
With paging process divided relatively small page
Paging system transfer block information primary secondary memory
Because fixed page size page frame size translation binary virtual address corresponding physical address relatively simple provided system efficient table lookup mechanism
Paging system use associative memory implement page translation table
Paging us address like used address cell within particular segment
In paging virtual address space linear sequence virtual address format differs hierarchical segmentation address space
In paging system programmer specific mechanism informing virtual memory system logical unit virtual address space done segmentation
Instead virtual memory manager completely responsible defining unit transfer page moved back forth primary secondary memory
The programmer need aware unit virtual address space loaded unloaded physical memory
In fact page size transparent process

Several address line card place cache directory upper address bit tag bit compared address ensure hit
If comparison valid result cache miss simply miss
The address given cache processor actually subdivided several piece different role accessing data figure
Direct Mapping Cache Figure Philip Operates fashion somewhat similar cache

The array drive appears host computer one logical drive
The Mean Time Between Failure MTBF array equal MTBF individual drive divided number drive array
Because MTBF array RAID low system
However disk array made fault tolerant redundantly storing information various way

Increasing Logical Drive Performance Without array controller connecting extra physical disk system increase total storage capacity
However effect efficiency operation data transferred one physical disk time see Figure
With array controller connecting extra physical disk system increase total storage capacity efficiency
The capacity several physical disk combined one virtual unit called logical drive also called logical volume
The head physical disk logical drive active simultaneously improving performance reducing total time required data transfer see Figure
William Because head physical disk active simultaneously amount data written disk given time interval
Each unit data called block
The block form set data stripe spread evenly physical disk logical drive see Figure William
For data logical drive readable data block sequence must every stripe
This sequencing process performed Smart Array Controller sends data block physical disk writing head correct order
In striped array physical disk logical drive contains amount data
If one physical disk larger capacity physical disk logical drive extra capacity used
A logical drive extend one channel controller extend one controller
Disk failure although rare potentially catastrophic array

RAID fastest efficient array type offer fault tolerance
RAID requires minimum two drive
RAID best choice environment
RAID choice two drive used
RAID seldom used today since ECC embedded hard drive
RAID supported Adaptec RAID controller
RAID used speed data transfer provide fault tolerance environment access long sequential record
However RAID allow overlapping multiple operation requires drive avoid performance degradation short record
Because RAID small stripe size offer
Similar performance RAID supported Adaptec RAID controller
RAID offer advantage RAID support multiple simultaneous write operation
RAID supported Adaptec RAID controller
RAID combine efficient data storage good performance characteristic
However write performance performance drive failure slower RAID
Rebuild operation also require time parity information also reconstructed
At least three drive required RAID array
Striped data dual distributed parity except us second level independently calculated distributed parity information additional fault tolerance
This extra fault tolerance provides data security event two drive fail drive replaced
While RAID level provide greater fault tolerance level significant loss write performance due requirement storing parity twice write operation
A configuration also requires drive accommodate additional parity data make le cost effective equivalent storage capacity
RAID Stripe set mirrored array RAID also called RAID combination RAID level
In type implementation stripe set data created across array performance benefit
A duplicate first stripe set mirrored another array fault tolerance
While configuration provides performance benefit redundancy level costly implement minimum four disk necessary create RAID configuration
NOTE A RAID configuration continue operation even two disk failed provided two disk part mirror set
RAID Stripe set parity array RAID level also called RAID combination RAID level
Multiple array striped together using
Parity maintained separately group striped array
This level provides advantage small data transfer added performance striping disk operation
Also parity calculated independently component one array degraded effect overall operation significant single array
However overhead incurred parity generation still present
Normally cause noticeable degradation unless dependent XOR functionality large number disk array
RAID subsystem support XOR provide performance nearly equal configuration added protection data parity information event disk failure
A minimum six disk required RAID configuration
NOTE A RAID configuration continue operation even two disk failed provided two disk part parity group

If operating system allocates fewer eight page actual memory attempt swap part instruction data bring remainder instruction page fault thrash every attempt restart failing instruction
Thrashing best known context memory storage analogous phenomenon occur including Where main memory accessed pattern lead multiple main memory location competing cache line resulting excessive
This problematic cache low
Where TLB acting cache MMU translates virtual address physical address small working set page

Thus even code data working set fit cache working set across many page virtual address working set may fit TLB causing TLB thrashing
Frequent due failure allocate memory object due insufficient free memory insufficient contiguous free memory due referred heap thrashing
A similar phenomenon occurs process interacting process scheduled run time experience process thrashing due repeatedly scheduled unscheduled progressing slowly

In field transaction management system abstract model describe execution transaction running system
Often operation action ordered time performed set executed together system
If order time certain operation determined system used
Examples operation requesting read operation reading writing aborting committing requesting lock locking etc
Not transaction operation type included schedule typically selected operation type data access operation included needed reason describe certain phenomenon
Schedules schedule property fundamental concept database theory
The following example schedule In example horizontal axis represents different transaction schedule The vertical axis represents time order operation
Schedule D consists three transaction
The schedule describes action transaction seen
First Reads Writes object X Commits
Then Reads Writes object Y Commits finally Reads Writes object Z Commits
This example schedule sequential overlap time action three transaction sequential transaction interleaved time
Representing schedule D table rather list convenience identifying transaction operation glance
This notation used throughout article
A common way technical literature representing schedule list Usually purpose reasoning concurrency control database operation modeled occurring point time without duration
When satisfactory start end possibly point event specified rarely
Real executed operation always duration specified respective time occurrence event within exact time beginning completion concurrency control reasoning usually precedence time whole operation without looking quite complex detail operation matter operation another operation
Furthermore many case relationship two specific operation matter specified specified pair operation
In general operation transaction schedule interleave transaction executed concurrently time order operation transaction remain unchanged implied transaction program
Since always time order operation transaction matter need specified schedule general operation rather order pair determined list operation
Also general case transaction may consist several process properly represented partial order operation rather total order
Thus general schedule partial order operation containing partial order transaction
two operation represented operation existence pair mean always schedule general case ordered pair
Such set schedule represented DAG operation node cycle allowed since cycle mean first operation cycle another second operation cycle contradicts perception
In many case graphical representation graph used demonstrate schedule
Since list operation table notation used article always represents total order operation schedule total order represented list always represented DAG
The transaction executed see example serial schedule one transaction start running transaction ended
A schedule equivalent outcome serial schedule property
In schedule E order action transaction executed D end E give result Two action said conflict conflicting pair The following set action conflicting While following set action The schedule said following two condition satisfied A schedule said schedule one serial schedule
Another definition schedule graph committed transaction considered acyclic graph defined include also uncommitted transaction cycle involving uncommitted transaction may occur without conflict serializability violation
Which serial schedule
A schedule said obeys CO also schedule property
This mean order time transaction commitment event compatible precedence partial order respective transaction induced schedule acyclic precedence graph serializability graph conflict graph
This implies also
The CO property especially effective achieving distributed system
discovered obviously mentioned
Its correct definition appears however description related technique theory partial inaccurate misleading
For extensive coverage commitment ordering source see
Two schedule said following condition satisfied A schedule said serial schedule
Note definition schedule
Notice example example discussion time
There however schedule schedule transaction performing The example since serial schedule
Since determining whether schedule little practical interest
Transactions commit transaction whose change read commit
These schedule recoverable
F recoverable commits make value read correct
Then commit
In aborted abort value A read incorrect
In case database left consistent state
If transaction abort transaction commits relied unrecoverable schedule
In example G unrecoverable read value A written committed
later aborted therefore value read wrong since committed schedule unrecoverable
Also named cascadeless
Avoids single transaction abort lead series transaction rollback
A strategy prevent cascading abort disallow transaction reading uncommitted change another transaction schedule
The following example one discussion recoverable In example although recoverable avoid cascading abort
It seen abort aborted order maintain correctness schedule already read uncommitted value written
The following recoverable schedule avoids cascading abort
Note however update A always lost since aborted
Note Schedule would serializable would committed
Cascading abort avoidance sufficient necessary schedule recoverable
A schedule strict strictness property two transaction write operation precedes operation either read write commit abort event also precedes conflicting operation
Any strict schedule cascadeless converse
Strictness allows efficient recovery database failure
The following expression illustrate hierarachical containment relationship class The illustrates clause graphically
In practice general purpose database system employ recoverable primarily strict schedule

Computer Science All President bold new initiative empower American student kindergarten high school learn computer science equipped computational thinking skill need creator digital economy consumer active citizen world
Our economy rapidly shifting educator business leader increasingly recognizing computer science CS new basic skill necessary economic opportunity social mobility
CS All build effort already led parent teacher school district state private sector leader across country
Last year tech job across United States unfilled percent STEM job projected computer field
Computer science data science important tech sector many industry including transportation healthcare education financial service
Parents increasingly recognize need
However estimate one quarter school United States offer computer science programming coding state still allow count towards high school graduation even advanced economy making available student
Wide disparity exist even access course
In addition course access challenge medium portrayal classroom curriculum material unconscious bias stereotype exacerbate problem discourage many student taking course
For example
These statistic mirror current makeup America largest innovative tech firm woman compose le technical employee le percent
We better
Tech career exciting fun collaborative well critical economy
We want Americans opportunity part team
CS For All help make reality ensure every student access Computer Science classroom level
When come computer science student President Obama led way CS Student became first President write line code
His first line code moveForward CS All moving forward together
Who taught code
A student named Adrianna Newark New Jersey took computer science course school

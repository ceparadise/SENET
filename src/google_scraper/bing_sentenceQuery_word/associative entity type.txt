What difference associative entity associative relationship attribute
In book titled Modern Database Management Hoffer edition author state difference two
Though really explain difference instead give example different
From I gather relationship attribute associated associative relationship attribute denoted dashed line rectangle attribute inside rectangle
Whereas associative entity attribute describe relationship
Both used relationship ER diagramming
Is thought process correct
Edit Also I forgot mention associative entity also attribute unique identifier least I think
An table associate two table many many relationship
An associative relationship attribute attribute associative entity exists many many relationship
Here example
Let suppose following table
Ok many many relationship User Permission
A user one permission permission shared many user
So create associative entity
The permission granted time stamp associative relationship attribute
It would fit User table Permission table
It attribute association
In ER diagramming M N relationship associative entity OR single associative attribute describe relationship
The difference associative entity must unique identifier associative attribute

Learn something new every day email In model data abstractly conceptually represented software engineering associative entity one part model
Relational model often made represent data database system used organize data understandable readable schema
Entities could represent anything including people place object event concept
Associative entity connection describe relationship two different entity
These entity relationship meaning one associative entity may multiple relationship connection parent child entity
Associative entity convey information attribute connection
They considered entity attribute considered relationship link entity together
These kind entity frequently many relationship connection attributable independent meaning entity
It also good practice relational model associative entity least one attribute distinguishable identifier entity
Associative entity also participant relationship separate associated entity relationship
Primary key part associative entity well identifier adjoin certain table relational model
Though table may contain one primary key combination column uniquely specify row
There difference unique key primary key primary key enforce null constraint table entity
Another aspect differentiates primary key unique key primary key selected key first importance
Primary index created management primary key ease use enforcement database
Associative entity contained used junction table table relational model contain common field two table
Junction table employed deal relationship particular database
One example database employ associative entity use junction table enrollment student course
In case table data student connected indirectly table data course intermediate table contains data associated student course data connecting table
Can associative entity act parent entity fourth table ERD
That
I think incorporate entity modeling incremental way
I think pretty much nothing whole point model created whole database associative entity table
I used think great
If want tinker first I would use small project test
If work start using production database
MrMoody From I gather entity relationship database model high level abstraction database
The associative entity article talk nothing relationship similar could create database platform
I suppose thing make different simple relationship property
I know important application
Most people want relate information together query make sense generate meaningful report
Personally I think new technology try integrate around edge currently use see work first going full throttle
I work software company recently started work entity relationship model database design
Basically happens instead building database software independently build database first relationship table primary key
Then use wizard tool create entity relational diagram database along skeleton code allow modify database directly
The diagram contains associative entity correspond relationship original database
In word completed database serf template drive code look like
This different traditional approach software engineering build database software separately wire software talk database manipulate
One editor review suggestion make change warranted
Note depending number suggestion receive take anywhere hour day
Thank helping improve wiseGEEK

In represents countable number ordered value may occur
An instance list computer representation concept finite potentially infinite analog list
Lists basic example contain value
If value occurs multiple time occurrence considered distinct item
The name also used several concrete used implement abstract list especially
Many provide support special syntax semantics list list operation
A list often constructed writing item sequence separated within pair delimiters
Some language may allow list type like case data type accurately described array
In list usually provided subclass generic list class traversed via separate
List data type often implemented using linked list sort may appropriate application
In context programming term list may refer specifically linked list rather array
In abstract list usually defined two operation yield empty list add item beginning list
Implementation list data structure may provide following Lists typically implemented either either singly doubly linked usually variable length
The standard way implementing list originating programming language element list contain value pointer indicating location next element list
This result either depending whether list nested sublists
Some older Lisp implementation Lisp implementation also supported compressed list using special internal representation invisible user
Lists manipulated using
The former often preferred latter norm
Lists implemented holding pair providing access element
residing fringe internal node storing child index used guide search taking time logarithmic list size long change much provide illusion enable swap prefix append operation logarithmic time well
Some language offer list offer use kind table emulate list
For example provides table
Although Lua store list numerical index array internally still appear dictionary
In list fundamental data type represent program code data
In dialect list first three prime number could written
In several dialect Lisp including list collection pair consisting value pointer next pair null value making singly linked list
As name implies list used store list element
However unlike traditional list expand shrink stored dynamically memory
In computing list easier implement set
A finite mathematical sense realized list additional restriction duplicate element disallowed order irrelevant
Sorting list speed determining given item already set order ensure order requires time add new entry list
In efficient implementation however set implemented using rather list
Lists also form basis including variation
The abstract list type element type list defined following function axiom element list
It implicit Note first nil rest nil defined
These axiom equivalent abstract data type
In definition simply regarded defined term constructor
In algebraic term represented transformation
obtained constructor separately handling case
The list type form following function using rather represent monomorphic list element type defined Alternatively monad may defined term operation Note since applied progressively deeper argument recursive call
The list type additive monad monadic zero monadic sum
Lists form operation
The identity element monoid empty list
In fact set list element

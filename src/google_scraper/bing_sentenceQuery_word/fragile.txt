What would happen hundred social scientist data scientist worked together scientific challenge improve life disadvantaged child United States
The ongoing mass research collaboration us big data collected part Princeton University attempting answer
The Fragile Families Child Wellbeing Study based Princeton Columbia University following cohort child born large city turn century
The study gathered information child physical mental health cognitive function skill schooling living condition well makeup stability financial resource family
The challenge launched earlier year asked participant around world use trove data million data point predict six key outcome grade point average academic achievement child grit child material hardship household measure extreme poverty eviction family layoff caregiver whether primary caregiver would participate job skill program
The challenge received application researcher least institution representing least seven country team submitted final prediction challenge
The submission statistical model important outcome life child optimally combined community model used conduct substantive methodological research
The entry already offered expert new way improve survey expand range social science theory
Ultimately goal model provide policymakers information could help spark new theory improve life future generation disadvantaged child
The Fragile Families Challenge left right Matthew Salganik professor sociology Ian Lundberg graduate student sociology Alex Kindel graduate student sociology Sara McLanahan William Tod Professor Sociology Public Affairs principal investigator Fragile Families Child Wellbeing study
It exciting interact people world different intellectual background working problem said professor Princeton Fragile Families Challenge supported grant Russell Sage Foundation
The challenge part Salganik larger research interest computational social science topic also recently published book
Participants challenge included sociologist psychologist economist demographer well computer scientist statistician engineer data scientist industry
It also really rewarding see many participant willing share Salganik said
Many team work challenge going
I love fact able something collaborative normally
This collaborative approach also exciting William Tod Professor Sociology Princeton principal investigator Fragile Familes Child Wellbeing study challenge
When started collecting data almost year ago never imagined kind research said
I think many different people different background working data going help u really care understanding improving life disadvantaged family
In August Fragile Families Challenge team awarded six prize submission outcome well Innovation Awards novel approach using idea social science data science Foundational Prize contribution helped participant
The Foundational Prize Gregory Gundersen graduate student computer science Princeton work building tool make data easier analyze
The winner interested researcher gather Princeton share methodology idea future project may combine predictive modeling causal inference interview
These model potential application published scientific journal individually collectively
The challenge fun way u work together team mix idea social science data science compete people world said Abdullah Almaatouq graduate student Human Dynamics research group MIT Media Lab
Almaatouq team first place three category Fragile Families Challenge
We learned great deal challenge
It allowed u compare modeling idea social science data science term predictive performance
We got chance ass style modeling also find new way combine This predictive modeling beginning according Salganik
The next phase challenge combine machine learning qualitative interview use model help identify learn child beating odds
I particularly excited interview going come Fragile Families Challenge said Ian Lundberg graduate student sociology
He along Alex Kindel also sociology graduate student Fragile Families Challenge
We going interview kid worse expected better expected try learn else affect achievement family experience measure Lundberg said
The challenge also found application classroom brought undergraduate research process
For example assistant professor used Fragile Families Challenge undergraduate machine learning class
The challenge also used class Stanford University Columbia University University Wisconsin Koc Univerisity Turkey
Salganik advises undergraduate Maya Phillips left senior majoring computer science earning certificate technology society focus information technology David Liu center senior computer science major earning certificate statistic machine learning tinker data honing academic interest process
Undergraduates Maya Phillips senior majoring computer science earning focus information technology David Liu senior computer science major earning tinkering data honing academic interest process
The intersection social science data science something really interest I tried focus throughout study said Phillips
The current plan project build API application programming interface programmer use access Fragile Families metadata way beneficial future research using information
The Fragile Families data huge set longitudinal data collection file format machine learning statistical analysis continue done
I knew I wanted thesis focus machine learning said Liu embarked senior thesis
Fragile Families stuck involved machine learning uncertainty
I interested seeing extent machine learning viable tool analyzing social science data
The thing open collaborative sometimes know going happen said Salganik scientific workshop forthcoming research using Fragile Families data
You put something world sometimes world return really cool stuff
Which happened
People really cool really creative thing could never imagined really wonderful

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

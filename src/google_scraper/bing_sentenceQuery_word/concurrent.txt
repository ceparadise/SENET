When looking concurrent programming two term commonly used
concurrent parallel
And programming language specifically claim support parallel programming
Does mean parallel concurrent programming actually different
This question came site theoretical computer scientist researcher related field
Distinguish parallelism using extra computational unit work per unit time concurrency managing access shared resource
Teach parallelism easier help establish sequential mindset
From A Introduction Parallelism Concurrency Dan Grossman version November Conurrency parallelism differ problem solve cause independent
Executing two task mean individual step task executed interleaved fashion
If disregard parallelism assume one statement executed point time priori guarantee task get execute next step
This useful regard Some main challenge Executing two task mean statement executed
This mainly useful Key challenge include See also distinguishing parallel distributed computing
In addition Nish answer let recommend Simon Marlow book
They answer first question Haskell perspective could better suited theoretically inclined reader Haskell purely functional lazy programming language much closer Mathematics language
Quoting In many field word parallel concurrent synonym programming used describe fundamentally different concept
A parallel program one us multiplicity computational hardware
multiple processor core order perform computation quickly
Different part computation delegated different processor execute time parallel result may delivered earlier computation performed sequentially
In contrast concurrency technique multiple thread control
Notionally thread control execute time user see effect interleaved
Whether actually execute time implementation detail concurrent program execute single processor interleaved execution multiple physical processor
I recommend reading rest tutorial let quote remainder section connects programming paradigm quantitative qualitative characteristic program efficiency modularity determinism
While parallel programming concerned efficiency concurrent programming concerned structuring program need interact multiple independent external agent example user database server external client
Concurrency allows program modular thread interacts user distinct thread talk database
In absence concurrency program written event loop callback indeed event loop callback often used even concurrency available many language concurrency either expensive difficult use
The notion thread control make sense purely functional program effect observe evaluation order irrelevant
So concurrency structuring technique effectful code Haskell mean code IO monad
A related distinction deterministic nondeterministic programming model
A deterministic programming model one program give one result whereas nondeterministic programming model admits program may different result depending aspect execution
Concurrent programming model necessarily nondeterministic must interact external agent cause event unpredictable time
Nondeterminism notable drawback however program become signifficantly harder test reason
For parallel programming would like use deterministic programming model possible
Since goal arrive answer quickly would rather make program harder debug process
Deterministic parallel programming best world testing debugging reasoning performed sequential program program run faster processor added
Indeed computer processor implement deterministic parallelism form pipelining multiple execution unit
While possible parallel programming using concurrency often poor choice concurrency sacriffices determinism
In Haskell parallel programming model deterministic
However important note deterministic programming model sufficient express kind parallel algorithm algorithm depend internal nondeterminism particularly problem involve searching solution space
In Haskell class algorithm expressible using concurrency

In operating system happens several process thread running parallel
These thread may communicate either shared memory message passing
Distribution form concurrency communication simultaneous thread done exclusively via message passing
Distribution useful employ lenient scaling resource consumption economizes resource
Whereas shared memory concurrency often requires single processor per thread distribution allows several thread communicate one another
Concurrency also programming design philosophy
In concurrent programming programmer attempt break complex problem several simultaneous executing process addressed individually
Although concurrent programming offer better program structure sequential programming always practical
In concurrent system computation executed time diverge giving indeterminate answer
They system may end deadlock maximum assigned resource consumption executing thread
Thus design robust concurrency operating system programmer need reduce problem individual parallel task coordinate execution memory allocation data exchange task

I often hear phrase like concurrency semantics concurrency equivalence without reference
What term mean important
What example true concurrency equivalence need

case applicable standard equivalence bisimulation trace equivalence etc
The term true concurrency arises theoretical study concurrent parallel computation
It contrast interleaving concurrency
True concurrency concurrency reduced interleaving
Concurrency interleaved step computation one atomic computing action
exchange message sender receiver take place
Concurrency true one atomic action take place step
The simplest way distinguishing look rule parallel composition
In interleaving based setting would look something like P P This rule enforces one process parallel composition execute atomic action
For true concurrency rule like following would appropriate
P Q Q This rule allows participant parallel composition execute atomic action
Why would one interested interleaved concurrency concurrency theory really study system execute computation step parallel
The answer great insight simple form message passing concurrency true concurrency interleaving based concurrency contextually distinguishable
In word interleaved concurrency behaves like true concurrency far observer see
Interleaving good decomposition true concurrency
Since interleaving easier handle proof people often study simpler interleaving based concurrency
CCS
However simplicity disappears concurrent computation richer form observation
timed computation difference true concurrency interleaved concurrency becomes observable
Standard equivalence like bisimulations trace definition true interleaving based concurrency
But may may equate different process depending underlying calculus
Let give informal explanation interleaving truly concurrent interaction indistinguishable simple process calculus
The setting CCS calculus
Say program P x b Then following truly concurrent reduction P b This reduction step matched following interleaved step P x b b The difference former take one step latter two
But simple calculus detect number step used reach process
At time P following second interleaved reduction sequence P b b But also reduction sequence truly concurrent setting long true concurrency forced
interleaved execution allowed even potential one interaction time

The problem caused concurrency even important ability support concurrent transaction
For example one user changing data yet saved committed data database allow user query data view changed unsaved data
Instead user view original data
Almost database deal concurrency way although terminology may differ
The general principle changed unsaved data held sort temporary log file
Once saved written database physical storage place original data
As long user performing change saved data able view data changing
All user querying data view data existed prior change
Once user save data new query reveal new value data

Refine search using tool

form several executed overlapping time one completing next start
This property may individual separate execution point thread control computation process
A one computation advance without waiting computation complete
As concurrent computing form namely overall computation subcomputations may executed concurrently
Pioneers field concurrent computing include
The concept concurrent computing frequently confused related distinct concept although described multiple process executing
In parallel computing execution occurs physical instant example separate machine goal speeding computing impossible single processor one computation occur instant single clock cycle
By contrast concurrent computing consists process overlapping execution need happen instant
The goal model process outside world happen concurrently multiple client accessing server time
Structuring software system composed multiple concurrent communicating part useful tackling complexity regardless whether part executed parallel
For example concurrent process executed one core interleaving execution step process via slice one process run time complete time slice another process begin resume later original process resumed
In way multiple process execution single instant one process executed instant
Concurrent computation executed parallel example assigning process separate processor processor core computation across network
In general however language tool technique parallel programming might suitable concurrent programming vice versa
The exact timing task concurrent system executed depend task need always executed concurrently
For example given two task The word sequential used antonym concurrent parallel explicitly distinguished used opposing pair
A schedule task execute one time serially parallelism without interleaving sequentially concurrency task begin prior task end called
A set task scheduled serially simplifies
The main challenge designing concurrent program ensuring correct sequencing interaction communication different computational execution coordinating access resource shared among execution
Potential problem include
For example consider following algorithm make withdrawal checking account represented shared resource Suppose two concurrent make call
If line operation executes line operation find evaluates execution proceed subtracting withdrawal amount
However since process perform withdrawal total amount withdrawn end original balance
These sort problem shared resource need use
Because concurrent system rely use shared resource including communication medium concurrent computing general need use form somewhere implementation mediate access resource
Unfortunately many solution exist problem conflict one resource many solution concurrency problem one resource involved
Concurrent computing following advantage There several model concurrent computing used understand analyze concurrent system
These model include A number different method used implement concurrent program implementing computational execution implementing computational process set within single operating system process
In concurrent computing system communication concurrent component hidden programmer using others must handled explicitly
Explicit communication divided two class Shared memory message passing concurrency different performance characteristic
Typically although always memory overhead task switching overhead lower message passing system overhead message passing greater procedure call
These difference often overwhelmed performance factor

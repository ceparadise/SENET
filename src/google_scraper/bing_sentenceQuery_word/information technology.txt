IT construct network established building block carry task automated supply ordering service
Due nature work IT professional likely interact client outside department
They may help explain client solve technology problem work executive business owner construct technology plan meet business need
IT student study network database design depth receive introduction basic theory applied mathematics
Successful IT candidate posse strong critical thinking skill IT professional tasked resourcefully applying tool disposal
At every level shop multinational corporation business need IT
Over next decade career opportunity IT expected grow faster average
Depending level education degree IT provide comfortable paycheck
To sum maybe oversimplify bit computer engineer design build computer
Computer scientist design develop computer program software application
IT professional use troubleshoot program software application
These three profession work together make sure hardware software user interface UI come together smoothly computer carry task business individual need
It might help imagine like Computer engineer architect construction worker
They design build house
Computer scientist electrician plumber installation specialist put light running water appliance house
IT professional live house use appliance effectively efficiently desired effect
There overlap within three field
Essentially exist subsection discipline performing complementary different task fit together like gear
Hopefully distinction three professional area clear

If interest computer hardware software sure career path choose probably want learn information technology IT computer science
These two rewarding career require slightly different set skill appeal somewhat different type person
An IT career involves installing organizing maintaining computer system well designing operating network database
Computer science focused entirely efficiently programming computer using mathematical algorithm
An IT career necessarily require computer science CS degree although CS degree open certain door otherwise available
IT professional typically work business environment installing internal network computer system perhaps programming
Computer scientist work wider range environment ranging business university video game design company
Both career excellent growth potential high salary software developer somewhat ahead IT professional earnings
A computer science degree give student rigorous education discrete mathematics computer science theory
Most CS graduate go become software developer Web programmer continue schooling chance research work specialized role advanced artificial intelligence programming
With CS degree student find employment programmer software engineer IT professional
However become software developer graduate usually must teach quite bit programming
A CS education prepares student choose correct design pattern algorithm data structure program student graduate knowing one two programming language usually Python Java
For corporate programming job alone may suffice professional software developer know several language including HTML CSS JavaScript MySQL PHP Python Java
Software developer job projected grow well average
In median annual salary developer percent making least
With IT degree graduate find work number occupation including information security network architecture database administration system administration computer support
However job require advanced computer science programming knowledge graduate must enroll specialized program take elective course
For example information security requires knowledge discrete math algorithm database administration requires knowledge programming
Also information security analyst usually certification ISC CISSP
In general IT professional need stay abreast new technology must familiar use operating system server software including Linux Apache OpenSSL Windows Server Oracle MySQL Microsoft SQL Server
percent next ten year salary ranging depending experience level education
While IT CS degree lead similar job difference two quite pronounced
IT professional enjoy installing computer system using software maintaining network database computer scientist enjoy mathematics software design
In general relationship information technology quite close interdependent

These day almost TOO many choice degree
Which degree choose
What difference Computer Information Systems v Computer Science major
IS really difference
If one best career path
If trouble choosing IT degree path start asking following three career question interest The question find drawn clue type online degree prefer come Computer Information Systems v Computer Science
Many online IT degree offered today related Computer Science Information Technology Computer Information Systems
Each major share much common also tends focus answering slightly different question
These approach translate turn different career path
Computer Science focus teaching programming computing
It meant give professional foundational skill applied towards career coding
It also provides overview computer operating system work
Computer Science primarily sharpening programming ability
You learn write code lesson plan many online IT degree also learn code work computer way
A Computer Science major often focus programming underlying algorithm make code work
As fair amount math involved ex
Calculus Discrete Mathematics etc
This degree major especially math heavy undergraduate level
Some see math plus many
Also due programming focus subject may interest ex
security networking etc
often touched upon lightly pure Computer Science degree program

Despite name significant amount computer science involve study computer
Because several alternative name proposed
Certain department major university prefer term emphasize precisely difference
Danish scientist suggested term reflect fact scientific discipline revolves around data data treatment necessarily involving computer
The first scientific institution use term Department Datalogy University Copenhagen founded Peter Naur first professor datalogy
The term used mainly Scandinavian country
An alternative term also proposed Naur used distinct field data analysis including statistic database
Also early day computing number term practitioner field computing suggested
Three month later journal suggested followed next year
The term also suggested
In Europe term derived contracted translation expression automatic information

In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science

Student learning depth student knowledge increase active learning method employed classroom
Active learning strategy discussed general computer science course work used theory computation course
Difficulties active learning technique dealing also presented
Active learning get student involved activity classroom rather passively listening lecture
This activity reading writing discussing solving problem responding question require factual answer
The idea get student thinking material
This important student passive decline concentration minute minute lecture act learning passive
As faculty learn actively
In preparing lecture note read compare read experience synthesize information coherent note develop example illustrate concept
This lead greater understanding material
Unfortunately use understanding lecture student depriving journey discovery
By carefully involving student path knowledge increase student depth understanding material increase student comfort material improve student confidence
In science value active learning already realized implemented laboratory computer science programming project
The idea present expand include activity classroom replace part lecture
If active learning successful used frequently
This perception active learning higher risk
There fear content taken put active learning preparation time higher active learning appropriate large class
Perhaps largest fear giving control classroom lecture let professor decide say student centered activity may raise question professor planning discus
These fear real surmountable
To cover content give student responsibility learning factual material apply classroom discussion
I student write course evaluation need read book class lecture would tell needed know chapter
If student believe hear lecture similar text material willing read text
For faculty class note year year developing active learning strategy take time pulling note filing cabinet
In field rapidly changing computer science note need done frequently enough great concern
Further develop idea active learning find applied across number different course
Active learning strategy allow control level risk
By selecting short highly structured activity level risk fairly low
Involving student asking series question current topic allows teacher control direction content discussion still make student active
Breaking student small group letting independently solve problem much higher risk prove highly rewarding
As mentioned strategy active learning equally valid many computer science course
This section describe generic technique active learning computer science
The next section show application technique theory computation course
As mentioned student attention begin decline minute lecture
Further lecture something catch attention causing u miss part next point
A strategy handle lecture minute take minute break
During break student discus note person next filling gap correcting misunderstanding
Alternatively activity lead discussion would pose question employ technique
In technique question posed student individually write answer within one two minute time limit
Each student pair person next discus answer possibly developing new one
The instructor start discussion next lecture topic asking pair share answer class
In computer science class could pose question like What happen I change input
What could happen I include conditional check
Why important reduce number operation sorting algorithm
Why four condition necessary deadlock occur If professor computer classroom question relate structure algorithm behavior answer tested real time
Even better student computer hand group get together try solution
In later case instructor must careful student think answer first activity degrade hacking session
Instead tracing execution algorithm lecture break student group trace algorithm
For example compare sorting algorithm break class group four student
Assign one student algorithm tracer one keep track variable value another record number performed last record change list
By providing team transparency marker team easily display answer rest class
By running implementation algorithm group result quickly compared actual answer In classroom projection unit connected computer system running demonstration software professor powerful tool student interact idea computer science
By dividing student group ask predict happen output based change input set also allows student formulate question trying understand idea
For example student trying understand nature recursive algorithm see effect input large amount software type developed number area computer science
This readily available internet
Role playing powerful tool computer science classroom
To student understand network protocol could class passing ball around discussion letting student talk ball
Students experience first hand operation Token Passing Protocols
Similar activity could used simulate flow information circuit student chip passing information back forth execution parallel algorithm group different part simultaneously recently used activity type illustrate concept object class introductory programming class
In class I used paper bag represent object private data inside bag
Students class given code fragment representing class method well main program used class
We executed code constructor function getting new bag object create bag object moving around room opened class method
This clearly illustrated student action class method relationship method private data
I teaching theory computation number year upper undergraduate level sophomore year
Our student taken theory computation first semester sophomore year completed one semester computer science overview course
They take hour C programming course concurrently theory computation
The purpose theory course introduce student finite state machine regular expression grammar Turing Machines limit computing
At sophomore level course practically oriented proof past three offering course I used three different teaching style
For Fall course taught typical lecture style presentation
Students regular homework assignment took three semester exam final Fall course different look
Students assigned group three static entire semester
For information using group work see
Class time broken two minute followed minute group problem solving exercise classroom
One group would present solution class
There regular homework assignment done group
These exercise homework taken directly problem text
Students still took three semester exam individually group also reworked exam weekend turned group solution
So student took exam twice alone Fall course became combination two previous offering
Because fear group working effectively enough learn material classroom became closer lecture hall
I keep active learning asking question lead student solving problem
However student longer group exercise classroom though continued work homework exam group outside class
When I decided implement active learning class I wanted way checking see benefit student
The active learning literature example said would positive effect I wanted test
There numerous study large student population show positive influence student grade active learning employed
Even though class small I wanted test see I would find similar I distribute copy final exam since cumulative entire semester I thought could mechanism test student done various technique
So three semester mentioned I used exact final exam
I also collected information grade point average GPA college level course work student completed starting course
There student transferred institution institution
They excluded study reliable grade point average information avoid difference grading scheme likely exam graded three year period exam duplicated regraded
Exams three class mixed together regrading help eliminate unconscious biasing result
Further I developed five point scale question used take difference point level different question
The general meaning point value given table
After excluding transfer student established GPA sample student involved study small Fall Fall Fall
The result ANOVA single factor analysis class GPA class exam score showed significant difference GPAs student three class significant difference exam score table
Students class Fall many Fall active learning technique used performed better final exam
In order ass strength effect variable correlation matrix calculated
Since exam score second year higher third class renumbered correlation variable Fall Fall Fall
The correlation GPA final exam score p
The correlation GPA class indicates independence GPA class assignment
The correlation class exam score p
Thus correlation class exam score confounded assignment student different GPAs different summary student sample three offering course significantly differ ability base entering GPA
This important expected result show student higher GPAs perform better exam
Since class similar GPA distribution difference student ability could skewed result
The important point however student course active learning better
Further addition significant group activity classroom Fall Fall seemed help much le noticeable amount
Based experience I appreciate need balance instructor presentation student activity
It seems lecture necessary discus thing instructor view critical difficult understand
It also important however activity get student active active learning technique risky faculty risk minimized choosing short well structured activity
As comfort level active learning increase riskier strategy tried
Though loss control scary first I found invigorated look forward challenge active reality today higher education United States student seem interested learning
By employing active learning strategy student learn content process well
This make better student later course better professional finishing degree
I would like thank Frank Dinan support effort active learning
I would also like thank Fred Dansereau help statistical analysis result

Still question
Ask


How teach kid programming computer science much learning code
Most people quit
Here idea link help answer question
In past year I published magazine first year common question people asked Where I child begin learn code Or How I teach kid programming computer science My answer variation It It depends whether child adult parent teacher
It also depends learning code answer
Learning comfortable technology learning technology work learning technology help hurt u individually society answer question Where I begin learn code Writing publishing magazine taught vast majority people start coding quit
They get bored
Or coding hard
Or coding really fit thing
For example coding requires lot problem solving skill turn requires balance rigid step step process intuition based experience
Not everybody like combination
From start magazine published article based guideline developed Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA If learn lot topic give coding never learn code understand technology work technology appropriate
If learn code terrific
However learning code helpful required technology literate
With prologue specific answer question Where I begin learn code If kid year old especially younger sibling might want start game toy teach programming concept
For example Robot Turtles great board game neat extension like online community create game board
These game sometimes let replace object direct game person like child parent adding another level fun engagement
In style Move Turtle phone application let kid basic programming
Kids adult give direction move turtle make turtle thing
Each step corresponds programming activity specify action detail action example move action forward way screen detail action
There also robot like KIBO robot developed Tufts University geared kid age
KIBO Kickstarter looking mass market technology
Kids almost age also might appreciate Computer Science Unplugged computational thinking project
Like board game project teach computer science programming concept without computer
If kid comfortable game like Robot Turtles CS Unplugged activity might try next project coding aspect
Robots like Sphero make easy direct cute little robot ball around room graduate programming robot
Computational thinking project also project basic programming Python useful advanced project
From simple use coding kid also gravitate programming language geared towards kid education language like Python
For example least one ebook online teach basic Python kid
They learn small bit language importantly learn programming concept
Languages geared towards kid tend use Logo language kid enter basic direction avatar often turtle follows direction screen use block language like Scratch Alice Tynker several others
These language make easy kid focus language le specific syntax
In contrast adult use programming language syntax structure critical bit code slightly le important
When kid might start beginning board game programmable robot language geared towards education
But also might dive language like PHP Python JavaScript part reading online finding neat project trying replicate project computer
They also might love game learn modify game get coding
I used web browser View Source menu example learn HTML CSS JavaScript million people year ago
Technology everywhere number way older kid latch learn
While parent might mixed feeling kid lost hour video game game lead programming
Minecraft put Raspberry Pi computer designed help kid get hardware software project
Skyrim game make somewhat easy older kid research code modification make game even fun
I also highly recommend find local programming group like Coder Dojo kid adult work together computing project
It structured way relax fun technology engaging people
Technology social activity strictly solo
You also learn sharing debating
And I would encourage parent kid look online resource geared towards teacher teach computer science programming
Often resource like Minecraft Education parent use get kid started kid explore
Bottomline though true subject important start kid adult place find comfortable provide tool explore find way
Programming computer science fascinating absorbing
But discover
A teacher parent ca force enthralled concept making computer something
What I found interesting publishing magazine many teacher want learn programming computer science much student
There lot energy fun ingenuity going teaching computer science coding classroom
Even better fad
Teachers get connection math taught kid generation example math used computing
Teachers also get need guideline online behavior another critical skill want technology literate
What applies kid adult also applies teacher many option learn computer programming computer science
It important holistic focus strictly learning skill
It important kid well rounded view technology love gadget healthy respect work might might fit society
While teacher might enjoy board game Robot Turtles might work great kindergarten first grade classroom Computer Science Unplugged project project geared towards time constraint classroom well laser focus one topic project
If student graduate programming tool like Scratch Alice Tynker Codea Minecraft like great kid project within single class period period time
There many resource online help distill programming language education project kid handle easily
Finally Skype classroom great example technology teacher kid use connect teacher classroom
You learn programming necessarily
But teacher student expand horizon learn lot world engage people would never meet otherwise
As I noted start biggest lesson learned first year publishing magazine coding answer
The answer exposure technology computer science programming
Most people never code
Yet learn enough programming realize phone tablet computer device magical
They tool created human being like
And tool limitation benefit
Tools extremely fun use
It also true group charged creating programming computer science curriculum treat programming one aspect curriculum
While lot hype outside classroom everyone must learn code people charged creating curriculum student take holistic broader view
I want thank reader subscriber great first year publishing magazine
I started Help Kids Code way explore computer science coding meet write people really neat stuff
It fun ride

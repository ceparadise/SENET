Computer science sometimes referred name suggests scientific practical theoretical approach computation using computer
Computer scientist professional involved computer science
mathematician engineer etc
use unique understanding computer computation process design computational system theoretical application
Computer scientist problem solver
They employ advanced modeling use computer analyze problem design solution
Computer science requires ability think logically good computer scientist also creative
Within discipline computer science several practical theoretical nature
Computer science discipline specialty abstract
computational complexity theory practical
computer graphic combination two
programming language theory
The practical application computer science seen every facet today computer driven world
Some important discipline within computer science include software engineering application development artificial intelligence computer networking interaction computer graphic computer architecture operating system numerica symbolic computation database system computational science
Computer science one discipline includes experimental method engineering design theoretical study
This different field science tend separate understanding science application engineering setting
In computer science theoretical concept computation intermingled modern practical advancement electronics engineering technology turn help advance discipline
The discipline computer science cover large array topic theoretical study limit computation algorithm practical application development implementation computer software driven computing system
There however four area according CSAB integral study understanding advancement computer science
Within discipline computer science two general category Theoretical Computer Science Applied Computer Science
The following break different specialty within area focus
The approach taken teach computer science vary dramatically one institution next
Some college university approach computer science theoretical study algorithmic reasoning computation
Schools employ theory based education approach often focus area study analysis algorithm concurrency theory theory computation formal method system analysis database name
While school often teach computer programming typically central focus taught enough depth student gain level competency required software development programming career many technology field
Many college university vocational school take different approach teaching computer science
While theory important aspect program curriculum emphasis placed teaching computer science advanced programming apply setting
These program designed help student develop practical applicable skill need enter work force particularly software industry software engineer
While many academia may disagree strong consensus among professional industry education program emphasize applied computer science provide student valuable education focus primarily theory
While computer science becoming driving force economy many school include computer science class part core curriculum
However slowly changing
Fourteen state include computer science core academic curriculum set computer science competency standard must met graduation
Many college traditionally offered computer science specific major include computer science class part undergraduate core curriculum
See nation
If trying figure degree computer science get started important first understand difference associate degree bachelor degree computer science
While degree undergraduate degree prepare career position different coursework graduate requirement
An associate degree bachelor degree computer science also vary dramatically near career option salary possibility provide
One key difference associate degree bachelor degree computer science time required complete degree program
On average associate degree computer science completed two year take four year complete bachelor degree
But additional two year required complete bachelor degree nothing
A bachelor degree computer science provides student much comprehensive education
Probably one important difference associate bachelor degree computer science especially recent graduate type job salary level provide
It probably go without saying earning bachelor degree computer science qualifies student better position associate degree
An associate degree computer science typically requires student complete semester hour bachelor degree computer science usually requires semester hour
Both associate bachelor degree similar general education requirement bachelor degree substantially major course requirement provide study computer science associate degree
The Bachelor Computer Science typically take four year complete today several accelerated program student earn degree three year
While student option earning associate degree computer science Bachelor Computer Science degree choice among employer recruiter looking fill coveted information technology position
The Bachelor Computer Science bachelor computer science degree offered college university
There several bachelor degree computer science program core curriculum Bachelor Computer Science
Other comparable degree include Following trend established field study many university offer degree awarded student exhibit superior academic performance complete additional year study
Not bachelor degree program
Truth known uncommon curriculum coursework vary one school degree
Students carefully review consider computer science program make sure help meet educational career goal
Some common topic addressed bachelor degree computer science program include Algorithms Programming Paradigms Data Structures Information Retrieval Programming Principles Computer Architecture Logic Computation
More course usually associated specialized discipline computer science include interaction information theory data communication theory computation numerical computation operating system compiler computer graphic game design information assurance distributed system artificial intelligence among others
If want take career next level may considered earning Master Science Computer Science MSCS
The MSCS similar Bachelor Computer Science BCS provides study computer science
The MSCS take depth study one step BCS
Next physician assistant study degree master degree computer science best master degree earn according magazine
Salaries college graduate MSCS well year job opportunity advanced computer science degree holder always plentiful
Between employment opportunity computer holder expected increase best position expected filled CS professional advanced degree
However keep mind many successful professional programmer work technology field computer science career never earned formal degree computer science
At end day success determined degree
A degree help land good job
Where go determined skill ability bring table
The Doctor Computer Science abbrevidated DCompSci
applied research doctorate degree offered select university throughout United States
This degree usually requires substantial amount work research go well beyond master level

A reporter recently asked advice I kid coming high school
I said Go computer science probably always job
I wonder I said Skip college spend time teaching computer
Especially America education incurs tremendous debt educational institution teach little really matter ask Ca I
I computer science degree though I worked company founded firm
I literally grown field
I started programming BASIC I year old learned create software dBase I
I even grabbed big book compiler theory kind nonsense I know everything I needed
If I picked degree I would missed entire boom graduated ensuing recession experience carrying load debt
Instead I stayed gainfully employed month two bust joined successful startup economy picked
But teaching code sound advice given today grinding economy
If believe headhunter national unemployment rate technology sector percent
If recall percent unemployment supposedly full employment everyone want job one
Moreover u industry believe supply talented programmer forever constrained
A recruiter recently asked employer picky
I explained people earned computer science degree know theory ca code
Instead succeed putting thing resume match keywords
Plus company consider responsibility provide training mentoring
In fairness scarcity talent created mercenary culture Now employer paid learn new skill let check see ad Dice Craigslist higher rate pay

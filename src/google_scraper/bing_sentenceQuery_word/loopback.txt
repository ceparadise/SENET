What
Why exist used would I use
The special computer us communicate
It used mainly diagnostics troubleshooting connect server running local machine
When network interface disconnected example port unplugged turned associated communication interface possible even communication computer
The loopback interface represent actual hardware exists application running computer always connect server machine
This important troubleshooting compared looking mirror
The loopback device sometimes explained purely diagnostic tool
But also helpful server offering resource need
For example run web server web document could examine file file
You may able load file browser though active content wo work way someone access normally
So want experience site others best course usually connect server
The loopback interface facilitates
For loopback interface assigned
That represent computer
For purpose though necessary use one IP address
This IP mapped
Thus log via SSH server running machine would use Like network adapter loopback device show output
Its name
One common production diagnostic use Ubuntu perform advanced printer configuration
In web browser go run web server port used configure printing regardless GUI running even running GUI
If try connecting work
However try connect
All address identify computer loopback interface server program decide bind specific IP address
If come Windows background might expect synonym thus able ping connect server forth
That behavior peculiar Windows
The general concept mechanism message signal end loop back started
So way use Ubuntu confused loopback device networking
To mount disk image Ubuntu could run This usually called term occasionally used
This nothing loopback device networking
Pulseaudio sound system provide mechanism connect audio input echoed back
Pulseaudio facilitates
Here correct use term like loop mount also nothing loopback device networking
And nothing loop mount either

I really know whether correct site post question I sorry I mistaken
I studying computer network explanation ip protocol professor described reserved address etc
Of course one address told u subnet
behaves correct loopback address
My question reason many available loopback address
Is historical reason
It look like waste possible byte address
Why

What address
address even mean
Please descriptive give example I understanding
The put better I could The term sometimes spelled generally used describe method procedure routing electronic signal digital data stream flow item originating facility quickly back source entity without intentional processing modification
This primarily intended mean testing transmission transportation infrastructure
In term IP address mean communication address effectively never leave perhaps never actually enter network interface card always connection
This allows test software example part running machine
A loopback address connected virtual network card machine called loopback adapter
Anything sent virtual loopback adapter come right back
It like connected
For example I make web request typing browser request go virtual loopback adapter right back
So web server running system listening receive request browser also able communicate browser sending response back
This excellent testing purpose see
Nothing going loopback adapter go Internet leaf system
The loopback adapter completely contained within system
It simply mean local address
When test NIC done via ping
When testing make sure information go layer back
If suspect NIC working physical level make good test
It also used specify application want information leave host computer
This seen model application installed local computer want information accessible remotely
You specify server software transfer information via loopback address client software could listen loop back address
This would provide information local application disabling ability somebody else LAN access whatever server software set local
I know I explained well best I could
The good information

So I got task I setup virtual network OSPF routing protocol
I firstly ignored loopback interface I configure router since difference virtualization software called Cisco Packet Tracer I thought
Then I built network real life Cisco router anything either
With without loopback network worked pinging one host another
Now question Why loopback interface needed function
In picture network I build help
The loopback interface useful interface IP address never go
OSPF without specifically defined Router ID pick Router ID
It chooses Router ID IP address configured enabled interface
A loopback good choice since loopback interface always unless someone specifically shuts
Other interface may go problem link
First loopbacks interface mainly used want entablish adyacencies equipment sure one link fails adyacency going Loopbacks interface logical interface reach different way
Another used announce network
Networks anounnced even existed routing table
I guess upper example comment loopbacks interface one used done announce network see OSPF work even use loopbacks interface configuration must work fine

I want know exactly till layer OSI model loopback packet go till returned upper layer
I read go till data link layer
told data link layer see ip address data link layer decide packet send instead
When say layer probably thinking also known model
However real implementation actually fit OSI model well
The OSI model designed standard committee year ago based committee member thought network stack designed Internet without advantage experience today
IP address loopback functionality associated IP protocol
The IP protocol thought closely associated network layer OSI model
So could say answer network layer
But important realize bit lie
In real operating system necessarily clean separation TCP stack IP stack two closely hooked together
So make sense ask code loopback processing layer
The code loopback processing could plausibly considered part stack stack combine element network layer transport layer session layer
Loopback processing might also performed separate device driver operating system perspective look like another device like another Ethernet card different one could even make argument code really part data link layer physical layer
See OSI model really adding much insight
The code code trying attach label based one seven layer human construct one case good match reality
It probably better think OSI model plausible vocabulary talking network le helpful talking structure networking structure code necessarily correlate well seven layer OSI model
TL DR
Simple answer The address IP layer concept handed IP layer correct routing
More complex answer The address might common enough practical use upper layer stack particular operating system cut corner handle specially
Even application might figure supposed talk never touch stack
No totally misguided finally dead buried OSI protocol stack relevance

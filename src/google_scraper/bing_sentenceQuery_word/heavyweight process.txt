In computing executed
It contains program code current activity
Depending OS process may made multiple execute instruction
A computer program passive collection process actual execution instruction
Several process may associated program example opening several instance program often mean one process executed
method allow multiple process share CPUs system resource
Each CPU core executes single time
However multitasking allows processor task executed without wait task finish
Depending operating system implementation switch could performed task perform operation task indicates switched hardware
A common form multitasking
method allow fast response interactive user application
In system performed rapidly make seem like multiple process executed simultaneously processor
This seeming execution multiple process simultaneously called
For security reliability modern prevent direct independent process providing strictly mediated controlled communication functionality
In general computer system process consists said following resource The operating system hold information active process data structure called
Any subset resource typically least processor state may associated process operating system support thread process
The operating system keep process separate allocates resource need le likely interfere cause system failure
The operating system may also provide mechanism enable process interact safe predictable way
A may switch process give appearance many process simultaneously though fact one process executing one time single unless CPU multiple core similar technology used
It usual associate single process main program child process parallel process behave like subroutine
A process said resource program memory one resource
However multiprocessing system process may run share program location memory process said program
Processes often called task operating system
The sense process task something take time opposed memory something take space
The description applies process managed operating system process defined
If process request something must wait blocked
When process eligible swapping disk transparent system region process memory may really disk time
Note even unused portion active executing program eligible swapping disk
All part executing program data physical memory associated process active
An operating system allows multitasking need process
Names state standardised similar functionality
When process communicate called communication IPC
Processes frequently need communicate instance shell pipeline output first process need pas second one process
It preferred way using interrupt
It even possible two process running different machine
The operating system OS may differ one process therefore mediator called needed
By early computer control software evolved example
Over time computer got faster still neither cheap fully utilized environment made possible necessary
Multiprogramming mean several program run
At first one program ran single processor result underlying computer architecture shared scarce limited hardware resource consequently concurrency nature
On later system multiple program may run concurrently
Programs consist sequence instruction processor
A single processor run one instruction time impossible run program time
A program might need input device large delay program might start slow operation sending output printer
This would lead processor idle unused
To keep processor busy time execution program halted operating system switch processor run another program
To user appear program run time hence term parallel
Shortly thereafter notion program expanded notion executing program context
The concept process born also became necessary invention
came somewhat later
However advent concept computer old multiprogramming gave way true multiprocessing later

Is following assertion true question
Lightweight process contain single process multiple thread Heavyweight process contain multiple subprocesses I know much I wondering would pas basic understanding heavyweight lightweight process A normal process Operating System OS process
For process OS provides independent address space way keeping different user service separated
Switching one process another time consuming though modern machine contain special unit Memory Management Unit MMU dedicated task
A Process LWP also called thread run address space normal process LWPs process may share
variable
Switching one LWP another much faster switching one process another le manage MMU involved
Actually I think way around
say In computer operating system process LWP mean achieving multitasking
In traditional meaning term used Unix System V Solaris LWP run user space top single kernel thread share address space system resource LWPs within process
Multiple user level thread managed thread library placed top one many LWPs allowing multitasking done user level performance benefit
So LWPs share address space within process
In word LWP
LWP thread Lightweight process denomination thread still used Solaris utility across variant

Linux
multithrading java process execute multiple thread Thread basically lightweight process smallest unit multiprocessing used achieve use multithrading multiprocessing thread share common memory area seprate memory indivisual Lightweight process contain single process multiple thread Heavyweight process contain multiple subprocesses It block user thread independent perform multiple operation time

A process two thread execution running single processor In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within process share resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share instruction executable code context value variable given moment
On single processor multithreading generally implemented CPU switch different
This generally happens frequently enough user perceives thread task running time
On system thread executed true concurrent manner every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously
To implement multiprocessing operating system may use exist method better utilization particular CPU different software thread pure software construct representation
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading
The allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Programs threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort
Threads differ traditional Systems said cheap thread expensive process operating system great difference except cost switch implies TLB flush
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context single process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied single process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread one two way Threads called made early appearance Multiprogramming Variable Number Tasks MVT
Until late CPUs desktop computer much support multithreading although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
In late idea executing instruction multiple thread simultaneously known reached desktop processor name
It dropped architecture later architecture CPUs
Although thread seem small step sequential computation fact represent huge step
They discard essential appealing property sequential computation understandability predictability determinism
Threads model computation wildly job programmer becomes one pruning nondeterminism
Edward Lee UC Berkeley A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way
Processes typically preemptively multitasked
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly yield allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel user thread
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate
To prevent threading APIs offer data structure concurrent access
On uniprocessor system thread running locked mutex must sleep hence trigger context switch
On system thread may instead poll mutex
Both may sap performance force processor system contend memory bus especially locking fine
User thread fiber implementation typically entirely
As result context switching user thread fiber within process extremely efficient require interaction kernel context switch performed locally saving CPU register used currently executing user thread fiber loading register required user thread fiber executed
Since scheduling occurs userspace scheduling policy easily tailored requirement program workload
However use blocking system call user thread opposed kernel thread fiber problematic
If user thread fiber performs system call block user thread fiber process unable run system call return
A typical example problem performing program written perform synchronously
When operation initiated system call made return operation completed
In intervening period entire process blocked kernel run starves user thread fiber process executing
A common solution problem providing API implement synchronous interface using internally scheduling another user thread fiber operation progress
Similar solution provided blocking system call
Alternatively program written avoid use synchronous blocking system call
implemented LWPs
implement LWPs kernel thread model
SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model
SunOS later well NetBSD eliminated user thread support returning model
FreeBSD implemented M N model
FreeBSD supported M N user could choose one used given program using
Starting FreeBSD became default
FreeBSD longer support M N model
The use kernel thread simplifies user code moving complex aspect threading kernel
The program need schedule thread explicitly yield processor
User code written familiar procedural style including call blocking APIs without starving thread
However kernel threading may force context switch thread time thus expose race hazard concurrency bug would otherwise lie latent
On SMP system exacerbated kernel thread may literally execute separate processor parallel
Threads created user correspondence schedulable entity kernel simplest possible threading implementation
used approach start implement approach via older
This approach also used
An model implies thread map single scheduled entity kernel knowledge application thread
With approach context switching done quickly addition implemented even simple kernel support threading
One major drawback however benefit hardware acceleration processor computer never one thread scheduled time
For example If one thread need execute request whole process blocked threading advantage utilized
The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation C provide support threading also provide access native threading APIs provided operating system
Some higher level usually cross platform programming language Java Python expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
A number programming language also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer altogether
Some language designed parallelism
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby implementation Python support threading limitation known GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter concurrently interpreting application code two thread time effectively limit concurrency multiple core system mostly thread much one
Other interpreted programming language Tcl using Thread extension avoid GIL limitation using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation set library call
OS vendor free implement interface wish application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most UNIX platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage certain number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed parallel computation array thread run code parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel utilize GPU architecture

What technical difference process thread
I get feeling word like overused also hardware software thread
How process language like
Is definitive reason use one term
Both process thread independent sequence execution
The typical difference thread process run shared memory space process run separate memory space
I sure hardware v software thread might referring
Threads operating environment feature rather CPU feature though CPU typically operation make thread efficient
Erlang us term process expose multiprogramming model
Calling thread would imply shared memory
Each process provides resource needed execute program
A process virtual address space executable code open handle system object security context unique process identifier environment variable priority class minimum maximum working set size least one thread execution
Each process started single thread often called primary thread create additional thread thread
A thread entity within process scheduled execution
All thread process share virtual address space system resource
In addition thread maintains exception handler scheduling priority thread local storage unique thread identifier set structure system use save thread context scheduled
The thread context includes thread set machine register kernel stack thread environment block user stack address space thread process
Threads also security context used impersonating client
Found MSDN Microsoft Windows support preemptive multitasking creates effect simultaneous execution multiple thread multiple process
On multiprocessor computer system simultaneously execute many thread processor computer
I borrowed info
First let look theoretical aspect
You need understand process conceptually understand difference process thread shared
We following section Tanenbaum The process model based two independent concept resource grouping execution
Sometimes separate thread come
He continues One way looking process way group related resource together
A process address space containing program text data well resource
These resource may include open file child process pending alarm signal handler accounting information
By putting together form process managed easily
The concept process thread execution usually shortened thread
The thread program counter keep track execute next
It register hold current working variable
It stack contains execution history one frame called yet returned
Although thread must execute process thread process different concept treated
Processes used group resource together thread entity scheduled execution CPU
Further provides following table Let deal issue
Classically CPU would support single thread execution maintaining thread state via single program counter set register
But happens cache miss
It take long time fetch data main memory happening CPU sitting idle
So someone idea basically two set thread state PC register another thread maybe process maybe different process get work done thread waiting main memory
There multiple name implementation concept HyperThreading SMT short
Now let look software side
There basically three way thread implemented software side
All need implement thread ability save CPU state maintain multiple stack many case done user space
The advantage user space thread super fast thread switching since trap kernel ability schedule thread way like
The biggest drawback inability blocking would block entire process user thread one big reason use thread first place
Blocking using thread greatly simplifies program design many case
Kernel thread advantage able use blocking addition leaving scheduling issue OS
But thread switch requires trapping kernel potentially relatively slow
However switching thread blocked really issue since operation probably trapped kernel already anyway
Another approach combine two multiple kernel thread multiple user thread
So getting back question terminology see process thread execution two different concept choice term use depends talking
Regarding term light weight process I personally see point since really convey going well term thread execution
An application consists one process
A process simplest term executing program
One thread run context process
A thread basic unit operating system allocates processor time
A thread execute part process code including part currently executed another thread
A fiber unit execution must manually scheduled application
Fibers run context thread schedule
Stolen
To explain respect concurrent programming A process execution environment
A process generally complete private set basic resource particular process memory space
Threads exist within process every process least one
Threads share process resource including memory open file
This make efficient potentially problematic communication
Keeping average person mind On computer open Microsoft Word web browser
We call two
In Microsoft word type thing get automatically saved
Now would observed editing saving happens parallel
This called thread
A process collection code memory data resource
A thread sequence code executed within scope process
You usually multiple thread executing concurrently within process
A process executing instance application
What mean
Well example Microsoft Word icon start process run Word
A thread path execution within process
Also process contain multiple thread
When start Word operating system creates process begin executing primary thread process
important note thread anything process
But since process consist multiple thread thread could considered process
Thus essential difference thread process work one used accomplish
Threads used small task whereas process used task basically execution application
Another difference thread process thread within process share address space whereas different process
This allows thread read write data structure variable also facilitates communication thread
Communication process also known IPC communication quite difficult
Both process thread independent sequence execution
The typical difference thread process run shared memory space process run separate memory space
Process Is program execution
text section program code current activity represented value program counter content processor register
It also includes process stack contains temporary data function parameter return addressed local variable data section contains global variable
A process may also include heap memory dynamically allocated process run time
Thread A thread basic unit CPU utilisation comprises thread ID program counter register set stack
shared thread belonging process code section data section operating system resource open file signal
Taken Operating System Galvin Trying answer question relating Java world
A process execution program thread single execution sequence within process
A process contain multiple thread
A thread sometimes called
For example Example A JVM run single process thread JVM share heap belonging process
That several thread may access object
Threads share heap stack space
This one invocation method local variable kept thread safe thread
But heap must synchronized thread safety
Example A program might able draw picture reading keystroke
The program must give full attention keyboard input lacking ability handle one event time lead trouble
The ideal solution problem seamless execution two section program time
Threads allows u
Here Drawing picture process reading keystroke sub process thread
Both thread process atomic unit OS resource allocation
concurrency model describing CPU time divided model owning OS resource
There difference Greg Hewgill correct Erlang meaning word process discussion Erlang could process lightweight
A process executing instance application A thread path execution within process
Also process contain multiple important note thread anything process
But since process consist multiple thread thread could considered process
Thus essential difference thread process work one used accomplish
Threads used small task whereas process used task basically execution application
Another difference thread process thread within process share address space whereas different process
This allows thread read write data structure variable also facilitates communication thread
Communication process also known IPC communication quite difficult
summary difference thread process Threads easier create process since require separate address space
Multithreading requires careful programming since thread share data strucures modified one thread time
Unlike thread process share address space
Threads considered lightweight use far le resource process
Processes independent
Threads since share address space interdependent caution must taken different thread step
This really another way stating
A process consist multiple thread
thanks From point view interviewer basically main thing I want hear besides obvious thing like process multiple thread If want Scott Langham response pretty much cover everything
All perspective operating system
Different language implement different concept like task thread way using thread fiber Windows
There hardware software thread
There hardware software kernel
Example Say opening browser mozilla Chrome IE
At point new process start execute
Example Opening multiple tab browser
The following I got one article
I guess explains everything needed clearly
A thread another mechanism splitting workload separate execution stream
A thread lighter weight process
This mean offer le flexibility full blown process initiated faster le Operating System set
When program consists two thread thread share single memory space
Processes given separate address space
thread share single heap
But thread given stack
Trying answer Linux Kernel OS View A program becomes process launched memory
A process address space meaning various segment memory segement storing compiled code storing uninitialized static global variable etc
Each process would program counter
Inside kernel process would kernel stack separated user space stack security issue structure named generally abstracted process control block storing information regarding process priority state whole lot chunk
A process multiple thread execution
Coming thread reside inside process share address space parent process along resource passed thread creation filesystem resource sharing pending signal sharing data variable instruction therefore making thread lightweight hence allowing faster context switching
Inside kernel thread kernel stack along structure defines thread
Therefore kernel view thread process different entity schedulable
Threads process share common id called thread group id also unique id called process id
While building algorithm Python interpreted language incorporated I surprised see execution time better compared sequential algorithm I previously built
In effort understand reason result I reading believe I learned offer interesting context better understand difference
system may exercise multiple thread execution Python support
But Python compiled language instead interpreted language
This mean program must interpreted order run interpreter aware program begin execution
What know however rule Python dynamically applies rule
Optimizations Python must principally optimization interpreter code run
This contrast compiled language consequence Python
Specifically Python us Global Interpreter Lock manage
On hand compiled language well compiled
The program processed entirely first interpreted according syntactical definition mapped language agnostic intermediate representation finally linked executable code
This process allows code highly optimized available time compilation
The various program interaction relationship defined time executable created robust decision optimization made
In modern environment Python interpreter must permit must safe efficient
This difference interpreted language versus compiled language enters picture
The interpreter must disturb internally shared data different thread time optimizing use processor computation
As noted previous post process thread independent sequential execution primary difference memory shared across multiple thread process process isolate memory space
In Python data protected simultaneous access different thread Global Interpreter Lock
It requires Python program one thread executed time
On hand possible run multiple process since memory process isolated process process run multiple core
Donald Knuth good explanation interpretive routine The Art Computer Programming Fundamental Algorithms
Coming embedded world I would like add concept process exists big processor MMU memory management unit operating system support using MMUs
With processor microcontrollers small RTOS operating system freeRTOS MMU support thus process thread
access others memory scheduled OS interleaved manner appear run parallel really run parallel
hand live private sandbox virtual memory provided guarded MMU
This handy enables A process separate virtual address space
Two process running system time overlap
Every process data segment well separate memory offset
A process executing instance application
What mean
Well example Microsoft Word icon start process run Word
A thread path execution within process
Also process contain multiple thread
When start Word operating system creates process begin executing primary thread process
Threads within process share Memory thread stack register thread store data heap
Threads never execute independently communication much faster compared communication
Processes never share memory
When child process creates duplicate memory location parent process
Process communication done using pipe shared memory message parsing
Context switching thread slow
They almost
But key difference thread lightweight process term context switching work load
good process thread
Example A JVM run single process thread JVM share heap belonging process
That several thread may access object
Threads share heap stack space
This one invocation method local variable kept thread safe thread
But heap must synchronized thread safety

In execution smallest sequence programmed instruction managed independently typically part
The implementation thread differs operating system case thread component process
Multiple thread exist within one process executing sharing resource different process share resource
In particular thread process share executable code value variable given time
Systems single processor generally implement multithreading CPU switch different
This generally happens often rapidly enough user perceive thread task running parallel
On system multiple thread execute every processor core executing separate thread simultaneously processor core separate software thread also executed concurrently separate hardware thread
Threads made early appearance MVT context called task
The term thread attributed
many modern operating system directly support multiprocessor threading allows programmer manipulate thread exposing required functionality interface
Some threading implementation called whereas LWP specific type kernel thread share state information
Furthermore program threading timer signal method interrupt execution performing sort time slicing
Threads differ traditional operating system Systems said thread process operating system great difference except cost switch architecture notably result TLB flush
In one time
The opposite multithreading
While suggested term misleading term widely accepted within community
Multithreading mainly found multitasking operating system
Multithreading widespread programming execution model allows multiple thread exist within context one process
These thread share process resource able execute independently
The threaded programming model provides developer useful abstraction concurrent execution
Multithreading also applied one process enable system
Multithreaded application following advantage Multithreading following drawback Operating system schedule thread either cooperatively
On widely used approach finer grained control execution time via
However preemptive scheduling may context switch thread moment unanticipated programmer therefore causing
In contrast relies thread relinquish control execution thus ensuring thread
This create problem cooperatively multitasked thread waiting thread yielding control execution intensive computation
Until early desktop computer one CPU support although thread still used computer switching thread generally still quicker
In added support processor name introduced processor introduced processor
Processors higher requirement behavior might support multithreading decreasing time perhaps allocating dedicated thread instead common register file
Scheduling done kernel level user level multitasking done preemptively cooperatively
This yield variety related concept
At kernel level contains one share process resource memory file handle process unit resource thread unit scheduling execution
Kernel scheduling typically uniformly done preemptively le commonly cooperatively
At user level process schedule multiple thread execution
If share data Erlang usually analogously called process share data usually called particularly preemptively scheduled
Cooperatively scheduled user thread known different process may schedule user thread differently
User thread may executed kernel thread various way
The term variously refers user thread kernel mechanism scheduling user thread onto kernel thread
A heavyweight unit kernel scheduling creating destroying switching process relatively expensive
Processes allocated operating system
Resources include memory code data socket device handle window
Processes share address space file resource except explicit method inheriting file handle shared memory segment mapping file shared way see
Creating destroying process relatively expensive resource must acquired released
Processes typically preemptively multitasked process switching relatively expensive beyond basic cost due issue cache flushing
A lightweight unit kernel scheduling
At least one kernel thread exists within process
If multiple kernel thread exist within process share memory file resource
Kernel thread preemptively multitasked operating system process preemptive
Kernel thread resource except copy including thus relatively cheap create destroy
Thread switching also relatively cheap requires context switch saving restoring register stack pointer change virtual memory thus leaving TLB valid
The kernel assign one thread logical core system processor split multiple logical core support multithreading support one logical core per physical core swap thread get blocked
However kernel thread take much longer user thread swapped
Threads sometimes implemented library thus called
The kernel unaware managed scheduled
Some implementation base user thread top several kernel thread benefit machine
In article term thread without kernel user qualifier default referring kernel thread
User thread implemented also called
User thread generally fast create manage take advantage multithreading multiprocessing get blocked associated kernel thread get blocked even user thread ready run
even lighter unit scheduling running fiber must explicitly allow another fiber run make implementation much easier kernel
A fiber scheduled run thread process
This permit application gain performance improvement managing scheduling instead relying kernel scheduler may tuned application
Parallel programming environment typically implement task fiber
Closely related fiber distinction coroutines construct fiber construct
Threads process share address space
This allows concurrently running code tightly conveniently exchange data without overhead complexity
When shared thread however even simple data structure become prone require one CPU instruction update two thread may end attempting update data structure time find unexpectedly changing underfoot
Bugs caused race condition difficult reproduce isolate

SunOS SunOS well NetBSD NetBSD implemented two level model multiplexing one user level thread kernel thread M N model

The us threading
M N map M number application thread onto N number kernel entity virtual processor
This compromise threading
In general M N threading system complex implement either kernel user thread change kernel code required
In M N implementation threading library responsible scheduling user thread available schedulable entity make context switching thread fast avoids system call
However increase complexity likelihood well suboptimal scheduling without extensive expensive coordination userland scheduler kernel scheduler
Fibers implemented without operating system support although operating system library provide explicit support
IBM F included support multithreading called late continued Optimizing Compiler later version
The IBM Enterprise compiler introduced new model thread API
Neither version part standard
Many programming language support threading capacity
Many implementation support threading provide access native threading APIs operating system
Some usually programming language language expose threading developer abstracting platform specific difference threading implementation runtime
Several programming language language extension also try abstract concept concurrency threading developer fully MPI
Some language designed sequential parallelism instead especially using GPUs without requiring concurrency thread
A interpreted programming language implementation Ruby Python support threading concurrency parallel execution thread due GIL
The GIL mutual exclusion lock held interpreter prevent interpreter simultaneously interpreting application code two thread effectively limit parallelism multiple core system
This limit performance mostly thread require processor much one
Other implementation interpreted programming language using Thread extension avoid GIL limit using Apartment model data code must explicitly shared thread
In Tcl thread one interpreter
different threading model support extremely large number thread modeling hardware
A standardized interface thread implementation Pthreads set library call
OS vendor free implement interface desired application developer able use interface across multiple platform
Most platform including Linux support Pthreads
Microsoft Windows set thread function interface multithreading like
Java provides yet another standardized interface host operating system using library
Multithreading library provide function call create new thread take function parameter
A concurrent thread created start running passed function end function return
The thread library also offer synchronization function make possible implement free multithreading function using condition variable synchronization primitive
Another paradigm thread usage set number thread created startup wait task assigned
When new task arrives wake completes task go back waiting
This avoids relatively expensive thread creation destruction function every task performed take thread management application developer hand leaf library operating system better suited optimize thread management
For example framework like
In programming model designed array thread run parallel using ID find data memory
In essence application must designed thread performs operation different segment memory operate parallel use GPU architecture

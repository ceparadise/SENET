Posted April Nicholas Zakas Tags When I started writing first edition working title featured lot content make final cut
I actually several chapter worth content sitting around computer
Several chapter discus implementing common computer science pattern algorithm JavaScript
At time I thought would make good addition book ultimately ended holding back fit final vision book
Instead letting content sit computer I decided start sharing blog
One first data structure learn computer science linked list
As quick refresher Wikipedia description It consists sequence node containing arbitrary data field one two reference link pointing next previous node
The principal benefit linked list conventional array order linked item may different order data item stored memory disk allowing list item traversed different order
A linked list datatype contains pointer link another datum type
Linked list permit insertion removal node point list constant time allow random access
Linked list often used computer science program help introduce concept pointer
The list pointer head node turn point next node
Each node consists two field field containing value location list field containing pointer next node list empty pointer last item
To begin JavaScript implementation start creating single node
This done easily using object literal When want create list create new node assign node property Once list traverse following property node get specific point list
Of course hand annoying error prone better create custom type
Here start The constructor creates object private property contains number item list point first item list
Initially set list empty
Adding item linked list requires walking structure find correct location creating new node inserting place
The one special case list empty case simply create new node assign The complicated part method traversing list find correct spot insert new node
Traditional algorithm use two pointer point item inspected point node
When mean pointing last item list
I recreated algorithm JavaScript though several arguably better alternative tradition sake
Retrieving value list involves type traversal The method check ensure index specified within valid range traversing list
The loop used figure correct place stop list find data requested
Removing node linked list little bit tricky
You need find node remove set previous node property appropriate next node
This skipping appropriate node result removal list
The typical implementation linked list node removal two pointer pointer indicates node inspected pointer point node prior
When node remove must set execute removal
The code Note one special case removal first item
In case need set equal moving pointer start list next item
Once complete use linked list implementation like This basic implementation linked list rounded method return length list method convert regular array
The full source code available GitHub project
I updating project blog post hopefully build nice collection implementation reference
Just clear I advocating using production code native object serf need quite well
This purely academic exercise treated

A question I gotten lot lately difference similarity Computer Science Computer Engineering
At risk difference I written guide explain Computer Science Computer Engineering alike differ
Computer Engineering marriage Computer Science Electrical Engineering
It focus computing form microprocessor embedded computing device laptop desktop system supercomputer
As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn
That page begin helpful list specialization area Computer Engineering
I copied list specialization I marked asterisk Computer Scientists also specialize
In case overlap Computer Scientists focus software development aspect specialization Computer Engineers study hardware design integration hardware software needed implement specialization
That website present number interesting data Computer Engineering
For example table express relationship among Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science term class major take percentage class fall category hardware software
You see computer science software computer engineering hardware theme play table
That easiest way distinguish two field
And yet enough overlap ensure kind student find plenty opportunity wide range career computer field

You find
Please also I would like ask difference Sc
Computer Science Sc
Mathematics Computer Science
I computer science social science natural science
That good question
There consensus kind science Computer Science
A good book subject The Science Computing Shaping Discipline Matti Tedre
Personally I see Computer Science engineering discipline
Like Electrical Engineering applies law Physics Math solve problem
Computer Engineering Computer Science mean different thing different people
I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

In object whose value refers another value stored elsewhere using
A pointer location memory obtaining value stored location known pointer
As analogy page number book index could considered pointer corresponding page dereferencing pointer would done flipping page given page number reading text found indexed page
Pointers data significantly improve performance repetitive operation traversing structure
In particular often much cheaper time space copy dereference pointer copy access data pointer point
Pointers also used hold address entry point subroutine
In used often using called
A pointer simple concrete implementation abstract
Several language support type pointer although restriction use others
While pointer used refer reference general properly applies whose explicitly allows pointer manipulated arithmetically via memory address opposed possible
Because pointer allow protected unprotected access memory address risk associated using particularly latter case
Primitive pointer often stored format similar however attempting dereference look pointer whose value never valid memory address would cause program crash
To alleviate potential problem matter pointer considered separate type parameterized type data point even underlying representation integer
Other measure may also taken validation bound checking verify content pointer variable contain value valid memory address within numerical range processor capable addressing
credited invention pointer
In Lawson presented Computer Pioneer Award f inventing pointer variable introducing concept thus providing first time capability flexibly treat linked list high level language
According first appeared print technical memorandum
In pointer kind
A datum read written using one memory access instance primitive
A group primitive contiguous memory viewed collectively one datum instance aggregate could logically contiguous byte value represent coordinate point space
When aggregate entirely composed type primitive aggregate may called sense primitive array byte program use word way
In context definition smallest primitive specifies different byte
The memory address initial byte datum considered memory address entire datum
A primitive value intended used memory address said
It also said pointer value datum memory address
More generally pointer kind said obtain datum
The feature separate pointer kind reference pointer value meant interpreted memory address rather concept
References serve level indirection A pointer value determines memory address datum used calculation
Because indirection fundamental aspect algorithm pointer often expressed fundamental typed programming language pointer determines type datum pointer point
When setting like tree necessary pointer help manage structure implemented controlled
Typical example pointer start pointer end pointer pointer
These pointer either actual absolute start address base typically us fewer bit full address usually require one additional arithmetic operation resolve
Relative address form manual share many advantage disadvantage
A offset containing unsigned integer used provide relative addressing kilobyte data structure
This easily extended address pointed forced word boundary requiring additional shift left order adjust offset factor addition base address
Generally though scheme lot trouble convenience programmer absolute address underlying preferred
A one byte offset hexadecimal value character
used point alternative integer value index array

In way character efficiently translated usable sequential absolute address without
used control usually make extensive use pointer
The pointer usually embedded table entry may instance used hold entry point executed based certain condition defined table entry
The pointer however simply index separate associated table comprising array actual address address depending upon programming language construct available
They also used point earlier table entry loop processing forward skip table entry early exit loop
For latter purpose pointer may simply table entry number transformed actual address simple arithmetic
Pointers thin top addressing capability provided modern
In simplest scheme numeric assigned unit memory system unit typically either depending whether architecture effectively transforming memory large
The system would also provide operation retrieve value stored memory unit given address usually utilizing machine
In usual case pointer large enough hold address unit memory system
This introduces possibility program may attempt access address corresponds unit memory either enough memory installed
beyond range available memory architecture support address
The first case may certain platform architecture called segfault
The second case possible current implementation pointer bit long address extend bit
Pointers must conform certain rule canonical address pointer dereferenced processor raise
On hand system unit memory address
In case complex scheme employed use different part memory different time
The last incarnation architecture support bit physical memory address mapped linear address space paging mechanism
Thus possible total memory may accessed time
Another example computer family processor though supporting MB physical memory could access GB virtual memory combination address segment register made accessing KB one data structure cumbersome
In order provide consistent interface architecture provide allows address refer unit memory others refer device computer
There analogous concept file offset array index remote object reference serve purpose address type object
Pointers directly supported without restriction language implicitly
They primarily used constructing turn fundamental constructing nearly well passing data different part program
In functional programming language rely heavily list pointer reference managed abstractly language using internal construct like
When dealing array critical operation typically involves stage called involves constructing pointer desired data element array
In data structure pointer used reference explicitly tie one piece structure another
Pointers used pas parameter reference
This useful programmer want function modification parameter visible function caller
This also useful returning multiple value function
Pointers also used deallocate dynamic variable array memory
Since variable often become redundant served purpose waste memory keep therefore good practice deallocate using original pointer reference longer needed
Failure may result available free memory gradually severe case rapidly diminishes accumulation numerous redundant memory block
The basic define pointer This declares identifier object following type This usually stated succinctly pointer
Because C language specify implicit initialization object automatic storage duration care often taken ensure address point valid sometimes suggested pointer explicitly initialized value traditionally specified C standardized macro Dereferencing null pointer C produce could catastrophic
However implementation simply halt execution program question usually
However initializing pointer unnecessarily could hinder program analysis thereby hiding bug
In case pointer declared next logical step point something This assigns value address
For example stored memory location value assignment
To dereference pointer asterisk used This mean take content locate address memory set value
If later accessed new value
This example may clearer memory examined directly
Assume located address memory also assume machine int wide
The following would memory following code snippet executed The NULL pointer shown
By assigning address yield following memory value Then dereferencing coding computer take content address assign location yielding following memory Clearly accessing yield value previous instruction modified content way pointer
In C array indexing formally defined term pointer arithmetic language specification requires equivalent
Thus C array thought pointer consecutive area memory gap syntax accessing array identical used dereference pointer
For example array declared used following manner This allocates block five integer name block act pointer block
Another common use pointer point dynamically allocated memory return consecutive block memory le requested size used array
While operator array pointer equivalent result operator differs
In example evaluate size array evaluate size pointer
Default value array declared like If located memory starting address machine memory contain following value like address Represented five integer
These five integer occupy bit byte byte stored first stored consecutively starting address
The syntax C pointer The last example access content
Breaking Below example definition This definition essentially definition empty list cell type another link also type
The definition reference however use potentially confusing signal value
For reason data structure C usually dealt via carefully checked correctness
Pointers used pas variable address allowing value changed
For example consider following code In program required memory depends may enter
In case programmer need allocate memory dynamically
This done allocating memory rather variable usually stored
Variables also stored CPU register another matter Dynamic memory allocation made pointer name like common variable ca given
Pointers used store manage address block memory
Such block used store data object array object
Most structured language provide area memory called object dynamically allocated
The example C code illustrates structure object dynamically allocated referenced
The provides function allocating memory block heap
It take size object allocate parameter return pointer newly allocated block memory suitable storing object return null pointer allocation failed
The code illustrates memory object dynamically deallocated returned heap free store
The standard C library provides function deallocating previously allocated memory block returning back heap
On computing architecture pointer used directly manipulate memory device
Assigning address pointer invaluable tool programming
Below simple example declaring pointer type int initialising address example constant In mid using access video capability PCs slow
Applications typically used access video memory directly casting constant pointer array unsigned int value
Each value consisted code low byte colour high byte
Thus put letter row column bright white blue one would write code like following In many language pointer additional restriction object point specific
For example pointer may declared point language attempt prevent programmer pointing object integer eliminating error
For example C would integer pointer would char pointer
The following would yield compiler warning assignment incompatible pointer type declared different type
To suppress compiler warning must made explicit indeed wish make assignment say cast integer pointer char pointer assign
A draft C standard requires casting pointer derived one type one another type maintain alignment correctness type Pointers par
In language allow pointer arithmetic arithmetic pointer take account size type
For example adding integer number pointer produce another pointer point address higher number time size type
This allows u easily compute address element array given type shown C array example
When pointer one type cast another type different size programmer expect pointer arithmetic calculated differently
In C example array start byte whereas byte point would point
Other risk casting include loss data wide data written narrow location
unexpected result value comparison problem especially signed v unsigned value
Although impossible general determine cast safe language store used confirm dangerous cast valid runtime
Other language merely accept conservative approximation safe cast none
As pointer allows program attempt access object may defined pointer origin variety
However usefulness pointer great difficult perform programming task without
Consequently many language created construct designed provide useful feature pointer without also sometimes referred
In context pointer directly address memory used article referred contrast smart pointer variant
One major problem pointer long directly manipulated number made point unused address data used purpose
Many language including recent like replace pointer opaque type reference typically referred simply used refer object manipulated number preventing type error
Array indexing handled special case
A pointer address assigned called
Any attempt use uninitialized pointer cause unexpected behavior either initial value valid address using may damage part program
The result often used function pointer branch address
In system explicit memory allocation possible create deallocating memory region point
This type pointer dangerous subtle deallocated memory region may contain data deallocated may reallocated overwritten unrelated code unknown earlier code
Languages prevent type error deallocation performed automatically reference scope
Some language like support use simple form help track allocation dynamic memory addition acting reference
In absence reference cycle object refers indirectly sequence smart pointer eliminate possibility dangling pointer memory leak
string support reference counting natively
The introduces optimisation based around eliminate pointer bug without resorting
A value reserved indicating pointer refer valid object
Null pointer routinely used represent condition end unknown length failure perform action use null pointer compared value
An pointer whose value interpreted offset address pointer thus data structure autorelative pointer member point portion data structure data structure may relocated memory without update value auto relative pointer
The cited patent also us term mean thing
However meaning term used way A pointer whose value offset value another pointer
This used store load block data assigning address beginning block base pointer
In language pointer reference another pointer requiring multiple dereference operation get original value
While level indirection may add performance cost sometimes necessary order provide correct behavior complex
For example C typical define term element contains pointer next element list This implementation us pointer first element list surrogate entire list
If new value added beginning list changed point new element
Since C argument always passed value using double indirection allows insertion implemented correctly desirable eliminating special case code deal insertion front list In case value le caller properly updated address new item
A basic example argument given prototype variable pointer array string array array pointer string convention name program character string
In language pointer reference executable code point function method procedure
A store address function invoked
While facility used call function dynamically often favorite technique virus malicious software writer
A pointer point valid object consequently may make program crash behave oddly
In pointer specifically initialized may point unpredictable address memory
The following example code show dangling pointer Here may point anywhere memory performing assignment corrupt unknown area memory trigger
In doubly back pointer held element back item referring current element
These useful navigation manipulation expense greater memory use
These pointer declaration cover variant pointer declaration
Of course possible triple pointer main principle behind triple pointer already exist double pointer
The higher priority
Where pointer used address entry point program start also either uninitialized corrupted call nevertheless made address said occurred
The consequence usually unpredictable error may present several different way depending upon whether pointer valid address whether coincidentally valid instruction opcode address
The detection wild branch present one difficult frustrating debugging exercise since much evidence may already destroyed beforehand execution one inappropriate instruction branch location
If available usually detect wild branch take effect also provide complete partial trace history
It possible simulate pointer behavior using index normally array
Primarily language support pointer explicitly support array thought processed entire memory range within scope particular array index thought equivalent assembly language point individual byte whose actual value relative start array absolute address memory
Assuming array say contiguous character individual byte contiguous byte within array directly addressed manipulated using name array bit unsigned simulated pointer quite similar example shown
Pointer arithmetic simulated adding subtracting index minimal additional overhead compared genuine pointer arithmetic
It even theoretically possible using technique together suitable simulate intermediate another language support pointer example
To achieve code initially loaded contiguous byte array simulator read interpret action entirely within memory contained array
If necessary completely avoid problem usually actioned compiler hand coded simulator
strongly typed language pointer typed safe type conversion permitted
All pointer default initialized attempt access data pointer cause raised
Pointers Ada called
Ada permit arithmetic access type although many compiler vendor provided feature Ada support safe arithmetic access type via package
Several old version Windows platform support STRPTR return address string VARPTR return address variable
Visual Basic also support OBJPTR return address object interface ADDRESSOF operator return address function
The type integer value equivalent held pointer type
Newer dialect exhaustive pointer implementation however
In FreeBASIC arithmetic pointer equivalent C treated though pointer byte width
pointer dereferenced Also casting type pointer generate warning
In pointer variable store address
Each pointer type point one freely cast pointer type function pointer object pointer
A special pointer type called void pointer allows pointing object limited fact dereferenced directly shall cast
The address often directly manipulated casting pointer integral type sufficient size though result may indeed cause undefined behavior earlier C standard integral type guaranteed large enough specifies defined implementation need provide
fully support C pointer C typecasting
It also support new group typecasting operator help catch unintended dangerous cast
Since also provides used situation safer alternative primitive C pointer
also support another form reference quite different pointer called simply
ability modify pointer target address arithmetic operation well magnitude comparison restricted language standard remain within bound single array object otherwise invoke
Adding subtracting pointer move multiple size
For example adding pointer integer value increment pointer
This effect incrementing pointer point next element contiguous array often intended result
Pointer arithmetic performed pointer size thus pointed address added although compiler perform byte arithmetic extension treating
Pointer arithmetic provides programmer single way dealing different type adding subtracting number element required instead actual offset byte
Pointer arithmetic pointer us byte offset definition
In particular C definition explicitly declares syntax element array equivalent content element pointed
This implies equivalent one write equally well access fourth element array
While powerful pointer arithmetic source
It tends confuse novice forcing different context expression ordinary arithmetic one pointer arithmetic one sometimes easy mistake one
In response many modern computer language example permit direct access memory using address
Also safe C dialect address many issue pointer
See discussion
The supported ANSI C generic pointer type
A pointer store address object function C implicitly converted object pointer type assignment must explicitly cast dereferenced
C used pointer purpose ANSI C
allow implicit conversion pointer type even assignment
This design decision avoid careless even unintended cast though compiler output warning error encountering cast
In reference void complement pointer void reference behave like alias variable point never variable whose type
In pointer supported certain condition block code including pointer must marked keyword
Such block usually require higher security permission allowed run
The syntax essentially address pointed either memory
However pointer managed memory pointer managed object must declared using keyword prevents moving pointed object part memory management pointer scope thus keeping pointer address valid
An exception using structure safe managed equivalent require unsafe code
This type often returned using method example The framework includes many class method namespaces class convert type example many type pointer example allow communication
Most method security permission requirement unmanaged code since affect arbitrary place memory
The programming language support pointer variable
Primitive group record data object declared within program inherently memory allocated within program space address data item typically single memory word
In program source code data item used like variable content implicitly accessed indirectly pointer
Memory space data object typically using external statement via embedded extended language construct statement
Extended version COBOL also provide pointer variable declared clause
The value pointer variable established modified using statement
Some extended version COBOL also provide variable capable storing
The language provides full support pointer data type including pointer structure string handling extensive
quite leap forward compared programming language time
The derivative C fully support C pointer C typecasting
The employ value reference semantics without pointer arithmetic
Nevertheless pointer class provided
They offer pointer arithmetic typecasting explicit memory management interfacing software feature
introduced strongly typed pointer capability
Fortran pointer contain simple memory address
They also encapsulate lower upper bound array dimension stride example support arbitrary array section metadata
An used associate variable attribute
The statement may also used associate pointer block memory
For example following code might used define create linked list structure add support procedure pointer
Also part feature support intrinsic function converting pointer Fortran pointer back
pointer
Its declaration syntax equivalent C written way around ending type
Unlike C Go garbage collection disallows pointer arithmetic
Reference type like exist
Some type like map channel boxed
internally pointer mutable structure initialized using function
In approach unified syntax pointer arrow operator dropped dot operator pointer refers field method dereferenced object
This however work level indirection
Unlike explicit representation pointer
Instead complex data structure like implemented using
The language provide explicit pointer manipulation operator
It still possible code attempt dereference null reference null pointer however result thrown
The space occupied unreferenced memory object recovered automatically
Pointers implemented much Pascal parameter procedure call
even strongly typed Pascal fewer way escape type system
Some variant include garbage collection
Much pointer available
There still fewer way evade type system variant still safer respect pointer variant
As garbage collection part language specification
Unlike many language feature pointer standard allows pointer reference dynamically created variable anonymous allow reference standard static local variable
It pointer arithmetic
Pointers also must associated type pointer one type compatible pointer another type
pointer char compatible pointer integer
This help eliminate type security issue inherent pointer implementation particularly used
It also remove risk caused ability dynamically let go referenced space using standard procedure effect library function found mean risk dangling pointer entirely eliminated
However commercial open source Pascal derivative compiler implementation pointer allowed reference standard static local variable cast one pointer type another
Moreover pointer arithmetic unrestricted adding subtracting pointer move number byte either direction using standard procedure move pointer size point
An untyped pointer also provided name compatible pointer type
The support pointer although rarely used form pack unpack function
These intended simple interaction compiled OS library
In case Perl us typed allow form pointer arithmetic
They used construct complex data structure

Several operating system developed originally West Lafayette Indiana later Chapel Hill North Carolina used singly linked list file structure
A directory entry pointed first sector file succeeding portion file located traversing pointer
Systems using technique included Flex CPU CPU Motorola CPU
A variant developed TSC marketed Smoke Signal Broadcasting California used doubly linked list manner
The operating system developed IBM System machine used double linked list file system catalog
The directory structure similar Unix directory could contain file directory extend depth
Each record linked list often called
The field node contains address next node usually called link pointer
The remaining field known field
The list first node
The list may refer either rest list head last node list
In derived language next node may called pronounced list payload head node may called
Singly linked list contain node data field well field point next node line node
Operations performed singly linked list include insertion deletion traversal
The following code demonstrates add new node data value end singly linked list In linked list node contains besides link second link field pointing node sequence
The two link may called
A technique known allows doubly linked list implemented using single link field node
However technique requires ability bit operation address therefore may available language
Many modern operating system use doubly linked list maintain reference active process thread dynamic object
A common strategy evade detection unlink list
In linked list node contains two link field field used connect set data record different order name department date birth etc
While doubly linked list seen special case multiply linked list fact two order opposite lead simpler efficient algorithm usually treated separate case
In last list link field often contains reference special value used indicate lack node
A le common convention make point first node list case list said linked otherwise said list last pointer point first node
In case circular doubly linked list change occurs end tail said list linked back front head list vice linked list consist several node list
In implementation extra node may added first data record last one
This convention simplifies accelerates algorithm ensuring link safely dereferenced every list even one contains data element always first last node
An empty list list contains data record
This usually saying zero node
If sentinel node used list usually said empty sentinel node
The link field need physically part node
If data record stored array referenced index link field may stored separate array index data record
Since reference first node give access whole list reference often called list
Algorithms manipulate linked list usually get handle input list return handle resulting list
In fact context algorithm word list often mean list handle
In situation however may convenient refer list handle consists two link pointing first last node
The alternative listed may arbitrarily combined almost every way one may circular doubly linked list without sentinel circular singly linked list sentinel etc
As choice computer programming design method well suited circumstance
A linked list data structure might work well one case cause problem another
This list common tradeoff involving linked list structure
A data structure allocates element contiguously memory keep count current number element
If space reserved dynamic array exceeded reallocated possibly copied expensive operation
Linked list several advantage dynamic array
Insertion deletion element specific point list assuming indexed pointer node one removed insertion point already operation otherwise without reference O n whereas insertion dynamic array random location require moving half element average element worst case
While one delete element array constant time somehow marking slot vacant cause impedes performance iteration
Moreover arbitrarily many element may inserted linked list limited total memory available dynamic array eventually fill underlying array data structure reallocate expensive operation one may even possible memory fragmented although cost reallocation averaged insertion cost insertion due reallocation would still O
This help appending element array end inserting removing middle position still carry prohibitive cost due data moving maintain contiguity
An array many element removed may also resized order avoid wasting much space
On hand dynamic array well allow linked list allow element
Singly linked list fact easily traversed one direction
This make linked list unsuitable application useful look element index quickly
Sequential access array dynamic array also faster linked list many machine optimal thus make good use data caching
Another disadvantage linked list extra storage needed reference often make impractical list small data item storage overhead link may exceed factor two size data
In contrast dynamic array requires space data small amount control data
It also slow naïve allocator wasteful allocate memory separately new element problem generally solved using
Some hybrid solution try combine advantage two representation
store several element list node increasing cache performance decreasing memory overhead reference
well replacing reference actual data referenced extends end referencing record
A good example highlight pro con using dynamic array linked list implementing program resolve
The Josephus problem election method work group people stand circle
Starting predetermined person count around circle time
Once reach th person take circle member close circle
Then count around circle time repeat process one person left
That person win election
This show strength weakness linked list dynamic array view people connected node circular linked list show easily linked list able delete node rearrange link different node
However linked list poor finding next person remove need search list find person
A dynamic array hand poor deleting node element remove one node without individually shifting element list one
However exceptionally easy find th person circle directly referencing position array
The problem concern efficient conversion linked list representation array
Although trivial conventional computer solving problem complicated subject much research
A similar memory access pattern space overhead linked list permitting much efficient indexing taking O log n time instead O n random access
However insertion deletion operation expensive due overhead tree manipulation maintain balance
Schemes exist tree automatically maintain balanced state
While doubly linked circular list advantage singly linked linear list linear list offer advantage make preferable situation
A singly linked linear list data structure contains pointer object type
For reason many operation singly linked linear list two list enumerating element reverse order often simple recursive algorithm much simpler solution using
While recursive solution adapted doubly linked circularly linked list procedure generally need extra argument complicated base case
Linear singly linked list also allow use common final portion terminal portion two different list
In particular new node added beginning list former list remains available tail new one simple example
Again true variant node may never belong two different circular doubly linked list
In particular node shared among singly linked list
The node may used list
In example every proper list end link special node denoted whose link point
Thus Lisp procedure safely take list
The advantage fancy variant often limited complexity algorithm efficiency
A circular list particular usually emulated linear list together two variable point first last node extra cost
list require space per node unless one us elementary operation expensive often easier manipulate allow fast easy sequential access list direction
In doubly linked list one insert delete node constant number operation given node address
To singly linked list one must node either handle whole list case first node link field node
Some algorithm require access direction
On hand doubly linked list allow used A circularly linked list may natural option represent array naturally circular
corner pool used released first first order set process
In application pointer node serf handle whole list
With circular list pointer last node give easy access also first node following one link
Thus application require access end list implementation queue circular structure allows one handle structure single pointer instead two
A circular list split two circular list constant time giving address last node piece
The operation consists swapping content link field two node
Applying operation two node two distinct list join two list one
This property greatly simplifies algorithm data structure
The simplest representation empty list thing make sense null pointer indicating list node
Without choice many algorithm test special case handle separately
By contrast use null denote empty list natural often creates fewer special case
may simplify certain list operation ensuring next previous node exist every element even empty list least one node
One may also use sentinel node end list appropriate data field eliminate test
For example scanning list looking node given value setting sentinel data field make unnecessary test inside loop
Another example merging two sorted list sentinel data field set choice next output node need special handling empty list
However sentinel node use extra space especially application use many short list may complicate operation creation new empty list
However circular list used merely simulate linear list one may avoid complexity adding single sentinel node every list last first data node
With convention empty list consists sentinel node alone pointing via link
The list handle pointer last data node sentinel list empty sentinel list empty
The trick used simplify handling doubly linked linear list turning circular doubly linked list single sentinel node
However case handle single pointer dummy node
When manipulating linked list care must taken use value invalidated previous assignment
This make algorithm inserting deleting linked list node somewhat subtle
This section give adding removing node singly doubly circularly linked list
Throughout use refer marker may implemented number way
Our node data structure two field
We also keep variable always point first node list empty list
Traversal singly linked list simple beginning first node following link come end The following code insert node existing node singly linked list
The diagram show work
Inserting node existing one done directly instead one must keep track previous node insert node
Inserting beginning list requires separate function
This requires updating
Similarly function removing node given node removing node beginning list
The diagram demonstrates former
To find remove particular node one must keep track previous element
Notice set removing last node list
Since ca iterate backwards efficient operation possible
Inserting list specific node requires traversing list would worst case running time O n
Appending one linked list another inefficient unless reference tail kept part List structure must traverse entire first list order find tail append second list
Thus two linearly linked list length list appending
In Lisp family language list appending provided procedure
Many special case linked list operation eliminated including dummy element front list
This ensures special case beginning list render unnecessary
In case first useful data list found
In circularly linked list node linked continuous circle without using For list front back queue one store reference last node list
The node last node first node
Elements added back list removed front constant time
Circularly linked list either singly doubly linked
Both type circularly linked list benefit ability traverse full list beginning given node
This often allows u avoid storing although list may empty need special representation empty list variable point node list empty use
This representation significantly simplifies adding removing node list empty list special case
Assuming node circular singly linked list code iterates list starting Notice test node someNode must end loop
If test moved beginning loop procedure would fail whenever list one node
This function insert node newNode circular linked list given node node
If node null assumes list empty
Suppose L variable pointing last node circular linked list null list empty
To append newNode list one may To insert newNode list one may Languages support type still create link replacing pointer array index
The approach keep record integer field indicating index next possibly previous node array
Not node array need used
If record also supported often used instead
As example consider following linked list record us array instead pointer A linked list built creating array structure integer variable store index first element
Links element formed placing array index next previous cell Next Prev field within given element
For example In example would set location first entry list
Notice entry part list
These cell available addition list
By creating integer variable could created keep track cell available
If entry use size array would increased element would deleted new entry could stored list
The following code would traverse list display name account balance When faced choice advantage approach include This approach one main disadvantage however creates manages private memory space node
This lead following issue For reason approach mainly used language support dynamic memory allocation
These disadvantage also mitigated maximum size list known time array created
Many singly linked list built
In many list constructed node called
The con two field reference data node reference next node
Although con cell used build data structure primary purpose
In language support template linked list ADTs template available building linked list
In language linked list typically built using together
When constructing linked list one faced choice whether store data list directly linked list node called merely store reference data called
Internal storage advantage making access data efficient requiring le storage overall better simplifying memory management list data allocated deallocated time list node
External storage hand advantage generic data structure machine code used linked list matter size data
It also make easy place data multiple linked list
Although internal storage data placed multiple list including multiple reference node data structure would necessary create separate routine add delete cell based field
It possible create additional linked list element use internal storage using external storage cell additional linked list store reference node linked list containing data
In general set data structure need included linked list external storage best approach
If set data structure need included one linked list internal storage slightly better unless generic linked list package using external storage available
Likewise different set data stored data structure included single linked list internal storage would fine
Another approach used language involves different data structure initial field including double linked list reference location
After defining separate structure type data generic structure defined contains minimum amount data shared structure contained top beginning structure
Then generic routine created use minimal structure perform linked list type operation separate routine handle specific data
This approach often used message parsing routine several type message received start set field usually including field message type
The generic routine used add new message queue received remove queue order process message
The message type field used call correct routine process specific type message
Suppose wanted create linked list family member
Using internal storage structure might look like following To print complete list family member using internal storage could write Using external storage would create following structure To print complete list family member using external storage could write Notice using external storage extra step needed extract record node cast proper data type
This list family list member within family stored two linked list using data structure language parametric type
As long number family member belong known compile time internal storage work fine
If however member needed included arbitrary number family specific number known run time external storage would necessary
Finding specific element linked list even sorted normally requires O time
This one primary disadvantage linked list data structure
In addition variant discussed two simple way improve search time
In unordered list one simple heuristic decreasing average search time simply move element beginning list found
This scheme handy creating simple cache ensures recently used item also quickest find
Another common approach linked list using efficient external data structure
For example one build whose element reference linked list node
Multiple index built single list
The disadvantage index may need updated time node added removed least index used
A list support fast random access read modify element list
One possible implementation using involves list tree special property allows constant time operation logarithmic time random access element index
Random access list implemented
Random access list viewed immutable linked list likewise support O head tail operation
A simple extension random access list provides additional operation yield minimum element entire list constant time without mutation complexity
Both often implemented using linked list simply restrict type operation supported
The linked list augmented layer pointer quickly jumping large number element descending next layer
This process continues bottom layer actual list
A seen type linked list element linked list nature
The result node may include reference first node one two linked list together content form subtrees node
An linked list node contains array data value
This lead improved performance since list element contiguous memory reduced memory overhead le metadata need stored element list
A may use linked list store chain item hash position hash table
A share ordering property linked list almost always implemented using array
Instead reference node node next previous data index calculated using current data index
A rearranges node based heuristic reduces search time data retrieval keeping commonly accessed node head list

The began long modern discipline emerged century hinted century prior
The progression mechanical invention theory towards led major academic field basis massive worldwide industry
The earliest known tool use computation developed period BCE
The Sumerians abacus consisted table successive column delimited successive order magnitude number system
Its original style usage line drawn sand pebble
Abaci modern design still used calculation tool today
In BC invented
It first known mechanism use later used
The also invented sophisticated abacus around century BC known
In century BC formulated rule known highly systematized technical
Panini used metarule
The believed early mechanical analog computer
It designed calculate astronomical position
It discovered wreck Greek island Antikythera Kythera dated BC
Mechanical analog computer device appeared thousand year later developed mechanical geared
According also made important advance development
machine also invented automatic player brother programmable considered first analog computer
Technological artifact similar complexity appeared century mechanical
When discovered logarithm computational purpose early century followed period considerable progress inventor scientist making calculating tool
In designed calculating machine abandoned project prototype started building destroyed fire
Around leading French mathematician constructed mechanical adding device based design described mathematician
Then invented completed
In first described accepted first design modern computer
The analytical engine expandable memory arithmetic unit logic processing capability able interpret programming language loop conditional branching
Although never built design studied extensively understood
The analytical engine would memory capacity le kilobyte memory clock speed le Hertz
Considerable advancement mathematics electronics theory required first modern computer could designed
In developed formal mathematical sense writing binary numeral system
In system one zero also represent value state
But took century published complete system allowed computational process mathematically modeled
By time first mechanical device driven binary pattern invented
The driven forward mechanization many task included
controlled loom hole punched card indicated binary unpunched spot indicated binary
Jacquard loom far computer illustrate machine could driven binary system
Before sometimes human clerk performed computation
They usually lead physicist
Many thousand computer employed commerce government research establishment
Most computer woman
Some performed astronomical calculation calendar others ballistic table military
After expression referred machine performed work human computer especially accordance effective method
The thesis state mathematical method effective could set list instruction able followed human clerk paper pencil long necessary without ingenuity insight
Machines computed continuous value became known kind
They used machinery represented continuous numeric quantity like angle shaft rotation difference electrical potential
Digital machinery contrast analog able render state numeric value store individual digit
Digital machinery used difference engine relay invention faster memory device
The phrase gradually gave way late onset electronic digital machinery became common
These computer able perform calculation performed previous human clerk
Since value stored digital machine bound physical property like analog device logical computer based digital equipment able anything could described purely mechanical
The theoretical created hypothetical device theorized order study property hardware
often regarded one first pioneer computing
Beginning Babbage vision mechanically computing number table
Putting reality Babbage designed calculator compute number decimal point long
Continuing success idea Babbage worked develop machine could compute number decimal place
By Babbage devised plan develop machine could use punched card perform arithmetical operation
The machine would store number memory unit would form sequential control
This mean one operation would carried another way machine would produce answer fail
This machine known Analytical Engine first true representation modern computer
Augusta Ada Byron credited pioneer computer programming regarded mathematical genius result mathematically heavy tutoring regimen mother assigned young girl
Lovelace began working Charles Babbage assistant Babbage working Analytical Engine first mechanical computer
During work Babbage Ada Lovelace became designer first computer algorithm ability compute
Moreover Lovelace work Babbage resulted prediction future computer perform mathematical calculation also manipulate symbol mathematical
While never able see result work Analytical Engine created lifetime effort later year beginning go unnoticed
The mathematical foundation modern computer science began laid
In theorem showed limit could proved disproved within
This led work GÃ¶del others define describe formal system including concept
In Alan Turing independently also together introduced formalization limit computed purely mechanical model computing
This became hypothesis nature mechanical calculation device electronic computer
The thesis claim calculation possible performed algorithm running computer provided sufficient time storage space available
In also published seminal work abstract digital computing machine simply referred
This machine invented principle modern computer birthplace concept almost modern day computer use
These hypothetical machine designed formally determine mathematically computed taking account limitation computing ability
If Turing machine complete task considered Turing computable commonly Turing complete
The physicist described view fundamental importance Turing paper letter I know von Neumann well aware fundamental importance Turing paper Von Neumann introduced paper urging I studied care
Many people acclaimed von Neumann father computer modern sense term I sure would never made mistake
He might well called midwife perhaps firmly emphasized others I sure fundamental conception owing Turing Up electrical engineer able build electronic circuit solve mathematical logic problem manner lacking theoretical rigor
This changed engineer Akira Nakashima
From Nakashima published series paper showing discovered independently unaware work describe operation switching circuit
This concept utilizing property electrical switch logic basic concept underlies electronic
Switching circuit theory provided mathematical foundation tool design almost area modern technology
Nakashima work later cited elaborated seminal master thesis
While taking undergraduate philosophy class Shannon exposed work recognized could used arrange electromechanical relay used telephone routing switch solve logic problem
His thesis became foundation practical digital circuit design became widely known among electrical engineering community World War II
In developed world first functional computer
In shown principle
Zuse also developed computing machine considered first computer
He founded one earliest computer business producing became world first commercial computer
In designed first
In completed world first general purpose electronic digital computer also ran stored program like almost modern computer
The influence Turing seminal paper contribution project crucial successful development
In Britain completed small scale programmable computer based Turing philosophy
With operating speed MHz Pilot Model ACE time fastest computer world
Turing design much common today architecture called memory roughly capacity early computer enormous standard day
Had Turing ACE built planned full would different league early computer
went found field paper titled applied problem best encode information sender want transmit
This work one theoretical foundation many area study including
From experiment system interpreted radar image detect enemy plane coined term Greek word steersman
He published Cybernetics influenced
Wiener also compared computing machinery device cognitive similarity analysis brain wave
The first actual computer bug
It stuck relay Harvard Mark II
While invention term often erroneously attributed future rear admiral Navy supposedly logged bug September account conflict least detail
According account actual date September operator filed along insect notation First actual case bug found see detail
In model computer architecture introduced became known
Since von Neumann model provided uniformity subsequent computer design
The von Neumann architecture considered innovative introduced idea allowing machine instruction data share memory space
The von Neumann model composed three major part arithmetic logic unit ALU memory instruction processing unit IPU
In von Neumann machine design IPU pass address memory memory turn routed either back IPU instruction fetched ALU data fetched
Von Neumann machine design us RISC Reduced instruction set computing architecture mean instruction set us total instruction perform task
This contrast CISC instruction set instruction choose
With von Neumann architecture main memory along accumulator register hold result logical operation two memory addressed
Operations carried simple arithmetic performed ALU include addition subtraction multiplication division conditional branch commonly seen statement loop
The branch serve statement logical move different component machine move accumulator memory vice versa
Von Neumann architecture accepts fraction instruction data type
Finally von Neumann architecture simple one register management also simple
The architecture us set seven register manipulate interpret fetched data instruction
These register include IR instruction register IBR instruction buffer register MQ multiplier quotient register MAR memory address register MDR memory data register
The architecture also us program counter PC keep track program machine

A blog
We dedicated giving every student every school opportunity learn computer programming
Not day go I read article speech need invest STEM education invest future student national competitiveness etc
Every time I hear STEM Science Technology Engineering Math I wish could focus conversation computer science
Why
Because three reason I explain See chart
Computer science STEM field job student
The data come government comparing job data projection Bureau Labor Statistics student data National Science Foundation
In chart computer science categorized alongside mathematics separated distinction would even greater favor CS
Now look computer science see field annual job growth almost rate student graduating bachelor degree
Computing job growing every state every industry
show job software computing company core driver recovery
And picture show fraction growth opportunity
Across field STEM computer science occupation top highest demand list lowest unemployment rate across field
Computer science impacting everything banking retail manufacturing entertainment across every industry country enough computer scientist fill open job
Google diversity gap workforce
Both tell similar story tech company hire men woman
For year author STEM problem talk fixing gender gap STEM addressing education pipeline student STEM field
If ask parent student STEM mostly know
By contrast far people familiar term like biology chemistry
I ran Meanwhile huge disconnect meaning STEM depending audience
When politician businessmen leader talk importance STEM mostly referring new stuff new technology innovation advancement invention driving growth national competitiveness
But STEM translated practice public education system translate topic already taught today school algebra geometry calculus biology chemistry physic
One hundred percent US public school teach math science
But percent NOT teach computer science encouraged teach STEM increase funding STEM turn course already teach
I run nonprofit called focused bringing computer science school offering free curriculum support school want add course option
The biggest obstacle work enough school district administrator feel need teach computer science
They need hear parent important
If high school parent ask school district offer computer science proper course alongside algebra biology chemistry
Don ask technology computer STEM even coding
Ask computer science

She year experience staffing industry writing blog post sample resume providing sage career advice IT professional Dice Community since
Leslie bachelor degree English Journalism University Southern California
Computer science degree come common misconception often discourages student pursuing degree They turn isolated code cruncher
That really case
Computer science graduate qualify However ensure right mix skill experience get one homework decide career path selecting technical specialty program
The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue University
Purdue Computer Science department taken step make student aware versatility CS degree
His undergraduate opportunity explore various career select educational track suit preference
Computer science major take course freshman year explains various career option actually day explains Dunsmore
They also opportunity mix corporate partner hear different job opportunity select broad array educational track everything graphic security may require le math If interested CS consider five thing James Green said This article seems discourage people getting computer science degree
It sound like youth get Business degree minor computer science
I personally looking going back school getting second master Computational Finance perhaps Medical School
Either way I recommend anyone major Computer Science dead end profession
James Billy said would suggest major something business oriented minor computer science would hold stronger presence
DudeWithATattoo said Both actually business technical
For young college graduate ultimately want rewarding career IT start technical minor business major want
But make sure least get something technical
From IT Systems Comp
Eng
Doesn learn code business logic either way
Once get chance learn business world organization
Because become valuable
If want code life integrator fine cry making lot money like guy unless make hot killer app go solo It want life really
If want make ungodly amount
From Sales Sales Engineers even IT Strategists sale role make crap load money
hoodle said actually c dead end
one employable degree possible earn
massive shortage software engineer silicon valley pay enormous many perk government
field also growing faster almost field
Minion said I recommend CS anyone point
Development outsourced India Australia Africa
System Administration moving cloud say lot server large building server actual cloud
Three Sys admins using SCOM manage ton server
Project Management safe moment dev team I work India
Employers expect everything interview
Do know Java C Ruby Rails
What Redhat Linux Windows given
Did I mention Cisco
Yes want well
I read article degree certification real answer
People degree vote degree course people certz vote certz
It really depends position
A CS degree never beat CCIE I never met anyone cert CS degree make rounded individual
I talking circle
Robc said Not sure get idea job outsourced Australia
Australian wage similar US salary I would surprised case
Do example
Tech Recriter said From experience tech recruiter opinion I hard data support
Companies asking programmer almost want skill two three people
networking cert seem desired particularly cisco Linux cert use well admins
If developing software quality school degree generally looked conjunction tough interview analysis coding sample test particularly high paying job
It look like future people earning lot money niche section like data science machine learning math based quantitative application finance business need math based modeling
Sales engineer security engineer earn pretty good money experienced good
Also people tend forget people generally earn code general business knowledge well create solution increase efficiency also usually save labor
The scary thing company need skilled worker generate output many worker get efficient however trying stop progress efficiency innovation bad
lolno said Sounds like experuence company company
said Interesting mentioned outsourcing India craze within past year however lot company outsourced India year ago decided bring tech department right back state especially software engineering simply QUALITY
Sometimes cheaper always actually time get pay different
You get quality
I work tech industry heard time
Also outsourcing
since
The reliability assertion bit questionable
Especially good company either outsource simply bring back home
Some company choose outsource tech specific company tend keep stuff house
Totally agree employer expecting everything interview
totally true
Joe said Computer Science good degree
I related degree computer engineering
Engineers take math course Engineer title make marketable government industry
I worried job going overseas year ago lot news around I stuck
Unemployment comp
engineer percent I job waiting I got State school
I went middling grad school got master paid employer saving I earning paycheck
Now metropolitan area I want live new grad start unemployment hang percent
If I want go back MBA employer pay
It true Computer Science theoretical engineering technical school teach coding
It also true Computer Science geared toward research
And programmer without even getting collage degree
However experience best people bachelor computer attitude learn throughout career
Bite bullet keep mind money make get
Six year seems really long
I mine I took summer class I knew every semester costing wage
Stephen said CS way dead
I know picked smart phone time recently take one tap open app store see
Programming especially mobile developer demand
As computer get easier use le people want learn actually program
LOL said Wow I really hope love humanity read James Green post smart enough realize ridiculous statement CS dead end profession
Are mental
We start anywhere year programming
Just YOU get CS degree YOU understand CS mean create false information
Again anyone interested CS Majors make almost money degree unless Doctor another engineering field
Shantal said To Trinity first let extend kudos accurate assessment
I personally bit tired hearing phrase computer guy graphic guy
Although woman greatly represented IT field one I met tend collectively functioning genius level
Because sometimes represent threat male alliance may prevailing given company
In instance I woman least male developer design selected proceed project
After occurred many refused collaborate project
This got hand I left position one offered higher salary I worked female le ego centered far collaborative
Instead reworking bug every week closed project moved new one
Our client thrilled offered u substantial bonus within year
dom said Way stick mike andrew said deadend
sought degree employer
Marija Milic said Hi James I somebody received BA Business ago taken time child returning workforce
I want go back school considering Master CS would recommend
I curious
said Yes Computer Science dead end
call dead end profession one top growing job market field
Software engineer system administrator mobile app developer system engineer etc
job market HIGHEST paid MOST job job job market continues grow people
Computer scientist always needed going absolutely NO shortage highly skilled computer guaranteed job upon graduation
Forbes rate computer science degree get job offer Computer Science Economics Accounting Engineering Everywhere look computer science hottest degree creates broadest range skill set could
Don ridiculous
James Green said One thing get Master degree Computer Science unless going get Phd research University professor
James said This I agree Your
sounded like someone intelligent enough complete computer science degree understand field opportunity
Proud Paulbot said I agree university need teach far le theory far hard skill
That biggest beef degree
I learned bunch obscure trivia would served well I intended make money competing Jeopardy The focus hard practical skill thing employer list job ad
But job require little matter
Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
In fact I hedge guess overwhelming majority graduate even kid
Parents agree support adult child long tell need get paying job
Of course problem every industry right tech
position vanished partly baby boomer afford retire probably going hold onto job die
The reason I got gig I I adult student worked year copywriter
Kids whose work experience involves mall SOL unless I guess decide become restaurant retail manager
richie said teaching applied skill job university school certification
university built research theory
scruffNstuff said According survey linked Computer Engineering Applied Math CS Stats top paying degree beaten engineering
Business

Shoot apparently PHILOSOPHY major make much
Payscale corresponding profession indicates similar figure median
CS Business I found article poorly researched uninformative inconclusive
I far expert subject number successful aquaintances business IT figure happily employed moving say differently
One would swear MBA
The wisdom differentiate within CS
For currently management oriented education bat MAY gotten sooner would anyone entering education recently
He got Network Support work experience manages entire IT department
He company shortage applicant shortage qualified applicant multiple position
The key usually software development
They would little trouble staffing someone sale marketing administration whatever liberal art teach would even opening
The right server support DBM
Much harder find
To tech company fact IT Dept
small Speaking broadly job demand bls article certain outlook far average estimating even growth rate
average James said Do major Computer Science unless plan going get Phd research teach University
The best advise article give Major field minor Computer Science
James Proud Paulbot said I agree
At first I regretted going college
Now I come realize attending college mistake attending college
I gotten nice business I could continue working
I MBA program totally online reason since I chained class schedule I able work two job
atconway said I disagree last comment
As Senior Software Engineer CS degree last year realm I say business booming
Every day million line code written around world guess
That code need maintained enhanced supported
Of course become obsolete naturally part almost everything interact today technology speaking software component
And offshoring
Yes still occurs I believe going rubber band phase
While wildly popular many company seen inadequate delivered software much time still took many developer US make right I think threat present say textile worker year ago
Many people becoming consumer technology rather lending hand create real need software engineer
Need proof
Search site
As junior developer begin become seasoned job market compensation increase greatly
My advice
Be team player try hone skill
stick grow skill
It fantastic career pursue vantage point outlook tremendous
Tom Marks said The problem little junior developer position career transitioned entry level developer
Jim said I disagree
Universities NOT job training center
They institution higher learning concentration research
They teach much theory computer science program possible theoretical foundation allows learn practical application easily
I saying every computer science student forced read Principia Mathematica solid foundation ACM curriculum really best thing computer scientist
Now guy doubt relevance computer science degree job market
That different claim
I agree job computer scientist even software engineer day
A combination business management skill computer science probably better bet current economic climate
I found computer science degree well known high ranking school quite useful combination discipline
Law case
Much software development moving offshore
Tornado said My advise tell people master degree Computer Science consider major instead Computer Science eric said RE Not everyone afford work unpaid internship year end
No tech company I worked last year unpaid internship
Back I interned Tandem paid roughly
It bound gone since
My current company post opening mostly intern recent college graduate senior developer
The reason intern recent college grad relatively low cost investment future
Senior developer really good always demand
My observation position SOL job market
When studying CS learn application theory
If learn one far le marketable career likely stall
For example someone technically code understand theory behind reach limit ability quickly
These people eventually get replaced difficulty finding new job ability match perceived price tag come someone experience level
Those job filled new college grad locally overseas
Either way lower price
If stall slowly given senior level work pay level
Eventually pay catch work level slowly
Is fair
Of course
It I seen
When studying whether CS subject learn learn learn
I mean figure best way learn
For example others reading book
This allow learn faster put self position succeed
This give advantage people figured
Also learn think
Not one way every way
See thing different point view
Another thing figured give edge
Lastly get first job serious work
Goofing easy tech industry noticed
This come horrible movie I saw recently great theme live Adapt Innovate Overcome Dennis said After diploma Computer Science specialisation student major minor good job prospect modern world today
kalirajan said instruction useful preparing Gabriella said Well answer question
Thanks comment people
Your input helped article
JJ said Reading comment made clear majority people made comment either tried major computer science failed completed computer science degree also failed make good living
I think make good life computer science got degree love building software technology
They DID NOT money passionate money came bonus
Schools DO NOT make become good software engineer YOU make become great passionately using tool resource University provides
A degree combination degree nothing primary motivation getting one money
Computer Science IS NOT anyone major money
If find pulling hair advanced math data structure algorithm assembler school teach assembler
Its anyone money
Those posted telling people major probably make computer science failed make anything heart
It like saying Not everyone FIT United States Marine try eventually run steam collapse HEART
Proud Paulbot said I admit
I took I told tech job money
I passion anything except making money
That result struggle make entire life
I run parent check I trouble
I homeless period time I year old
I take whatever job I could get whether I liked whether I hated much consumed
The notion loving one work alien Internet would someone lived
So yeah I looking way La Vida Loca
If situation would looking get
I actually enjoyed advanced math class
The advanced CIS class much
I looked way I looked godawful job something I needed endure make money
My graduating GPA fantastic cellar either
Maybe I would never World Greatest Programmer I said country Depression I could found SOME sort job degree
Even technical writing I enjoy writing experience copywriter even something really like paralegal work
And would okay
I know realistic goal I still hoping I find way La Vida Loca II Electric Boogaloo
Get Rich Die Tryin
LadyAngel said Dude I place similar lifestory
Wondering I take loan go school
How dig yoruself hole pit hell get top
Email sometime
Lets talk
cyril said still STUDENT CS AND would like thing wch John said I largely agree
I PhD CIS I never academic I developer year involved exclusively Linux open source since Linux began year ago
I get PhD money prestige thank goodness since I neither
Not even job currently I keep getting replaced intern I train job
I thought I might learn challenging thing OSes development tool like compiler device driver etc
And I learn I done thing
But many job complex skill especially I
Truthfully employer believe need someone like long term hard argue perception
I never taken programming language class though I taught programming language informally even past professor
And I estimate I written line code life
And indeed I think programming language need taught computer science grad student I think undergrad need taught computer science
Anyone developing software opinion need strong background computer science strong background mathematics especially number theory formal logic
There result psychology known effect
It speaks rule IT day people head believe otherwise
And I thinking programmer even programmer first foremost
If I ever told HR person ask technical question give technical answer interview seem care date resume I gon na scream
Yes job market CS professional terrible useful
It understand would useful
What I see instead like TV commercial guy undershirt sitting kitchen table butter knife ready surgery doctor phone asking doctor next
Put doctor response
The market learned hire good developer short term le capable maintenance programmer longer term good people seen expensive fact economics suggests opposite
In worst case people barely even capable maintenance work fixing code write called upon development work usually end failure although software understand sunk cost failure take way long work
There also general perception particular programming language augment skill programmer magical fashion make using le skilled people happened use long time good idea generally experience specific tool product desirable generally diversely experienced person better choice
Few understand much law instrument speaks kind perception
In younger day I told difference year experience year experience Those tasked tech hiring would well task saying heart
Even way tech hiring done perfect would still effect information technology devalues labor labor market general deal
But perfect even close
The way tech hiring done far harm good
A death spiral effect
Time industry wake smell coffee
But I one holding breath
John Doe said John I comp sci grad tell truth comment hit nail head
I also looking going back something totally unrelated computer even removed technology together
something said post though raise eye brow I would love discus time
email Drop line could
Deepak said Not good
Bill said If want work go software engineering degree
Learn latest development methodology software written industry
Combine process abiltiy write code marc said As older student returned get BSCS I tell bad idea
Yes I love code like math
The problem place older person welcome support truly job
I several position hired lure move development find career black hole
To add insult injury previous profession look degree sign I move first chance
To finish degree full time student required student loan tune cheap compared without selfless spouse help
Before write obvious bitterness someone second rate degree substandard GPA program ABET certification GPA I top class bad
In graduating class several student GPAs receive one job offer forced I take support job really even require GED
Companies completely unwilling invest even risk anything development
I taught java native try get past recruiter without experience resume
To people say anyone write code need educated people science I say go hell
There entry level job century jerk selling training disguised placement
Until profession get organized I would recommend anyone get
FogAndMist said Computer field like train anyone get
No strict Computer Science degree required
If bachelor degree like Math Civil Eng Mechanical Doctors MBA Finance Construction Management folk learn book learn tool like Business Intelligence SQL ETL tool C Java Ajax etc join IT within year learning tool
Ask IT firm IT worker core Computer Science graduate
In past saw IT guy work scheduler handling SQL server stuff
Just understanding business logic skill little bit expertise language required
Now asking question Core Computer Science graduate yr Computer Science yr MS Computer Science investing thousand dollar get CS degree training certification book time
Now layoff fired CS degree get job Civil Mechanical Electrical Environmental Traffic Electronics engineering department
Ans apply Cause degree
Angelizer said I know people talking
I BS Computer Science
I working company almost year since graduation
Money good I love job
If considering another major I pretty sure heart intelligence software developer
Chris said I agree ANGELIZER I master CS never problem finding job
DudeWithATattoo said Number good point
However everyone field
And solely incompetence
For CS opened door quickly also opened dose reality college give head
The people
It type culture employee need consider
Me another year job finding bit unhappy seem fit
I sure case I honest I terribly outgoing normal
What mean I find pleasure talking code day dressing like McLovin
I found talking business unit IT department
Don get wrong everyone like majority nerdy
Sure I code lead project driving nut guy similarity
Sorry weird
I CS plan I wanted prove everyone location I could taunt bash
But towards middle I liking major
It pretty cool learn something I always curious
But I give much thought I saw strange people class never realizing I would work
It hit
Anyway I working business side
The majority people business degree one thing common They IT
And real eye opener They actually make ton money programmer engineer
Sales make incredible amount money commission
Average salary programmer like
Business manager
Sales
And sale guy go become product manager making business manager
Programmers pretty much stay level
But I also learned They really care getting lot money
They care making cool stuff
Maybe separate
But I assuming
I sure ALL programmer like
Oh well
Roshaun said people sure know crush people getting good job money
People choose career path passionate passionate career obviously choose wrong path
quite programmer commented saying problem finding job
ignore negative comment continue seek heart desire great
CorporateHate said ALL money friend
Life short
TR said When pay basic talking minimal standard living fancy car vacation jewelry even nice DOES become money
Ever get sick money see doctor
Ever utility turned afford pay
Ever collector harassing night day
Those type issue I talking Gee I wish I could afford new iPhone Gee I afford pay electric Possibly even worse Gee I pay student loan punished harshly rapist murderer fraudsters run Ponzi scheme
I lived La Vida Loca many year
I become passionate one thing MAKING MONEY
I would think Greed Good society would considered positive thing
I come believe I simply honest people
lolno said I offer guaranteed employment three year starting year moving two year
You looking wrong place get job support c degree
That know budget
Stop cry make obscene amount money stop acting like need survive
You dont
year well poverty
said Computer science realy intresting feed would advice anyone go computer science also get mba degree co wil give u edge job market computer science student plan get mba graduating TR said I going complete MBA next spring
Unfortunately I see degree opening door degree shame I enjoyed business class far CIS class I like math
RADI said I graduated uni field computer science looking forward master
However I idea master I background please let know recommendation
thx said
Code
Write code
Marc Herman said I majoring Finance really enjoying class
I also decided minor CS found liking intro class well
Does anybody know CS minor worth effort looking job
Rita said Definitely major
Most CFO IT department
said Actually CTO CIO IT
unless super small company afford employ CTO IT department large enough
Ben said Wow someone pointed article asking computer science advice comment article quite possibly worst piece advice I ever seen
I even sure anyone computer science degree
I graduated CS Math degree worked large company since
CS major typically work IT department CIS major Business Administration degree might Computer Science degree
As Computer Science major typically development whether startup established company choice
The unemployment rate someone CS degree one lowest nation even development job
When team looking hire college hire start hunting student January fall graduate time gradation come around CS major already found job
I boat I graduated college I offer letter hand month I graduated
If someone looking going Computer Science word warning make sure understand many people familiar CS blur line software development working IT department company
Chris said Good god yes
You tell educated folk
I one year away graduation BS Computer Science even smaller university company beating door trying hire CS grad
They campus time semester
The job
My university offer several Computer Science degree one real computer science degree
They offer Software Engineering Computer Information Systems Information Technology soon offer another dumbed CS degree
Personally I started SE major moved CS I found SE nothing business degree CS class thrown fill curriculum
CS NOT IT
It CS difficult degree acquire
Anyone get specialization I mentioned
That also mean employer view specialization le favorably
I know first hand everyone
The hard CS course weed dedicated quickly
My Data Structures course lost half enrolled start semester
There someone keep regurgitating degree
CIS joke degree really complement Math
Of course nobody going hire technical field
Math great degree every CS major spent hour hour challenging project banging head desk Segmentation Fault burned retina way qualified
I know math degree qualifies looking CS job outclassed
Plain simple
CS major fantastic field I several prospect already junior
If passionate work put time make
I attending big university famed CS curriculum either
But I work hard I love work
Notice major news publication place CS top degree
It stay way people
Notice also find work blame economy lack job degree outsourcing full moon etc
They never talk never think WHY find work
They look blame someone else
said First CIS degree completely different computer science degree
Also CS business CIS combined The comment true comment seem coming people know talking
CS almost always top salary statistic
Business CIS even get top Nightcrawler said
Business major among top earner country
Of course data probably skewed due fact many go work finance
If took finance people equation salary would lower
My undergrad degree
Not CS CIS perhaps part problem
I could obtain type work degree even though I willing work minimum wage
The problem I encountered simply truly tech job
It resume
It It way I interviewed
I certain thing problem I would applying job getting turned
I find tech job apply
An employer I never applied idea I even exist going turned something I
When I applied secretarial clerical job one I found I qualified employer thought I overqualified would bored understand value education
You know lot people claim math worthless never use algebra daily life
I encountered among hiring party We use calculus value I rebuttal though I email infamous Power Pi scene Person Interest
Granted people get job people absolutely brilliant sit replicate MS Word earn lot money
That I believe
Unfortunately I one people
I would required job training mentoring learning environment
They exist
I give tech go different direction
It difficult
It hard spend five year life studying something find work field
When I looking I got lot advice people happy read riot act enumerate thing I allegedly wrong nobody wanted offer idea workable solution
FINALLY week I talked someone willing mentor tech give realistic advice I make skill education
Not
said Engineering CS still highest paid major
Some company filtering software allows certain number resume system
They look certain keywords resume
Why rather CS
Anyways I wish good luck hopefully find good job Nightcrawler said I originally going math
I thought adding CIS would make employable
I applied perhaps six tech job year half
I doubt engineering CIS get job field studied
That problem
In order obtain job absolutely
You able sit write version Microsoft Word build version including graphic
I I qualify tech job
What I would like see statistic regarding percentage computer science major working tech job job require type degree
tania said There seems confusion
CS Computer Science IS NOT CIS Computer Information Systems
Computer Scientists generally work seek employment tech department
The degree one low unemployment rate highly paid big difference
A true computer science graduate likely fare better computer information system grad
I wish luck marketing though
said You applied six tech
job year half
No wonder job
A average person degree applies job receive call back
If stopped trying hard get job
Ange said I Bachelor Computer Science UCDavis two offer big company right school
Unfortunately I left something else awhile looking get back
I love programming good love
Right I looking job several month promise
I older person much real world experience huge employment gap last time I development job
I taking several course get Software Test also prospect
I plan get Masters CS way get back
Any advise I get Masters keep looking job
Anonymous said Look intern junior developer opening
Companies always looking apprentice darkknight said I started college late
Having pay pocket taken almost twice time complete degree due working full time dealing responsibility adult life
Currently job would consider career black I get write code mostly maintenance fixing code written someone else opportunity career advancement department
exactly predecessor left I graduating month Bachelor Business minor CS
I couple Oracle certification
I saving going right grad school Master CS
To currently working CS age issue looking new work
I
Or combination credential actual work experience enough find right career position
Or I even bother Master CS since I already industry certification
said I associate degree computer science university Phoenix currently I pursuing bachelor degree concentration
currently I also employed supply clerk law firm since high school supply clerk
Everytime time sought transfer IT department
I turned
From hardware help desk position told qualified even freelance experience degree
My best bet continue degree learn much I
And begin seek opportunity
No hope place employment
And real
Jeffrey said I think great career
without computer science degree
I recommend anyone major
You could situation want intern take job much qualification first job offer college good college
By time get real technical job forgotten coursework
Here five reason major computer science
It take long obtain
The cost living alone year justify

job
require
There reason spend money time job someone else certificate Associate degree training
Many software engineering job require bachelor degree
I disagree article
If want pursue career software engineering complete rigorous coursework math programming Many software engineer never including famous people started software company
Some teacher incentive advertise program make student think valuable really

Several student cheat dishonesty stay rest life
Even ethical intelligent student may pressured
Google cheating computer science
It stressful serious personality issue student teacher
Not student report difficult people deal
You may well work job try transfer something related
try intern
article right money

The coursework theoretical practical many marketable skill obtained computer science program
The article say The gap classroom workplace problem acknowledges
Dunsmore associate professor Computer Science chair College Science Undergraduate Education Policy Curriculum Committee Purdue Majoring business minor computer science probably better idea acquiring marketable skill
The article mention fact
said It sad see kind thing
This might something I regret life
I go CS I thought would great prospect year I barely code taught Math useless theory
It crushing see CS graduate unemployed among subject
Lord I done
Ben said getting information CS unemployed among subject
I seen datapoints suggest CS one degree highest unemployment I mentioned actually quite opposite
First started third year college I expect programming ability college graduate discouraged
But start third year I would recommend looking summer internship sooner better
Most college career fair time place employment information internship
It internship get lot hand experience development reason find internship another possibility would participate OpenSource community take look lot project help
What trying get would increase programming skill
When I looking hiring college hire I always looking individual took initiative get internship participate OpenSource
Anonymous said On contrary liberal art major unemployed plus make WAAAY le CS
I think single employer care person think art history
Graduating CS blessing due high demand
The math theory reason
There many company looking software web developer
Try harder
said You guy negative
If monetary seeking degree clearly taken medical route computer science science degree high payout would foolish
Many already mentioned seek love loved IT realm complaining I mean acquired knowledge established connection maybe socialized
Nevertheless I see failure acquisition gratification
Now I changing degree psychology liberal right
Anonymous said Who program machine collect data
Who develops hospital database medical profession get job hosptial
Who program MCUs control machine collect data ultrasound medical device measure heart pulse blood pressure
A CS guy
ann said I Bsc CS final year want know job oriented course c Trinity said It difficult find female area men wall u
cold icing
If find another female made help
That I
Trinity said I female software engineer
I BS information system database minor math minor computer science
I class left degree Computer Science
I repeat
I AM female software engineer
I learned program I sweet
I know guy I guy
Keep mind woman computer scientist woman programmer read blog forum talk like work place discriminatory
If talk like work like talk I would record document personal lawsuit
You guy talk like think guy field
That sort tell job make delusional dreamer
I never worked office female programmer planet
emilov said I worked major IT company without female
There woman management support release management Database support none app development
Trinity said Hey girl
I took digital electronics class I used Karnaugh mapping chip designed thermostat using Boolean algebra binary math
It called opposite rule
You think nothing wrong saying guy swap opposite understand feel excluded
That sound u
Trinity said We men please quit using term guy talking others
I female happen good linear algebra matrix
I best programmer class much professor used example slide show
This ridiculous men treat u invisible smart
Jasmine said Trinity forgive might I say
arent Guys refer men AND woman
Just like word men MAN refer woman well
If said boy male well might problem really get ur panty place belong
Im sure quite comfy uh check I female well
Over
Trinity said For woman
The CS degree worth
Go
I
Dennis said hello I Dennis
I year old I believe I want career computer science
But I never well school I visual kind guy
Would getting AA CS certification IT give good career
I hard hearing I hydrocephalus last thing I want happen let disability
I know I stupid I smartest bunch
I always loved front computer I young one wanted hang someone different I would thrilled anything computer enough life
What I want know getting AA CS good way go
said With positive attitude like yeah good idea
The hardest aspect CS learning problem solve
How break simple idea transfer finally understood took lot restless night
You able learn class array problem check making decision
said Things Learn About Computer Science Degrees said Someone made comment earlier year experience v year repeated time
It scary many latter group I run
Many developer investing learn new thing
A lot field require continuing education
Software development programming one therefore invest education
Are good design pattern
No
learn
Do know certain algorithm perform well others given problem
No
learn
So get degree never ever stop learning
Push learning new thing apply job
sania said right confused CS degree
I interest IT business clue degree choose
I want something businessy time something related computer people please suggest degree start first major minor
sania said want go business career course preferable MBA said I would opt Information Management path probably useful
Good luck
Anonymous said Go CIS computer information system
You able study business much coding
Anonymous said I CS guy recent graduate
And one misconception I hate CS computer science people get mistaken CIS computer information system guy
CS CIS NOT damn degree
Let repeat CS CIS CS people work software development embedded system computer architecture web application
They TRUE coder even engineer term embedded system
CIS people connect setup router switch computer together form network
CS also far stepper learning curve CIS
CS people required take year Calculus physic whereas CIS required go far College Algebra
Not many CIS people would survive CS class due project networking many bug taking engineering class calculus
Garillo said I IT graduate believe CS better love world
Anyways suggest read dogmatic
Thanks comment anyways
Basavaraj said I studing BE COMPUTER SCIENCE degree want take MBA PG course help
Andrew said I think article service towards reality computer science degree especially towards end
To give background I always good computer decide get degree
Currently I junior attending UCF I say need take lot math
Many fellow classmate lost sleep I believe anyone stay committed
It also determine degree
Calculus difficult first like math course problem set If good handle trig always help Is degree worth
Everyone I spoke graduated say yes
So I saying discouraging others I saying realistic decide path
Cheers
tom said Hello everybody
The name Tom I actually getting ready throw CS degree Now majority high school year spent totally ignoring class filling lung MJ booze learning love take care apartment let alone Trust tell I probably worst candidate succeed field thats actually probably true fact
I terrible math I actually process making within month span school start also spending hour day learning code multiple resource online offer structured Java Ruby Python course work progress
I know much current hiring trend related industry internet decides throw know truly believe something waste time business worth totally right
IT WAS FOR YOU A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR factor everyone else like anything perception reality know much business point know successful anything requires want learn see guy seem made decision upon degree primary focus earn learn conclusion study promise fulfilling career without effort people making good money anywhere usually top updated frequently new tool new method new platform new idea better perform job like anything position never promised always someone wanting deliver better product give edge I trying say attitude work ethic set aside degree majority post Im seeing listed regarding CS bad major seem coming never really applied fullest extent otherwise would reason post downer post
The reality want something bad enough reason attain position salary reason feel incapable achieving greatness one answer question bid anyone best luck achieving dream never stop learning
I truly excited view world totally different way interact technology infinite level Sandra said Hi
recently discovered computer science year finished high school
I college anything I total newbie researching could cause highschool day type career talked filming car engineering called car mechanic
And politics
I also never work even tried mainly cause teacher sucked keeping focused lesson well subject overall favorite helped one found know caught complete interest trouble finding school south california comp
science
And grade likely struggle
Any advice

So ask think find job field
To add another point let u say job went overseas travel job taken
India country yes
In second year I want intern middle east
So study CS passionate enjoy
reagan said Yes want actually agree Mohamed Ali CS best I love computing never discouraged
Aaron said I fourth year I transfer student I got internship computer science lot math theory I far know one language I might stay another year take class I want take graduation plus always master degree GRE damn hard need straight A B stay master everyone say worth I know
Two friend software developer without going school get internship job without I I feel like I dead end
Entry level job really difficult find
Bluesy said Hi Aaron Check mindteck
I way affiliated company give training find job developer

For MIT senior Shannon Kao expert storytelling essential even especially come coding
The computer science major relies narrative everywhere science fiction writing research educational computer game MIT Media Lab stem childhood replete book
Kao grew Michigan China mother school librarian exposed two younger brother early age everything picture book hefty novel
Instead hanging would grab book sit living room read Kao say laugh
After two semester organic chemistry doused interest medical school Kao stumbled course Introduction Electrical Engineering Computer Science immediately saw computer science way use love math build something tangible interactive
The summer freshman year took research position Affective Computing Group Media Lab worked free app called StoryScape
The program geared toward family developmentally challenged child let user drag drop animated character illustration gallery Kao helped build onto page user write original story share story others
The animated character react stimulus user environment loud noise shaking phone tablet app installed
Working StoryScape graphic gallery Kao first experience computer science lab first research position MIT biology lab even though little expertise field point new research setting immediately felt natural
It important strong story underneath something rest follow say
Kao since expanded research MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program STEP develops learning technology
For past year worked software developer Daniel Wendel research associate MIT Department Urban Studies Planning project called StarLogo
It teach student computer science background build program modeling decentralized system like traffic jam
StarLogo accessibility inexperienced coder hinge system programming work like virtual LEGO brick To build program rather writing line code using individual symbol number user drag drop block text code graphic certain combination text block create functioning program
The process building modeling program way lot like building story need coherent beginning middle end else function
Kao role develop graphic block code
Blocks make programming intuitive people necessarily background say
Kao helped run several workshop make ongoing improvement StarLogo
STEP invite parent child programming background complete series challenge researcher ask feedback usability
Some biggest issue team encountered interface control zooming scrolling
After workshop back lab Kao colleague whittle away list tweak preparation next workshop set feedback
Kao interest telling story design graphic started mindless doodle class soon grew illustration later learned turn animation using computer science skill bring art life
Looking illustration easy see inspiration come Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki Kao cite Disney film Ratatouille favorite animated movie
I feel like part interest art I constant stream picture book young adult book I would read regardless age I say
I still really enjoy picture Kao also work written narrative As literature editor MIT literary magazine sophomore year responsible vetting incoming submission
For past two year focused writing winning MIT Ilona Karmel Prize Science Fiction
Despite passion art literature Kao occupational focus remains computer science always hobby upbringing guidepost

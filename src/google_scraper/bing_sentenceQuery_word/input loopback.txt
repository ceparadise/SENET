What
Why exist used would I use
The special computer us communicate
It used mainly diagnostics troubleshooting connect server running local machine
When network interface disconnected example port unplugged turned associated communication interface possible even communication computer
The loopback interface represent actual hardware exists application running computer always connect server machine
This important troubleshooting compared looking mirror
The loopback device sometimes explained purely diagnostic tool
But also helpful server offering resource need
For example run web server web document could examine file file
You may able load file browser though active content wo work way someone access normally
So want experience site others best course usually connect server
The loopback interface facilitates
For loopback interface assigned
That represent computer
For purpose though necessary use one IP address
This IP mapped
Thus log via SSH server running machine would use Like network adapter loopback device show output
Its name
One common production diagnostic use Ubuntu perform advanced printer configuration
In web browser go run web server port used configure printing regardless GUI running even running GUI
If try connecting work
However try connect
All address identify computer loopback interface server program decide bind specific IP address
If come Windows background might expect synonym thus able ping connect server forth
That behavior peculiar Windows
The general concept mechanism message signal end loop back started
So way use Ubuntu confused loopback device networking
To mount disk image Ubuntu could run This usually called term occasionally used
This nothing loopback device networking
Pulseaudio sound system provide mechanism connect audio input echoed back
Pulseaudio facilitates
Here correct use term like loop mount also nothing loopback device networking
And nothing loop mount either

What Keyboard
Keyboard set typewriter enable enter data computer
The key computer keyboard got alphanumeric key punctuation key special key
There several type keyboard
For example notebook keyboard PDA stylus Tablet PCs Wireless keyboard Ergonomic keyboard
For notebook keyboard screen CPU
Keyboards laptop notebook computer often shorter travel distance keystroke reduced set key
They may numerical keypad function key may placed location different placement standard keyboard
The layout based Windows design except key crammed available space
There numeric keypad see label key middle keyboard superimposed letter J numeral K
The Fn key lower left used activate particular option used combination function key top keyboard
PDA Stylus PDA stylus touch type keyboard
That keyboard needed extensive typing person use fold keyboard
The keyboard room usual keyboard yet still compact
Tablet PCs Keyboard Tablet PCs keyboard majority common people world using
It use type data computer
It place number key alphanumeric key punctuation key special key
Wireless Keyboard Wireless Keyboard newest keyboard came year
The keyboard use without wire others function normal keyboard use
Ergonomic Keyboard Ergonomic keyboard computer keyboard designed ergonomic consideration minimize muscle strain host related problem
An ergonomic keyboard may decrease muscle strain reduce risk Carpal Tunnel syndrome clear evidence benefit
After user take time adjust style keyboard keyboard make typing easier faster le awkward
The key separated two three group allowing user type different angle typical straight keyboard
Printer classified type
There impact printer nonimpact printer specialty printer
The example impact printer
Dot matrix printer still commonly used application like cash register demanding high volume application like invoice printing
dot matrix The nonimpact printer Inkjet Laser
For Inkjet operate propelling droplet liquid molten material ink onto almost sized page
They ordinary type computer printer universal consumer
The laser common type computer printer rapidly produce high quality text graphic plain paper
But price expensive others
Inkjet Printer Laser Printer Specialty The specialty printer multifunction plotter thermal printer
A multifunction printer office machine incorporates functionality multiple device one smaller footprint home small business setting provide centralized document production setting
A typical multifunction printer may act combination printer scanner photocopier fax email
Plotter computer printing device printing vector graphic
In past plotter generally used application design though generally replaced conventional printer

Thermal A thermal printer produce printed image selectively heating coated thermo chromic paper thermal paper generally known paper pass thermal print head
The coating turn black area heated producing image
direct thermal printer capable printing black supplementary color often red applying heat two different temperature
Monitor output device resembles television screen us Cathode Ray Tube CRT display information
The monitor associated keyboard guide input character display information keyed
It also display program application output
Like television monitor also available different size
Liquid Crystal Display LCD LCD introduced applied display terminal also
Its advantage like low energy consumption smaller lighter paved way usage portable computer laptop
Video capture one important hardware used multimedia work personal computer
result depend performance capacity component system working together
Video capture analog device like video camera requires special Video capture card convert analog signal digital form compress data
card use various component computer pas frame processor hard disk
For video card must able capture video high rate
For example video card must capable capturing frame per second pixel digital video analog video
To determine setting produce best result project must careful defining parameter
A sound card device attache motherboard enable computer input process deliver sound
The sound card generates sound record sound analog device converting digital mode reproduce sound speaker reconverting analog mode
Creative Lab Sound Blaster standard sound card extent people use name generic term
A video adapter provides extended capability computer term video
The better video adapter better quality picture see
A high quality video adapter must designing multimedia project

In last lesson discussed user input really explain user input obtained
In Python user type one line input time
You use function actually obtain next line input user
The function take argument always give back Here example using get input
The grader automatically specify input program
The next example demonstrates From exercise allow option entering test input
Try following experiment press button
Leave input text box empty
Then press
You get error like For next exercise asked debug program working make work

How I allow traffic sent loopback device lo
What iptables command
By question I presume either default policy chain explicit rule near end chain
Any rule must come
Rule example If want play around testing dump load
I explicitly added see normally matched could match wanted
Also I used ICMP reject response tell rule matched patch easily
If change order rule accept trigger rejection
You also try adding another IP like loopback interface testing IP normal IP want explicitly specify source IP
The chain seldom used loopback interface unless thing tunneling traffic might bind loopback locally
A rule would allow traffic sent lo
But due work need make sure rule come rule would deny matching packet work

So far learned basic programming command
assigning value printing way control statement executed using statement
In lesson introduce sometimes called way make computer thing similar thing
For example word document would done loop
We describe two kind Python loop lesson loop loop
A statement repeat section code long condition true
Here example Here general structure So example keep repeating loop body greater
There another kind loop Python called loop
In many situation either kind loop used one simpler another useful know use
A loop built order easily loop range number see later lesson list data
Here example loop
The general structure numerical loop Here example loop inside another loop
The statement like emergency escape loop cause immediate jump command end loop body
Here example using read line input find one say
The statement make rest loop repeat body next round usually called next iteration
Here visualized example combine

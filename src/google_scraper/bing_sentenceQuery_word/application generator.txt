In special used control behaviour
In fact generator
A generator similar function return array generator parameter called generates sequence value
However instead building array containing value returning generator yield value one time requires le memory allows caller get started processing first value immediately
In short generator function
Generators implemented term expressive construct
Generators also known semicoroutines special case weaker coroutines always yield control back caller passing value back rather specifying coroutine jump see
Generators usually inside loop
The first time generator invocation reached loop iterator created encapsulates state generator routine beginning argument bound corresponding
The generator body executed context iterator special action encountered time value provided action used value invocation expression
The next time generator invocation reached subsequent iteration execution generator body resumed action yet another action encountered
In addition action execution generator body also terminated action time innermost loop enclosing generator invocation terminated
In complicated situation generator may used manually outside loop create iterator used various way
Because generator compute yielded value demand useful representing sequence would expensive impossible compute
These include
infinite sequence live data stream
When eager evaluation desirable primarily sequence finite otherwise evaluation never terminate one either convert use parallel construction creates list instead generator
For example Python generator evaluated list via F evaluates lazily generator sequence evaluates eagerly list
In presence generator loop construct language reduced single loop end loop construct usual loop construct comfortably simulated using suitable generator right way
For example ranged loop like implemented iteration generator Python
Further implemented sending generator using loop
Generators first appeared prominent feature string manipulation language available later version ECMAScript language
In CLU C generator called Ruby
The final standard natively provide generator yet various library implementation exist documented
A yield statement used implement iterators data abstraction
Every expression including loop generator
The language many generator even implement logic semantics using generator mechanism OR done way
Printing square achieved using writing However time custom generator implemented suspend keyword function exactly like yield keyword CLU
As Icon every expression generator
The infinite generator prime serve example It possible introduce generator using macro
The resulting code might aspect different native
generator syntax uncluttered
A good example found
The set macro defined source allow generator defined syntax following example This iterated using Moreover allows applied class provides function
It possible write class defining iterable method iterator method class
For example possible write following program A basic range implementation would look like Perl natively provide generator support provided module us framework
Example usage In generator mechanism founded named
In model everything generator every datum created data constructor generated demand
For example list constructor operator used parenthesization
This us standard adaptor function value agreeable predicate stop requesting new value soon one encountered
The shared storage access used universal mediator Haskell
List comprehension freely used provides several related facility generator
First form work kind producer sequence also value Some sequence implemented imperatively private state variable implemented possibly infinite lazy list
Also new struct definition property specifies used sequence
But directly Racket come generator library traditional generator specification
For example Note Racket core implement powerful continuation feature providing general continuation composable also delimited continuation
Using generator library implemented Racket
The community PHP implemented generator PHP
Details found original
Ruby support generator starting version form Enumerator class
Java standard interface implementing iterators since early day since Java foreach construction make easy loop object provide interface
The collection framework typically provide iterators collection
However generator built language
This mean creating iterators often much trickier language generator especially generation logic complex
Because state must saved restored every time item yielded iterator possible store state local variable use looping routine generator available instead must manually simulated using object field hold local state loop counter
Even simple iterators built way tend significantly bulkier using generator lot
The original example could written An infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written int Iterator Also infinite Fibonacci sequence could also written using Stream interface Or get Iterator BaseStream Stream interface
An example C generator available since C version Both example utilise Generics required
It possible use multiple statement applied sequence iteration In iterators basis loop provides generator via since version
These define sequence lazily evaluated sequential access via list eagerly evaluated sequential access via array eagerly evaluated indexed access via contain code generates value
For example form sequence square number filtering number range number
Generators added version
An example generator In Python generator thought contains frozen
Whenever iterator method called Python resume frozen frame executes normally next statement reached
The generator frame frozen yielded value returned caller
PEP implemented Python add expression allowing generator delegate part operation another generator
Python syntax modeled called generator expression aid creation generator
The following extends example using generator expression compute square countfrom generator function
Harmony feature generator function
An infinite Fibonacci sequence written using function generator The iterators package used purpose

learn share knowledge build career
become popular introduction recursion Computer Science student strong argument persist within nature
For reason many u familiar
They also exist within Computer Science elsewhere surprisingly efficient data structure algorithm based upon sequence
There two main example come mind Is special property number give advantage numerical sequence
Is spatial quality
What possible application could
It seems strange many natural number sequence occur recursive problem I never seen heap
The Fibonacci number sort really nice mathematical property make excellent computer science
Here I sure reason I sure reason main factor
Hope help
another magic see many magic
But Fibonacci number easy calculate also specific name
For example natural number many logic prime within sum computable one produce one one take care One important thing I forgot important impact real life example like wide monitor If algorithm successfully explained simple concise mannor understandable example CS nature better teaching tool could someone come
Fibonacci sequence indeed found everywhere
They useful modeling growth animal population plant cell growth snowflake shape plant shape cryptography course computer science
I heard referred DNA pattern nature
Fibonacci heap already mentioned number child node heap log n
Also subtree starting node child least th fibonacci number
Torrent like protocol use system node supernodes use fibonacci decide new super node needed many subnodes manage
They node management based fibonacci spiral golden ratio
See photo node partitioned one large square smaller one vice versa
See photo I think definitive answer one possibility operation dividing set S two partition one divided one size likely approach many algorithm sometimes numerically described Fibonacci sequence
Let add another data structure Fibonacci tree
They interesting calculation next position tree done mere addition previous node It tie well discussion templatetypedef AVL tree worst fibonacci structure
I also seen buffer extended rather power two case
Just add trivia Fibonacci number describe breading rabbit
You start two rabbit population grows exponentially
Their computation power matrix considered primitive problem Operational Research sort like Prisoner Dilemma primitive problem Game Theory

The underlying theory condition example chicken liver connected dangerous storm military political fortune
Divination still practiced much basis formerly
Unpredictable human involved number usually taken number first investigated context developing sometimes pathological form like
Many randomizing device wheel seem developed use
Electronic gambling equipment use theoretical problem le easy avoid method creating sometimes regulated governmental gaming commission
Modern electronic game contain often one decide outcome trial game
Even modern mechanical reel seem spin screen reel actually spinning entertainment value
They eventually stop exactly machine software decided would stop handle first pulled
It alleged gaming machine software deliberately biased prevent true randomness interest maximizing owner revenue history biased machine gambling industry reason government inspector attempt supervise equipment extended range supervision
Some theft casino used clever modification internal software bias outcome least discovered
Gambling establishment keep close track machine payouts attempt detect alteration
Random draw often used make decision rational fair basis exists making deterministic decision make unpredictable move

Random number us
Many method statistical analysis method require random number
physic computer science require random number
Random number often used test
Statistical practice based founded concept
Many element statistical practice depend randomness via random number
Where random number fail actually random subsequent analysis may suffer
Elements statistical practice depend randomness include choosing representative population examined disguising study participant see simulation
These application useful determining sample example creation
Many physic rely statistical analysis output
For example experiment might collect astronomical source analyze result periodic signal
Since random noise expected appear faint periodic signal embedded statistical analysis required determine likelihood detected signal actually represents genuine signal
Such analysis method requires generation random number
If statistical method extremely sensitive pattern data used search binary large amount data recognizable pattern needed
In many scientific engineering field real phenomenon commonly used
When real phenomenon affected unpredictable process radio noise weather process simulated using random number
Automatic first constructed carry computer simulation physical phenomenon notably simulation
number frequently used statistical event simple example outcome
More complicated situation simulation population genetics behaviour particle
Such simulation method often called method many application computer simulation process
Some speculative project monitor fluctuation randomness number generated many attempt predict scope event near future
The intent prove large scale event happen build pressure affect RNGs
A ubiquitous use unpredictable random number underlies scheme attempt provide security modern communication etc
For example user want use best select random number
The selection must high unpredictability attacker thus increasing attack difficulty
With key low entropy relatively easily guessable attacker security likely compromised
To illustrate imagine simple bit linear congruential number generator type supplied programming language function used source key
There four billion possible value produced generator repeat
A suitably motivated adversary could simply test practical using readily available computer
Even linear congruential RNG used parameter simple exercise linear algebra recover modulus constant b x ax mod given five consecutive value
Even better random number generator used might insecure might guessable producing predictable key reducing security nil
A vulnerability sort famously discovered early release forcing author quickly find source random random number
For application truly random number ideal high quality number necessary truly random number coming unavailable
Truly random number absolutely required assured theoretical security provided provably unbreakable algorithm
Furthermore random sequence reused must never become available attacker implies continuously operable generator
See example happens requirement violated using pad
For cryptographic purpose one normally assumes upper limit work adversary usually limit astronomically sized
If one number generator whose output sufficiently difficult predict one generate true random number use initial value seed use number generator produce number use cryptographic application
Such random number generator called several implemented example device available Unixes design server truerand
As cryptographic software subtle issue beyond discussed care certainly indicated actual practice
In case sometimes impossible avoid need true random number generator
Since requirement cryptography high entropy published random sequence poor choice sequence digit even
All available enterprising attacker
Put another way cryptography random bit stream need random also secret hence unpredictable
Public source random value random value computed publicly observable phenomenon weather sport game result stock price almost never cryptographically acceptable
Their use may tempting reality permit easier attack attacking cryptography
Since cryptographic application require thousand slow random number generator serve actually random
This use random generator important many informed observer believe every computer way generate true random number
Some aesthetic theory claim based randomness one way another
Little testing done situation claim reliance use randomness generally poorly based definite theory impression randomness technical field
An example need randomness sometimes occurs arranging item art exhibit
Usually avoided using theme
As John Cage pointed While many way sound might produced term pattern attempted
Similarly arrangement art exhibit often deliberately
One case Hitler attempt portray modern art worst possible light arranging work worst possible manner
A case made trying make art worst possible way either actually random art
well many movement art letter attempted accommodate acknowledge randomness various way
Often people mistake order randomness based lack information drip painting abstraction For
Thus theory art art random paint canvas explanation work
Similarly unexpected ending part nature interesting literature
An example novel literally sometimes referred
At one point novel Diderot speaks directly reader Now I author novel might set upon thief I might rest tree rain stop fact kept walking near could see light inn distance
exact quote
Diderot making point novel recent introduction European literature seemed random sense invented thin air author modern technical sense

If embark task developing Master thesis Computer Science document may interest
The scope document narrow deal certain feature thesis development unique field Computer Science
For general information consult source Strunk White Turabian University guide thesis preparation
Before get heart matter ask background skill required successfully complete thesis Computer Science
The next section list skill expected posse
While hard fast rule guarantee background skill required complete thesis Computer Science indicator
Here list indicator
Most thesis Computer Science consist two distinct part writing significant program writing paper describes program wrote
The intent document guide two thing
Of course need taken certain course read certain book journal article otherwise perform basic research begin writing program thesis
If thesis involve writing program skip section
Presumably thesis topic time start developing program implement demonstrate idea topic
You learned write program previous course usually program write thesis involved program written
Thus important use good software engineering technique
The requirement document explains program
Often requirement quite vague
For example system must fast system must
You want write set requirement serve contract specifying expected program
What requirement document
Abstractly answer simple statement valid input program statement corresponding output
Your software operate data derive computed data
The requirement document clearly state input data output data
The requirement document tell program perspective
The specification document explains requirement precisely requirement document
It restates requirement point view developer
The specification explicitly precisely stated
They statement design test
Essentially specification define function set possible data input data output program
The preliminary design document explains going fulfill specification
It written write program include list algorithm use major data structure list major function step use develop program
Stepwise refinement information hiding concept used developing program producing detailed design document
Understanding comment code important
Comments help understand done
It backwards write code try explain
Basic rule include giving selection iteration statement well block sequential code
Additionally loop invariant need developed iteration statement
Data structure use also need explained
Additional document sometimes required program
These include user manual maintenance manual test suite
Often appear appendix thesis
The user manual describes user interface program
The maintenance manual describes change augment port program
The test suite offer validation program compute intended describing test procedure sample test input
Most likely others use program
Writing good user manual facilitate use program
The important thing write naive user
It best assume user program know nothing computer interface
A clear concise description one us program great value others well
You identify awkward misleading command correcting develop much usable product
Start requirement document remind program
If work lasting benefit someone want extend functionality code
A well maintenance manual assist explaining code
The maintenance manual grows specification preliminary design detailed design document
The manual show program decomposed module specifies interface module list major data structure control structure
It also specify effective scope change code
How guarantee program meet specification
Formal verification one proof technique difficult apply large program
You familiar verification technique use develop code others still going want see code give expected result sample test case
Thus develop test suite used show program work correctly variety condition specifying testing procedure used variety test case exercise component program
I believe program written read understood person experienced programming
The basic method facilitating human consumption program write good internal comment discussed
Much sophisticated method exist one system developed Don Knuth
The original system written Pascal system language written even program called used generate system programming language
Briefly benefit using system enables develop program logically without constraint imposed compiler provide excellent program documentation modularity track variable module automatically
An index variable module produced containing pointer variable module defined used
To learn system refer cited literature
Your thesis paper document work serve basis publishable paper
The common mistake made thesis student assume thesis easy write
Consequently postpone writing completed programming
By time produce acceptable copy find term two school slipped still graduated
Important advice start writing early ask thesis advisor feedback writing
Equally important
Plagiarism result expulsion school
You expected write paper copy someone else written
It okay use people idea even word must clearly reference work
Your paper describe
Everyone make spelling mistake spelling checker program available type error eliminated
Always run written work spelling checker ask someone else read
Also find someone correct grammatical mistake paper
If necessary hire someone English Department Language Institute correct work give advisor
Also use professional document preparation system example WordPerfect allows print document laser printer
There
thesis style file developed produce correct margin format plus automatically handle many detail preparation thesis
You begin writing paper first quarter enrolled thesis credit
You write thesis proposal evolves thesis
Writing good proposal important first step success
Proposals differ certain thing expected found every one
There need statement problem studied previous work problem software requirement goal study outline proposed work set milestone bibliography
The approach recommended program development carry development thesis paper
Here begin outline chapter
Although difficult specify included chapter thesis following outline fairly general
Your finished thesis must include title page signature page abstract bibliography
See University guide thesis preparation detail
Make sure follow margin format requirement exactly
You proud work want others know
One way show done quality work publish journal present conference
Thus write short page paper concisely explains new important
This paper submitted appropriate conference journal
The research done provide list conference journal submit work

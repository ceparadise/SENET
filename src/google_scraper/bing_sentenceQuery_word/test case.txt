A set test input execution condition expected result developed particular objective exercise particular program path verify compliance specific requirement
A test case could simply question ask program
The point running test gain information example whether program pas fail test
Test case cornerstone developed verify quality behavior product
In order fully test requirement application met must least two test case requirement one positive test one negative test
If requirement must least two test case
Keeping track link requirement test frequently done using
Written test case include description functionality tested preparation required ensure test conducted
A formal written characterized known input expected output worked test executed
The known input test expected output test
For application system without formal requirement test case written based accepted normal operation program similar class
In school testing test case written activity result reported test run
In hypothetical story used help tester think complex problem system
These scenario usually written detail
They simple diagram testing environment could description written prose
The ideal scenario test story motivating credible complex easy evaluate
They usually different test case test case single step scenario cover number step key
A test case usually single step occasionally sequence step test correct feature application
An expected result expected outcome usually given
Additional information may included Larger test case may also contain prerequisite state step description
A written test case also contain place actual result
These step stored word processor document spreadsheet database common repository
In database system may also able see past test result generated result system configuration used generate result
These past result would usually stored separate table
often also contain Besides description functionality tested preparation required ensure test conducted time consuming part test case creating test modifying system change
Under special circumstance could need run test produce result team expert would evaluate result considered pas
This happens often new product performance number determination
The first test taken base line subsequent test product release cycle
use variation written test case commonly performed group client system ensure developed system meet requirement specified contract
User acceptance test differentiated inclusion positive test case almost complete exclusion negative test case

There different model software development
Testing major phase developing software
It important use test plan carry different type test
Developers use check range type data different circumstance
A test plan list requirement designed ensure coded solution work expected
The test plan include specific instruction data condition program tested
We use test plan check following section code see error
A simplified test plan might look like following table The result column giving unexpected result
The computer program without error must
To fix semantic error would need convert value
One solution would perform integer conversion first two line
For example Sign choose GCSE subject see content tailored

A test case document set test data precondition expected result postconditions developed particular test scenario order verify compliance specific requirement
Test Case act starting point test execution applying set input value application definitive outcome leaf system end point also known execution postcondition
Test Case ID Test Scenario Test Case Description Test Steps Prerequisite Test Data Expected Result Test Parameters Actual Result Environment Information Comments Let u say need check input field accept maximum character
While developing test case scenario test case documented following way
In example first case pas scenario second case FAIL
If expected result match actual result log defect
The defect go defect life cycle tester address fix

A Scenario functionality tested
It also called Test Condition Test Possibility
In software engineering test case set condition variable tester determine requirement upon application partially fully satisfied
It may take many test case determine requirement fully satisfied
In order fully test requirement application met must least one test case requirement unless requirement sub requirement
In situation sub requirement must least one test case
A test case also defined sequence step test correct behavior application
A sequence step consisting action performed system test
These step sometimes called test procedure test script
These action often associated set data preloaded input test
The combination action taken data provided system test lead test condition
This condition tends produce result test compare expected result ass quality given test condition
The action performed serially parallel combination consecution
Test Script set instruction written using language performed system test verify system performs expected
Test script used automated testing
Sometimes set instruction written human language used manual testing also called Test Script better term would Test Case
Test Scenario mean What tested test case mean How tested
Test case It consist test case name Precondition step input condition expected result
Test Scenario Test scenario consists detailed test procedure
We also say test scenario many test case associated
Before executing test scenario need think test case scenario
Test Script A Test Script set instruction written using programming language performed system test verify system performs expected
Test script term used referring automated testing
When creating test script using automation tool create script
outline testing approach everything else surround
It different test plan sense Test strategy sub set test plan
It hard core test document extent generic static
There also argument level test strategy plan I really see discerning difference
Example Test plan give information going test time
For example Module going tested
If tester Y replaces X reason test plan updated
On contrary test strategy going detail like module tested test team member
In case matter testing generic change team member updated keeping static
This one line pointer tester create initial transitional step test design phase
This mostly one line definition going test respect certain feature
Usually test scenario input creation test case
In agile project Test scenario test design output test case written following
A test scenario might result multiple test
Examples test scenario Test Case commonly used term specific test

I native English speaker
In native language I aware term used refer condition checked stop recursion condition checked extreme unlikely case
In English I encountered term edge case corner case boundary case base case I ca quite figure difference used refer I love get summary difference
In particular I would happy someone could provide annotation line following code sample I I native English speaker either
But according Wikipedia So nomenclature seems totally confused even though corner case seems mean something bit different combination value edge boundary case definitely synonymes
It probably safe say edge corner boundary case thing common speech
Someone could mean say different thing hardly common agreement
Your wrote case base case special case
Regardless difference word use describe test depends meaning test exact code In example provided obvious test mean
That aside I understand Thank interest question

In store certain value without particular repeated value
It computer implementation concept
Unlike type rather retrieving specific element set one typically test value membership set
Some set data structure designed change constructed
Static set allow query operation element checking whether given value set enumerating value arbitrary order
Other variant called allow also insertion deletion element set
An abstract data structure collection aggregate data
The data may booleans number character data structure
If one considers structure yielded packaging indexing four basic data structure In view content set bunch isolated data item elementary bunch element
Whereas set element bunch element
Further structuring may achieved considering multiplicity element set become multisets bunch become hyperbunches homogeneity record set field necessarily type
In set generally identified characteristic function accordingly set value type may denoted
Subtypes subset may modeled may replaced
The characteristic function set defined In theory many abstract data structure viewed set structure additional operation additional imposed standard operation
For example abstract viewed set structure operation return element smallest value
One may define operation Typical operation may provided static set structure Dynamic set structure typically add Some set structure may allow operation
The cost operation depend implementation possibly also particular value stored set order inserted
There many operation principle defined term Other operation defined set element special type Sets implemented using various provide different time space various operation
Some implementation designed improve efficiency specialized operation
Implementations described general use typically strive optimize operation
A simple implementation use ignoring order element taking care avoid repeated value
This simple inefficient operation like set membership element deletion require scanning entire list
Sets often instead implemented using efficient data structure particularly various flavor
As set interpreted kind map indicator function set commonly implemented way partial map case value pair sentinel value like namely sorted set O log n operation unsorted set O O n operation
A sorted linear hash table may used provide deterministically ordered set
Further language support map set set implemented term map
For example common convert array hash whose value sentinel value use set Other popular method include
In particular subset integer implemented efficiently also support efficient union intersection operation
A implement set probabilistically using compact representation risking small chance false positive query
The Boolean set operation implemented term elementary operation specialized algorithm may yield lower asymptotic time bound
If set implemented sorted list example naive algorithm take time proportional length time length whereas variant job time proportional
Moreover specialized set data structure optimized one operation expense others
One earliest language support set many language include whether core language
As noted previous section language directly support set support set emulated using associative array using element key using dummy value value ignored
A generalization notion set similar set allows repeated equal value duplicate
This used two distinct sens either equal value considered simply counted equal value considered stored distinct item
For example given list people name age year one could construct multiset age simply count number people given age
Alternatively one construct multiset people two people considered equivalent age may different people different name case pair name age must stored selecting given age give people given age
Formally possible object computer science considered equal still distinct another relation
Some type multiset implementation store distinct equal object separate item data structure others collapse one version first one encountered keep positive integer count multiplicity element
As set multisets naturally implemented using hash table tree yield different performance characteristic
The set bag type T given expression bag If multiset one considers equal item identical simply count multiset interpreted function input domain integer generalizing identification set indicator function
In case multiset counting sense may generalized allow negative value Python
Where multiset data structure available workaround use regular set override equality predicate item always return equal distinct object however still able store multiple occurrence object use mapping value integer multiplicity able distinguish equal element
Typical operation bag In table mathematical set multiset depending presence unicity constraint column turn candidate key
allows selection row relational table operation general yield multiset unless keyword used force row different selection includes primary candidate key
In keyword used transform subquery collection expression general select used another general query transforms subquery used another query assignment column appropriate collection type

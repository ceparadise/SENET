amount work accomplished computer system
Depending context high computer performance may involve one following The performance computer system evaluated measurable technical term using one metric listed
This way performance Whilst definition relates scientific technical approach following definition given would useful audience performance performance particularly response time aspect important
Performance engineering within system engineering encompasses set role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase system development life cycle ensures solution designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement defined solution
Performance engineering continuously deal type performance
Occasionally find way make CPU better overall performance improving one aspect performance presented without sacrificing CPU performance area
For example building CPU better faster transistor
However sometimes pushing one type performance extreme lead CPU worse overall performance important aspect sacrificed get one number example chip see
Application Performance Engineering APE specific methodology within designed meet challenge associated application performance increasingly distributed mobile cloud terrestrial IT environment
It includes role skill activity practice tool deliverable applied every phase application lifecycle ensure application designed implemented operationally supported meet performance requirement
Computer performance thing measure include
benchmark available
Availability system typically measured factor reliability reliability increase availability le
Availability system may also increased strategy focusing increasing testability maintainability reliability
Improving maintainability generally easier reliability
Maintainability estimate Repair rate also generally accurate
However uncertainty reliability estimate case large likely dominate availability prediction uncertainty problem even maintainability level high
Response time total amount time take respond request service
In computing service unit work simple disk IO loading complex
The response time sum three number Most consumer pick computer architecture normally architecture able run large base software
Being relatively uninformed computer benchmark pick particular CPU based operating frequency see
Some system designer building parallel computer pick CPUs based speed per dollar
Channel capacity tightest upper bound rate reliably transmitted
By channel capacity given limiting information rate unit per unit time achieved arbitrarily small error probability
developed defines notion channel capacity provides mathematical model one compute
The key result state capacity channel defined given maximum input output channel maximization respect input distribution
Latency time delay cause effect physical change system observed
Latency result limited velocity physical interaction take place
This velocity always lower equal speed light
Therefore every physical system spatial dimension different zero experience sort latency
The precise definition latency depends system observed nature stimulation
In communication lower limit latency determined medium used communication
In reliable communication system latency limit maximum rate information transmitted often limit amount information one moment
In field interaction perceptible latency delay user command computer provides result strong effect user satisfaction usability
Computers run set instruction called process
In operating system execution process postponed process also executing
In addition operating system schedule perform action process commanding
For example suppose process command computer card voltage output set rate Hz
The operating system may choose adjust scheduling transition based internal clock
The latency delay process instruction commanding transition hardware actually transitioning voltage high low low high
System designer building system want guarantee response
That easier CPU low deterministic response
In computer networking bandwidth measurement available consumed data communication resource expressed bit per second multiple etc
Bandwidth sometimes defines net bit rate aka
peak bit rate information rate physical layer useful bit rate channel capacity maximum throughput logical physical communication path digital communication system
For example bandwidth test measure maximum throughput computer network
The reason usage according Hartley law maximum data rate physical communication link proportional bandwidth hertz sometimes called frequency bandwidth spectral bandwidth RF bandwidth signal bandwidth analog bandwidth
In general term throughput rate production rate something processed
In communication network throughput essentially synonymous digital bandwidth consumption
In unit maximum system throughput aggregate throughput divided analog bandwidth measure system coverage area
In integrated circuit often block single input single output operate discrete packet information
Examples block module
Because unit throughput reciprocal unit per message per output throughput used relate computational device performing dedicated function communication channel simplifying system analysis
Scalability ability system network process handle growing amount work capable manner ability enlarged accommodate growth The amount electricity used computer
This becomes especially important system limited power source solar battery human power
System designer building pick CPUs based speed per watt power cost powering CPU outweighs cost CPU
Compression useful help reduce resource usage data storage space transmission capacity
Because compressed data must decompressed use extra processing imposes computational cost decompression situation far free lunch
Data compression subject complexity
This important performance feature mobile system smart phone keep pocket portable embedded system spacecraft
The effect computer computer environment manufacturing recycling well use
Measurements taken objective reducing waste reducing hazardous material minimizing computer
Because many program test CPU aspect performance developed
The famous benchmark SPECint benchmark developed benchmark developed Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium
In software engineering performance testing general testing performed determine system performs term responsiveness stability particular workload
It also serve investigate measure validate verify quality attribute system scalability reliability resource usage
Performance testing subset performance engineering emerging computer science practice strives build performance implementation design architecture system
In profiling program profiling software profiling form measure example space memory time frequency duration function call
The common use profiling information aid program
Profiling achieved instrumenting either program binary executable form using tool called
A number different technique may used profilers statistical instrumented simulation method
Performance tuning improvement performance
This typically computer application method applied economic market bureaucracy complex system
The motivation activity called performance problem real anticipated
Most system respond increased degree decreasing performance
A system ability accept higher load called modifying system handle higher load synonymous performance tuning
Systematic tuning follows step Perceived performance computer engineering refers quickly software feature appears perform task
The concept applies mainly user acceptance aspect
The amount time application take start file download made faster showing startup screen see Splash screen file progress dialog box
However satisfies human need appears faster user well providing visual cue let know system handling request
In case increasing real performance increase perceived performance real performance increased due physical limitation technique used increase perceived performance cost marginally decreasing real performance
The total amount time required execute particular benchmark program Even one machine different compiler compiler different switch change N benchmark executes faster new compiler improve N C without making worse often better example use complicated instruction take long time execute use instruction execute quickly although take execute benchmark
A CPU designer often required implement particular change Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement f technique deeper pipeline faster cache hopefully sacrificing much CPU design
Sometimes designer focus improving performance making significant improvement CPI technique CPUs larger cache cache improved hit rate improved branch prediction etc
hopefully sacrificing much clock brainiac CPU design
For given instruction set therefore fixed N semiconductor process maximum performance requires balance brainiac technique speedracer technique

If new probably really basic question Just high performance computing HPC anyway First definition get thing started High Performance Computing generally refers practice aggregating computing power way delivers much higher performance one could get typical desktop computer workstation order solve large problem science engineering business
It turn defining HPC kind like defining word car probably know car I bet hard pressed write concise simple definition one mean anything
Also note HPC actually used two way either mean high performance computing high performance It usually pretty clear context sense used
You may heard supercomputing monster machine company like Cray IBM work mankind biggest problem science engineering
Origins universe new cancer drug sort thing
These exotic machine virtue technology inside scale built sometimes thousand processor make single machine
For reason supercomputer expensive top machine world costing upwards
This kind computing related HPC might consider business way Formula One racer related Camry
They car similarity end
Supercomputers like race car take vast sum money specialized expertise use good specialized problem drive race car grocery store
But high performance computer like family sedan used managed without lot expense expertise
If never done need learn new thing
An HPC machine complex simple desktop computer intimidated
The basic much difficult grasp lot company big small provide much little help need
A helpful way help understand high performance computer think
You element find desktop processor memory disk operating system
High performance computer interest small business today really computer
Each individual computer commonly configured small cluster one four processor today processor typically two four
HPC people often refer individual cluster
A cluster interest small business could four node core
A common cluster size many business node core
The point high performance computer individual node work together solve problem larger one computer easily solve
And like people node need able talk one another order work meaningfully together
Of course computer talk network variety computer network option available business cluster see overview cluster interconnects
Just like desktop laptop HPC cluster run without software
Two popular choice HPC Linux many variety Windows
Linux currently dominates HPC installation part due HPC legacy supercomputing large scale machine Unix
Your choice operating system really driven kind application need run high performance computer
If using Excel run option calculation parallel want cluster
In fact first thing know considering buying building HPC cluster want
This sound obvious clear sense cluster required run make sure decision make later one regret

Using Remote Direct Memory Access based analytics fast scalable external disk system massively parallel access data SAS analytics driven organization deliver timely accurate execution data intensive workflow risk management incorporating larger datasets using traditional NAS

In act running set program operation order ass relative object normally running number standard test trial
The term also mostly utilized purpose elaborately designed benchmarking program
Benchmarking usually associated assessing performance characteristic computer hardware example floating point operation performance circumstance technique also applicable software
Software benchmark example run
Benchmarks provide method comparing performance various subsystem across different architecture
type system intended ass software
As advanced became difficult compare performance various computer system simply looking specification
Therefore test developed allowed comparison different architecture
For example processor generally operate higher clock frequency processor necessarily translate computational power
A slower processor regard clock frequency may perform well processor operating higher frequency
See
Benchmarks designed mimic particular type workload component system
Synthetic benchmark specially created program impose workload component
Application benchmark run program system
While application benchmark usually give much better measure performance given system synthetic benchmark useful testing individual component like networking device
Benchmarks particularly important giving processor architect ability measure make tradeoff decision
For example benchmark extract key application contain aspect application
Running much smaller snippet simulator give clue improve performance
Prior computer microprocessor architect used although SPEC benchmark quite lengthy thus unwieldy use intact
Computer manufacturer known configure system give unrealistically high performance benchmark test replicated real usage
For instance compiler could detect specific mathematical operation used benchmark replace operation faster mathematically equivalent operation
However transformation rarely useful outside benchmark architecture emphasized importance technology related performance
Benchmarks regularly used company improve benchmark score real application performance
CPUs many execution unit CPU CPU CPU typically slower clock rate sequential CPU one two execution unit built transistor fast
Nevertheless CPUs many execution unit often complete benchmark task le time supposedly faster CPU
Given large number benchmark available manufacturer usually find least one benchmark show system outperform another system system shown excel different benchmark
Manufacturers commonly report benchmark aspect benchmark show product best light
They also known significance benchmark show product best possible light
Taken together practice called Ideally benchmark substitute real application application unavailable difficult costly port specific processor computer system
If performance critical benchmark matter target environment application suite
Benchmarking easy often involves several iterative round order arrive predictable useful conclusion
Interpretation benchmarking data also extraordinarily difficult

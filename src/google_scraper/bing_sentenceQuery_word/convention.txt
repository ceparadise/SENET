Have ever held hand pot boiling water
You probably could keep long
But put hand pot feel perfectly fine
Why happen
Because convection
There three type heat transfer conduction convection radiation
type heat transfer happen liquid gas involves liquid gas physically moving
Convection happens difference temperature two part liquid gas
The hot part fluid rise cooler part sink
But let use example think happens lest assume fluid mind
After day good solid learning time break
You put kettle make cup tea
The kettle heat water bottom giving molecule near bottom kinetic energy movement energy
This extra movement allows molecule spread apart little
If spread apart mean water le dense
Cold water generally denser hot water
If put something le dense inside something dense happens
Well try putting cork water
You wo surprised see jump right surface
In way hot water bottom kettle le dense cold water rise surface
Once get cool away heating element
This cause become dense sink
These movement water convection current boiling water move around much
The water heat becomes le dense rise cool becoming dense sink
This process repeat
And happens due simple temperature difference top bottom kettle
So minute ago I asked hot boiling pot water perfectly comfortable put hand next
Convection current reason
It heat rise
When put hand next pot receiving energy type heat transfer like conduction radiation
But much
However add convection mix
The heated air literally rising towards hand
Convection probably complex three type heat transfer involves chaotic fluid
But still equation use represent
The following equation describes heat energy transferred surface area convection occurring The coefficient convection number represents property material involved temperature difference difference temperature surface receiving heat energy average temperature liquid difference temperature top bottom liquid
So example Let say pot degree Celsius boiling water lid lid surface area temperature degree Celsius
This mean temperature difference degree
The convection coefficient want know many Joules energy transferred lid every second
To calculate would multiply giving Joules per second
Let take look example
One example convection weather
Warm front le dense cold front mean rise
When happens water vapor cool condense fall back Earth rain
Cool sea breeze caused convection
In summer air land becomes hot easily air sea
When inland air heat rise convects sea air flow fill gap

Convection even happens inside Earth
In outer core Earth liquid metal hotter near center Earth cooler
This cause flow around convection current
These liquid metal contain charged particle motion creates Earth magnetic field
The magnetic field Earth important
Without compass would point North bird would know fly south winter would nothing push away dangerous radiation Sun
Without Earth magnetic field therefore without convection would able survive Earth
It even give u beautiful nighttime display called Aurora Borealis Northern Lights
happens difference temperature two part liquid gas
Convection hot le dense part fluid rise cooler denser part sink
This cycle move heat upwards heat rise hand get hotter pot boiling water rather next
Examples convection include movement liquid metal Earth outer core give u magnetic field certain weather effect like sea breeze source rainfall
Without convection current would hard u survive Earth

In set rule choosing character sequence used denote entity
Reasons using naming convention opposed allowing choose character sequence include following The choice naming convention enormously controversial issue partisan holding best others inferior
Colloquially said matter
Many company also established set convention
Some potential benefit obtained adopting naming convention include following The choice naming convention extent enforced often contentious issue partisan holding viewpoint best others inferior
Moreover even known naming convention place organization may fail consistently adhere causing inconsistency confusion
These challenge may exacerbated naming convention rule internally inconsistent arbitrary difficult remember otherwise perceived burdensome beneficial
identifier make significantly easier developer analyst understand system fix extend apply new need
For example although statement correct purpose evident
Contrast implies intent meaning source code least familiar context statement
The exact rule naming convention depend context employed
Nevertheless several common element influence naming convention common use today
Fundamental element naming convention rule related finite number individual character allowed identifier
Some rule dictate fixed numerical bound others specify le precise heuristic guideline
Identifier length rule routinely contested practice subject much debate academically
Some consideration It open research issue whether programmer prefer shorter identifier easier type think longer identifier many situation longer identifier simply clutter visible code provides perceived additional benefit
Brevity programming could part attributed Some naming convention limit whether letter may appear uppercase lowercase
Other convention restrict letter case attach interpretation based letter case
Some naming convention specify whether alphabetic numeric alphanumeric character may used sequence
A common recommendation Use meaningful identifier
A single may meaningful specific multiple word
Consequently naming convention specify rule treatment compound identifier containing one word
As allow identifier method delimiting word needed make easier subsequent reader interpret character belong word
Historically early language notably allowed space within identifier determining end identifier context
This abandoned later language due difficulty
It possible write name simply concatenating word sometimes used Java package name though legibility suffers longer term usually form separation used
One approach separate word character
The two character commonly used purpose name would represented
The hyphen used nearly programmer writing also common command package used
This convention standard name though may referred compare variant
Of dating least achieved currency since
By contrast language tradition notably language family used hyphen operator wish require space around preventing use identifier
An alternative use underscore common C family including Python lowercase word found example come known
Underscores upper case commonly used macro hence known Unix
Another approach indicate word boundary using medial capitalization called Pascal case many name thus rendering either
This convention commonly used Pascal
Treatment acronym identifier
varies
Some dictate lowercased
ease typing readability whereas others leave uppercased
accuracy
Some naming convention represent rule requirement go beyond requirement specific project problem domain instead reflect greater overarching set principle defined underlying kind methodology
Perhaps encodes either purpose Apps Hungarian Systems Hungarian variable name
For example prefix sz variable szName indicates variable string
A style used short character le could LC would application Letters Credit C COBOL IIL particular process subset sequence number
This sort convention still active use mainframe dependent upon also seen maximum character period separator followed character file type style
One earliest published convention system IBM OF Language documented IMS manual
It detailed word scheme consisted name like indicate customer account number
PRIME word meant indicate major entity interest system
MODIFIER word used additional refinement qualification readability
CLASS word ideally would short list data type relevant particular application
Common CLASS word might NO number ID identifier TXT text AMT amount QTY quantity FL flag CD code W work forth
In practice available CLASS word would list le two dozen term
CLASS word typically positioned right suffix served much purpose prefix
The purpose CLASS word addition consistency specify programmer particular data field
Prior acceptance BOOLEAN two value field FL flag would indicate field two possible value
Adobe Coding Conventions Best Practices suggests naming standard mostly consistent
The style identifier similar
In recommended style identifier
In identifier mostly lowercase
In abbreviated name common
function testing whether character alphanumeric often us underscore word separator

Identifiers representing convention written using upper case letter underscore related convention many programming language using identifier constant
Names containing double underscore beginning underscore capital letter reserved implementation used

This superficially similar semantics differ underscore part value identifier rather quoting character stropping value reserved different namespace
In convention use rather underscore write multiword name
In naming convention identifier established suggested various Java community Sun Microsystems Netscape AmbySoft etc
A sample naming convention set Sun Microsystems listed name one composed number word joined without space word initial letter capital example CamelCase
Variable name short yet meaningful
The choice variable name designed indicate casual observer intent use
variable name avoided except temporary throwaway variable
Common name temporary variable j k n integer c e character
Java compiler enforce rule failing follow may result confusion erroneous code
For example imply significantly different behaviour implies invocation method instance named whereas implies invocation static method class
One widely used Java coding style dictate used used
Recognising usage implement shortcut based CamelCase
For instance Eclipse feature typing letter CamelCase word suggest matching class method name example typing NPE activating content assist could suggest
Initialisms three letter CamelCase instead upper case instead
One may also set boundary two letter

The JavaScript library use naming convention Java
Data type constructor function use upper camel case method use lower camel case
In order consistent JavaScript developer follow convention
See also Common practice dialect use dash separate word identifier
Dynamic variable name conventionally start end asterisk
Constants name marked plus sign
recommends identifier
recommended shared convention language
Microsoft recommends type prefix hint also known used
Instead using Hungarian notation recommended end name base class name instead
common coding style root
entity including class protocol category well C construct used program like global variable function UpperCamelCase short prefix denoting namespace like
Constants may optionally prefixed lower case letter k like
Instance variable object use lowerCamelCase prefixed underscore like
Method name use multiple lowerCamelCase part separated colon delimit argument like
Wirthian language Pascal Oberon generally use identifier program module constant type procedure identifier math constant variable formal parameter function
While dialect support underscore dollar sign identifier snake case macro case likely confined use within foreign API interface
take cue C heritage convention
Locally scoped variable subroutine name lowercase infix underscore
Subroutines variable meant treated private prefixed underscore
Package variable title cased
Declared constant cap
Package name camel case excepting lowercase
follows le convention Perl except allows infix hyphen apostrophe single quote within identifier two row provided followed alphabetic character
Perl programmer thus often use identifier example valid identifier
recommendation contained PHP Standard Recommendation
recommend class name constant name
In Python name intended prefixed underscore
Private variable enforced convention Python
Names also suffixed underscore prevent conflict Python keywords
Prefixing double underscore change behaviour class regard
Prefixing suffixing double underscore reserved magic name fulfill special behaviour Python object
shifted naming convention individual release
However major update Swift stabilised naming convention across variable function declaration
Constants usually defined enum type constant parameter also written way
Class object type declaration
As Swift made clear naming guideline language effort standardise API naming declaration convention across third party APIs

Convection term hear quite often meteorology
In weather describes vertical transport heat moisture usually warmer area surface cooler one aloft
While word convection sometimes used interchangeably thunderstorm remember thunderstorm one type convection
Before delve atmospheric convection let look example may familiar boiling pot water
When water boil hot water bottom pot rise surface leading bubble heated water sometimes steam surface
It convection air except air fluid replaces water
The process convection begin sunrise continues follows After main process convection complete number scenario could happen form different weather type
The term convective often added name since convection jump start development
As convection continues air cool reach lower air pressure may reach point within condenses form guessed top
If air contains lot moisture quite hot continue grow vertically become towering cumulus cumulonimbus
Cumulus towering cumulus Cumulonimbus Altocumulus Castellanus cloud visible form convection
They also example moist convection convection excess water vapor rising air condenses form cloud
Convection occurs without cloud formation called dry convection
If convective cloud enough cloud droplet produce convective precipitation
In contrast precipitation result air lifted force convective precipitation requires instability ability air continue rising
It associated lightning thunder burst
precipitation event le intense rain rate last longer produce steadier rainfall
All rising air convection must balanced equal amount sinking air elsewhere
As heated air rise air elsewhere flow replace
We feel balancing movement air wind
Examples convective wind include
Besides creating weather event convection serf another purpose remove excess heat earth surface
Without calculated average surface air temperature earth would somewhere around F rather current liveable Only pocket warm rising air cooled temperature surrounding air stop rising

Have ever wondered much hotter campfire next
Or boil pot water liquid move around rapidly
Both thing due
one three main type heat transfer two
Unlike two convection happen fluid
This includes liquid gas molecule free move
Heat energy transfer convection significant difference temperature two part fluid
When temperature difference exists hot fluid rise cold fluid sink movement created fluid
But happen
Let look example convection action get better understanding
Imagine lunchtime hungry
You decide heat soup stovetop
As soup increase temperature giving soup molecule movement kinetic energy
This extra movement energy cause molecule spread apart
Because hotter fluid le dense colder fluid
The soup near bottom saucepan hottest closer burner
This mean soup le dense bottom
Now let think happens put cork water
The cork le dense water pop surface
The thing happens soup
The hotter le dense soup bottom rise colder denser soup
As soup rise get away burner start cool become denser
Before long soup dense enough sink passing rising hot soup way whole process repeat
These movement soup called convection current reason pot boiling water move around rapidly
The water heated becomes le dense rise cool becomes denser sink
All burner creates temperature difference top bottom pot
Convection current also reason hotter campfire next heat rise
If put hand front campfire fewer convection current heating hand
A lot heat come different type heat transfer radiation
But put hand top campfire lot convection current rising towards

If ever sat hot sandy beach suddenly felt lovely cooling breeze convection current thank
Convection big part earth weather system work
Warm front le dense meet colder front rise
If warm front contain enough water vapor water cool condense liquid form rain
A breeze beach also flow due convection
On warm day air land heat quickly air sea
When air land heat becomes le dense rise allowing colder air sea rush fill empty space
This cool sea breeze usually come sea towards land
The hottest part earth center pressure greatest
Because temperature difference liquid magma earth mantle also contains convection current like pot boiling water
Without movement magma would even exist
The magma contains charged particle charged particle move make earth act like huge magnet
This compass point north ship navigated thousand year
But importantly magnetic field earth push dangerous solar radiation towards North South pole instead killing u give u pretty light show call Aurora Borealis Northern Lights
Let review
one three type heat transfer extremely important explains lot see around u every day
Convection happen fluid
This includes liquid gas molecule free move
found boiling liquid heat campfire weather even magma earth

Human behavior like
Everything say tell world going inside
Because psychologist ca observe thought emotion behavior important part psychology since beginning discipline
In early though study behavior became even important introduced world
Pavlov studying digestion dog discovered dog began drool whenever saw person charge feeding
He designed experiment ringing bell whenever dog fed
Pretty soon dog would salivate whenever heard bell even food sight
What Pavlov dog demonstrated
In classical conditioning neutral stimulus sound bell presented time another unrelated stimulus food
The stimulus automatically produce response drooling food
This
After neutral stimulus also produce response Pavlov dog drooled sound bell
This called
You might wondering Pavlov dog human behavior
Classical conditioning happens human time
Imagine ate favorite taco got sick
Chances wo want taco quite
That classical conditioning taco neutral stimulus getting sick stimulus
After two presented together taco sound good conditioned response
Psychologist expanded idea conditioning
He built box placed rat inside
When bar box pressed rat would rewarded piece food
At first rat wandered around box aimlessly
Eventually though rat learned get food every time pressed bar began press often

Humans well information organized network
Interacting network part daily life talk friend social network find information navigating Web form opinion listening others medium
Thus understanding predicting enhancing human behavior network pose important research problem computer data science practical application high impact
In talk I present work area focusing human navigation information network opinion social network
Network navigation constitutes fundamental human behavior order make use information resource around u constantly explore disentangle navigate network Web
Studying navigation pattern let u understand better human reason complex network let u build information system
As example I present algorithm improving website hyperlink structure mining raw web server log
The resulting system deployed Wikipedia full server log terabyte scale producing link clicked time frequently average link added human Wikipedia editor
Communication coordination natural language another prominent human network behavior
Studying interplay social network structure language potential benefit sociolinguistics natural language processing
Intriguing opportunity challenge arisen recently advent online social medium produce large amount network natural language data
As example I discus work sentiment analysis social network combine sociological theory structural balance technique natural language processing resulting machine learning model sentiment prediction clearly outperforms version
I conclude talk sketching interesting future direction computational approach studying enhancing human behavior network
Robert West candidate Computer Science Infolab Stanford University advised Jure Leskovec
His research aim understand predict enhance human behavior social information network developing technique data science data mining network analysis machine learning natural language processing

Everyone different attitude towards different thing
A main factor determines attitude like dislike
The one like something someone one willing open accept offer
When one like something one likely get defensive shut
An example one attitude affect one human behavior could simple taking child park doctor
Children know fun park attitude becomes willing positive doctor mentioned shut become upset thought pain
Attitudes sculpt personality way people view
People similar attitude tend stick together interest hobby common
This mean people different attitude interact fact
What mean specific attitude bring people together religious group
Attitudes lot mind highly relates human behavior
The way human behaves depends lot look situation expect gain
Positive attitude better negative one negativity bring negative emotion time avoided
It human make sure attitude positively reflect behavior want show
This done assessing attitude properly presenting society

You might presume least hope human better understanding fellow human machine
But new MIT study suggests algorithm predict someone behavior faster reliably human
Max Kanter master student computer science MIT advisor Kalyan Veeramachaneni research scientist MIT computer science artificial intelligence laboratory created Data Science Machine search pattern choose variable relevant
Their pdf presented Paris week
It fairly common machine analyze data human typically required choose data point relevant analysis
In three competition human team machine made accurate prediction human team
And human worked predictive algorithm month machine took two hour produce competition entry
For example one competition asked team predict whether student would drop next ten day based student interaction resource online course many possible factor consider
Teams might looked late student turned problem set whether spent time looking lecture note
But instead two important indicator turned far ahead deadline student began working problem set much time student spent course website
These statistic directly collected MIT online learning platform could inferred data available
The Data Science Machine performed well competition
It also successful two competition one participant predict whether project would considered exciting another customer would become repeat buyer
Kanter told MIT News many possible us Data Science Machine
There much data analyzed said
And right sitting anything

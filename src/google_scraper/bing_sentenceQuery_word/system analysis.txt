The dictionary defines process studying procedure order identify goal purpose create procedure achieve efficient way
Another view see system analysis technique break system component piece purpose studying well component part work interact accomplish purpose
The field system analysis relates closely
It also explicit formal inquiry carried help identify better course action make better decision might otherwise made
The term stem Greek meaning take apart put together respectively
These term used many mathematics logic economics psychology denote similar investigative procedure
Analysis defined procedure break intellectual substantial whole part synthesis mean procedure combine separate element component order form coherent whole
System analysis researcher apply system involved forming overall picture
System analysis used every field something developed
Analysis also series component perform organic function together system engineering
engineering focus complex engineering project designed managed
The development information system includes system analysis phase
This help produce precursor creating enhancing
There number different approach system analysis
When information system developed system analysis according would constitute following step Another view outline phased approach process
This approach break system analysis phase widely used system analysis modeling tool identifying expressing functional requirement system
Each use case business scenario event system must provide defined response
Use case evolved analysis
The discipline today known originated application system analysis first instituted United States
Practitioners system analysis often called dissect system grown haphazardly determine current component system
This shown year effort business manufacturing process examined part automation upgrade
Employment utilizing system analysis include etc
While practitioner system analysis called upon create new system often modify expand document existing system

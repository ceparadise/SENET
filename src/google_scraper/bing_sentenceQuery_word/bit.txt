The correspondence value physical state underlying matter convention different assignment may used even within device
The length binary number may referred
In one bit typically defined binary random variable equal probability information gained value variable becomes known
In exist two bit value
The symbol binary digit either simply recommended standard lowercase recommended standard
A group eight binary digit commonly called one historically size byte strictly defined
As bit alternatively called named founder field information theory
This usage distinguishes quantity information form state variable used represent
When logical value equally probable signal conveyed perfectly communication system binary digit representation information convey le one bit information
However shannon unit terminology uncommon practice
The encoding data discrete bit used invented Falcon developed later adopted early computer manufacturer like
Another variant idea perforated
In system medium card tape conceptually carried array hole position position could either punched thus carrying one bit information
The encoding text bit also used early digital communication machine
suggested use logarithmic measure information first used word seminal paper
He attributed origin written Bell Labs memo January contracted binary information digit simply bit
Interestingly written bit information could stored used mechanical computer time
The first programmable computer built used binary notation number
A bit stored digital device physical system exists either two possible distinct
These may two stable state two position two distinct level allowed two distinct level two direction orientation reversible double stranded etc
Bits implemented several form
In modern computing device bit usually represented pulse electrical state
For device using digit value logical value true represented positive voltage relative representation
The specific voltage different different logic family variation permitted allow component aging noise immunity
For example TTL compatible circuit digit value output device represented higher volt lower volt respectively TTL input specified recognize volt volt

The string bit making byte processed unit computer byte smallest operable unit storage computer
A byte represent equivalent single character letter B comma percentage sign represent number
Because byte contains little information processing storage capacity computer hardware usually given gigabyte GB one billion byte terabyte TB one trillion byte
Because byte root binary digit originally one kilobyte byte byte thus one megabyte MB byte
However notable exception computer industry switched decimal prefix prefix denote thousandfold increase byte
bit called byte
group called byte
Because digital computer use byte ASCII code commonly embedded field consisting seven information bit parity bit used purpose represent special symbol
The use system device processing storing displaying information

A bit short binary digit smallest unit measurement used quantify computer
It contains single value
While single bit define value True False individual bit little use
Therefore computer storage bit often grouped together cluster called
Since byte contains eight bit two possible value single byte may different value
The term bit byte often confused even used interchangeably since sound similar abbreviated letter B
However written correctly bit abbreviated lowercase b byte abbreviated capital B
It important confuse two term since measurement byte contains eight time many bit
For example small text KB size contains byte bit
Generally file measured byte measured bit
For instance may storage capacity GB may transfer Mbps
Additionally bit also used describe processor processor

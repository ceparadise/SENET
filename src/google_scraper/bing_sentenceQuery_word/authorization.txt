Trusted consumer often authorized unrestricted access resource system must authenticated access control system make access approval decision
Partially trusted guest often restricted authorization order protect resource improper access usage
The access policy operating system default grant consumer full access resource
Others opposite insisting administrator explicitly authorizes consumer use resource
Even access controlled combination authentication problem maintaining authorization data trivial often represents much administrative burden managing authentication credential
It often necessary change remove user authorization done changing deleting corresponding access rule system
Using authorization alternative authorization management securely distributes authorization information
In authorization feature used
In hold placed customer account purchase made using
In sometimes public lecture freely available text published without approval
These called unauthorized text

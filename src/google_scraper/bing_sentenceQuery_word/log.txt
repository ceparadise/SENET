I currently learning Big O Notation running time amortized time
I understand notion linear time meaning size input affect growth algorithm proportionally go example quadratic time algorithm permutation generator time grow factorial
For example following function algorithm grows proportion input Similarly nested loop time would O n
But exactly
For example mean say height complete binary tree
I know maybe great detail Logarithm sense log I understand identify function logarithmic time
I understand identify function log time
The common attribute logarithmic function This example looking people phone book O log n
You need check person phone book find right one instead simply looking based name alphabetically every section need explore subset section eventually find someone phone number
Of course bigger phone book still take longer time wo grow quickly proportional increase additional size
We expand phone book example compare kind operation running time
We assume phone book Yellow Pages unique name White Pages may unique name
A phone number assigned one person business
We also assume take constant time flip specific page
Here running time operation might perform phone book best worst Given page business name business name find phone number
Given page person name name find phone number
Given person name find phone number picking random point halfway part book searched yet checking see whether person name point
Then repeat process halfway part book person name lie
This binary search person name
Find people whose phone number contain digit
Given phone number find person business number
There printer office phone book page inserted random order
Fix ordering correct looking first name page putting page appropriate spot new empty phone book
For example printer office
Phone book waiting mailed resident business sticker phone book identifying mailed
Every person business get one phone book
We want personalize phone book going find person business name designated copy circle name book write short note patronage
A mistake occurred office every entry phone book extra end phone number
Take remove zero
We ready load phonebook onto shipping dock
Unfortunately robot supposed load book gone haywire putting book onto truck random order
Even worse load book onto truck check see right order unloads start
This dreaded
You fix robot loading thing correctly
The next day one play prank wire loading dock robot automated printing system
Every time robot go load original book factory printer make duplicate run phonebook
Fortunately robot system sophisticated enough robot try printing even copy encounter duplicate book loading still load every original duplicate book printed
Many good answer already posted question I believe really missing important one namely illustrated answer
What mean say height complete binary tree O log n
The following drawing depicts binary tree
Notice level contains double number node compared level hence Binary search example complexity
Let say node bottom level tree figure represents item sorted collection
Binary search algorithm drawing show need comparison find record searching item dataset
Assume instead dataset element
Continue drawing find need comparison find searching tree grown one level deeper multiplied amount data
As result complexity algorithm described logarithmic order
Plotting plain piece paper result graph rise curve decelerates increase basically mean time go linearly go exponentially
So take second compute element take second compute element second compute element
divide conquer type algorithm binary search
Another example quick sort time divide array two part time take time find pivot element
Hence The explanation using case fully binary tree help understand get logarithmic time complexity
Binary tree case problem size n divided size reach problem size And get O log n amount work need done tree reach solution
A common algorithm O log n time complexity Binary Search whose recursive relation T O
every subsequent level tree divide problem half constant amount additional work
If function take Then take log n time
The loosely speaking mean relationship need true large n constant factor smaller term ignored
Logarithmic running time essentially mean running time grows proportion input size example item take amount time item take say item take looking like time complexity
Others given good diagram example tree diagram
I see simple code example
So addition explanation I provide algorithm simple print statement illustrate complexity different algorithm category
First want general idea Logarithm get
Natural science use natural log
Engineering disciple use log base computer scientist use log base lot since computer binary based
Sometimes see abbreviation natural log engineer normally leave use abbreviated
All type logarithm grow similar fashion share category
When look code example I recommend looking O O n O
After good look others
I included clean example well variation demonstrate subtle change still result categorization
You think O O n O logn etc class category growth
Some category take time others
These category help give u way ordering algorithm performance
Some grown faster input n grows
The following table demonstrates said growth numerically
In table think log n ceiling
Algorithm print hello depend n always run constant time
Algorithm print hello time however depend input size
Even n grows algorithm always print hello time
That said constant algorithm also
Algorithm demonstrates algorithm run n
Notice post operation loop multiple current value go Algorithm demonstrates
Notice go Algorithm important help show long number greater result repeatedly multiplied looking logarithmic algorithm
This algorithm simple print hello n time
This algorithm show variation print hello time
We ignore constant see algorithm O n
Think combination
The nesting loop help u obtain Algorithm like algorithm loop allowed variation still result final result obtained easily nesting standard loop
Like algorithm variation
This like algorithm loop instead
Like algorithm variation still yield
The give several straight forward example variation help demonstrate subtle change introduced really change analysis
Hopefully give enough insight
You think O log N intuitively saying time proportional number digit If operation performs constant time work digit bit input whole operation take time proportional number digit bit input magnitude input thus O log N rather O N
If operation make series constant time decision half reduces factor size input considered whole take time proportional log base base base base size N input rather O N
And
The best way I always mentally visualize algorithm run O log n follows If increase problem size multiplicative amount
multiply size work increased additive amount
Applying binary tree question good application double number node binary tree height increase additive amount
If double still increased
Obviously I assuming stay balanced
That way instead doubling work problem size multiplied slightly work
That O log n algorithm awesome
Ok let try fully understand logarithm actually
Imagine rope tied horse
If rope directly tied horse force horse would need pull away say man directly
Now imagine rope looped round pole
The horse get away pull many time harder
The amount time depend roughness rope size pole let assume multiply one strength rope make complete turn
Now rope looped horse need pull time harder
If human decides make really difficult horse may loop rope round pole increasing strength additional time
A third loop increase strength time
We see loop value increase
The number turn required get number called logarithm number
need post multiple strength time post multiply strength
logarithm logarithm base
In example rate
For every additional loop force rope handle time Now example use base fortunately base log insignificant talk big notation
Now let imagine trying guess number
Now took guess get right
But relationship
What amount item guess additional guess
Using graph see use binary search guess number take u attempt
If number could also guess number attemps number take u attempt relation logarithm would need guess value range guess value range
logarithm logarithm base
Notice I bolded
Big notation always refers worse case
If lucky could guess number one attempt best case O another story
We see every guess data set shrinking
A good rule thumb identify algorithm logarithmtic time see data set shrink certain order iteration You eventually come across linerarithmic time algorithm
The rule thumb applies time logarithmic function run n time
reducing size list occurs algorithm like mergesort
You easily identify algorithmic time n log Look outer loop iterates list O n
Then look see inner loop
If inner loop data set iteration loop O log n overall algorithm
What log n
It number time cut log length n repeatedly b equal part reaching section size
Divide conquer algorithm usually component running time
This come repeated halving input
In case binary search every iteration throw away half input
It noted notation log log base
Edit As noted log base matter deriving performance algorithm log factor come halving hence I think base
But exactly O log n
For example mean say height complete binary tree O log n
I would rephrase complete binary tree log n
Figuring height complete binary tree would O log n traversing step step
I understand identify function logarithmic time
Logarithm essentially inverse exponentiation
So function eliminating element original item set logarithmic time algorithm
For tree example easily see stepping level node cut exponential number element continue traversing
The popular example looking phone book essentially equivalent traversing binary search tree middle page root element deduce step whether go left right
refers function algorithm step algorithm working amount time proportional logarithm usually base case always event insignificant size input
The logarithmic function inverse exponential function
Put another way input grows exponentially rather linearly would normally consider function grows linearly
running time common sort application ideally cutting work half every time
If division conquer step constant time work work time growing slowly entire function
It fairly common step require linear time input instead amount total time complexity
The running time complexity binary search example
This binary search always ignoring half input later step dividing array half focusing one half step
Each step binary search need compare one element key order figure next irregardless big array considering point
So approximately log n step
The running time complexity merge sort example
This dividing array half step resulting total approximately log n step
However step need perform merge operation element whether one merge operation two sublists element two merge operation four sublists element irrelevant add n element step
Thus total complexity
notation constant matter
Also logarithm difference logarithm different base constant factor
Simply put At step algorithm cut work half
Asymptotically equivalent third fourth It simply mean time needed task grows log n example n n
Read Wikipedia article precision
If plot logarithmic function graphical calculator something similar see rise really slowly even slowly linear function
This algorithm logarithmic time complexity highly sought even really big n let say n example perform acceptably
These case take O log n time But exactly O log n What mean precisely tends towards tends towards constant scaling factor
Or actually quite mean likely mean something like divided tends towards
Tends towards usual mathematical meaning example pick arbitrarily small constant I find corresponding value le value greater
In lay term mean equation time may component
may constant startup time component pale towards insignificance large value n n dominating term large Note equation example time n b n n would O n squared matter value constant b c term would always dominate others sufficiently large value That bit O notation mean mean order dominant term sufficiently large n
I add something interesting I read book Kormen etc
long time ago
Now imagine problem find solution problem space
This problem space finite
Now prove every iteration algorithm cut fraction space le limit mean algorithm running O logN time
I point talking relative fraction limit absolute one
The binary search classical example
At step throw away problem space
But binary search example
Suppose proved somehow step throw away least problem space
That mean program still running O logN time although significantly slower binary search
This good hint analyzing recursive algorithm
It often proved step recursion use several variant lead cutoff fraction problem space
O log n bit misleading precisely O log n
logarithm base
The height balanced binary tree O log n since every node two note two log n child node
So tree n node height log Another example binary search running time O log n every step divide search space
First I recommend read following book Here function expected complexity
Numbers indicating
Following also taken Lastly simple showcase show calculated Anatomy statement execution frequency
Analyzing running time program example
inverse If tree depth size n traversing whole tree O O n Walking single path tree O O log n base M I give example loop maybe grasped concept maybe simpler understand different context
That mean loop step grows exponentially

The complexity program O log n
Let try loop hand n somewhere excluding Although n somewhere iteration take place
This step loop grows exponentially thus take iteration reach termination
The logarithm x base reverse function
It like saying logarithm inverse exponential
Now try see way exponential grows fast logarithm grows inversely slow
The difference O n O log n huge similar difference O n O constant
In information technology mean Ant seems notation mostly taken mathematics
In article quote On basis issue discussed I propose member SIGACT editor computer science mathematics journal adopt notation defined unless
Today use still today
In mathematical analysis mean But even mathematical analysis sometimes symbol used meaning n f n
As I know university symbol intoduced German mathematician Landau The complete binary example O ln n search look like Searching yield hit
And good apporximate many hit needed
If looking intuition based answer I would like put two interpretation
Imagine high hill broad base well
To reach top hill two way one dedicated pathway going spirally around hill reaching top small terrace like carving cut provide staircase
Now first way reaching linear time O n second one O log n
Imagine algorithm accepts integer input completes time proportional O n theta n run time proportion algorithm run O log n theta log n time
I would like add height tree length longest path root leaf height node length longest path node leaf
The path mean number node encounter traversing tree two node
In order achieve O log n time complexity tree balanced meaning difference height child node le equal
Therefore tree always guarantee time complexity O log n unless balanced
Actually case time complexity searching tree O n worst case scenario
You take look balance tree
This one work balancing tree inserting data order keep time complexity log n searching tree
Algorithms Divide Conquer paradigm complexity O logn
One example calculate power function Actually list n element create binary tree list like divide conquer algorithm keep dividing reach list size leaf
At first step divide
You list divide list divide list list size That give equation take lg side lg log base Thank interest question

A concrete example
Just say I front class student one pen
Here way find pen O order
I question student ask Does Jeff pen
No
Does Bob pen
And naming student
If I get answer first student I move next one
In worst case I need ask question questioning student student
I ask student pen
If I move next one
In worst case I need ask question
I divide class two ask Is left side right side classroom
Then I take group divide two ask
In worst case I need ask question
I might need O n search one student know student pen hidden
I use O n one student pen knew
I use O log n search student knew would tell I guessed right name
Which one little shit pen
This parallel version
The asshole pen better come right fuck
You right asking whole class one parallel
Using known reference O
Sounds like dereferenced null pointer
made imagine Frodo hobbit called nerd
The parallel version would If noone tell pen get F
So asking group pen log n version No asking group pen parallel
It processing happens parallel group
Assuming group us algorithm answer parallelly processing half serially getting answer O log n
So parallel
Hm right
binary search one pen need anything parallel ever happen
Binary search requires set sorted
Not ask whole group parallel
Oh shit I pen
This comment made day
Thank
Sometimes brute force best way solve problem
Hahaha best I know pen
Give
How O nlog n
O n log n applies every student claim know answer one really willing play guessing game
This thread made day Do sort key pen
Then rightmost student pen
scenario O case I ask student know student whose name Jeff pen
etc
This zoom zero one student O log n step
If get pen move second student
If student numbered pen looking numbered pen order using log n method
Would fixed order
If order go line left right collecting pen
There effect wrong answer collect order
You take pen
I meant particularly defined order yes
This HUGE help
I gathered understanding year basic subject example like Windex dirty window
Thank
Excellent explanation
Great answer translate simple programming situation
I struggling make kind computational relation
Here comparison O n O n A physic system game n dynamic object moving around frame
The naive approach might frame compare object object
This would O n every object need process every object
So object mean check object mean check
You could improve drastically sorting dynamic object left right along one axis using bubble sort
Bubble sort best case potentially average case assuming object moving quickly O n
Once object sorted need compare object object immediately
You keep comparing reach object far away possibly collide ignore object
In best case O n sort look object collision test check object one left one right
A comparison O n O log n Picture single dynamic character moving collidable environment
If n obstacle could simple collision character need test collision every object scene
This O n
We could make O log n using tree structure store data like binary tree BSP quad tree octree
Then frame check see dynamic character left right BSP wall
Then space broken half half
Once found smallest broken level section test nearest static object
Because constantly ignoring half object spatial check BSP end collision test fraction many static object
I want know number data structure
If array I check element I find
If AVL tree A type balanced tree I know le greater node tree look left right accordingly
If two dimensional array I look N item N time The first index second index I assuming N two different number example I like example still linear since measuring would total size array whose value
It would make sense trying find say duplicate set unsorted array A B say time element A B
Sure
I really coming much n top head
I figured long call N size one set pointer n better example
Ah assumes student honest
Thank greatest explanation
The best example show basic principies logarithm particular
If one pompous gobbler site exmplain thing simply understandable way
For search happens ten student
If log mean divide class
If work
EDIT Actually I think could using natural log
Is
O log n mean search time bounded n n approach infinity k constant
Your search time n log n k
As pointed I totally missing fact computation done base I assumed referring instead
That messed quite bit
Still thanks explanation really useful
It actually matter base log
You convert base multiplying rule take factor put I sorry I clear I saying
It absolutely true base matter specific example failing I using base compensating adjustment O
Really ceilng n bounded log n
Just wanted comment say sorry downvotes
sadly filled dumb piece shit think trying learn mortal sin
Hope learned something Maimakterios nice explanation
Thanks kind word encouragement worry I even notice negativity really helpful explanation
Usually order notation refers base base divide class time Big O notation refer particular base since logarithm different base differ constant factor
Yes true convert logarithm another base constant factor since talking computation done traditional computer helpful think term rather
That said answer mine really best answer
Thanks ton
Knowing make thing enormously clearer
You idea helpful
Thanks
In general though O notation really deal general idea runtime cost grow n grows infinite
It supposed used calculator exact runtime especially since drop le significant element
For sure
O notation always one thing I I knew mean precise I know much actually implemented
The whole concept usually applies large number even mostly asymptotically
I get question first student u ask student given speaks truth get answer first one
The first student might know pen
Also student pen lie pen
However one student know student pen
That confused
But could think another way person pen know truth everyone answer I know asked someone else
In worst case last person speak pen already asked everyone else every student I know response asked
Also assumption one lie
deleted What
One person class pen backpack
It put someone class maybe maybe someone else without anyone else knowing either pen placed
Now ask person whether person well pen
Ergo O n
Yea sorry I read full actually made clear anyways I deleted comment come still downvoted understanding asking question ridiculous Maybe another method illustrating n Tell student line
Starting student front say Jeff pen switch student behind
switch Jeff pen switch student behind Jeff pen switch student behind
Until Jeff back line
If Bob front line everyone
Whoever front line pen
Which one referring
All involve pen asking student
question first student u ask student say ask student questioning first student clearly n case
The first example rather Does Jeff pen
needing confirmation every single student Jeff pen
That would O n
No
The check whether Jeff pen O n repeat check every student class hence O n Checking Jeff pen O operation performed across n student O n unless I missing something crazy checking pen possession
No asking every student Jeff pen say blame stealing deleted It O n operation
If I ask Jeff Do pen
O operation I one thing
If I verify every student class I ask meaning given student I ask question
Hence checking everyone class O operation
If however I checking every student pen right I ask student classmate meaning complexity would O O
If first student know need question people
The worst case scenario still n
deleted If ca identify O log n algorithm probable understand O log n mean
As algorithm analysis necessary understanding growth complexity respect size input
You measuring mapping result function amenable measured hard measure n n
galactic algorithm intuition
dictionary search proof usually inductive
n
Can happen without intentionally trying horrible
If spitballing idea problem find pretty wacky stuff
I really hate I trying solve problem I find
Last time happened I tried solve longest path problem challenge
If ca identify O log n algorithm probable understand O log n mean I think necessarily true analysis algorithm require rather deep mathematical result well beyond solving tricky recurrence
A lot analysis count operation really say comparison unique key whose bit length Θ log n claim reflect execution time
This quite confusing expect rigor
In general algorithm decision half search space algorithm
Most phone book example awful
The person trouble identifying long algorithm take
These example accurate help one bit
This answer relevant question It also give much better visual explanation O Log n see exactly would work traversing binary tree specific node
I personally like one better The main idea personally helped grasp best idea dividing problem sub problem
Everyone keep throwing around thread one actually explains mean relevant
I think fairly straight forward see cutting n half every step clearly different removing n every step therefore see different O n O log n Oh even better
Thanks link
I like display size divided
As commenter stackoverflow point binary tree since node split conveys general idea well
I like explanation example clear
Let upvote something else top
He seems want know binary tree traversal related log n much simpler answer along line When one level full binary tree one element binary tree
When two level full binary tree one element two element branching
When three level full binary tree two element second level two element branching You see going

Anyway becomes clear number element fit n level binary tree equal
This interesting give u way determine maximum number element given number level
But would manipulate equation give u number level number element
That flipped around logarithm
It happens number level equal processing time one spends traversing binary tree many element one must move worse case
So thought specific n
n proportional log n matter type use
Dude great explanation need upvotes
Disagree seems like example help answer running time function correct decide work involved function like sorting input divide conquer
He give tip decide amount work involved
He even suggest
True hardest part
Once accurately describe work required rest matching game
Yeah
And specific question O log n determine look every entry field
If infer thing entry without looking either O O log n determining difference two relatively easy
Can come better exemple
I feel like need go logarithm try explain algorithm logarithmic
The equation x solves equation thus algorithm cut away tenth possibility step would O log n run time How algorithm cut away possibility step
Imagine going hotel chain numbering system room would associated building floor room
If room could search room looking number easily
The first number eliminates room selecting one building second number cut away remaining room selecting one floor final number get rid final remaining room selecting room need visit
This algorithm would take step search thousand room
And logarithmic algorithm algorithm eliminates percentage search space step
Well much therefore le room confusion
I would say better example
If anybody new programming learned Big O Yes log super awesome
I would use example way try help person determine O
Instead I would tell person look function determine O
So specifically guy asks O log n
I would borrow one bit poster answer like O log n le O log n determine result without even considering every item field
In order would require incorrect item inspect eliminate item field possibility
This require inherent organization item operating determine item inspect right one also determine item right one
One way case field sorted examining single item determine whether item looking item
If adopt algorithm examine item field based upon whether item eliminate item every item
You repeat process half field remains continually find item looking
To honest phone book metaphor great one log n later I use
An example phone book looking entry name
The phone sorted name begin looking middle book
When see name higher name looking eliminate entire back half book go middle remaining front half
Repeat find item
You look every entry book eliminate half remaining book lookup
This O log n
Another case approximate location item looking determined value looking
So example looking first determines subset field item may eliminate rest
An example would multi story hotel
If example hotel room number consists two digit floor number two digit room number floor
When go room begin entering elevator pressing button corresponding first two digit room number
Then get floor examine room number floor find one match
Even room floor search room plus single button press elevator operation find one almost room
log n algorithm generally fall one two group one continual division field looking item middle remaining field one eliminate large portion field mathematical division field based upon value looking
Now back phone book idea
He explains looking entry phone book name O log n looking one phone number O n
But explain
So information becomes useful specific case looking phone book
I would go mention reason looking name O log n looking number O n book sorted name number
So look name determine something entry example single name every entry one come later alphabet every one come
So item high know every entry high also without examining
But looking number tell anything entry examine correct still search every item either side sure also correct
So must every item
This phone book search O log n name O n number
And book sorted number name would reversed
I could also explain height tree thing pretty well honestly next stackoverflow responder well I think point going
I belive mean algorithm scale order log N
So problem data point Log problem would take unit work made data point would take amount work
So log n problem scale much better say N N problem Other way put numeral system exponential counterpart logarithmic
So algorithm take within constant factor approximately much time digit length input
data point digit
data point digit
So practically instance double size dataset one second increase runtime
double size EDIT Derp Well computer science generally base log tends two
Things like binary search half list item search every iteration
So doubling size average mean one additional iteration
Yes generally base doesnt matter much fundamental part multiplying size input number N increase computation
multiplied data additive time
The base irrelevant since logarithm different base differ constant factor

So notation O n O n rest
So base customarily omitted
It really matter base
They proportional particular reason scale increase computation time second
That gist unit work nice wording
It scaling unit depend speed hardware etc
Something one might want add When one say algorithm run
O n time mean eventually scale worse n
So plot parabola n real time taken f n curve
In particular mean Close
It mean real time f n bounded cn constant So f n O n even though always curve
I dropped constant factor simplicity parent used unspecified unit work
It always possible set unit everything work
In word graph paper yay
line function f n problem size n runtime choose unit time f n plotted graph paper stay line
This correct
It important note class like specified like running time O depend model computation
A Turing Machine really meaningful algorithm running O input size model memory problem appropriate input data layout
Broader class like P supposed portable like Thesis complexity efficient machine agree P EXP etc
Scales critical word
deleted With matter difference different base constant factor
People always explain notation algorithm running time actually completely separate concept
O log n denotes set function
Roughly speaking set O log n set function grow faster function log For instance function sin n set
And function f n set
The criterion function f set f n n grow infinitely large n grows
So algorithm
We denote running time algorithm input size n function T n
For instance T may second T may second
We say running time algorithm O log n function T set
People always explain notation algorithm running time actually completely separate concept
In CS done common application
It one though
It also used memory usage network usage number costly function evaluation think numerical optimization finite resource one may want roughly quantify
When learn one context easy enough use others
People first learn counting apple whatnot apply orange quite readily
Nothing wrong teaching method
One usage CS I think mathematical Taylor series method suchlike say stuff like log x x x O x error order O h
This usage probably unfamiliar programmer numerical programming
O log n denotes set function
It one way defining even need liberal dose abuse notation explain away ubiquitously used
So little machinery even notation set theory used definition dubious usefulness particularly use algorithm O n way programmer ever encounter
It useful enlightening certainly way think thing
It one way defining even need liberal dose abuse notation explain away ubiquitously used
What alternative definition O f n make common usage precise
I think end roughly abuse notation regardless reason IMO commonly used one worst notation mathematics
In context CS I see vague definition good enough math really need precise definition want manipulate equation x term
One usage CS I think mathematical Taylor series method suchlike say stuff like log x x x O x error order O h
This usage probably unfamiliar programmer numerical programming
This standard usage many branch physic
It one way defining even need liberal dose abuse notation explain away ubiquitously used
So little machinery even notation set theory used definition dubious usefulness I realize talking specifically notation come meaning I disagree
I think amazingly useful say least discussion set function
As undergrad moment I heard idea gave good mental model understand concept notation better
And also made angry year everyone avoided stating term like made sense another issue And unlocked ability think thing like OK equivalence class lumping set difference set usually important similarity
Also I really know little machinery matter
If I using machinery find convenient good enough
I say physic velocity derivative displacement us tiny bit machinery calculus care still helpful insight
deleted So Can explain
It look worst case O n based size arr
Best case O length arr
So average case O
There finitely many input
Let C maximum run time required
On hand n duplicate guaranteed pigeonhole principle fast check inequality constant time C
So run time never max C C
haha awesome
go another equally important lesson always read spec carefully
Always
Honestly many would completely ignored hint
Beautiful
I know I bunch final I exam mode jumped right face
People rarely put extra useless information
That actually worst information like actually relevant
I blame algorithm professor
I even get actual algorithm I thought That bounded
The algorithm still growth characteristic n useful define
But expressed using O notation O notation concerned n approaching infinity
There O Ah I understand
Your code assumes O explanation make sense
julesjacobs already explained The criterion function f set f n changed log n grow infinitely large n grows
You could write instead
And yes kinda silly example
Time complexity comparing algorithm sleep routine really belong
Well unless talking sleepsort I suppose
P I realize like HashMap overly hashing algorithm
It would still slow O
Especially I trying weigh small frequently accessed HashMap like element
Or I List
In word O n O
I usually choose O I always unsure
O c O Constant factor matter You right corrected Well performance bottleneck like really frequently accessed map I benchmark I probably consider using even array opposed linked list I could easily map key hashmap index array
Chances though case I go whatever make sense I use like map I go map
But yeah depends doubt found bottleneck benchmark alternative
But correct example might well make sense go algorithm rather one constant time high enough
One thing always scare O c
You need use speed light also use O nicer unit
No need pull semimodern physic pure mathematics
Of course using Planck unit one
represents complexity run time
complex instruction let say building chair ikea step take le time complete step instruction
yet might prefer step instruction know everybody easily understand compatibility
programming first get working code optimize end step grow
So Why scare
I want meet algorithm whose time complexity approximated sin n
Sir algorithm taking long
Just feed extra slice pi
O sin n O At least extent O sin n limit sin infinity division zero generally
Big O notation used statistical physic function scale like given function incredibly large n anything grow le fast
Often used thing small instance see thing like O epsilon epsilon small number
This one problem notation whether limit taken infinity number hidden notation
In computer science limit almost always n get large mathematics physic often guess context
People always explain notation algorithm running time actually completely separate concept
So
In economics class loan might presented exponential function mean imply exponential function lending always money A simple way I always found explaining O log n mean amount calculation needing done increase function log And log n function given base grows every time n multiplied base number
Given base since
It obviously get really handy really high number multiplying drastic jump data point increase amount calculation needing done
Mandatory This cheat sheet already posted reddit ago clear simple explanation algorithm complexity I ever seen
Brilliant site
I actually learned algorithm complexity Uni implementing half algorithm data structure listed credit
In opinion way trully understand complexity various algorithm especially sorting algorithm sitting morning trying fix bug quick sort somehow put one element end list beginning sometimes even segfaults
In real sense something O log n mean case never need look input data solve problem
In fact need look small amount input data
And size input data grows amount data need look grows slowly
Understanding pretty easily come conclusion problem fall category rely part already solved
For instance looking something sorted list size n equivalently finding something balanced tree size n
Both operation assume list already sorted tree already balanced
Contrast something O n mean worst case need examine every piece data solve problem
O n mean worst case need examine every piece data n time solve problem
The way I always explain record many time algorithm need look element
If look le half element talking time
Terrible shorthand I know usually hold
If element look every element pretty simple
little complicated
That mean element look le element using shitty shorthand
fundamentally recursive
It mean additional element list amount processing done far element
The le half QUITE accurate
Basic array lookup iterate array index reached average half element seen linear time O n
Even O admittedly rare le half scale nearly well O log n
O log n time scale VERY well larger datasets represented well explanation
I say intentionally terrible shorthand
People right accurate way put element halve remaining element
I put much thought basically cheat sheet back CS class
Important note algorithm look exactly constant fraction input like still O n constant matter
O O n O logn generally mean point tree like divide conquer structure
If take balanced tree n element log n height many time divide get root algorithm use tree step get specific leaf
Or instead directly exploiting tree happen step situation like I need step time considering probability swap element sorting algorithm
O n n n usually mean repeat nested loop add another foreach like cartesian product
n logn logn logn would usually mean I tree structure ca always use probabilistic chance thing analysis expected time
I understand anyone problem O notation still highschool
The O notation kindergarden mathematics I think someone let ask sort thing Google average skilled programmer secretly hoping cheat way interview memorizing totally abstract unintuitive math
Pretty neat way put
Sorry downvotes getting
I guessing look le half element probably talking O log n time bogus
The rest pretty opinion
To O log n mean every time look one item cut number element need process half fixed ratio scale example reduce third reduce
Though difference scale factor intuitively seems huge u human affect constant factor big O
Thanks clarification good explanation difference looking half element v look element halve remaining element
Although I think might meant phrase correctly
While explains I always found hilarious O called big O notation obvious hard search know mean
I taught Latin ordo meaning order rank class native English speaking country
Well math get whole identifier use readability pretty much anywhere else
I suppose I self taught ground completely know little math algorithm I started learn difficult search information regarding
Self taught mean ca use course
Did browse wikipedia
Books local library late
From modern point view math syntax couple pretty severe flaw inconsistent hard type computer hard search search engine ignores thing put style guide programming language
Math written human programming language written computer
Do follow uncritically intuition programming
Programming Languages written human style guide certainly human choice alphabet
My point math syntax ignores thing put style guide programming language
Of course interhuman communication programming math
I emphasizing difference two
Yeah compiler surely need descriptive name
Some thing came existence long search engine even dreamed possible fyi
I really see counterintuitive either since O f n literally Order f n
Yeah tell think name fly
Sometimes I heard said order n
Well n indicates size input get
O f operator tels long take algorithm finish worst case scenario also Ω f operator tell long take best case scenario Θ f operator tell exactly long take O f f
Now clarify operator apply magnitude exact number
For definition O f f n g n positive real function g mean number c n n
This might sound awful first really difficult
O f say big n long mulltiply g n constats n n n log n whatever f n smaller g n
Maybe easier understand via exaplmes
Let say computer execute operation every second pretty fast one
Let say input n size We also algorithm take n n log n n
operation
Let see long take finish
For n simple calculation
For long input take second
For For second
n harder calculate either second second second year
You see much longer take complete operation time
Let see log It second
You see much faster log n
In fact growth slows much n growth speed longer input
Just fun It take year complete long input
In scientific circle also known shitload time
Funfact universe like year finish I even willing calculate input
n
even worse
It go like year year even riddiculously big number So O log n mean wo take longer finsh algorithm stuff I calculated multiplied constant take one operation calculate result input
Note constant size O mean take operation finish calculation take point case O number grow number input case O log n grows really slowly see
Also note time I dod say log n log n whatever log This change base logarithm actually multiply divide constant know log n log n
Hope clear thing little bit
For input size n algorithm requires
logn operation
Or many time much touch element O n greater many element must touch le O n
Scanning list element operation
Thus O
And O n
Another algorithm example Input balanced tree n node Output A leaf One must traverse logn node one path reach leaf
Technically binary tree log base n tertiary log base n The linked post comment page explaining logarithmic function term algorithm building block tend yield complexity
If going answer question O log n mean
need provide qualitative discussion growth
Logarithmic complexity mean taken grows slowly respect size problem
In fact increase resource usage constant amount requires multiply size input
Obligatory phone book example Suppose take one second decide whether go left right turn page
Then additional second time affords doubling number entry phone book
You go searching million entry searching ten million using second
Unless really critical path usually mean
Big O mean Given list n element many element I need work worst case scenario
What work
Work element compared accessed
If I SEARCH algorithm I need compare element list one I searching
Each comparison unit work
In use case log n mean log base tend split list half
O n O n log n O n O log n O Are typical runtimes show
To address question say algorithm O log n mean worst case take log base two n operation get result
So I list element I Binary search log rounding say take longer comparison find result value
Are asking O part mean log n mean
First log n mean
If already familiar logarithm think log n number time cut n half get
How many time cut half reach
already log
How many time cut half cut
Just log
How many time cut half get
time log
In mathematical term log n inverse function
ie log
O log n set function pretty much thing log n
Basically function f n said O log n n get big enough f n log n differ constant
This often described saying f n log n grow rate
For example consider f n log n
Suppose n huge number like
Then f n log n log n
These number basically point irrelevant
log n O log n
As another example consider n
This function also O log n
The matter end n log n
These two function differ constant ie fit definition growing rate
As example function O log n consider simple function f n Once n get big f n get much much bigger log n even multiplying f n constant like wo stop passing log n see note flat log n function look compared n million So stuff math
How relate
We want describe running time algorithm function f n n size input f n long code take run say second
Obviously way characterize function general
Certain computer faster processor run code faster certain machine language might generate better instruction make code run faster etc
But factor contribute constant running time eg faster cpu may let code run fast n f n O class
Basically faster computer faster programming language thing like affect running time function generally affect O class running time belongs
So tend describe algorithm O class since likely matter machine execute code
Going back log n fairly easy understand certain algorithm run O log n
Remember log n number time cut n half get one
Consider binary search given sorted list number want find particular one
So check middle number see target number greater le
Either way removing half possible number input
Then get single number ie n
So something like binary search run O log n
It log n since initialization code need run fast cpu run thing like affect specific running time running time something grows rate log n
What I described actually logarithm logarithm
In general logarithm number time need divide something b get
So log base
Equivalently log base b inverse function b
This technically O mean
What I described actually closer Θ mean
Something O f n actually mean grows fast f n
So say algorithm O log n saying running time ca possibly worse log n could also better
But want layman term size computation grows problem size increased
It separate computationally easy problem solve difficult
O log n basically mean computational cost grows slowly problem size increased O n O n It mean O n algorithm slower O log n sufficiently large n O log n theoretically always faster O n neglecting hairy hardware detail actually matter real world often complex relationship particular size n selected
Here figure I made gnuplot help visualize different complexity
And better one larger scale It mean add constant amount runtime algorithm need increase size input whatever n represents order magnitude
deleted Does matter
n n b base becomes constant factor ignore constant factor notation
So matter base logarithm
deleted Beyond log really much standard definition generally mean whatever make sense context
When first introduced log people taught log mean log advanced calculus book often use mean natural log c people often use mean binary log
It possible notation used way least one I never seen course textbook work
log without specified base usually mean math computer science used natural number
But even strict meaning base actually matter
Converting one base another involves dividing value depends base constant since care constant coefficient big O notation actual base logarithm irrelevant
log without specified base usually mean math Actually
In mathematics log default natural logarithm base e
It depends ask
Many prefer use ln mean natural log avoid confusion
The default something taught child engineer
I aware math people use ln use log mean base default
Huh I always seen ln
I guess going said used differently math course
We used lg n college like everyone already noted matter one way another
In case complexity generally care base
Different field different textbook use different notation
There standardized notation sort
And O log n mean log base anyway
Most notably hash linear search log base
O log n mean increase number item number operation needed increase approximately logarithmic rate
get curve instead straight line slope list sorted algorith O log n work like
get midle index check bigger smaller want
want smaller value thing first par bigger one
ex searching something index begining index found

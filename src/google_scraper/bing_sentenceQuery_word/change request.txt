A change request important document part change management process state data reason change application system
A change request declarative document meaning clear concise information need achieved change implemented well related information
Change management creates set standard rule need followed change request document
For every major change respect scope project change request must completed
Sometimes certain change management allows minor change carried without requirement change request document
In organization change request document mostly follows standard template created change management
This ensures streamlined standard process change request document respect information filled
Change request minimum need approved concerned change control supervisor designated charge change request approval
Change request initiated internally example case software hardware upgrade
However change request mostly initiated user case identification defect bug problem management event patch development application system modification standard application need senior management
Once change request created necessary step need undertaken per process defined change control ensure request completed satisfied according requirement change initiator
All information related change request must documented clearly concisely

CS All build effort already led parent teacher school district state private sector leader across country
Last year tech job across United States unfilled percent STEM job projected computer field
Computer science data science important tech sector many industry including transportation healthcare education financial service
Parents increasingly recognize need
However estimate one quarter school United States offer computer science programming coding state still allow count towards high school graduation even advanced economy making available student
Wide disparity exist even access course
In addition course access challenge medium portrayal classroom curriculum material unconscious bias stereotype exacerbate problem discourage many student taking course
For example
These statistic mirror current makeup America largest innovative tech firm woman compose le technical employee le percent
We better
Tech career exciting fun collaborative well critical economy
We want Americans opportunity part team
CS For All help make reality ensure every student access Computer Science classroom level
When come computer science student President Obama led way CS Student became first President write line code
His first line code moveForward CS All moving forward together
Who taught code
A student named Adrianna Newark New Jersey took computer science course school
If President start learning computer science
We know need basic tool make possible including teacher infrastructure
Thanks President well way making happen closing connectivity divide school half empowering million student broadband enlisting school district cause
And order make sure youth pathway workforce adult access skill President expanded city state rural area

Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

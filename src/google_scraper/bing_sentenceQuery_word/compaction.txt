My operating system textbook say compaction process rearranges disk block free disk block form contiguous chunk free disk space
But I always thought defragmentation
Are two term
Or I missing something
In modern disk operating system file subdivided block may stored arbitrary location disk
Files read quickly physical disk block stored consecutively I think every OS created since without difficulty create file larger single largest consecutive free area disk provided total size free area sufficient hold file
Such file end different piece stored different part disk thus accessing often fast entire file stored consecutively
Conceptually ideal disk arrangement would content every file stored consecutively file stored unused block consecutive range
Such arrangement would compacted defragmented
In general though amount effort arrange everything perfectly seldom worthwhile obvious exception disk written never modified would typically case

Defragmenting disk move block make file consecutive sequence block disk necessarily attempt eliminate free area file
Compacting disk consolidate free area moving data later part disk unused location earlier part may cause fragmentation existing file
Generally software performs defragmentation try avoid creating many scattered free area software performs compaction try avoid causing needle fragmentation depending upon software trying
maximize efficiency existing file versus preparing large contiguous area space preparation large operation need run smoothly software may focus one kind operation expense
mean moving memory area eliminate hole caused terminated five process A B C D E allocated memory
After sometime process B D terminated
Now memory layout
After applying compaction instead two memory unit one memory unit
mean storing complete file smallest number contiguous region
That try store file one complete unit size contiguous memory available
Suppose process A fragment process B fragment
Now suppose memory layout defragmentation
Defragmentation also contribute compaction

Though ca see much Earth surface made rock
And far common type rock find
As name implies rock composed sediment pressed glued together
Sedimentary rock cover whopping Earth surface
They also important Earth history contain remnant organism rock
Sedimentary rock take LONG time form four stage involved process
These include
While step process important others lesson going focus sedimentation phase sediment transformed rock specifically
Ready get started
Sedimentation final step process sedimentary rock creation
Before sedimentation occur sediment produced rock weathering erosion deposited laid horizontal layer
As new layer added sediment accumulates top old sediment transformation rock begin
The first step called
The weight sediment push sediment compact pushing sediment particle tightly together
In sediment particle water get pushed particle get pushed together
I mean else going go
As water pushed sediment particle begin next step sedimentation called
This water special contains dissolved compound fill tiny space sediment particle combined water glue particle together like cement
The type particle glued together influence type sedimentary rock produced
For example iron oxide produce beautiful orange rock like see Bryce Canyon National Park
Limestone type sedimentary rock made calcium carbonate shell coral fragment marine organism
Much Rocky Mountains composed different type sedimentary rock sandstone dolomite shale
And might surprised learn coal sedimentary rock form organic material dead plant animal matter
Get FREE access day create account
As might imagine since many different type sediment compacted compaction occur different type environment
Rainforests dry forest sand dune mountain stream lake river ocean beach delta example compaction eventually cementation occur
common type rock find Earth surface
They form process involves
Through weathering erosion sediment created rock
These particle deposited horizontal layer new layer added older layer underneath packed weight
This first step sedimentation called
As sediment compacted together second phase sedimentation occurs called
Here water dissolved compound pushed glue sediment together like cement
There many different type particle dissolved compound make many different kind sedimentary rock find Earth
Iron oxide produce bright red orange sedimentary rock fragment shell skeleton marine organism calcium carbonate create limestone sedimentary rock
Other type sedimentary rock include dolomite sandstone shale even coal
And since find many different type sedimentary rock Earth come surprise sedimentation occur many different environment well

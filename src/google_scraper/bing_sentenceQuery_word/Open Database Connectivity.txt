In mean software communicate
The term used whether client server different machine
The client us database connection send receive reply server
A database stored file set file magnetic disk tape optical disk secondary storage device
The information file may broken record consists one field
Fields basic unit data storage field typically contains information pertaining one aspect attribute entity described database
Records also organized table include information relationship various field
Although database applied loosely collection information computer file database strict sense provides capability
Connections key concept programming
Since require considerable time connect used improve performance
No command performed database without open available connection
Connections built supplying underlying used address specific provide instance user authentication credential example
Once connection built opened closed property command length one exists set
The connection string consists set pair dictated data access interface data provider
Some database allow one operation performed time connection
If request data statement sent database returned connection open available operation client finish consuming result set
Other database later impose limitation
However database allow multiple concurrent operation connection usually incur far overhead allow one operation time
Database connection take disproportionately long time create relative operation performed
It inefficient application create close database connection whenever need update database
technique designed alleviate problem
A pool database connection created shared among application need access database
When application need database access request connection pool
When finished return connection pool becomes available use application
The connection object obtained connection pool often around actual database connection
The wrapper handle relationship pool internally hide detail pool application
For example wrapper object implement close method called like close method database connection
Unlike method database connection method wrapper may actually close database connection might instead return pool
The application need aware connection pooling call method wrapper object
This approach encourages practice opening connection application needed closing soon work done rather holding connection open entire life application
In manner relatively small number connection service large number request
This also called
In hand persistent connection typically used server state managed
This state includes functional setting
It desirable set limit number connection pool
Using many connection may cause rather get useful work done
In case operation attempted connection use operation block connection returned pool error may returned

Open Database Connectivity Definition ODBC A standard accessing different database system
There interface programming language Visual Basic Visual SQL etc ODBC driver pack contains driver database Access Excel etc Search Open Database Connectivity UK US Search Open Database Connectivity rest Computing Students

Open Database Connectivity ODBC interface standard accessing data communicating database system regardless operating system OS database system DS programming language
This accomplished using ODBC driver serve bridge application database system
In group manufacturer introduced ODBC model communication solution large number OSs DSs application written different programming language
For example application written C access Oracle database UNIX rewritten application changed Windows database platform moved Sybase
These manufacturer recognized need intermediate translation mechanism created set protocol application programming interface APIs first ODBC model
The ODBC model contains following three major component The driver function similar human translator bridge gap party would otherwise understand

Learn something new every day email Open Database Connectivity ODBC interface computer application database
This interface provides buffer layer database software used access
This mean software may connect database regardless platform method long system use ODBC
Essentially two program speak language Open Database Connectivity routine translate information
The original Open Database Connectivity system developed
This system operated well circumstance others
In released Version system coincided adopted base standard structured language
As part SQL standard interface became widely used sort different database purpose
Before adoption Open Database Connectivity program needed coded method talking different style database
Programmers believed system would need access three different type database three different command function programmed system
Databases redundancy program required information sent specific manor
If either program syntax encountered unfamiliar system communication possible
This changed development implementation Open Database Connectivity
This essentially work translator
The programmer database application write method use syntax used ODBC
When application requires information sends query ODBC translates syntax method used database
The database sends answer back ODBC translates back syntax required application
This process work via installed set driver
Each database specific Open Database Connectivity driver associated
This driver actual translation database outside world
If change specification make driver obsolete driver need changing rest database may remain unaltered
This allows update interface without lot additional coding work
Applications essentially Open Database Connectivity driver built
These driver part programming application
They may updated program receives patch separate standard ODBC system
The real communication happens driver set
The program driver translate information actually sent
The database driver receive request language get information send still ODBC syntax
The program driver take information back translate back program language
This system creates interface nearly foolproof actual designer system make interface
One editor review suggestion make change warranted
Note depending number suggestion receive take anywhere hour day
Thank helping improve wiseGEEK

pronounced separate letter Short method developed SQL Access group
The goal ODBC make possible access regardless handling data
ODBC manages inserting middle layer called database application DBMS
The purpose layer translate application data DBMS understands

brings together idea explore early moment universe following big bang
According inflation theory universe created unstable energy state forced rapid expansion universe early moment
One consequence universe vastly bigger anticipated far larger size observe telescope
Another consequence theory predicts uniform distribution energy flat geometry previously explained within framework
Developed particle physicist Alan Guth inflation theory today generally considered component big bang theory even though central idea big bang theory well established year prior development inflation theory
The proven quite successful year especially confirmed discovery cosmic microwave background CMB radiation
Despite great success theory explain aspect universe saw three major problem remaining The big bang model seemed predict curved universe energy distributed evenly lot magnetic monopoles none matched evidence
Particle physicist Alan Guth first learned flatness problem lecture Cornell University Robert Dicke
Over next couple year Guth applied concept particle physic situation developed inflation model early universe
Guth presented finding January lecture Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
His revolutionary idea principle quantum physic heart particle physic could applied early moment big bang creation
The universe would created high energy density
Thermodynamics dictate density universe would forced expand extremely rapidly
Those interested detail essentially universe would created false vacuum Higgs mechanism turned put another way exist
It would gone process supercooling seeking stable state true vacuum Higgs mechanism switched supercooling process drove inflationary period rapid expansion
How rapidly
The universe would doubled size every second
Within second universe would doubled size time enough expansion explain flatness problem
Even universe curvature started much expansion would cause appear flat today
Consider size Earth large enough appears u flat even though know surface stand curved outside sphere
Similarly energy distributed evenly started small part universe part universe expanded quickly major uneven distribution energy far away u perceive
This solution homogeneity problem
The problem theory far Guth could tell inflation began would continue forever
There seemed clear mechanism place
Also space continually expanding rate previous idea early universe presented Sidney Coleman would work
Coleman predicted phase transition early universe took place creation tiny bubble coalesced together
With inflation place tiny bubble moving away fast ever coalesce
Fascinated prospect Russian physicist Andre Linde attacked problem realized another interpretation took care problem side remember Andreas Albrecht Paul Steinhardt came similar solution
This newer variant theory one really gained traction throughout eventually became part established big bang theory
Inflation Theory go several name including There also two closely related variant theory minor distinction
In theory inflation mechanism happen immediately following big bang rather happens different region space time
They posit number bubble universe part
Some physicist point prediction present version inflation theory really consider distinct theory
Being quantum theory field interpretation inflation theory
In approach driving mechanism
While concept modern cosmological theory also accelerates expansion universe mechanism involved appear different involved inflation theory
One area interest cosmologist way inflation theory might lead insight dark energy vice versa

Get news Let friend social network know reading What A grade mean
A link posted Facebook feed
To find Facebook commenting please read There time C meant average
The average GPA college university risen
And according Stuart Rojstaczer former Duke University professor founder GPAs keep rising
At college Rojstaczer say grade given A
And student may happy begs question What A grade mean
In fair grading system reward people outstanding achievement Rojstaczer say
It fair system student working hard creative excel
Grade inflation lower intensity intellectual level many class
According Rojstaczer grade inflation began earnest Vietnam War era student flunked college drafted army
Professors began awarding high grade prevent student deployed
When war ended grade went back
But grade began slowly rise
It driven university concerned past enrollment particular class Rojstaczer say
Departments whose budget depend enrollment want make sure class full
Rojstaczer claim student evaluation course contribute uptick GPA
Evaluations influence tenure promotion retention college professor
Professors therefore often feel pressured please student
Students know A mean anymore say Christopher Healy professor computer science Furman University study grade inflation Rojstaczer
It particular significance except everybody agrees really good grade It unsustainable trend
But grade inflation may help student succeed job graduate school application
published scientific journal July indicated final GPA determined whether student accepted regardless difficulty school
It difficult admission officer make right decision comparing candidate different grade inflation environment say Samuel Swift lead author study
Even know difficult discount
In first part study Swift colleague asked college admission officer ass fictitious applicant MBA program
In scenario candidate college equal quality different average GPAs
Swift found student highest GPAs likely accepted regardless average GPA school
Swift also found beneficial applicant high GPA relative undergraduate class based year real admission data four MBA program
It also helped attend college higher average GPA
In Princeton University advising professor cap A grade around
A faculty committee created October policy due student concern grade deflation hurt competitiveness graduate school
There evidence indicate Princeton graduate le successful getting graduate school professional school getting hired say Richard Kamber professor philosophy College New Jersey written extensively grade inflation
It exactly draconian say Kamber Princeton policy
It act leadership part
They actually suggesting institution consider thing
Yale attempted institute similar measure spring postponed voting change due major outcry student body
In spring A
Grade inflation affect college equally
Rojstaczer Healy finding indicate grade inflation pervasive private college
At community college Healy say grade actually going slightly student flunking
There also large interdisciplinary gap grade inflation
For fun I took recent data I could quite college across country say Healy examined unpublished data college
The toughest subject math
At opposite extreme education
Healy found tougher subject included biology chemistry mathematics economics education fine art tended grade easy
For education grade A music A Healy say
Contrast mathematics
Still Healy belief trend continue least foreseeable future
To great extent status quo working
Students succeeding say
The problem time go year year grade distribution becoming le le realistic

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I keep coming across reference question answer stackexchange I look meaning web obviously finding reference site Wikipedia
However none reference really answer question fixed point mean world computer science
In computer science arguably prominent use
A lattice partially ordered set S additional property given two element x S set x supremum infimum S
Now often consider function f lattice converge x S f x
Important result area
A prominent example lattice A set f induced inductive definition
For example let A define language L align w L L aw L baw L bw L abw bbw L align This inductive definition corresponds monotone function f A A baw aw abw bbw bw By theorem know f smallest fixpoint supremum smaller intermediate result correspond finitely often applying constructor inductive definition smallest fixpoint indeed L
By way fixpoint also us see example
In recursion theory another theorem also due Kleene
It Let r N N total computable function intuition compiler
Then N r
In fact even infinitely many finitely many could patch r contradicting theorem
Let elaborate bit meisterluk answer Imagine trying define factorial function remember definition factorial function Now PL framework namely immediately obvious define function
However may easy define following function take input function natural number There use recursion function definition
However way finding function Fact n n every n easy check indeed implementation factorial function
Now framework like one nature fact exist make clear use general programing language
There many us notion computer science boil one I showed
prove certain exist able show certain function construct framework shown factorial function exists
A fixed point function f A A element x f x equal x
For example function two fixed point value function three fixed point
Mathematically definition
Now depending mathematical structure dealing many different reason interested fixed point
For example consider dynamic system look state world change like thermostat fixed point corresponds stable configuration
If think game mathematical sense game theory fixed point correspond equillibria think behaviour optimization routine iteratively improves solution fixed point corresponds optimal solution
So mathematical notion fixed point lot application lot different context
A common fundamental application fixed point computer science mathematically model loop recursive program
If try model program mathematical function loop recursion obvious model
This body loop program represented mathematical function
How derive function representing loop behaviour
It corresponds applying loop body repeatedly conjunction loop guard change possible
Similarly model recursive program mathematically need mathematical notion mean function apply
This answer provided fixed point
A function mathematics map input output value
Fixed point input value function map output value satisfying equality input
For equality function f x x set input value equal set fixed point function
For function f x set fixed point limited
As far computer science concerned talking lot change definition fixed point u
You might also confused totally different topic concept represent real number memory
But name fixed point reference topic general point
major subarea CS important concept fixed point theorem

Well understand concept better faculty Inflation Assignment Help used example
Consider situation commodity priced buck income consumer buck
Now assuming person spends income buy five good said income buck
Now consider situation
Imagine inflation price good initially priced buck available buck
So consumer able buy two unit product whereas previously used able buy five unit product
Now change ability buy product given amount said purchasing power purchasing parity consumer economy
So understood basic term time learn cause inflation

economic concept defined two different way mean thing
First inflation measure rate price rise
Remember hearing story grandparent able buy candy bar nickel local grocery store younger
That candy bar probably cost
That general economic rule price tend rise time
The second way define inflation rate money loses value
If think price going value one dollar going really thing
Inflation reason need money today needed five year ago buy something
economic condition often seen country emerging economy inflation extremely high increasing rapid pace
The typical inflation rate United States healthy economy around two percent per year
In Zimbabwe experienced day annualized inflation rate eight billion percent
Yes read correctly eight billion percent
Had rate continued entire year something cost day one would cost billion end year
Lucky Zimbabwe hyperinflation continue rate entire year
But lasted long enough Zimbabwe distinguished honor printing largest denomination currency ever trillion dollar bill
At time printed worth American dollar
There two primary cause hyperinflation basically fault
When hyperinflation really take hold like Zimbabwe example example Germany World War I Hungary World War II usually two factor occurring simultaneously
The first cause market begin lose faith country currency
In case market mean consumer user currency
Remember currency good government issuing currency consumer believe government wo honor promissory note cash issuing nobody want hold cash
I pretty confident dollar still legitimate currency tomorrow I sell something exchange dollar
But Zimbabwe I might confidence
Why would I sell loaf bread today giving something may worthless tomorrow
The cause hyperinflation actually caused government issuing currency
As government print money value money go like value commodity decrease supply increase
The government may print money pay debt start inflation cycle
That people confidence government start hyperinflation ball rolling start difficult stop
Get FREE access day create account
When hyperinflation full force really little done
Eventually paper money printed worth money seen picture Germany World War I people would burn money stay warm
When happens people stop using money mean exchange start bartering trading one another
At point government one choice start making new money
In every case hyperinflation government end simply saying money money anymore
It take old bill circulation start issuing new series currency
When Zimbabwe trillion bill became bill overnight
By resetting currency government take care one cause oversupply
If keep supply reasonable help keep inflation check
But cause confidence government left consumer decide
economic concept defined two different way mean thing
First inflation measure rate price rise
The second way define inflation rate money loses value
economic condition often seen country emerging economy inflation extremely high increasing rapid pace
There two primary cause hyperinflation basically fault
The first cause market begin lose faith country currency
The cause hyperinflation actually caused government issuing currency
As government print money value money go
In every case hyperinflation government end simply saying money money anymore
It take old bill circulation start issuing new series currency

Is problem printing money printing money
Is fact way printed money get circulation fed buy bond thus get money economy
What logical rabbit trail lead inflation printing money
Would solving deflation way work today low interest rate
Why
Deflation hot topic since fear deflation look like subside anytime soon
Thanks topic suggestion
The article explains inflation occurs money becomes relatively le valuable good
Then deflation simply opposite time money becoming relatively valuable good economy
Following logic article deflation occur combination four factor Before decide Fed increase money supply determine much problem deflation really Fed influence money supply
First look problem caused deflation
Most economist agree deflation disease symptom problem economy
In Don Luskin examines James Paulsen differentation good deflation bad deflation
Paulsen definition clearly looking deflation symptom change economy
He describes good deflation occuring business able constantly produce good lower lower price due initiative efficiency gain
This simply factor The supply good go list four factor cause deflation
Paulsen refers good deflation since allows GDP growth remain strong profit growth surge unemployment fall without inflationary consequence
Bad deflation difficult concept define
Paulsen simply state bad deflation emerged even though selling price inflation still trending lower corporation longer keep cost reduction efficiency gain
Both Luskin I difficulty answer seems like half explanation
Luskin concludes bad deflation actually caused revaluation country monetary unit account country central bank
In essence really factor The supply money go list
So bad deflation caused relative decline money supply good deflation caused relative increase supply good
These definition inherently flawed deflation caused change
If supply good year increase supply money year increase causing deflation good deflation bad deflation
Since supply good increased good deflation since central bank increased money supply fast enough also bad deflation
Asking whether good money caused deflation like asking When clap hand left hand right hand responsible sound
Saying good grew fast money grew slowly inherently saying thing since comparing good money good deflation bad deflation term probably retired
Looking deflation disease tends get agreement among economist
Luskin say true problem deflation cause problem business relationship If borrower contractually committed making loan payment represent purchasing power time asset bought loan begin declining nominal price
If lender chance borrower default loan condition
Colin Asher economist Nomura Securities told Radio Free Europe problem deflation deflation declining spiral
Businesses make le profit cut back employment
People feel le like spending money
Businesses make profit everything work declining spiral
Deflation also psychological element becomes rooted people psychology becomes
Consumers discouraged buying expensive item like automobile home know thing cheaper future
Mark Gongloff agrees opinion
Gongloff explains price fall simply people desire buy leading vicious cycle consumer postponing spending believe price fall business ca make profit pay debt leading cut production worker leading lower demand good lead even lower price
While I polled every economist written article deflation give good idea general consensus subject
A psychological factor overlooked many worker look wage nominal term
The problem deflation force causing price general drop cause wage drop well
Wages however tend rather sticky downward direction
If price rise give employee raise roughly well
This equivalent situation price drop cut pay employee
However employee looking wage nominal term much happier raise pay cut
A low level inflation make easier adjust wage industry whereas deflation cause rigidity labor market
These rigidity lead inefficient level labor usage slower economic growth
Now seen reason deflation undesirable must ask What done deflation
Of four factor listed easiest one control number The supply money
By increasing money supply cause inflation rate rise avoid deflation
In order understand work first need definition money supply
The money supply dollar bill wallet coin pocket
Economist Anna Schwartz follows The money supply comprises currency dollar bill coin issue Treasury various kind deposit held public commercial bank depository institution saving loan credit union
There three broad measure economist use looking money supply narrow measure money function medium exchange broader measure also reflects money function store value still broader measure cover item many regard close substitute money
The Federal Reserve several option disposal order influence money supply thereby raise lower inflation rate
The common way Federal Reserve change inflation rate changing interest rate
The Fed influence interest rate cause supply money change
Suppose Fed wish lower interest rate
It buying government security exchange money
By buying security market supply security go
This cause price security go interest rate decline
The relationship price security interest rate explained third page article The Dividend Tax Cut Interest Rates
When Fed want lower interest rate buy security injects money system give holder bond money exchange security
So Federal Reserve increase money supply lowering interest rate buying security decrease money supply raising interest rate selling security
Influencing interest rate commonly used method reducing inflation avoiding deflation
Gongloff CNN Money site Federal Reserve study say Japan deflation could dodged example Bank Japan BOJ cut interest rate percentage point
Colin Asher point sometimes interest rate low method controlling deflation longer option currently Japan interest rate practically zero
Changing interest rate circumstance effective way controling deflation controlling money supply
We finally get original question Is problem printing money printing money
Is fact way printed money get circulation fed buy bond thus get money economy
That precisely happens
The money Fed get buy government security come somewhere
Generally created order Fed carry open market operation
So instance economist talk printing money Fed lowering interest rate talking thing
If interest rate already zero Japan little room lower using policy fight deflation work well
Fortunately interest rate yet reached low Japan
Next week look seldom used way influencing money supply United States may want consider order fight deflation
If like ask question deflation comment story please use feedback form

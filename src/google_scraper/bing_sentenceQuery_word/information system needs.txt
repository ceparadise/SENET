Upon successful completion chapter able If reading likely taking course information system even know course going cover
When tell friend family taking course information system explain
For past several year I taught Introduction Information Systems course
The first day class I ask student tell think information system
I generally get answer computer database These good answer definitely incomplete one
The study information system go far beyond understanding technology
Let begin study defining information system
Almost program business require student take course something called
But exactly term mean
Let take look popular definition first Wikipedia couple textbook As I stated earlier I spend first day information system class discussing exactly term mean
Many student understand information system something database spreadsheet
Others mention computer
And right least part information system made different component work together provide value organization
The first way I describe information system student tell made five component hardware software data people process
The first three fitting technology category generally student think asked define information system
But last two people process really separate idea information system technical field computer science
In order fully understand information system student must understand component work together bring value organization
Technology thought application scientific knowledge practical purpose
From invention wheel harnessing electricity artificial lighting technology part life many way tend take granted
As discussed first three component information system hardware software data fall category technology

Like software data also intangible
By piece data really useful
But aggregated indexed organized together database data become powerful tool business
In fact definition presented beginning chapter focused information system manage data
Organizations collect kind data use make decision
These decision analyzed effectiveness organization improved
Chapter focus data database us organization
Besides component hardware software data long considered core technology information system suggested one component added communication
An information system exist without ability communicate first personal computer machine access Internet
However today world extremely rare computer connect another device network
Technically networking communication component made hardware software core feature today information system become category
We covering networking chapter
When thinking information system easy get focused technology component forget must look beyond tool fully understand integrate organization
A focus people involved information system next step
From worker system analyst programmer way chief information officer CIO people involved information system essential element must overlooked
The people component covered chapter
The last component information system process
A process series step undertaken achieve desired outcome goal
Information system becoming integrated organizational process bringing productivity better control process
But simply automating activity using technology enough business looking effectively utilize information system
Using technology manage improve process within company externally supplier customer ultimate goal
Technology buzzword business process reengineering business process management enterprise resource planning continued improvement business procedure integration technology
Businesses hoping gain advantage competitor highly focused component information system
We discus process chapter
Now explored different component information system need turn attention role information system play organization
So far looked component information system component actually organization
From definition see component collect store organize distribute data throughout organization
In fact might say one role information system take data turn information transform organizational knowledge
As technology developed role evolved backbone organization
To get full appreciation role information system play review changed year

Some author make clear distinction information system
Information system typically include ICT component purely concerned ICT focusing instead end use information technology
Information system also different business process
Information system help control performance business process
Alter argues advantage viewing information system special type
A work system system human machine perform process activity using resource produce specific product service customer
An information system work system whose activity devoted capturing transmitting storing retrieving manipulating displaying information
As information system one hand activity system
An information system form system data represent processed form social memory
An information system also considered support human decision making action
Information system primary focus study
Silver et al
provided two view IS includes software hardware data people procedure
Zheng provided another also add process essential element like environment boundary purpose interaction
The defines Information system specialist focus ing integrating information technology solution business process meet information need business enterprise
There various type information system example office information system
Critical information system information technology typically designed enable human perform task human brain well suited handling large amount information performing complex calculation controlling many simultaneous process
Information technology important malleable resource available executive
Many company created position CIO sits executive board CEO CFO COO CTO
The CTO may also serve CIO vice versa
The CISO focus information security management
The six component must come together order produce information system Information system organizational procedure need computer software data erroneous IE accounting system using ledger ink utilizes information system Data bridge hardware people
This mean data collect data involve people
At point data information
The classic view Information system found textbook pyramid system reflected hierarchy organization usually bottom pyramid followed ending top
Although pyramid model remains useful since first formulated number new technology developed new category information system emerged longer fit easily original pyramid model
Some example system A essentially IS using computer technology carry planned task
The basic component information system The first four component hardware software database network make known information technology platform
Information technology worker could use component create information system watch safety measure risk management data
These action known information technology service
Certain information system support part organization others support entire organization still others support group organization
Recall department functional area within organization collection application program information system
These functional area information system FAIS supporting pillar general IS namely system
As name suggest FAIS support particular function within organization
accounting IS finance IS production operation management POM IS marketing IS human resource IS
In finance accounting manager use IT system forecast revenue business activity determine best source us fund perform audit ensure organization fundamentally sound financial report document accurate
Other type organizational information system FAIS system executive dashboard system
Dashboards special form IS support manager organization
They provide rapid access timely information direct access structured information form report
Expert system attempt duplicate work human expert applying reasoning capability knowledge expertise within specific domain
Information technology department larger organization tend strongly influence development use application information technology organization
A series methodology process used develop use information system
Many developer use engineering approach SDLC systematic procedure developing information system stage occur sequence
Recent research aim enabling measuring ongoing collective development system within organization entirety human actor
An information system developed house within organization outsourced
This accomplished outsourcing certain component entire system
A specific case geographical distribution development team
A information system following definition technologically implemented medium land information system disaster information system example emerging information system broadly considered spatial information system
System development done stage include The field study called encompasses variety topic including system analysis design computer networking information security database management decision support system
deal practical theoretical problem collecting analyzing information business function area including business productivity tool application programming implementation electronic commerce digital medium production data mining decision support
deal telecommunication technology
Information system bridge using theoretical foundation study various business model related process building IT system within computer science discipline
field studying computer algorithmic process including principle software hardware design application impact society whereas IS emphasizes functionality design
Several IS scholar debated nature foundation Information Systems root reference discipline others
Information system also defined collection hardware software data people procedure work together produce quality information
Similar computer science discipline seen related foundation discipline IS
The domain study IS involves study theory practice related social technological phenomenon determine development use effect information system organization society
But may considerable overlap discipline boundary discipline still differentiated focus purpose orientation activity
In broad scope term scientific field study address range strategic managerial operational activity involved gathering processing storing distributing use information associated technology society organization
The term information system also used describe organizational function applies IS knowledge industry government agency organization
often refers interaction algorithmic process technology
This interaction occur within across organizational boundary
An information system technology organization us also way organization interact technology way technology work organization business process
Information system distinct IT information system information technology component interacts process component
One problem approach prevents IS field interested use ICT social networking computer gaming mobile personal usage etc
A different way differentiating IS field neighbour ask Which aspect reality meaningful IS field field
This approach based philosophy help define focus purpose orientation also dignity destiny responsibility field among field

Information Systems worker enter number different career There wide variety career path information system discipline
Workers specialized technical knowledge strong communication skill best prospect
Workers management skill understanding business practice principle excellent opportunity company increasingly looking technology drive revenue
Information technology important operation contemporary business offer many employment opportunity
The information system field includes people organization design build information system people use system people responsible managing system
The demand traditional IT staff programmer business analyst system analyst designer significant
Many job exist area Information technology
At top list chief information officer CIO
The CIO executive charge IS function
In organization CIO work chief executive officer CEO chief financial officer CFO senior executive
Therefore actively participates organization strategic planning process
Information system research generally interdisciplinary concerned study effect information system behaviour individual group organization
Hevner et al
categorized research IS two scientific paradigm including develop verify theory explain predict human organizational behavior extends boundary human organizational capability creating new innovative artifact
Salvatore March Gerald Smith proposed framework researching different aspect Information Technology including output research research output activity carry research research activity
They identified research output follows Also research activity including Although Information Systems discipline evolving year core focus identity IS research still subject debate among scholar
There two main view around debate narrow view focusing IT artifact core subject matter IS research broad view focus interplay social technical aspect IT embedded dynamic evolving context
A third view call IS scholar pay balanced attention IT artifact context
Since study information system applied field industry practitioner expect information system research generate finding immediately applicable practice
This always case however information system researcher often explore behavioral issue much depth practitioner would expect
This may render information system research result difficult understand led criticism
In last ten year business trend represented considerable increasing Information Systems Function ISF role especially regard enterprise strategy operation supporting
It became increase productivity support new value creation
To study information system rather effect information system model used
The international body Information Systems researcher AIS Senior Scholars Forum Subcommittee Journals April proposed journal AIS deems nominated MISQ ISR JAIS JMIS EJIS ISJ

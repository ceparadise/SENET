In storage location identified paired associated contains known unknown quantity information referred
The variable name usual way stored value addition referring variable depending context
This separation name content allows name used independently exact information represents
The identifier computer value variable may thus change course
Variables programming may directly correspond concept
The latter reference physical object storage location
The value computing variable necessarily part mathematics
Variables computer programming frequently given long name make relatively descriptive use whereas variable mathematics often terse name brevity transcription manipulation
A variable storage location may referred several different identifier situation known
Assigning value variable using one identifier change value accessed identifier
replace variable symbolic name actual location data
While variable name type location often remain fixed data stored location may changed program execution
In value generally time
In variable expression keep single value entire due requirement
In imperative language behavior exhibited named symbolic constant typically contrasted normal variable
Depending programming language variable may able store specified

Alternatively datatype may associated current value allowing single variable store anything supported programming language
An identifier referencing variable used access variable order read value alter value edit variable access permission etc
For instance variable might referenced identifier variable contain number
If variable referenced identifier well using identifier value variable altered reading value using identifier yield result
If variable referenced single identifier simply called
Otherwise speak
For instance previous example name variable question another name variable
The variable describes program text variable may used describes program execution variable meaningful value
The scope variable actually property name variable extent property variable
These confused also called property program varies point source code execution see
Further may coincide variable lifetime many case tied variable lifetime
A variable name affect
important part variable
Most language define specific variable well named entity may differ within given program
The scope variable portion program code variable name meaning variable said visible
Entrance scope typically begin variable lifetime come context exit scope typically end lifetime go context
For instance variable meaningful within certain finely within block accordingly static resolution performable
Alternatively variable resolved based global binding stack depends specific control flow
Variables accessible within certain function termed
A one indefinite scope may referred anywhere program
hand runtime aspect variable
Each variable value runtime
The extent binding portion program execution time variable continues refer value memory location
A running program may enter leave given extent many time case
Unless programming language feature variable whose extent permanently outlasts scope result whereby memory allocated variable never freed since variable would used reference deallocation purpose longer accessible
However permissible variable binding extend beyond scope occurs Lisp C execution pass back variable scope variable may used
A variable whose scope begin extent said often undefined arbitrary value accessed see since yet explicitly given particular value
A variable whose extent end scope may become deemed uninitialized since value destroyed
Variables described previous two case may said
In many language error try use value variable extent
In language may yield
Such variable may however assigned new value give new extent
For space efficiency memory space needed variable may allocated variable first used freed longer needed
A variable needed scope thus beginning variable lifetime enters scope may give space unused variable
To avoid wasting space compiler often warn programmer variable declared used
It considered good programming practice make scope variable narrow feasible different part program accidentally interact modifying variable
Doing also prevents
Common technique different section program use different make individual variable private either
Many programming language employ reserved value often named indicate invalid uninitialized variable
In language variable also meaning certain kind value stored
For example variable type prohibited storing text value
In language value variable carry type
In situation exist simultaneously A variable given type undeclared assumed universal exists compile time
Values also type checked queried runtime
Typing variable also allows resolved compile time
However different polymorphism used function call referred resolve call based value type opposed supertypes variable allowed
Variables often store simple data like integer literal string programming language allow variable store value well
Such language may also enable function
These function operate like variable represent data multiple type
For example function named may determine length list
Such function may parametric polymorphic including type variable since amount element list independent element type
The function also referred variable
For instance code segment variable named given value function called
The integer give value
In language function parameter local scope
This specific variable named referred within function though course function also variable called
The specific variable allocation representation value vary widely among programming language among implementation given language
Many language implementation allocate space whose extent last single function call whose memory automatically reclaimed function return
More generally name variable bound address particular block contiguous sequence byte memory operation variable manipulate block
common variable whose value large unknown size code compiled
Such variable reference location value instead storing value allocated pool memory called
Bound variable value
A value however abstraction idea implementation value represented stored somewhere computer memory
The program must set aside memory data object since memory finite ensure memory yielded reuse object longer needed represent variable value
Objects allocated heap must object longer needed
In language runtime environment automatically reclaims object extant variable longer refer
In language program programmer must explicitly memory later free reclaim memory
Failure lead heap depleted program run risk eventual failure exhausting available memory
When variable refers created dynamically component may indirectly accessed variable
In circumstance garbage collector analogous program feature language lack garbage collector must deal case portion memory reachable variable need reclaimed
Unlike mathematical counterpart programming variable constant commonly take name

name commonly used auxiliary variable instance variable
Some naming convention enforced language level part language syntax involve format valid identifier
In almost language variable name start digit contain whitespace character
Whether punctuation mark permitted variable name varies language language many language permit variable name forbid punctuation
In programming language specific often punctuation character known prefixed appended variable identifier indicate variable type
variable name also varies language language require use certain case naming certain entity Most modern language older language
Some language reserve certain form variable name internal use many language name beginning two underscore often fall category
However beyond basic restriction imposed language naming variable largely matter style
At level variable name used exact name chosen matter computer
Thus name variable identify rest tool programmer make program easier write understand
Using poorly chosen variable name make code difficult review name name clear often encouraged
Programmers often create adhere code style guideline offer guidance naming variable impose precise naming scheme
Shorter name faster type le descriptive longer name often make program easier read purpose variable easier understand
However extreme verbosity variable name also lead le comprehensible code

Variables act storage location data program
They way naming information later usage
Each variable example variable name use
To store information variable write command using equal sign following way Thus end program value value value

Hey I got one I see someone answered similar question
Is one duplicate looking take
Either way problem
Thanks Cherryl I accidentally posted I done deleted
Just one moment I finish post
Here take let know question
What definition function loop control variable
A loop programming construct consists series one programming instruction loop control variable used determine exit series instruction
How loop control variable used determine loop terminate
The loop control variable must tested either processing instruction end processing instruction
The programmer set test control variable order ensure handled correctly
What counter
How used
A counter form loop control variable
It either incremented decremented either added subtracted
The counter tested decide whether end loop process
How value counter change loop executed
Depending programming language used programmer set full control counter change processing loop rely programming language automatically update counter
When counter updated automatically best update loop instruction may introduce error premature exit loop runaway process never pass test exit
How loop implemented different programming language
In Visual Basic loop common construct us counter set allow program automatically update counter example Dim X Integer Dim Y Integer For X Y X Next In loop look like int For int x x x Other loop construct consist
Visual Basic Dim X Integer Dim Y Integer Do While X Y Y X X X Loop int x int x x x x Cherryl Lewis online How JustAnswer work My Expert answered question promptly resolved issue totally

Learn without computer programming language
Includes exercise
As begin writing real code one first thing must familiarize variable close cousin constant
A variable according name something allows value vary
In programming use variable store data run program
A variable contrasted constant whose value allowed change
In programming use constant store information know never going change
Even though variable constant may sound different semantically reality quite similar
We start studying constant look variable variable easier understand understood constant
My name Erik I think fair say constant never ever change
The absolute zero temperature also constant never change either
The number second one hour constant well never change always second hour
A constant purpose computer programming consists two thing name value
The name clearly illustrate constant le
The value actual value constant example absolute zero number second hour
In programming book name constant uppercase letter
This allows u clearly identify constant soon run code thus able distinguish variable written using lower case letter
A constant created using const reserved word followed constant data type followed constant name finally followed sign value
Let create constant see look like
What would appropriate name constant example
Names variable constant always programmer suggestion For worry meaning int uint
They data type explain later
When picking name constant variable want expressive order reduce risk ambiguity also absolutely fine use abbreviation long name take whole screen
For example NBR nbr common abbreviation number one see lot
There another rule pick name name must consist alphanumerical character
well underscore
You use underscore separate word become legible
In programming term initialize two constant
When initialize constant variable two thing Constants useful want set value repeat many location inside program
If use constant rather wrote several different location program wherever wanted refer absolute zero ever wanted change different number would change multiple location rather one
According Murphy law saying anything go wrong go wrong
This usually recipe disaster often even forgot change one value could lead strange error run program
By declaring constant allows u easily change value constant time run program change code one location opposed many reduces risk introducing error code
Variables similar constant main difference constant change assigned value variable oftentimes
We define variable similar fashion define constant instead using reserved word const use var
Let introduce concept called declaration
Declaration thought initialization without giving variable value
When declare variable simply inform computer intention use variable program computer allocate memory
Sometimes may prefer give variable value immediately language typically older language actually forced declare variable beginning code regardless code intend use
In modern language best practice indicate preferable declare initialize variable close possible first use concept declaration significant anymore used
Still educational purpose let declare variable designed store current temperature That variable available use code change value many time like
In fact variable value often changed many time program sometimes even million time
Let say programming teacher asked write program simulates rolling dice time end sum roll present number screen
Your teacher instructed keep track progress using variable
How many variable might need
In case would need one variable keep track sum one keep track many time rolled dice
We might therefore start initializing variable start program yet rolled dice hence sum Remember initialize variable declare give type name well give value
We would also initialize variable yet rolled dice
Each time program roll dice would add number displayed dice variable
After first dice roll might second might third might etc
The point always keep track total sum roll name indicates
Also time rolled dice would increment stop running program reached
It noted program stop running variable constant respective value lost
That typically program print information screen otherwise output save result run program preserve result
Just like may able describe word English certain type personal name number etc variable constant computer programming language
For example English might classified number whereas Steve Elon Larry Mark might classified name
Computers use similar type require bit granularity
We therefore familiarize two common data type programming integer string
Integers simply number without decimal
Integer variable take negative positive value referred signed integer
Signed refers fact minus sign front
Integer variable take positive value referred unsigned integer
When initialized wrote We picked unsigned integer type written uint know dice roll sum never negative
The reason picking unsigned integer choose roll dice many many time unsigned integer contain twice large number signed integer
The explanation simple signed integer unsigned integer allocated space memory signed integer however half capacity minus sign half unsigned integer capacity minus sign
Whether declare integer variable signed unsigned depend circumstance although time probably end using signed integer give flexibility
When learning programming theory however dealing large number worth noting difference signed unsigned integer
In example must use signed integer written int since must allow negative cash flow
We initialize signed integer variable following way The bit smallest unit information stored computer memory
A bit take one two value
An integer variable stored memory using one bit typically bit modern computer
The bit allocated integer higher largest value
The general formula many value integer take n equal number bit
This mean integer take two different value integer take four different value integer take value etc
The string second data type get know
Strings programming basically said equal text plain English
Here example string note use keyword string indicate declaring string All variable string variable set equal text surrounded quote
The quote fact one requirement string
Without quote would string
Whether use double quote single quote considered equivalent purpose book Pete equivalent Pete
We know properly refer left sign learned called either variable constant
This begs obvious question far right sign
The answer literal
In example say Pete string literal integer literal
A literal anything written directly code example text number
Literals show many location code right sign
Both integer string would somewhat uninteresting perform operation
By operation point referring arithmetic integer
adding subtracting dividing multiplying string concatenation string
joining two string together
A example operation performed integer follow We start initializing two unsigned integer data type uint number minus sign front
We purchase ice cream reduce accordingly
Note simply applying basic algebra
Our variable value
Let say get lucky find street proceed donate half wallet charity Our variable value
Let turn attention string operation
In section discus concatenation
Concatenation act combining two string
For example concatenated two string Programming class would end Programming class
Here concatenate two string value Erik Linde
As see simply use sign want concatenate string
Observe empty space inserted two string

In simply specifying allows code repeatedly
The syntax based heritage language prior programming language borrowed programming language descendant offshoot language originally provided iterator often use keyword name iterator descendant use descendant use
There possibility example us PERFORM VARYING
Unlike many kind often distinguished explicit loop variable
This allows body code repeatedly executed know sequencing iteration
also typically used number iteration known entering loop
shorthand way make loop number iteration known every could written
The name come English word used programming language introduce
The term English date popularized influential later direct translation earlier German used also involved defining ALGOL ALGOL
The loop body executed given value loop variable though explicit version statement list possible value increment specified
In though keyword used called otherwise identical described confused
A statement available language
Even ignoring minor difference many difference statement work level expressiveness support
Generally fall one following category The language like requires look something like Depending language explicit sign may used place language require word even numerical case
An optional increment decrement may also included although exact syntax used differs bit language
Some language require separate declaration control variable
Another form popularized
It requires part three part optional
The initialization declares perhaps assigns variable required
The type variable using multiple variable initialization part
The condition check condition quits loop false
The afterthought performed exactly every time loop end repeat
Here example traditional
This type generalisation numeric range type allows enumeration set item number sequence
It usually characterized use implicit explicit loop variable take value sequence data collection
A representative example Where either data collection support implicit iteration like list employee name may fact iterator
Some language addition another syntax notably PHP type loop name well see name
Some language offer act processing iteration keyword interpretation expression evaluated assignment made distinct explicit iteration form
For example statement following pseudocode fragment calculating new value except first reference obtain new value placed previous step
In version however calculation refers original unaltered
The difference may significant
Some language FORTRAN also offer array assignment statement enable many omitted
Thus pseudocode would set element array A zero matter size dimensionality
The example loop could rendered But whether would rendered style something else may clearly described compiler manual
Introduced followed allows iteration loop compounded test That value assigned loop variable loop body executed
If result execution stop short
Granted loop variable value defined termination loop statement find first element array value suitable variation first character string
In control iteration loop computer construct
It named us construct result variable taking range integer value orderly sequence starting end increment Loop counter change loop providing unique value individual iteration
The loop counter used decide loop terminate program flow continue next loop
A common loop counter use variable name needed would outer loop next inner loop etc
The reverse order also used programmer
This style generally agreed originated early programming variable name beginning letter implicitly declared integer type obvious choice loop counter temporarily required
The practice date back often etc
A variant convention use reduplicated letter index allows easier searching using single letter
An example code involving nested loop loop counter variable This commonly source since fundamental step iteration completely control programmer
In fact infinite loop intended type used empty expression This style used instead infinite loop avoid type conversion warning compiler
Some programmer prefer succinct form semantically equivalent verbose form
Some language may also provide supporting statement present alter iteration proceeds
Common among statement found C derivative
The break statement cause loop terminated immediately executed
The continue statement move next iteration without progress loop body current iteration
A statement also terminates break goto return statement within statement body executed
Wells Other language may similar statement otherwise provide mean alter progress example FORTRAN Some language offer facility naming various loop statement multiple nested loop doubt loop involved
Fortran example Thus trouble detected inner loop CYCLE mean skip next iteration I J
The compiler also checking END DO appropriate label position documentation aid
The programmer must still code problem correctly possible blunder blocked
Different language specify different rule value loop variable hold termination loop indeed hold becomes undefined
This permit generate code leaf value loop variable perhaps even leaf unchanged loop value held register never stored memory
Actual behaviour may even vary according compiler optimization setting Honywell compiler
In language loop variable within scope loop body attempt modify value regarded semantic error
Such modification sometimes consequence programmer error difficult identify made
However overt change likely detected compiler
Situations address loop variable passed argument make difficult check routine behavior general unknowable compiler
Some example style Fortran A common approach calculate iteration count start loop careful attention overflow integer arithmetic iteration decrement count also adjusting value double counting result
However adjustment value within loop change number iteration executed
Still another possibility code generated may employ auxiliary variable loop variable possibly held machine register whose value may may copied iteration
Again modification would affect control loop disjunction possible within loop reference value might possibly altered current value auxiliary variable held safe improper modification confusing result guaranteed
For instance within loop reference element array would likely employ auxiliary variable especially held machine register parameter routine instance reveal value would likely reference proper variable instead
It best avoid possibility
Just index variable might modified within also may bound direction
But uncertain effect
A compiler may prevent attempt may effect might even work properly though many would declare would wrong
Consider statement If approach compiling loop evaluation calculation iteration count via something like start item simple variable value somehow adjusted iteration would effect iteration count even element selected division changed
Algol allows loop loop variable iterated list range value instead single range
The following example execute loop six value A converted equivalent incrementing counter variable directly
The following illustrates technique easily translated following This translation slightly complicated language allow statement jump next iteration loop continue statement C
These statement typically implicitly increment counter equivalent since latter case counter integral part loop construct
Any translation place statement within block increment explicit counter running statement
The formal equivalence applies far computer arithmetic also follows axia mathematics particular x x
Actual computer arithmetic suffers overflow limited representation example unsigned arithmetic come zero represented unsigned
Similar problem arise size signed unsigned
Compiler writer handle like possibly producing code inspects state overflow indicator unless provision equivalent checking calculating equivalence fail counter never exceed loop never end unless mishap occurs
Given action must repeated instance five time different language written differently
The syntax nearly identical language accounting different style block termination
Fortran equivalent loop loop using keyword instead The syntax Fortran loop The following two example behave equivalently three argument language initializing counter variable incrementing iteration loop stopping five inclusive
In Fortran later may also written The step part may omitted step one
Example Spaces irrelevant Fortran statement thus
In modern Fortran style blank significant
In Fortran may avoided using statement
first formalised report
COBOL formalized late many elaboration
It us PERFORM verb many option later addition structured statement
Ignoring need declaring initialising variable equivalent would If PERFORM verb optional clause TEST AFTER resulting loop slightly different loop body executed least test
Loops sometimes called loop
Notice marker specifies name index variable must correspond name index variable start
Some language FORTRAN later allow statement label start matched compiler text corresponding statement
Fortran also allows EXIT CYCLE statement name text nest loop make clear loop intended
However language label must unique successive loop involving index variable use text label name variable index variable loop
The statement may used exit loop
Loops labeled may leave specific labeled loop group nested loop
Some dialect include statement terminate current loop iteration begin next
considered universal loop full syntax Further single iteration range could replaced list range
There several unusual aspect construct Subsequent standard allowed syntactic element replaced achieve small optimization
The compiler also incorporated Decrementing counting backwards using keyword instead The varies somewhat
The often block statement example would The publication commonly known also allows initial declaration loop
All three section loop optional
Contrary language defined class Number method two parameter end value using self start value
The statement may used exit loop
Loops labeled may leave specifically labeled loop group nested loop Maple two form one iterating range value iterating content container
The value range form follows All part except optional
The part present must come first
The remaining part appear order
Iterating container done using form loop The clause specifies container may list set sum product unevaluated function array object implementing iterator
A may terminated
In one use also non integer value The written initialises internal variable executes body long internal variable limit le increment negative end iteration increment internal variable
Before iteration value internal variable pushed onto stack
There also simple
The written repeat body exactly X time
As used use loop variable discouraged
Note Perl programming motto
The construct corresponding language called Do Mathematica Mathematica also For construct mimic language Note empty loop one command syntax error
If loop contained comment execution would result message
The imperative map expression list get iteration result list But want save space list authentic construction defined used Note original Oberon language omitted favor general Oberon loop construct
The reintroduced
You also iterate list item similar array language You may also use exit loop time
Unlike language AppleScript currently command continue next iteration loop
So code print also loop table using iterate numerically array iterate randomly dictionary
Generic making use Simple index loop Using array Using list string value The example available dialect CFML used
Simple index loop Using array Using list string value For extended see JavaScript support loop
The statement supported inside loop
Alternatively possible iterate key array
This print triangle several possible syntax including sample
See expression syntax
In implemented many way
Oftentimes directly translated compare instruction instruction
However always
In interpreted programming language simply translated
For instance take following code

Watch video learn purpose variable computer science make life much easier


In software programming language variable work like container hold number phrase important stuff used several place code
Here work several common language
In software programming variable name used hold one value
Instead repeating value multiple place code variable hold result calculation database call result database query value
Instead multiple calculation load multiple database call retrieve data variable stored computer memory used wherever needed code
For example imagine calculation assigned variable called math math Now imagine need calculation different place code
You could copy paste spot code like answer Or could use variable math like answer math When update calculation example changing update part right math variable math One change definition variable much easier searching replacing How variable used similar across programming language
Typically variable left followed equal sign followed item item assigned
Assignment value variable happens either top script example variable used widely close used possible
This help readability maintenance code
Variable identifier different across language
Here example variable handled several different programming language
int width With C programming language specify data type variable case integer int
Lines code C also end
width With Lua programming language variable name assignment brutally simple
There mark end line code
width Note dollar sign variable name width well end line
If important useful specify data type variable typically short prefix added variable name example intWidth integer arrHouseData variable contains array library data
width As Lua Python use prefix like PHP explicit line ending like C PHP
width The Rails language number way express variable based location use within code
The use double symbol example indicates class variable whose value disappears unavailable outside class contains variable
The scope class variable differs variable used language
If know programming class block code
Classes contain number different item called referenced part application rather like variable
With variable also important note As learn language learn nuance language handle variable assigned scope possible detail

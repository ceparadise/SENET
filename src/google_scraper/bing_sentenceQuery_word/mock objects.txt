What Mocking
Prologue If look noun dictionary find one definition word
Mocking primarily used unit testing
An object test may dependency complex object
To isolate behaviour object want test replace object mock simulate behavior real object
This useful real object impractical incorporate unit test
In short mocking creating object simulate behaviour real object
At time may want distinguish opposed
There may disagreement subject definition stub minimal simulated object
The stub implement enough behaviour allow object test execute test
A mock like stub test also verify object test call mock expected
Part test verifying mock used correctly
To give example You stub database implementing simple structure storing record
The object test read write record database stub allow execute test
This could test behaviour object related database database stub would included let test run
If instead want verify object test writes specific data database mock database
Your test would incorporate assertion written database mock
There plenty answer SO good post web mocking
One place might want start looking post Martin Fowler discus lot idea mocking
In one paragraph Mocking one particlar technique allow testing unit code reliant upon dependency
In general differentiates mocking method mock object used replace code dependency allow expectation set mock object know meant called code respond
Your original question mentioned TypeMock I left answer TypeMock name
It offer feature free mocking framework like RhinoMocks Moq plus powerful option
Whether need TypeMock highly debatable mocking would ever want free mocking library many argue ability offered TypeMock often lead away well encapsulated design
As another answer stated actually defined concept could taken mean type mocking TypeMock offer using CLR profiler intercept call runtime giving much greater ability fake object requirement needing interface virtual method
Other answer explain mocking
Let walk
And believe actually far simpler think
It subclass original class
It data injected avoid testing injected part solely testing rest code
Let say writing iOS application network job test application
To whether network call work expected NOT YOUR DUTY
It another party duty test
You must remove network dependency yet continue test code work
A network call return different status code etc JSON response
Your app suppose work case error app throw expected error
What mocking create real network response like code JSON file test code without real network call waiting network response
You manually network response ALL different kind see app working expect
incorrect data responsibility responsibility test app correct case test app throw right error This creating real known mocking
In order CA use original code original code response right
You MUST add something dummy data normally needed part class
So SUBCLASS original class add whatever network HTTPResponse data OR case failure pas correct errorString HTTPResponse need subclass ie class
Long story short mocking testing also make feed class depends
In example instead whether app work expect class A good example mocking Just skip minute
I really like part transcript Because testing want make sure function called
We need make sure called Mock simulates behavior real controlled way
Mock object used unit testing
Often method test call external service method within
These called dependency
Once mocked dependency behave way defined
With dependency controlled mock easily test behavior method coded
This Unit testing
The purpose mocking type sever dependency order isolate test specific unit
Stubs simple surrogate mock surrogate verify usage
A mocking framework tool help generate stub mock
Since original wording mention type mocking I got impression related TypeMock
In experience general term mocking
Please feel free disregard info specifically TypeMock
TypeMock Isolator differs mocking framework work modifying IL fly
That allows mock type instance framework mock
To mock framework must provide abstraction mock
TypeMock offer great flexibility expense clean runtime environment
As side effect way TypeMock achieves result sometimes get strange result using TypeMock
I would think use TypeMock isolator mocking framework would TypeMocking
It tool generates mock use unit test without need write code IoC mind
If mock involves network request another alternative real test server hit
You use service generate request response testing
Mocking generating simulate real object behaviour test Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

In simulated object mimic behavior real object controlled way
A programmer typically creates mock object test behavior object much way car designer us dynamic behavior human vehicle impact
In mock object behavior complex real object therefore useful real object impractical impossible incorporate unit test
If object following characteristic may useful use mock object place For example alarm clock program cause bell ring certain time might get current time outside world
To test test must wait alarm time know whether rung bell correctly
If mock object used place real object programmed provide time whether time alarm clock program tested isolation
Mock object real object mimic allowing client object remain unaware whether using real object mock object
Many available mock object framework allow programmer specify order invoked mock object passed well value returned
Thus behavior complex object network socket mimicked mock object allowing programmer discover whether object tested responds appropriately wide variety state mock object may
Classification mock fake highly inconsistent across literature
Consistent among literature though represent production object testing environment exposing interface
Which simplest inconsistent simplest always return response
On side spectrum complex object fully simulate production object complete logic exception etc
Whether mock fake stub trio fit definition inconsistent across literature
For example mock fake stub method implementation two end complexity spectrum might contain examine context call
For example mock object might assert order method called assert consistency data across method call
In book mock described fake object help decide whether test failed passed verifying whether interaction object occurred
Everything else defined stub
In book anything real based usage either
Consider example authorization mocked
The mock object implement method match real authorization class
Many advantage follow also expose property present real class
This allows test code easily set expectation user granted permission next call therefore readily test behavior rest system either case
Similarly setting could ensure subsequent call cause without responding return etc
Thus possible develop test behavior realistic fault condition well expected response
Without simple flexible mock system testing situation may laborious given proper consideration
A mock database object method may contain much implementation code
It might check existence perhaps Person object passed saving see fake mock discussion beyond might implementation
This missed opportunity
The mock method could add entry public log string
The entry need Person saved may include detail person object instance name ID
If test code also check final content log string various series operation involving mock database possible verify case exactly expected number database save performed
This find otherwise invisible bug example developer nervous losing data coded repeated call one would sufficed
Programmers working TDD method make use mock object writing software
Mock object meet requirement stand complex real one thus allow programmer write functionality one area without calling complex underlying collaborating
Using mock object allows developer focus test behavior system test without worrying dependency
For example testing complex algorithm based multiple object particular state clearly expressed using mock object place real object
Apart complexity issue benefit gained practical speed issue involved
Developing realistic piece software using TDD may easily involve several hundred unit test
If many induce communication database web service system suite unit test quickly become slow run regularly
This turn lead bad habit reluctance developer maintain basic tenet TDD
When mock object replaced real one functionality need testing
These rather unit test
The use mock object closely couple implementation code tested
For example many mock object framework allow developer check order number time mock object method invoked real object tested subsequent code tested could therefore cause test fail even though mocked object method still obey contract previous implementation
This illustrates unit test test method external behavior rather internal implementation
mock object part suite unit test result dramatic increase amount maintenance need performed test system evolution refactoring take place
The improper maintenance test evolution could allow bug missed would otherwise caught unit test use instance real class
Conversely simply mocking one method might require far le configuration setting entire real class therefore reduce maintenance need
Mock object accurately model behavior object mocking difficult achieve object mocked come another developer project even written yet
If behavior modelled correctly unit test may register pas even though failure would occur run time condition unit test exercising thus rendering unit test inaccurate

I new unit testing I continously hear word object thrown around lot
In layman term someone explain mock object typically used writing unit test
Since say new unit testing asked mock object layman term I try layman example
Imagine unit testing system It generally easy envision testing component like The test driver simply order different dish verifies cook return correct dish order
Its harder test middle component like waiter utilizes behavior component
A naive tester might test waiter component way tested cook component The test driver would order different dish ensure waiter return correct dish
Unfortunately mean test waiter component may dependent correct behavior cook component
This dependency even worse cook component characteristic like behavior menu includes chef surprise dish lot dependency cook wo cook without entire staff lot resource dish require expensive ingredient take hour cook
Since waiter test ideally want test waiter cook
Specifically want make sure waiter conveys customer order cook correctly delivers cook food customer correctly
Unit testing mean testing unit independently better approach would isolate component test waiter using
Here test cook cahoot test driver
Ideally system test designed test cook easily substituted work waiter without changing production code
without changing waiter code
Now test cook test double could implemented different way See let focus mock cook
A big part unit testing waiter component focus waiter interacts cook component
A approach focus fully specifying correct interaction detecting go awry
The mock object know advance supposed happen test
method call invoked etc
mock object know supposed react
return value provide
The mock indicate whether really happens differs supposed happen
A custom mock object could created scratch test case execute expected behavior test case mocking framework strives allow behavior specification clearly easily indicated directly test case
The conversation surrounding test might look like posing customer TEST SUCCEEDED
But since waiter new could happen posing customer stop test note problem TEST FAILED
waiter changed order posing customer note unexpected french fry TEST FAILED
waiter gave back wrong dish It may hard clearly see difference mock object stub without contrasting example go answer way long already Also note pretty simplistic example mocking framework allow pretty sophisticated specification expected behavior component support comprehensive test
There plenty material mock object mocking framework information
A Mock Object object substitute real object
In programming mock object simulated object mimic behavior real object controlled way
A computer programmer typically creates mock object test behavior object much way car designer us crash test dummy simulate dynamic behavior human vehicle impact
Mock object allow set test scenario without bringing bear large unwieldy resource database
Instead calling database testing simulate database using mock object unit test
This free burden set tear real database test single method class
The word Mock sometimes erroneously used interchangeably Stub
The difference two word Essentially mock stub object also includes expectation
assertion proper behavior test
For example Notice mock object programmed expected result
A Mock object one kind
You using mockobjects test verify class test class
Typically kind expectation method call expect class underlying object
Let say example testing service method update field Widget
And architecture WidgetDAO deal database
Talking database slow setting cleaning afterwards complicated mock WidgetDao
let think service must get Widget database something save
So library would something like In way easily test drive development class depend class
Mock object simulated object mimic behavior real one
Typically write mock object I highly recommend explaining exactly mock differ stub
When unit testing part computer program ideally want test behavior particular part
For example look imaginary piece program us another program call print something If testing would mainly want test part look user Fred
You really want test part thing
That would another test
Mock object come
They pretend type thing
In case would use Mock would act like real printer would inconvenient thing like printing
There several type pretend object use Mocks
The main thing make Mocks Mocks configured behavior expectation
allow Mock raise error used incorrectly
So example could want sure Printer called HelloFred user Fred test case
If happen Mock warn
mean example code something like Now want test code Printer called return SaidHello set Mock return SaidHello called HelloFred
One good resource around Martin Fowlers post Mock stub object crucial part unit testing
In fact go long way make sure testing rather unit
In nutshell use stub break SUT System Under Test dependency object mock verify SUT called certain dependency
This go back fundamental principle unit testing test easily readable fast requiring configuration using real class might imply
Generally one stub test one mock
This mock purpose verify behavior test test one thing
Simple scenario using C Moq In example I used Moq demonstrate stub mock
Moq us class make bit confusing
Regardless runtime test fail called data whereas failure call fail
As another answer suggested via link mock form test double use lieu real object
What make different form test double stub object test double offer state verification optionally simulation whereas mock offer behavior verification optionally simulation
With stub might call several method stub order even repitiously determine success stub captured value state intended
In contrast mock object expects specific function called specific order even specific number time
The test mock object considered failed simply method invoked different sequence count even mock object correct state test concluded
In way mock object often considered tightly coupled SUT code stub object
That good bad thing depending trying verify
Part point using mock object really implemented according spec
They give dummy response

implement component A B call interact ca test A B implemented vice versa
In development problem
So create mock dummy object A B simple give sort response interacted
That way implement test A using mock object B
For php phpunit well explained phpunit documentaion
see In simple word mocking object dummy object original one return return value return value used test class By posting answer agree

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
How often QA engineer responsible developing Mock Objects Unit Testing
So dealing Mock Objects developer job
The reason ask interested QA career learning tool like JUnit TestNG couple framework
I want know level unit testing done developer point QA engineer take testing better test coverage
Thanks Based answer providing detail QA referring
I interested Test Automation rather simple QA involved record play script
So Test Automation engineer responsible developing framework
team developer dedicated Framework development
Yes asking usage Mock Objects testing Test Automation engineer perspective
Hey
First question use xUnit framework mock framework If bother
job tester include writing code something looking skip set knowledge
On hand like writing code somehow think developer possibility work test automation require coding skill
Particular programming language depend stack required write code
As xUnit framework probably wo write unit test mentioned dev job possible using test
For example Selenium mentioned require coding skill use SeleniumIDE one product
If use SeleniumCore using api wrap around browser
In case write code perform test given application
And put code xUnit framework runner report
As mock object using rare situation
Maybe building automation framework app
But depending approach skip
As per new answer edit main question
I agree probably wo writing unit test application code possible write unit test automation framework software software iven software testing software
Here said wrote gui level test selenium using Selenium acceptance test unit test
Anyway check following link work test automation engineer look It depends organization
Without polling ton company hard quantify QA team get involved writing test involve mock object
In experience software development company tend lean developer write unit integration UI test
The QA department firm usually test new feature enhancement well whether defect fixed ideally test practice every developer writes test check defect fixed
Many larger company employ QA team programming experience
Such team known write UI test Selenium browser application test require knowledge code check functionality UI test typically check expected UI response versus actual response
In case QA team contribute writing unit integration test well although experience rare see QA completely responsible test
going easier developer write test
That said QA team member illustrates understanding code ability write unit integration test including utilization mock object test would quickly become leader department
You focus learning good UI design practice testing common boundary case obtaining understanding user experience expectation general basis QA career
However learning development side QA
writing test without mock object definitely help career
If time learn
Here couple point QA write unit test Another thing point
Our team example us framework together write acceptance test
It would OK QA write test
Developers one writing unit test since one familiar code
Unit test written soon code written
As result developer also creating mock people use framework day really activity
QA could possibly responsible different kind test double involved larger system test
For example application depends hardware device could help simulation software
However I personally noticed QA get involved programming task
QA create integration test still usually depend developer write test fixture hook

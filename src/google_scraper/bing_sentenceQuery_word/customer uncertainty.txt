Nikki master degree teaching chemistry taught high school chemistry biology astronomy
Our vast collection scientific knowledge explains universe thoroughly possible motion planet melting point chemical
None knowledge would possible however without ability make measurement perform calculation
Making measurement root science
It pretty important scientist make best accurate precise measurement possible
Let say need determine average length pencil classroom
Your goal accurate precise possible
agreement measured value actual value
When make accurate reading get close possible true value
The ability accurate depends tool used make measurement
If using tool damaged calibrated properly get accurate reading
degree agreement several measurement quantity item
When precise getting nearly value every time measure object
The ability precise also depends tool used make measurement
More sensitive instrument allow detailed measurement
A great way imagine concept accuracy precision action think throwing set three dart target
If hit target three different place neither precise accurate
In case measuring pencil want measure unit made smallest increment
To understand measure pencil using two different ruler ruler smallest unit centimeter ruler smallest unit millimeter
In case remember millimeter ten time smaller centimeter ten squeeze evenly centimeter
First let line bottom pencil cm mark centimeter ruler
Mine go somewhere centimeter
Because marking ruler I certain pencil least three centimeter I uncertain much longer
I must estimate length pencil millimeter
To make life easier I going refer millimeter tenth centimeter
To look like top pencil centimeter
Thus measurement cm
Notice I certain pencil least three centimeter
Anyone measuring pencil would also certain pencil three centimeter
However digit I estimated might someone else
This digit therefore called value varies person making measurement
Generally one uncertain digit given
Now I measure pencil ruler contains millimeter
I treat millimeter tenth centimeter
Again pencil least three centimeter
But I millimeter mark I tell least cm
These certain digit
The top pencil seems half way cm mark cm mark I estimate length pencil hundredth centimeter
To appears centimeter cm
This uncertain digit
Collectively measurement cm
My second measurement much accurate I could measure way hundredth place
The first measurement higher uncertainty uncertain digit tenth place instead hundredth
Below two diagram liquid cylinder
Which one give accurate reading
If picked A nice work
A capable reading tenth milliliter B capable reading milliliter
Now pause video measure volume cylinder
Your answer contain certain digit one uncertain digit
The volume B certainly least mL quite mL
Since increment smaller mL must estimate tenth mL
I estimated mL
Thus volume liquid mL
certain digit uncertain digit
The volume A certainly mL quite mL
We estimate volume hundredth milliliter look like mL
My measured volume liquid mL
certain digit uncertain digit
If certain digit different mine rewind video check work
If uncertain digit different mine fine
That call uncertain
Try two volume
Pause video make measurement
The volume A mL
The volume B mL
Let imagine collected data length pencil classroom cm cm cm cm
Get FREE access day create account
Initially want determine total length pencil combined
So add together cm
cm


answer right
Kind mindful fact measurement accurate others higher degree uncertainty others
Since making calculation series measurement mindful precision
Our final answer precise least precise measurement
So begs question least precise measurement
The number digit measurement including certain digit lone uncertain digit known
Often significant figure nicknamed fig
By paying attention many significant figure measurement determine many answer
There five rule determining make number significant
A note number three five number significant mean eliminated
Zeros significant still important placeholder
So back adding problem
What least precise measurement
Pause video count significant figure well place precise value determine one
When performing addition subtraction operation answer precise least precise measurement
In case least precise measurement
It contains value ten one
Our answer therefore contain value ten one
We cut answer cm
But value tenth column pretty big
If bothered measure cm pencil precisely possible value could affect final answer
Considering round value digit one place making cm
We round value first digit eliminated five greater
If le five round
Try adding following measurement together determine value answer rounded correct number significant figure
answer
Our least precise measurement extended tenth answer contain value tenth
The zero eliminated large enough u round value tenth place leave
The last item agenda perform calculation involving multiplication division
We going multiple two pencil length together
cm cm
When performing operation involving multiplication division final answer contain number significant figure measurement least number significant figure
Unlike addition subtraction concerned number significant figure decimal point
Both three significant figure answer three significant figure
Before completely erase last digit remember value five greater large enough round smallest digit
In case become
Let review
agreement measured value actual value
degree agreement several measurement quantity item
The digit value varies person making measurement
The number digit measurement including certain digit lone uncertain digit known sig fig
There five rule determining make number significant
When performing addition subtraction operation answer precise least precise measurement
Round value first digit eliminated five greater
If le five round
When performing operation involving multiplication division final answer contain number significant figure measurement least number significant figure

Amy taught earth science course PhD Geology
At young age German physicist named Werner Karl Heisenberg published landmark paper describing theory uncertainty principle
Based work addition earlier theory lay groundwork quantum mechanic Heisenberg awarded Nobel Prize Physics
To understand work deserving Nobel Prize let dive little deeper
area physic examines physical behavior nanoscopic scale
There billion nanometer meter
Particles scale like individual atom molecule small impossible image
This make field quantum mechanic difficult crucial
Because directly observe physical behavior scale exceedingly difficult understand predict
The relates well know position momentum nanoscopic particle certainty time
Remember mass time velocity particle
Heisenberg summarized uncertainty principle precisely position determined le precisely momentum known vice versa
What mean accurately know BOTH location momentum nanoscopic particle
You may heard Heisenberg uncertainty principle popular medium described
This refers change particle undergoes result observed put simply act observing something change
The classic example try measure atom using super powerful gamma ray microscope gamma ray microscope would actually disrupt tiny atom making impossible image
But Heisenberg uncertainty principle complicated
It derives fact matter behaves particle wave
While particle fixed location disturbance travel space accompanied transfer energy fixed location
Think wave form drop rock puddle
We describe certain feature wave like distance two successive wave peak actual location wave always moving
Wavelength directly correlated momentum remember mass time velocity
This mean higher momentum higher wavelength vice versa
An object large mass high velocity like moving car huge momentum
Because momentum large wavelength short
Thus state object high momentum small wavelength
In case visible matter wavelength always small ca observe behavior
However dealing small nanoscopic particle mass thus momentum exponentially smaller
This mean wavelength nanoscopic particle larger
So determine momentum matter wavelength position
But remember matter behaves like wave AND particle
Particles course known position momentum wavelength
This root Heisenberg uncertainty principle
To know position momentum nanoscopic particle must observe particle wave behavior matter
Get FREE access day create account
So mathematically define principle
According Heisenberg uncertainty principle inverse correlation accuracy measure momentum position
In word one measurement get accurate measurement get le accurate
In equation position momentum
So delta uncertainty position delta uncertainty momentum You see multiply delta delta must greater
equation subject entirely different lesson
But simplify saying constant describes relation energy wavelength small number
Since constant mean value look insert equation
The right side equation serf limit well know position momentum particle certainty
If increase certainty position particle delta go
As delta decrease begin approach delta go
This mean uncertainty momentum increase uncertainty position decrease
This root Heisenberg uncertainty principle
While observe position momentum something like baseball quantum particle small great difficulty measuring understanding behavior
The relates well know position momentum nanoscopic particle certainty time
We learned matter exhibit behavior like particle wave
Particles fixed measurable location wave many location fixed measurable momentum
If trying measure position momentum measuring two contradictory behavior matter creates uncertainty measurement
We learned uncertainty position momentum defined equation previous section
This equation provides limit well simultaneously know position momentum particle certainty Planck constant
This provides mathematical definition describe fact better know position nanoscopic particle le know momentum certainty vice versa

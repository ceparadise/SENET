In enables program indirectly access particular value
The reference said datum accessing datum called reference
A reference distinct datum
Typically reference data stored memory given system reference implemented data stored memory storage device
For reason reference often erroneously confused said point data
However reference may also implemented way offset difference datum address fixed base address abstractly
More broadly networking reference may address
The concept reference must confused value uniquely identify data item give access operation
References widely used especially efficiently pas large mutable data share data among various us
In particular reference may point variable record contains reference data
This idea basis many
References cause significant complexity program partially due possibility partially data reference whose analysis quite complicated
References increase flexibility object stored allocated passed area code
As long one access reference data one access data data need moved
They also make sharing data different code area easier keep reference
The mechanism reference varying implementation fundamental programming language feature common nearly modern programming language
Even language support direct use reference internal implicit use
For example calling convention implemented either explicit implicit use reference
primitive
Due intimate relationship underlying hardware one powerful efficient type reference
However also due relationship pointer require strong understanding programmer detail memory architecture
Because pointer store memory location address instead value directly inappropriate use pointer lead program particularly due
act like pointer accessed particular method
A abstract reference may represented various way
A common example FILE data structure used abstract file content
It usually represents file requesting file specific position within file content reading file
In reference may contain address identifier may also include embedded specification network protocol used locate access referenced object way information encoded serialized
Thus example description remote web service viewed form reference includes complete specification locate bind particular
A reference another example complete specification construct small software component called subsequently engage interaction local machine may gain access data replicated exists weakly consistent message stream
In case reference includes full set instruction recipe access data sense serf purpose identifier address memory
More generally reference considered piece data allows unique retrieval another piece data
This includes key
If set key set data object function defines type reference image key referring anything meaningful
An alternative representation function directed graph called
Here datum represented vertex edge datum refers datum
The maximum one
These graph valuable used separate accessible
In many data structure large complex object composed smaller object
These object typically stored one two way Internal storage usually efficient space cost reference metadata time cost associated dereferencing reference allocating memory smaller object
Internal storage also enhances keeping different part large object close together memory
However variety situation external storage preferred Some language support internal storage
In language object uniformly accessed reference
In first language used typical express reference using either raw memory address index table
These work somewhat tricky use address tell nothing value point even large interpret information encoded program logic
The result misinterpretation occur incorrect program causing bewildering error
One earliest opaque reference language simply containing two reference Lisp object including possibly con cell
This simple structure commonly used build singly also used build simple dotted list terminate null reference value
Another early language Fortran explicit representation reference use implicitly calling semantics
The still one popular type reference today
It similar assembly representation raw address except carry static used ensure data refers misinterpreted
However C violated using explicit conversion various pointer type pointer type integer misinterpretation still possible difficult
Its successor tried increase pointer new cast operator smart pointer still retained ability circumvent safety mechanism compatibility
A number popular mainstream language today adopted much opaque type reference usually referred simply
These reference type like C pointer indicating interpret data reference typesafe interpreted raw address unsafe conversion permitted
A reference best thought another object scalar variable row column array
There syntax dereference reference manipulate content referent directly
Fortran reference null
As language reference facilitate processing dynamic structure linked list queue tree
In setting concept data modified often make implicit use reference
In many functional language value persistent modified assignment
Assignable reference cell serve unavoidable purpose mutable reference imperative language make capability modified explicit
Such reference cell hold value given type replaced type value pointed
These mutable reference pointed different object lifetime
For example permit building circular data structure
The reference cell functionally equivalent array length
To preserve safety efficient implementation reference ML pointer arithmetic performed
It important note functional paradigm many structure would represented using pointer language like C represented using facility powerful mechanism
The programmer able enjoy certain property guarantee immutability programming even though compiler often us machine pointer hood
Some language like support string value contain name variable
When value regular reference dereferenced Perl considers symbolic reference give variable name given value
similar feature form syntax
Many object oriented language make extensive use reference
They may use reference access object
References also used call message passing frequently used perform unused object

I read multiple time sentence similar Finally standard image classification feature based SIFT descriptor found critical high performance
We first compute standard SIFT discriptor regular grid point whole image
Source image segmentation using Conditional Random Fields Global Classification Nils Plath Marc Toussaint Shinichi Nakajima
What descriptor
I thought SIFT algorithm operates image give feature vector R n fixed fixed size image parameter SIFT algorithm
The SIFT descriptor vector feature vector
Descriptor vector feature vector synonym context
Most description SIFT I seen use phrase descriptor vector occasionally refer feature vector refer SIFT feature perhaps draw upon intuition machine learning
SIFT work analyzing image identifying set keypoints set point image helpful alignment keypoint computes descriptor vector feature vector
Then us descriptor vector keypoints image descriptor vector keypoints image try align two image
The intuition descriptor vector keypoint image similar descriptor vector keypoint image maybe two point aligned
Here similarity measured Euclidean distance two descriptor vector
Thus descriptor vector keypoint vector R chosen image translated scaled rotated descriptor vector point wo changed much transformation
You find reasonable description SIFT Wikipedia By posting answer agree

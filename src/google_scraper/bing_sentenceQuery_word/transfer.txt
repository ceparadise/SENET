Taking following course prepare major computer science UC campus
take two four term complete depending whether institution semester quarter want start early
Use find specific class offered community college satisfy expected addition specific coursework need fulfill expected transfer applicant UC
If working Associate Degree Transfer ADT computer science community college goal applying CSU well UC lot overlap coursework
The difference UC expects CSU requires computer science transfer student UC expects multivariable calculus linear algebra differential equation CSU
The Computer Science pathway applies degree program listed
More may added year ahead
Admission different UC campus major varies competitiveness depending many student apply many slot available
As result minimum GPA grade requirement particular course may vary campus campus
Make sure look find minimum expected grade point average major interested
one UC top major offering new Transfer Pathway single set course student take prepare admission UC nine undergraduate campus

Community college key increasing diversity technology yet transfer rate computer science CS tend lag compared program
As result college technology industry leader working improve transition process provide support CS student special focus woman minority
While national focus CS education university education community college overlooked say Sepi Hejazi Moghadam head research evaluation computer science education Google
That unfortunate community college produce half college graduate half black Hispanic A Google found million college student entered community college fall went earn bachelor degree CS
Those student representative community college population Moghadam say
Only percent female example compared percent transfer student earned bachelor degree STEM subject percent subject
For choose career computer science plenty opportunity
The current graduation rate computer discipline may satisfy projected million job opening coming year ACM report
The student successfully started community college went bachelor degree CS shared several characteristic Google found
They unusually focused fortunate say Moghadam
They likely start college earlier change school frequently went community college located technology hub transferred school provided extensive support transfer student
Students attend community college way bachelor degree CS encounter many challenge according
Among obstacle lack clear pathway insufficient information pathway course student need limited capacity institution lack clear articulation agreement student given insufficient information career opportunity
Among student earned bachelor degree separate path graduation according study
The nature community college student many working family often personal financial challenge mean face uncertainty creates lot swirl student say Moghadam
Also many community college student interested CS often confused anxious academic requirement might need brush math skill
All mean need support service say
Community college encourage student choose major early choose CS help stay track Moghadam say
He advises community college welcoming student underrepresented group provide scholarship support
The industry work closely higher education provide project connect dot school career Moghadam add encourage woman minority working tech serve mentor
The research mainly done time study released much progress made Moghadam say
He seen lot passion community college supporting CS program note funding workshop scheduled early broaden community college participation CS education
Moghadam call issued September ACM step right direction
Those guideline developed ACM Committee Computing Education Community Colleges aimed ensure institution sync course CS student take
Computer Science Curricular Guidance Transfer Programs Infused Cybersecurity based input community college university educator well practitioner industry
The document outline competency learning outcome covered CS program
It also provides map assessment metric stress importance soft skill ability work team solve problem creatively
The transfer guideline call structure supportive pathway articulation agreement specific CS program map
They recommend CS program community college provide strong foundation mathematics CS laboratory experience rigorous science laboratory course access strong student support service
The ACM transfer guideline designed keep student current rapidly changing demand college workplace say committee member Elizabeth Hawthorne senior professor computer science UCC New Jersey primary author guideline
Students computing class Union County College
Photo UCC There student computer science information technology UCC
Most UCC student earn associate degree CS transfer although go state Hawthorne say
UCC developing guided pathway prevent student taking unnecessary course
And guard unforeseen requirement curriculum change university Hawthorne colleague maintain close relationship faculty institution
If student realize need take extra semester transfer affect financial aid say
That could really make break whether graduate Because Hawthorne female professor CS UCC work making sure female student feel welcome
She also help recruit female speaker computing club encourages student participate similar event
The ideal transfer pathway would credit transferring allowing student earn bachelor degree four year say Cara Tang chair computer information system department PCC Oregon
That typical however
Unless student know exactly school want transfer want study could tough say Tang also served ACM committee wrote transfer guideline
PCC confer CS degree program geared transfer student
The college working providing associate degree student least credential complete coursework Tang say
Universities tend hesitate accepting CS credit community college note
In Oregon statewide transfer system patchwork separate articulation agreement say university accepting credit others
And community college open access many student find take introductory remedial math course make learn high school
For reason usually take four year earn CS degree institution Oregon say
Another hurdle required proficiency exam get CS program main transfer school PCC student
The failure rate student transferring school percent
Students fail get one chance retake test
That challenge lot student focusing getting student ready exam
It stressful setting say
Students get Portland State transfer school switch major like information technology
The state Oregon established council chair CS department higher education develop closer working relationship smoother transfer
The group looking learning outcome better way package course Tang say
It ongoing challenge try build smooth pathway student say

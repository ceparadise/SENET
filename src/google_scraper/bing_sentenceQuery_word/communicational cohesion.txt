Cohesion type measurement usually described high cohesion low cohesion
Modules high cohesion tend preferable high cohesion associated several desirable trait software including reliability understandability
In contrast low cohesion associated undesirable trait difficult maintain test reuse even understand
Cohesion often contrasted different concept
High cohesion often correlate vice versa
The coupling cohesion invented late part based characteristic good programming practice reduced maintenance modification cost
Structured Design cohesion coupling published article book latter two subsequently became standard term software engineering
In method serve class tend similar many aspect class said high cohesion
In highly cohesive system code readability increased complexity kept manageable
Cohesion increased Advantages high cohesion strong cohesion While principle module perfect cohesion consisting single atomic element single function example practice complex task expressible single simple element
Thus module element either complicated order accomplish task narrow thus tightly coupled module
Thus cohesion balanced unit complexity coupling

The literary meaning word cohesion consistency organization different unit
In computer science software engineering cohesion refers level strength unity different component software program
It remained norm software engineering software program developed different function module module separate task associated
Cohesion software determines strength source code comprehended exploring associative principle type calculating method
The concept cohesion introduced capture feature program software engineering domain
This concept make easy determine module software program indicates rapidly perform different task assigned
Increased cohesion software program obtained identical operation performed different module inversely proportional decreased number module
This mean software program designed perform multiple task multiple module higher probability lower cohesion negatively affect overall performance effectiveness computing machine
Associative principle software cohesion refer relationship type software module corresponding action operation
These principle collectively constitute cohesion software program vary according different operational requirement
There seven associative principle formalized seven type software cohesion includes coincidental logical temporal procedural communicational sequential functional cohesion
Each cohesion type unique associative principle associated define action property software module
There certain property associated cohesion software engineering
For instance software constituted three different module similar term action overall cohesion software program increase
Similarly cohesion decrease module entirely different unique action associated
Furthermore cohesion software program also dependent upon type data process inversely proportional increased number data type
Cohesion software program analysis quantitative qualitative method
In qualitative measurement process textual code software program analyzed taking different sample evaluating according coding standard respective programming language
In contrast quantitative evaluation cohesion identifies number module constituted within software program evaluates action according scale

There coupling cohesion module

Functional cohesion grouping functionality
Communication cohesion grouping Not Can explain communication cohesion provide example language Java preferable
This interpretation I say communication cohesion mean code work data placed together together data
Together mean package JAR mean advantage mainly maintainability
Or mean life hardware LAN performance security benefit
First called
I found clear A communicationally cohesive module one performs
For obtain author title price book bibliographic record based passed flag
Note The function example could performed independently separated greater flexibility
Maintainability usually improved separate communicationally cohesive module functionally cohesive module
For comparison type cohesion referenced article seems really clear
As example state important prefer functional cohesion even sequential cohesion communicational cohesion
Communicational cohesion rare system since design tend stress polymorphism
Presumably communication cohesion involves use open standard protocol format

Location Levels Cohesion This material covered lecture February
As previously mentioned one way ass functional independence module find
You considering kind cohesion listed
It generally important determine level cohesion precisely
It somewhat important decide broader grouping low unacceptable cohesion moderate acceptable ideal cohesion high desirable cohesion
Modules low level cohesion highly undesirable modified replaced
Strategies given separate page
A module one supporting task meaningful relationship one another
give example module necessarily one implemented using software
supporting following task
The legendary one hope programmer told use subroutine told ideal length drew horizontal line every twenty line code put block module doubt creating module coincidental cohesion breaking one two rule along way
If discover best name find module Miscellaneous Functions sign module undesirably low level cohesion
There pretty much excuse inclusion module whose level cohesion low design system implemented using high level programming language
Again quoting A module one whose element contribute activity general category activity activity executed selected outside module
Keeping definition mind consider following example
Someone contemplating journey might compile following list What relates activity
They mean transport course
But crucial point journey person must choose specific subset mode transport
unlikely anyone would use particular journey
A logically cohesive module contains number activity general kind
To use module pick piece need
Thus logically cohesive module grab bag activity
The activity although different forced share one interface module
The meaning parameter depends activity used certain activity parameter even left blank although calling module still need use know specific type
As note later description module name like Do System probably module logically cohesive
Again module whose level cohesion low extremely difficult effectively implement test maintain avoided
A module one supporting task related time
somewhat dated example module supporting task argues activity related fact late night go bed
A module whose name Do All Startup Activities Do All Shutdown Activities might temporal cohesion
On hand higher level cohesion described next
Modules moderate cohesion acceptable ideal
Consider modifying note change might introduce design problem might best leave
A module one supporting different possibly unrelated activity control pass one activity next
give example module whose name might something like Prepare Holiday Meal This bit better temporal cohesion since know fixed linear ordering activity
However still much reason putting activity together one module
A module exhibit activity support use input output data access modify part data structure
give example module supporting activity presumably user specify one set activity occur module called
Another example would module providing interface stack supporting activity Push Pop Empty
test initialization new empty stack possibly operation initialization reading content file perform save writing content file
Note left kind linear ordering containment relationship level cohesion I imagine module would seem procedural cohesion communicational cohesion another module communicational cohesion procedural cohesion
For kind cohesion defined point module kind cohesion defined could argued also kind cohesion defined
Again quoting A module one whose element involved activity output data one activity serf input data next
give example module supporting following activity
presumably car input passed parameter task task
Modules high cohesion extremely desirable need changed except correct kind design problem
A module exhibit functional cohesion support activity needed execution one one task
give several example module name Location

In use existing asset form within software product development process
Assets product software development life cycle include code software component test suite design documentation
modifying existing asset needed meet specific system requirement
Because reuse implies creation preferred leverage
simplest form reuse
A chunk code regularly organized using
Proponents claim offer advanced form reusability although tough objectively measure define level score reusability
The ability reuse relies essential way ability build larger thing smaller part able identify among part
Reusability often required characteristic software
Reusability brings several aspect need considered reusability required
Reusability implies explicit management issue
If issue considered software may appear reusable point view reused practice
Software reusability specifically refers design feature software element collection software element enhance suitability reuse
Many reuse design principle developed WISR workshop
Candidate design feature software reuse include Consensus yet reached list relative importance entry issue make one important particular class application

also called use existing software knowledge build new software following
code reuse practiced earliest day
Programmers always reused section code template function procedure
Software reuse recognized area study software engineering however date proposed basing software industry reusable component
Code reuse aim save time resource reduce redundancy taking advantage asset already created form within software product development process
The key idea reuse part written one time used construction program written later time
Code reuse may imply creation separately maintained version reusable asset
While code common resource selected reuse asset generated development cycle may offer opportunity reuse software component test suite design documentation
The good example code reuse
Programmers may decide create internal abstraction certain part program reused may create custom library use
Some characteristic make software easily reusable high
For newly written code use piece existing code kind interface mean communication must defined
These commonly include call use
In organization practice formalized standardized also known engineering
The general practice using prior version extant program starting point next version also form code reuse
Some code reuse involves simply copying code existing program new one
While organization realize benefit new product approach subsequently saddled many problem caused
Many researcher worked make reuse faster easier systematic integral part normal process programming
These main goal behind invention became one common form formalized reuse
A somewhat later invention
Another newer mean use software program create new program certain type based set parameter user choose
Fields study system
Concerning motivation driving factor reuse Reuse categorized Concerning form structure reuse code often discouraged form code duplication requires every bug corrected copy enhancement made reused code need manually merged every copy become
However benefit isolation flexibility change reused code easier packaging deployment version management
Systematic software reuse strategy increasing productivity improving quality software industry
Although simple concept successful software reuse implementation difficult practice
A reason put forward dependence software reuse context implemented
Some problematic issue need addressed related systematic software reuse A common example code reuse technique using
Many common operation converting information among different format accessing external storage interfacing external program manipulating information number word name location date etc
common way needed many different program
Authors new program use code software library perform task instead wheel writing fully new code directly program perform operation
Library implementation often benefit covering unusual arcane case
Disadvantages include inability tweak detail may affect performance desired output time cost acquiring learning configuring library
A design pattern general solution recurring problem
Design pattern conceptual tangible modified fit exact need
However abstract class interface reused implement certain pattern
Developers generally reuse large piece software via application framework
Though framework usually applicable family application
In function used many case design pattern framework formerly used
encompasses reuse code simply retro program run older computer
In employed software exploit method
When attacker able directly input code modify control flow program example presence code injection defense redirect control flow code sequence existing memory
Examples attack programming
A component extent represents set collaborative class one class interface
The interface responsible enabling replacement component
Reusable component also isolated synchronized SCM repository using component source code management technology
The whole concept code reuse also encompass engineering application outside software
For instance allows creating reusable design
result creation interoperable part reused many context
Code reuse result component reused
Rob Pike opined A little copying better little dependency
When joined Google company putting heavy emphasis code reuse
He belief Google still suffers result former policy term compilation speed maintainability

Early software reuse considered beneficial form software reuse
Hence previous research focused supporting reuse software requirement
This study aim identify investigate current state art respect requirement reuse approach proposed b method used evaluate approach c characteristic approach quality empirical study requirement reuse respect rigor relevance
We conducted systematic review combination snowball sampling database search used identify study
The rigor relevance scoring rubric used ass quality empirical study
Multiple researcher involved step increase reliability study

The majority approach used structuring matching requirement method support requirement reuse artefact commonly used input approach
Further evaluation study revealed majority approach validated industry
The subset empirical study total analyzed rigor relevance two study achieved maximum score rigor relevance based rubric
It found mostly requirement reuse approach validated industry
From review found number approach already exist literature many approach validated industry
The evaluation rigor relevance empirical study show contain detail context validity threat industrial setting thus highlighting need industrial evaluation approach

What virus worm Trojan horse
Defining virus worm Trojan horse Answer According Webster Collegiate Dictionary computer virus computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program produce copy insert program file usually performs malicious action destroying data
Computer virus never naturally occurring always
Once created Macro virus A macro piece code embedded data file
A macro virus thus virus exists macro attached data file
In respect macro virus like virus
The main difference attached data file document rather executable program
virus likely continue prevalent type virus
Worms Worms similar virus computer program replicate functional copy usually computer system via network connection often always contain functionality interfere normal use computer program
Unlike virus however worm exist separate entity attach file program
Because similarity virus worm also often referred virus
Trojan horse A Trojan horse program something undocumented programmer intended user would accept knew
By definition virus particular case Trojan horse namely one able spread program turn Trojans
According others virus deliberate damage merely replicating Trojan
Finally despite definition many people use term Trojan refer malicious program

The metric system international system measurement adopted almost universally United States Liberia Myanmar exception
Considered nearly synonymous Standard International System Units metric system sometimes called MKS mks system although usage mostly deprecated
The system based three fundamental unit quantifies kg quantifies sec quantifies
Even metric system adopted used almost exclusively within science standard measurement science engineering technology mathematics
The metric system originally developed scientist frustrated le system
In theoretical laboratory calculation arithmetic involving FPS unit messy
There example inch foot three foot yard foot statute mile ounce pound
Less common English unit rod furlong peck bushel seem modern scientific term dreamed age ago without concern common sense although used agricultural industrial people day
The meter kilogram divided fractional unit enlarged multiple unit according
For example cm mm meter meter kilometer gram g kilogram milligram mg gram
This make metric unit easy work scientific notation
Time however denoted way English system

Even metric measurement metric function measurement number obtained application metric often two term used synonym
Since quantitative measurement essential science continuous effort practitioner theoretician bring similar approach software development
The goal obtaining objective reproducible quantifiable measurement may numerous valuable application schedule budget planning cost estimation quality assurance testing software debugging software performance optimization optimal personnel task assignment
Common software measurement include As software development complex process high variance methodology objective difficult define measure software quality quantity determine valid concurrent measurement metric especially making prediction prior detail design
Another source difficulty debate determining metric matter mean
The practical utility software measurement therefore limited following domain A specific measurement may target one aspect balance example indicator team motivation project performance
Some software development practitioner point simplistic measurement cause harm good
Others noted metric become integral part software development process
Impact measurement programmer psychology raised concern harmful effect performance due stress performance anxiety attempt cheat metric others find positive impact developer value towards work prevent undervalued

The development model created study data collected organization contracted funded research
The term maturity relates degree formality optimization process practice formally defined step managed result metric active optimization process
The model aim improve existing process also applied process
The Capability Maturity Model originally developed tool objectively assessing ability government contractor implement contracted software project
The model based process maturity framework first described later book
It later published report book author
Though model come field also used model aid business process generally also used extensively worldwide government office commerce industry
In use computer grew widespread flexible le costly
Organizations began adopt computerized information system demand grew significantly
Many process software development infancy standard best practice approach defined
As result growth accompanied growing pain project failure common field still early year ambition project scale complexity exceeded market capability deliver adequate product within planned budget
Individuals began publish article book research result attempt professionalize process
In several US military project involving software subcontractor ran completed far later planned
In effort determine occurring funded study SEI
The first application staged maturity model IT rather published IT organization
began developing process maturity concept later stage career IBM
Active development model US Department Defense Software Engineering Institute SEI began Humphrey joined located Carnegie Mellon University retiring IBM
At request Air Force began formalizing Process Maturity Framework aid Department Defense evaluating capability software contractor part awarding contract
The result Air Force study model military use objective evaluation software subcontractor process capability maturity
Humphrey based framework earlier Quality Management Maturity Grid developed book Quality Free
Humphrey approach differed unique insight organization mature process stage based solving process problem specific order
Humphrey based approach staged evolution system software development practice within organization rather measuring maturity separate development process independently
The CMM thus used different organization general powerful tool understanding improving general business process performance
Watts Humphrey Capability Maturity Model CMM published book
Organizations originally assessed using process maturity questionnaire Software Capability Evaluation method devised Humphrey colleague Software Engineering Institute
The full representation Capability Maturity Model set defined process area practice five maturity level initiated Version completed January
The CMM published book primary author Mark Paulk Charles Weber Mary Beth Chrissis
United States America New York USA
The CMM model application software development sometimes problematic
Applying multiple model integrated within across organization could costly training appraisal improvement activity
The CMMI project formed sort problem using multiple model software development process thus CMMI model superseded CMM model though CMM model continues general theoretical process capability model used public domain
The CMM originally intended tool evaluate ability government contractor perform contracted software project
Though come area software development continues widely applied general model maturity process organization
A viewed set structured level describe well behavior practice process organization reliably sustainably produce required outcome
A maturity model used benchmark comparison aid understanding example comparative assessment different organization something common used basis comparison
In case CMM example basis comparison would organization software development process
The model involves five aspect There five level defined along continuum model according SEI Predictability effectiveness control organization software process believed improve organization move five level
While rigorous empirical evidence date support belief
Within maturity level Key Process Areas characterise level area five factor goal commitment ability measurement verification
These necessarily unique CMM representing stage organization must go way becoming mature
The model provides theoretical continuum along process maturity developed incrementally one level next
Skipping level
At maturity level process concerned addressing statistical process variation changing process example shift mean process performance improve process performance
This would done time maintaining likelihood achieving established quantitative objective
There company world attained level
The model originally intended evaluate ability government contractor perform software project
It used may suited purpose critic pointed process maturity according CMM necessarily mandatory successful software development
The software process framework documented intended guide wishing ass organization project consistency Key Process Areas

Harry run factory make cell phone
His customer expect certain thing Harry cell phone
They want phone simple use long battery life reliable
Customers always want certain thing product buy
For example Harry customer want cell phone never drop call though settle one rarely drop call
How Harry make sure meeting customer expectation
Process capability one way company make sure making product meet customer demand
To help Harry understand use process capability let look closer element used calculate
Harry want make sure company cell phone meet customer expectation
Specifically know ca make every single cell phone perfect want make sure whole cell phone dropping many call customer go different brand
Since Harry run factory particularly interested way process manufacturing meet customer expectation
ability company produce product meet customer demand
Let say Harry option two different manufacturing process factory
Process make cell phone automatically drop every phone call
That phone call dropped
Instead process Harry could use process make phone randomly drop call
Which process meet Harry customer demand
Possibly know sure Harry need statistical analysis
That lead u another important point process capability
It statistical analysis whether process used company capable meeting customer demand
Get FREE access day create account
If paying attention already know process capability using statistic analyze effective company process
But element go statistical analysis
To calculate process capability Harry need certain information
Specifically need important piece information
First need minimum maximum customer put
For example perhaps Harry customer willing put phone drop call
Then customer tolerance range
In addition Harry need know variation within process much difference one outcome another
For example remember process make phone randomly drop call
That range difference phone
The production variation curve usually expressed term one standard deviation mean
For example production mean process might sigma
In case average mean phone drop call
A phone one sigma standard deviation mean might drop call
A phone two standard deviation mean drop call
Generally production variation curve includes value three sigma three sigma mean
So process production variation curve call dropped call dropped
In ideal world want production variation curve much smaller customer tolerance range
That way something go wrong customer satisfied
If production variation curve customer tolerance range identical wiggle room
ability company produce product meet customer demand
It statistical analysis whether process used company capable meeting customer demand
The two main element go calculating process capability minimum maximum customer put variation within process
The production variation curve usually six sigma one standard deviation mean
Ideally production variation curve much smaller customer tolerance range

The Capability Maturity Model initially funded military research
The United States Air Force funded study Software Engineering Institute create model abstract military use objective evaluation software subcontractor
The result Capability Maturity Model published Managing Software Process
The CMM longer supported SEI superseded comprehensive CMMI
The Capability Maturity Model CMM way develop refine organization process
The first CMM purpose developing refining software development process
A maturity model structured collection element describe characteristic effective process
A maturity model provides A maturity model used benchmark assessing different organization equivalent comparison
It describes maturity company based upon project company dealing client
In technological improvement made computer widespread flexible inexpensive
Organizations began adopt computerized information system field software development grew significantly
This led increased demand satisfied le experienced professional
Unfortunately influx growth caused growing pain project failure became commonplace field computer science still infancy also project became ambitious scale complexity
In response individual Edward Yourdon Larry Constantine Gerald Weinberg Tom DeMarco David Parnas published article book research result attempt professionalize software development process
Watts Humphrey Capability Maturity Model CMM described book Managing Software Process
The CMM conceived Watts Humphrey based earlier work Phil Crosby
Active development model SEI began
The CMM originally intended tool evaluate ability government contractor perform contracted software project
Though come area software development continues widely applied general model maturity process organization
The model identifies five level process maturity organisation
Within maturity level KPAs Key Process Areas characterise level KPA five definition identified The KPAs necessarily unique CMM representing stage organization must go way becoming mature
The assessment supposed led authorised lead assessor
One way company supposed use model first ass maturity level form specific plan get next level
Skipping level allowed
Although model proved useful many organization use multiple model problematic
Further applying multiple model integrated within across organization costly term training appraisal improvement activity
The CMM Integration project formed sort problem using multiple CMMs
The CMMI Product Team mission combine three source model CMMI designated successor three source model
The SEI released policy sunset Software CMM previous version CMMI
The said SECM model superseded CMMI
With release CMMI Version Product Suite existing CMMI renamed CMMI Development

In case CMM combined methodology
It commonly used conjunction ISO standard well computer programming methodology Extreme Programming XP Six Sigma
There five level CMM The beneficial element CMM Level

A capability level evolutionary plateau describing organization capability relative process area
A capability level consists related specific generic practice process area improve organization process associated process area
Each level layer foundation continuous process improvement
Thus capability level cumulative higher capability level includes attribute lower level
In CMMI model contiunous representation six capability level designated number
Incomplete Performed Managed Defined Quantitatively Managed Optimizing A short description capability level follows An incomplete process process either performed partially performed
One specific goal process area satisfied generic goal exist level since reason institutionalize partially performed process
This tantamount Maturity Level staged representation
A Capability Level process process expected perform Capability Level specific generic practice
Performance may stable may meet specific objective quality cost schedule useful work done
This start process improvement
It mean something prove really working
A managed process planned performed monitored controlled individual project group process achieve given purpose
Managing process achieves model objective process well objective cost schedule quality
As title level indicates actively managing way thing done organization
You metric consistently collected applied management approach
Remember metric collected used level CMMI staged continuous representation
It bitter fallacy think organization wait Capability Level use metric
A capability level process characterized defined process
A defined process managed capability level process tailored organization set standard process according organization tailoring guideline contributes work product measure information organizational process asset
A capability level process characterized quantitatively managed process
A quantitatively managed process defined capability level process controlled using statistical quantitative technique
Quantitative objective quality process performance established used criterion managing process
Quality process performance understood statistical term managed throughout life process
An optimizing process quantitatively managed process improved based understanding common cause process variation inherent process
It focus continually improving process performance incremental innovative improvement
Both defined process organization set standard process target improvement activity
Capability Level focus establishing baseline model measurement process performance
Capability Level focus studying performance result across organization entire enterprise finding common cause problem work done process e used fixing problem process
The fix would include updating process documentation training involved error injected

The term used various context
For example enterprise process model often referred
Process model nature classified together model
Thus process model description process type level
Since process model type level process instantiation
The process model used repeatedly development many application thus many instantiation
One possible use process model prescribe thing done contrast process really happens
A process model roughly anticipation process look like
What process shall determined actual system development
The goal process model From theoretical point view explains key concept needed describe happens development process happens
From operational point view modeling aimed providing guidance method engineer application developer
The activity process usually predicate need change process identify issue corrected
This transformation may may require IT involvement although common driver need model business process
programme desired put process practice
With advance technology larger platform vendor vision business process model BPM becoming fully executable capable engineering coming closer reality every day
Supporting technology include UML
Process modeling address process aspect enterprise leading encompassing
The relationship business process context rest enterprise system data organizational structure strategy etc
create greater capability analyzing planning change
One example corporate understanding process company detail allowing management identify redundancy resulting smoother merger
Process modeling always key aspect continuous improvement approach seen
There five type coverage term process model defined differently Processes different kind
These definition correspond various way process modelled
refers level detail process model affect kind guidance explanation trace provided
Coarse granularity restricts rather limited level detail whereas fine granularity provides detailed capability
The nature granularity needed dependent situation hand
Project manager customer representative general middle management require rather process description want gain overview time budget resource planning decision
In contrast software engineer user tester analyst software system architect prefer process model detail model provide instruction important execution dependency dependency people
While notation model exist traditional process model description
Process model ideally provide wide range granularity
Process Weaver
It found process model prescriptive actual practice departure prescription occur
Thus framework adopting method evolved system development method match specific organizational situation thereby improve usefulness
The development framework also called situational
Method construction approach organized flexibility spectrum ranging
Lying end spectrum rigid method whereas end modular method construction
Rigid method completely leave little scope adapting situation hand
On hand modular method modified augmented fit given situation
Selecting rigid method allows project choose method panel rigid method whereas selecting path within method consists choosing appropriate path situation hand
Finally selecting tuning method allows project select method different approach tune project need
As quality process model discussed paper need elaborate quality modeling technique important essence quality process model
In existing framework created understanding quality line quality modeling technique quality model result application technique clearly drawn
This report concentrate quality process modeling technique quality process model clearly differentiate two
Various framework developed help understanding quality process modeling technique one example Quality based modeling evaluation framework known framework argued provide set well defined quality property procedure make objective assessment property possible
This framework also advantage providing uniform formal description model element within one different model type using one modeling technique In short make assessment product quality process quality modeling technique regard set property defined
Quality property relate technique discussed To ass quality framework used illustrate quality dynamic essential modeling organisation DEMO business modeling technique
It stated evaluation framework DEMO modeling technique revealed shortcoming
One particular include quantifiable metric express quality business modeling technique make hard compare quality different technique overall rating
There also systematic approach quality measurement modeling technique known complexity metric suggested Rossi et al

Techniques Meta model used basis computation complexity metric
In comparison quality framework proposed quality measurement focus technical level instead individual model level
Authors Cardoso Mendling Neuman Reijers used complexity metric measure simplicity understandability design
This supported later research done Mendling argued without using quality metric help question quality property model simple process modeled complex unsuitable way
This turn lead lower understandability higher maintenance cost perhaps inefficient execution process question
The quality modeling technique important creating model quality contribute correctness usefulness model
Earliest process model reflected dynamic process practical process obtained instantiation term relevant concept available technology specific implementation environment process constraint
Enormous number research done quality model le focus shifted towards quality process model
Quality issue process model evaluated exhaustively however four main guideline framework practice
These quality framework metric related quality aspect empirical survey related modeling technique pragmatic guideline
Hommes quoted Wang main characteristic quality model grouped group namely correctness usefulness model correctness range model correspondence phenomenon modeled correspondence syntactical rule modeling also independent purpose model used
Whereas usefulness seen model helpful specific purpose hand model constructed first place
Hommes also make distinction internal correctness empirical syntactical semantic quality external correctness validity
A common starting point defining quality conceptual model look linguistic property modeling language syntax semantics often applied
Also broader approach based semiotics rather linguistic done Krogstie using quality framework known SEQUAL
It defines several quality aspect based relationship model knowledge Externalisation domain modeling language activity learning taking action modeling
The framework however provide way determine various degree quality used extensively business process modeling empirical test carried According previous research done Moody use conceptual model quality framework proposed Lindland evaluate quality process model three level quality identified From research noticed quality framework found easy use useful evaluating quality process model however limitation regard reliability difficult identify defect
These limitation led refinement framework subsequent research done
This framework called SEQUEL framework Krogstie Refined Krogstie Jørgensen included three quality aspect
Dimensions Conceptual Quality framework Modeling Domain set statement relevant correct describing problem domain Language Extension set statement possible given grammar vocabulary modeling language used
Model Externalization conceptual representation problem domain
It defined set statement problem domain actually made
Social Actor Interpretation Technical Actor Interpretation set statement actor human model user tool interact model respectively conceptual representation problem domain contains
Finally Participant Knowledge set statement human actor involved modeling process believe made represent problem domain
These quality dimension later divided two group deal physical social aspect model
In later work Krogstie et al
stated extension SEQUAL framework fixed limitation initial framework however limitation remain
In particular framework static view upon semantic quality mainly considering model modeling activity comparing model static domain rather seeing model facilitator changing domain
Also framework definition pragmatic quality quite narrow focusing understanding line semiotics Morris newer research linguistics semiotics focused beyond mere understanding model used affect interpreter
The need dynamic view semiotic quality framework particularly evident considering process model often prescribe even enact action problem domain hence change model may also change problem domain directly
This paper discus quality framework relation active process model suggests revised framework based
Further work Krogstie revise SEQUAL framework appropriate active process model redefining physical quality narrow interpretation previous research
The framework use Guidelines Modeling GoM based general accounting principle include six principle Correctness Clarity deal comprehensibility explicitness System description model system
Comprehensibility relates graphical arrangement information object therefore support understand ability model
Relevance relates model situation presented
Comparability involves ability compare model semantic comparison two model Economic efficiency produced cost design process need least covered proposed use cost cutting revenue increase
Since purpose organization case maximization profit principle defines borderline modeling process
The last principle Systematic design defines accepted differentiation diverse view within modeling
Correctness relevance economic efficiency prerequisite quality model must fulfilled remaining guideline optional necessary
The two framework SEQUAL GOM limitation use used people competent modeling
They provide major quality metric easily applicable
The use metric related quality aspect process model trying bridge gap use two framework modeling mostly theoretical empirical test carried support use
Most experiment carried relate relationship metric quality aspect work done individually different author Canfora et al
study connection mainly count metric example number task split maintainability software process model Cardoso validates correlation control flow complexity perceived complexity Mendling et al
use metric predict control flow error deadlock process model
The result reveal increase size model appears reduce quality comprehensibility
Further work Mendling et al
investigates connection metric understanding While metric confirmed regarding effect also personal factor modeler like competence revealed important understanding model
Several empirical survey carried still give clear guideline way evaluating quality process model necessary clear set guideline guide modeler task
Pragmatic guideline proposed different practitioner even though difficult provide exhaustive account guideline practice
In tip process modeling summarized many technical definition rule provided teach create process model effective primary mission maximizing shared understanding process
Most guideline easily put practice label activity rule suggested practitioner analyzed empirically
From research
value process model dependent choice graphical construct also annotation textual label need analyzed
It found result better model term understanding alternative labelling style
From earlier research way evaluate process model quality seen process model size structure expertise modeler modularity affect overall comprehensibility
Based set guideline presented Process Modeling Guidelines
This guideline us style well guideline number element model application structured modeling decomposition process model
The guideline follows still though limitation use Validity problem relate content process model way content organized represented
It suggest way organizing different structure process model content kept intact pragmatic issue must included model still left
The second limitation relates prioritizing guideline derived ranking small empirical basis relies involvement process modeler
This could seen one hand need wider involvement process modeler experience also rise question alternative approach may available arrive prioritizing guideline

A process almost measurement fall inside specification limit process
This represented pictorially plot There several statistic used measure capability process pk pm
Most capability index estimate valid sample size used large enough
Large enough generally thought independent data value
The pk pm statistic assume population data value normally distributed
Assuming specification mean standard deviation respectively normal data USL LSL upper lower specification limit target value respectively population capability index defined follows
pk USL LSL pm USL LSL T C p USL LSL C pk USL x x LSL C pm USL LSL x T The estimator pk also expressed pk scaled distance midpoint specification range process mean
Denote midpoint specification range USL LSL
The distance process mean optimum LSL
The scaled distance k USL LSL k The absolute sign take care case LSL
To determine estimated value k estimate x
Note x USL
The estimator index adjusted factor C pk C p k
Since k follows C pk C p
This expressed numerically table ppm part per million ppb part per billion
Note reject figure based assumption distribution centered
We discussed situation two spec

This known case
There many case lower upper specification used
Using one spec limit called
The corresponding capability index Estimators pu pl obtained replacing x respectively
The following relationship hold pu pl
This represented pictorially Note also write pk min pl pu
The resulting formula confidence limit given
Confidence Limits C p C p eqnarray eqnarray degree freedom
pu upper C pu C pu denoting percent point function standard normal distribution
If known set
Limits pl obtained replacing C pu C pl
The variance obtained follows
Let But since x
The k factor found k x USL LSL C pk C p k We would like C pk least good process
If possible reduce variability center process
We compute C pu C pl using C pu USL x C pl x LSL
From see C pu smallest index
Note formula C pk C p k algebraic equivalent min C pu C pl definition

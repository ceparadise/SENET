Reversible program finite execution step well studied
For example Turing machine whose transition reversible halt executed backwards consuming tape reverse order
A variant Turing machine distinct input output work tape similarly executed reverse consume output regenerate input assuming halted empty work tape forward execution avoid possibility stashing input information work tape
Is work equivallent concept setting interactive program spirit
In Turing machine model described clearly possible infinite interactive run consuming infinite input stream emitting infinite output stream storing intermediate result work tape
Some program clearly reversible analogous way finite program covered formalism
How characterize reversible interactive program model
We need exclude program simply stash away input work tape unlike finite case ca simply require program end empty work tape
Is work reversible interactive program

technique performs task may actually needed
The main idea work known whether work needed prevent delay would incurred work known whether needed
If turn work needed change made work reverted result ignored
The objective provide extra available
This approach employed variety area including value prediction exploiting value locality prefetching
Modern use speculative execution reduce cost instruction using scheme predict execution path program based history branch execution
In order improve performance utilization computer resource instruction scheduled time yet determined instruction need executed ahead
Eager execution form speculative execution side conditional branch executed however result committed predicate true
With unlimited resource eager execution also known would theory provide performance perfect
With limited resource eager execution employed carefully since number resource needed grows level branch executed eagerly
Predictive execution form speculative execution outcome predicted execution proceeds along predicted path actual result known
If prediction true predicted execution allowed commit however misprediction execution unrolled
Common form include
A generalized form sometimes referred value prediction
Lazy execution involve speculation
The incorporation speculative execution implementation current research topic
designed around idea speculative execution
A PhD thesis made support kind speculative execution abortion mechanism back case bad choice called

I reading book The singularity near written Kurzweil mentioned reversible gate like example
The advantage using gate could get rid thermal waste related computation bit disappear heat computation wo need energy input
Those assumption make gate sound like miracle solution
So question technical hurdle still preventing large scale usage
I also think shame I never heard gate electrical engineering bachelor master study top German university
I mean expert topic casually reading Wikipedia relies motion spherical billiard ball environment made buffer ball bounce perfectly sound realistic
Nobody actually figured actually make gate yet merely theoretical interest
That might explain never heard since engineering usually deal practice
The premise Reversible Computing bit disappears amount heat generated
By using reversible gate bit ever appear disappear supposedly computation could much efficient reversible gate
The theoretical limit Reversible Computing claim get around erasing bit information generates least energy heat
For computer running toasty C transistor making bit disappear rate GHz corresponds mW heat generation
That account tiny proportion computer energy usage
Our computer limited heat generation associated bit disappearing
They limited inherent inefficiency moving electron around tiny copper trace
The problem practical reversible gate gate fabricated silicon actual energy saving linearly proportional run
I know Tom Knight research group MIT fabricated small adiabatic processor late
The practical logic family developed called charge recovery logic implemented using standard CMOS fabrication technique
I believe work continued Michael P Frank Florida State University
An example work Tom Knight group following master thesis pretty decent section related work early
Vieri C J Master Thesis MIT EECS dept
Reversible circuit need ca heat exchange circuit environment mean must equilibrium time
For process need change something approximate equilibrium making change happen slowly possible
If I remember thermodynamics correctly make reversible computation arbitrarily small minimum energy time time must small constant
The largest hurdle preventing large scale use asynchronous circuit pretty much circuit design Moore law become something self fulfilling prophecy seen chip manufacturer see fulfilling Moore law challenge
Because need fulfill Moore law gotten adept decreasing size chip advancing lithography often using cheat like multipatterning
What reversible gate
As foundry race release newer smaller transistor size company want print new chip see easy path towards increasing speed simply adding cache reworking conventional design better use cache
The killer technological hurtles success
Useful computing device require feedback make possible one circuit element perform number sequential computation
Usable feedback circuit must contain section whose total number input counting one fed back output exceeds number output fed back input way number input would exceed number output would circuit respond way outside stimulus
Since perfectly function ca input output possible construct feedback structure required perform computing task
Note CMOS technology used today computer feedback required ensure result reported computation different part circuit made available simultaneously part since relative timing signal arrive would constitute information could perfectly passed downstream technology might make possible many gate propagate signal precisely rate retaining reversibility I know practical technology
Note CS perspective trivial make computing process reversible one storage medium whose size essentially proportional number step time amount state could change step
This claim contradict claim previous paragraph since storage proportional number step require circuitry proportional number step imply circuitry proportional amount would required feedback eliminated
If one allowed output ignored given proper input condition never go high might possible design system would theory benefit reversible logic
For example one algorithm operated chunk RAM one wanted use CPU performed operation per second operation updated either register program counter one word RAM one could use reversible CPU would The recipe could repeated number time run algorithm arbitrary number step last step recipe would reversible
The amount energy spent per algorithmic step operation would inversely proportional size LIFO thus could made arbitrarily small one building build large enough LIFO
In order ability translate sort energy saving however would necessary LIFO would store energy information put usefully return energy read
Further LIFO would large enough hold state data enough step energy cost using le amount energy usefully saved
Given amount energy lost storage retrieval N byte practical FIFO unlikely O unclear increasing N meaningfully reduce energy consumption
Practical applied reversible computing active area research likely become prominent future
Most seen attempting create reversible qubit gate hard experimentally match theoretical property QM formalism steady progress made
Another basic point anytime energy dissipation decreased chip essentially moving gate system reversible chip dissipation high priority long time mobile computing representing sort paradigm shift
For decade chip performance gain similar Moore law came somewhat relaxed even sloppy energy dissipation reached point diminishing return year ago
The leading worldwide chip manufacturer Intel attempting pivot chip compete Arm advantage never building anything
There possibly breakthrough recent research using superconducting technology June active research project area
See
Takeuchi Yamanashi Yoshikawa Nature Reversible computing studied since Rolf Landauer advanced argument come known Landauer principle
This principle state minimum energy dissipation logic operation reversible computing accompanied reduction information entropy
However practical reversible logic gate demonstrated
One problem reversible logic gate must built using extremely logic device
Another difficulty reversible logic gate must logically physically reversible
Here propose first practical reversible logic gate using adiabatic superconducting device experimentally demonstrate logical physical reversibility gate
Additionally estimate energy dissipation gate discus minimum energy dissipation required reversible logic operation
It expected result study enable reversible computing move theoretical stage practical usage

hard problem computer science caching naming Honestly compiler construction
I think question depends teacher subject organized career
Analyzing algorithm hard someone want
Take count unsolved problem problem ca solved
The thing problem know ca solved perfect
But
You spend lot time trying demonstrate trying find polynomial time solution solve
Demonstrating easy
Yes lot problem known thing find reduction demonstrate
And spend lot trying demonstrate solved polynomial time
There also subject like hard subject plan teacher want
Artificial Intelligence
This refers smart computing along pattern recognition tool like Optical Character Recognition Voice text facial identification etc
Many cool thing wish could computer rely algorithm attempting perfect decade without whole lot success
My pick Hmm maybe important sure difficult There two hard problem Computer Science cache invalidation naming thing
category theory discrete mathematics worth If slightly wrong could cost company million
Operating Systems especially part anything threading
And reason hard make philosopher eat pizza fork
The reason writing multithreaded code difficult necessarily easy human least male according wife mind compute
I vote Compiler Design
Especially DFA NFA part come
I also clear NP problem stuff
Well technically branch mathematics highly relevant CS
Nearly everything CS based queue visible obvious invisible obvious implied
In early day CS queue obvious
A queue program program deck card
Nowadays queue obvious
The internet example packet switched network packet form queue routing packet form queue minimization
It hard toy problem given course start considering real problem turn serious drudgery
client really know want
This taught college one essential skill
Personally mine Formal Logic
It tough start get rule manage play enough brain go development good thing
As I answering question directly definitely hardest subject I degree probably hardest applicable subject
Compiler Constructions
Hard must understand concept behind anyone
Well I really know done targeted feature OS thinking designing kernel must daunting task
I also think I really know make system unsafe except course obvious buffer overflow XSS SQL injection
I sure seems algorithm also unsafe look MetaSploit project list type kind security breach see lot way program flawed
There many awkward topic field pick sheer persistent difficulty involving
Examples general topic include These hard something exists everything correct need global system property yet virtually tool available one scale real problem experience really local reasoning
It process going reasoning piece program whole shebang hard particularly entirely possible piece correct still subtle bug component incorrectly arranged bug undesirable emergent During college period used one management subject semester totally made mad
Tough
well subject like etc tough really Interesting challenging
I really messed subject like Management Information System Services etc full boredom go lot theory
If working pointer important concept know
But somehow I never understood fully college
Design Analysis Algorithms
It much hard understand analyze algorithm designing analyzing new algorithm hard problem difficult requires broad understanding many area practice applying many different technique
deal combinatorial problem problem
Optimization Algorithm challenging Topic
Which difficult CS studied important field
Discrete math
It difficult theory loosely related used CS
Too much memorization I guess
Proof Induction Big O recursion divide conqure Graph Theory blah argh
Compiler easy take Theory Automata
Z method used hurt brain college
Mainly I hated
Hard lot easier enjoy much harder
I like answer I forget upvoting like compiler kernel programmer never met problem
There bit easier common issue thread locking
It easy write program produce magical error make even small bug concurrency architecture
So I say hardest issue computing commonly used dangerous one
It probably I cut teeth FORTRAN APL shift strictly procedural language object something I struggled year
It help write conflicting article tutorial mean object oriented way constructing object oriented program

The applicant must Bachelor Degree Computer Science equivalent Degree Professional Degree accompanied high level practice profession computer computer science specialty
The applicant must present folder following document

Throughout book going using technique called We ca give complete definition term yet chapter introduce building block functional programming Basically mean function thing high school algebra teacher meant except function necessarily relate number
But essential idea like kind function described
In example name function function take called number number
In chapter going use computer explore function going use standard Scheme notation rest book
That chapter want separate idea function complexity programming language notation
For example real Scheme notation let write expression involve one function chapter use one time
To get chapter special computer interface first start running Scheme first chapter type tell Scheme read program using
If trouble loading program look Appendix A information
Then start program type You able carry interaction like following
In text printed type type printing As see different function different number argument
In example added two number took square root one number
However every function give exactly one result time use
To leave program type asks function
Experiment arithmetic function
Try different kind number including integer number decimal fraction
What try divide zero
Throughout chapter going let experiment function rather give long boring list one work
The boring list available reference page
Try These suggestion
Be creative type example
Not Scheme function deal number
A broader category argument including number also including English word like
Even meaningless sequence letter digit considered word
Try function accept word argument
What happens use number argument one
So far function fall one two category arithmetic function require number argument return number result word function accept word argument return word result
The one exception seen
What kind argument accept
What kind value return
The technical term kind data In principle could think almost anything type number contain digit
Such type legitimate sometimes useful also official type Scheme know
Types overlap example number also considered word
The technical term thing function accepts argument function
The name thing function return So domain word range number fact nonnegative integer
This example show range may exactly one standard data type nonnegative integer type Scheme
How talk domain range function
You could say example The function number domain number range
Or informally may also say take number argument return number
For function two argument language little le straightforward
The informal version still work take two integer argument return integer
But ca say The domain two integer domain function possible argument statement characteristic legal argument
By way making certain simplification chapter
For example Scheme function actually accept number argument two
But want go bell whistle start adding two number time
Here example illustrate domain function We going introduce data type function include type domain range
The next type bunch word enclosed parenthesis Do include punctuation character within sentence
Many function accept word domain also accept sentence
There also function accepts word sentence
Try example like sentence
Other important function used ask question
That range function contains two value one meaning true meaning false
Try numeric comparison function work word sentence
The question mark part name function
There also function whose domain range value
The two value true false called named George Boole developed formal tool used value mathematics
What good value
Often program must choose two option If number positive negative
Scheme function make choice based value
For experiment function
Its first argument must true false others anything
So far data type include number word sentence Booleans
Scheme several data type consider one
A used data
Here example The range nonnegative integer
But domain For example try using argument
If used computer programming language may seem strange use part computer data
Most language make sharp distinction program data
soon see ability treat function data help make Scheme programming powerful convenient
Try example Think carefully
You applying function sentence applying function function sentence
Other function used include whose domain integer whose domain everything
If reading book trying thing computer go along get work
Spend time getting used idea thinking
When done read ahead
The idea heart mathematics computer science
For example mathematician want think formally system number use function create integer
They say let suppose one number called zero let suppose given
By applying function repeatedly create
Functions important computer science give u way think simple English way think something happening something changing
A function embodies information taking something know returning something know
That computer They transform information produce new result
A lot mathematics taught school number seen function number
used function word sentence even function function
You imagine function transform information kind function French window function capital California
You done lot thinking function
You add two number make sense add two word number
Some function complicated domain acceptable value one argument depend specific value used one
The function example make sure tried positive negative number fractional well power
Part definition function always get answer whenever call function argument
The value returned function word change regardless anything else may computed meanwhile
One function explored chapter real function according rule one
The rule may seem restrictive indeed often convenient use name function loosely process give different result different circumstance
But see sometimes important stick strict definition refrain using process truly function
We hinted two different way thinking function
The first called Here function rule tell u transform information information
The function rule thing right
The actual thing word number whatever function manipulates
The second way thinking called In view function perfectly good thing
We use function argument another function example
Research college math student show second idea hard people worth effort see function function like make program much easier write
As homey analogy think carrot peeler
If focus attention want peeler represents process
We peeling carrot
We applying function carrot
It carrot count
But also think peeler thing right clean worry whether blade sharp enough
The big idea explored chapter although used lot Chapter function using result one function argument another function
crucial idea write large program defining bunch small function composing produce desired result
We start next chapter return real Scheme notation
In line following table left one piece information
Fill missing detail
What domain function
One function use called
Experiment describe fully domain range
Make sure try lot case
Hint Think name
One function use called
Experiment describe fully domain range
The following exercise ask function meet certain criterion
For convenience function chapter
List function chapter type return value always different type argument
List function chapter type return value sometimes different type argument
Mathematicians sometimes use term operator mean function two argument type return result type
Which function seen chapter satisfy definition
An operator possible argument
For example commutative
Which operator Exercise commutative
An operator possible argument
For example associative
Which operator Exercise associative
Certain punctuation character also used word let defer detail gotten know word function simpler example
Unless version Scheme complex number
Real mathematician say The domain Cartesian cross product integer integer
In order avoid mouthful use informal wording
Yes English word
It astronomy
chapter thread

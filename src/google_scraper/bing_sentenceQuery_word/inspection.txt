Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Stack Inspection security mechanism introduced JVM deal running code originating location different level trust
This question aim finding simple description functionality
So How stack inspection work
See From paper
The stack inspection algorithm used current Java system thought generalization following model In model principal
Likewise privilege available This model resembles stack inspection system used internally Netscape Navigator
In model every stack frame labeled principal frame executing code part virtual machine library otherwise contains privilege flag may set system class chooses privilege explicitly stating want something dangerous
An untrusted class set privilege flag
When stack frame exit privilege flag automatically disappears
All procedure perform dangerous operation accessing file system network first apply stack inspection algorithm decide whether access allowed
The stack inspection algorithmsearches frame stack sequence newest oldest
The search terminates allowing access upon finding stack frame privilege flag
The search also terminates forbidding access throwing exception upon finding untrusted stack frame could never gotten privilege flag

In ability examine modify structure behavior
The earliest computer programmed native inherently reflective original architecture could programmed defining instruction data using
As programming moved compiled language also many language reflective ability largely disappeared programming language reflection built type system appeared
doctoral dissertation introduced notion computational reflection procedural notion component
Reflection used observing modifying program execution runtime
A program component monitor execution enclosure code modify according desired goal related enclosure
This typically accomplished dynamically assigning program code runtime
In programming language reflection allows class interface field method runtime without knowing name interface field method compile time
It also allows new object method
Reflection used adapt given program different situation dynamically
programming almost always requires additional knowledge framework relational mapping object relevance order take advantage generic code execution
Reflection often used part runtime
Reflection also key strategy
In programming language reflection used override rule
For example reflection make possible change value field marked private library class
A language supporting reflection provides number feature available runtime would otherwise difficult accomplish language
Some feature ability These feature implemented different way
In reflection form natural part everyday programming idiom
When verb method called various variable name verb called object verb called populated give context call
Security typically managed accessing caller stack programmatically Since list method current verb eventually called performing test command invoked original user allows verb protect unauthorised use
Compiled language rely runtime system provide information source code
A compiled executable example record name method block executable providing table correspond underlying method selector method compiled program
In compiled language support runtime creation function runtime environment must include compiler interpreter
Reflection implemented language reflection facility using system define automated change
The following code snippet create invoke
For normal call sequence shown
The following example This example assumes class declared unit called This notable example since Delphi unmanaged fully natively compiled language unlike language support reflection
Its language architecture inherits strongly typed Pascal significant influence SmallTalk
Compare example many dynamic script language like Perl Python PHP language runtime like Java C
The following example The following example therefore also applies The following example The following example The following example implying either framework used The following example The following example The following example The following example The following example

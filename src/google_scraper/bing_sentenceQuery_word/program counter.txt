The commonly called sometimes called part instruction sequencer indicates sequence
In processor PC incremented fetching hold next instruction would executed
In processor incrementation precedes fetch PC point current instruction executed
Processors usually fetch instruction sequentially memory instruction change sequence placing new value PC
These include sometimes called jump call
A transfer conditional truth assertion let computer follow different sequence different condition
A branch provides next instruction fetched somewhere else memory
A subroutine call branch save preceding content PC somewhere
A return retrieves saved content PC place back PC resuming sequential execution instruction following subroutine call
In typical CPU PC origin term program counter may one many CPU hardware
The begin CPU place value PC send memory
The memory responds sending content memory location
This model executable instruction stored alongside ordinary data memory handled identically
Following fetch CPU proceeds taking action based memory content obtained
At point cycle PC modified next instruction executed different one typically incremented next instruction one starting memory address immediately following last memory location current instruction
Like processor register PC may bank binary latch one representing one bit value PC
The number bit width PC relates processor architecture
For instance CPU may use bit able address unit memory
If PC binary counter may increment pulse applied COUNT UP input CPU may compute value load PC pulse LOAD input
To identify current instruction PC may combined register identify
This approach permit PC fewer bit assuming memory unit interest within current vicinity
Use PC normally increment assumes computer execute usually linear sequence instruction
Such PC central
Thus programmer write sequential even algorithm sequential
The resulting led research parallel computing including Neumann model use PC example rather specifying sequential step programmer might specify desired programmer might specify using
This research also led way making conventional CPUs run faster including Modern programming language still follow model indeed common way identifying programming error procedure execution programmer finger identifies point execution PC would
The language essentially machine language virtual machine complex built hardware instead emulated software
However new programming model transcend programming

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
A program counter computer contains address location executed current time
As instruction get program counter increase stored value
After instruction fetched program counter point next instruction sequence
When computer restarts reset program counter normally reverts

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I think store address current instruction
And instruction completed program counter incremented get next instruction
But question increment program counter
It would mean increment address work
Assuming architecture alignment instruction word every instruction composed byte
That implies bottom two bit address byte offset within word address denotes byte word
When talking instruction however never need fetch individual byte want whole word
Different textbook handle program counter differently given whichever paradigm using program counter incremented rather lead believe PC store address rather byte address
Then program counter increment fact get
To turn address byte address fetch instruction memory simply
In short program counter address address instruction actually fetching
To fetch next instruction increment program counter

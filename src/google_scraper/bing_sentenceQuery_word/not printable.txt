In however linked applied computing computing context another domain
A folkloric quotation often attributed almost certainly first formulated state computer science computer astronomy telescope
The design deployment computer computer system generally considered province discipline computer science
For example study computer hardware usually considered part study commercial deployment often called information technology
However much idea various discipline
Computer science research also often intersects discipline philosophy
Computer science considered much closer relationship mathematics many scientific discipline observer saying computing mathematical science
Early computer science strongly influenced work mathematician continues useful interchange idea two field area
The relationship computer science software engineering contentious issue muddied term software engineering mean computer science defined
taking cue relationship engineering science discipline claimed principal focus computer science studying property computation general principal focus software engineering design specific computation achieve practical goal making two separate complementary discipline
The academic political funding aspect computer science tend depend whether department formed mathematical emphasis engineering emphasis
Computer science department mathematics emphasis numerical orientation consider alignment
Both type department tend make effort bridge field educationally across research
A number computer scientist argued distinction three separate paradigm computer science
argued paradigm science technology mathematics
working group argued theory abstraction modeling design
Amnon Eden described rationalist paradigm treat computer science branch mathematics prevalent theoretical computer science mainly employ technocratic paradigm might found engineering approach prominently software engineering scientific paradigm approach artifact empirical perspective identifiable branch

The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


Commentary car surgery automated news writing huggable humanoid Mickey Mouse character Disney example many way computer science changing way live work learn play
This push toward automation task job creation intelligent technology simulate human decision emotion substantial benefit society
Many technological innovation advancing health care public safety communication education science improving quality life access
There one better access tool student shape technology future
In recent year dizzying pace technological innovation motivated surge interest creating quality experience student United States
In early President Barack Obama announced called billion federal funding expand computer science elementary middle high school
initiative set motion new focus computer science Some state including Arkansas Texas Virginia West Virginia require high school teach computer science district San Francisco teaching computer science grade level
And member CSforAll Consortium hub initiative made organization continuing connect school funders researcher together
There still much work however
In ongoing multiyear conducted Google Gallup researcher found although student parent teacher school administrator value computer science still offered many school
This lack time funding qualified teacher
Only percent school nationwide reported offering computer science class number rose percent still As educational researcher focused computer science learning welcome push district teach discipline student
But believe nation current conception computer science education go far enough
It sufficient simply give student access
As computer science continues expand advocate educator teach functional computer science literacy field science education spent decade refining approach teaching reasoning integrates learning science content context issue
In fact Kamau Bobb program officer National Science Foundation raised red flag last year without critical analysis redress existing educational inequity may actually undermine equity inclusion computing field
This concern palpable one considers fact leadership team nine powerhouse technology company United States overwhelmingly male percent percent overwhelmingly white percent percent
Greater attention must paid disproportionate influence small group people rest u think feel behave
We urgent need educated populace question push back transform technological innovation toward equitable ethical us society
Because must teach child think design program particular technology consider potential role impact society
Schools strong need infuse critical thinking benefit drawback using technological innovation
Computer science educator prepare student learn computer science concept practice also deal pressing ethical question related capability mass surveillance spreading fake news social medium malicious hacking loss job automation
More Opinion They also help student think ethical implication creating technology perspective versus multiple perspective using communication technology watch people versus reach people using algorithmic trading amass fortune versus investing company provide product service useful society
Consideration ethical social issue related computer science woven throughout computer science curriculum
And teaching ethic rooted shared democratic value participation representation justice
Fulfilling promise laid Obama initiative truly make computer science education priority continue work state district around country
But without addressing ethical issue engendered technological innovation computer science student live full potential
Florence Sullivan associate professor learning technology University Massachusetts Amherst author recently published Creativity Technology Learning Theory Classroom Practice Routledge

In program described designed remember preceding event user interaction remembered information called system
The set state system occupy known
In state space often system internal behaviour interaction environment consists separately occurring individual action event accepting input producing output may may cause system change state
Examples system circuit component
The output digital circuit computer program time completely determined current input state
circuit divided two type whose output dependent present input signal whose output function current input past history input
In sequential logic information past input stored electronic memory element
The stored content memory element given point time collectively referred circuit contains information past circuit access
Since two possible state finite number memory element digital circuit certain finite number possible state
If number binary memory element circuit maximum number state circuit
Similarly computer program store data represent storage location computer
The content memory location given point program execution called program
way designing describes computation term program state statement change program state
In language program describes desired result specify change state directly
A specialized definition state used computer program operate sequentially stream data program
Serial program operate incoming data character packet sequentially one time
In program information previous data character packet received stored variable used affect processing current character packet
This called data carried previous processing cycle called state
In others program information previous data stream start fresh data input called
The output sequential circuit computer program time completely determined current input current state
Since memory element two possible state total number different state circuit assume finite fixed number memory element
If binary memory element digital circuit distinct state
The concept state formalized abstract mathematical called used design sequential digital circuit computer program
An example everyday device state
To change channel TV user usually press channel channel button remote control sends coded message set
In order calculate new channel user desire digital tuner television must stored number
It add one subtracts one number get number new channel adjusts TV receive channel
This new number stored
Similarly television also store number control level produced speaker
Pressing volume volume button increment decrement number setting new level volume
Both number part TV state
They stored preserve information TV turned turned TV return previous station volume level
As another example state content memory element
When computer laptop go save energy shutting processor state processor stored computer restored computer come hibernation processor take operation left
Following state distinguished

From Mark Head Computer science enables programming possible lot programming without understanding computer science concept underlying process computation
This always bad thing
When program work much higher level abstraction
When drive car concern two three pedal gearshift steering wheel
You safely operate car without clear idea work
However want operate car limit capability need know lot automobile three pedal gearshift steering wheel
The true programming
Much mundane everyday work accomplished little understanding computer science
You need understand computational theory build contact u form PHP
However plan write code requires serious computation going need understand bit computation work hood
The purpose article provide fundamental background computation
If interest I may follow advanced topic right I want look logic behind one simplest abstract computational finite state machine
A finite state machine mathematical abstraction used design algorithm
In simple term state machine read series input
When read input switch different state
Each state specifies state switch given input
This sound complicated really quite simple
Imagine device read long piece paper
For every inch paper single letter printed letter letter b
As state machine read letter change state
Here simple state machine
The circle state machine
The arrow transition
So state read transition state
If read stay state
So start read paper tape left right read move state
Then read move back
Another keep u followed move u back state
Simple enough whats point
Well turn run tape state machine done tell something sequence letter examining state end
In simple state machine end tape end letter end tape end letter
This may sound pointless awful lot problem solved type approach
A simple example would determine page HTML contains tag order The state machine move state show read html tag loop get head tag loop get head close tag etc
If successfully make final state particular tag right order
Finite state machine also used represent mechanic parking meter pop machine automated gas pump kind thing
The state machine looked far deterministic state machine
From state one transition allowed input
In word two path leading state read letter
At first sound silly even make distinction
What good set decision input result moving one state
You tell computer execute doSomethingBig execute doSomethingSmall
Well kind state machine
The output state machine final state
It go processing final state read action taken
A state machine anything move state state
It process get end state read something external trigger desired action dispenses soda etc
This important concept come finite state machine
finite state machine finite state machine given input particular state lead one different state
For example let say want build finite state machine recognize string letter start followed zero occurrence letter b zero occurrence letter c terminated next letter alphabet
Valid string would So recognize letter followed zero letter followed next letter alphabet
A simple way represent state machine look like one final state mean string accepted match pattern
Do see problem
From starting point know path take
If read letter know whether go state There way solve problem
One back tracking
You simply take possible path ignore back one get stuck
This basically chess playing computer work
They look possibility possibility possibility choose path give greatest number advantage opponent
The option convert machine deterministic machine
One interesting attribute machine exists algorithm turn machine deterministic one
However often much complicated
Fortunately u example slightly complicated
In fact one simple enough transform deterministic machine head without aid formal algorithm
The machine deterministic version machine
In machine final state reached string accepted machine
The model four state six transition
The deterministic model state transition two possible final state
That much complexity usually grows exponentially moderately sized machine produce absolutely huge deterministic machine
If done type programming probably encountered regular expression
Regular expression finite state machine functionally equivalent
Anything accept match regular expression accepted matched state machine
For example pattern could matched Regular expression finite state machine also limitation
In particular match accept pattern handled finite memory
So type pattern match
Lets say want match string b number followed equal number b
Or n followed n b n number
Examples would At first look like easy job finite state machine
The problem quickly run state assume infinite number point longer finite state machine
Lets say create finite state machine accept followed b
That work fine get string followed b point need rewrite machine handle longer string
For string recognize one little bit longer machine recognize run memory
This known Pumping Lemma basically say pattern section repeated like one pattern regular
In word neither regular expression finite state machine constructed recognize string match pattern
If look carefully notice type pattern every matching look similar HTML within pair tag may number matching pair tag
So may able use regular expression finite state machine recognize page HTML element correct order use regular expression tell entire HTML page valid HTML regular pattern
So recognize pattern
There theoretical device similar state machine called Turing Machine
It similar finite state machine paper strip read Turing Machine erase write paper tape
Explaining Turing Machine take space important point relevant discussion finite state machine regular expression
Turing Machines computationally complete anything computed computed Turing Machine
Since Turing Machine write well read paper tape limited finite number state
The paper tape assumed infinite length
Obviously actual computer infinite amount memory contain enough memory hit limit type problem process
Turing Machines give u imaginary mechanical device let u visualize understand computational process work
It particularly useful understanding limit computation
If interest I another article Turing Machines future
So whats point
How going help create next PHP form
Regardless limitation state machine central concept computing
In particular recognition state machine design exists deterministic state machine thing
This key point mean design algorithm whichever way easiest think
Once proper algorithm convert whatever form efficient
The understanding finite state machine regular expression functionally equivalent open incredibly interesting us regular expression come creating business rule changed without recompiling system
A foundation computer science allows take problem X know solve reason I know solve X I know solve Y I know convert solution Y solution X
Therefore I know solve I think error fixing state machine case
Legal q yet fix would take q v Good catch
The machine accepts valid deterministic machine accepts must least different letter
Thanks pointing
I updated deterministic machine make match one
Where write number followed number b would clearer say followed equal Thanks suggestion
I incorporated
Your regular expression could make use operator would better
Good suggestion
I started I remember sign allowed formal proof
Not article particularly
There reason barred
trivially equivalent That I thinking redundant
Just spelling grammar error
For refrain pointing missing comma depending editor love comma
When read input switch different state
When read input switch different state
The state machine move state show read html tag The state machine move state show read html tag In word two path leading state read letter
In word two path leading state read letter
If read letter know wether go state q If read letter know whether go state q So recognize pattern
So recognize pattern
I appreciate constructive feedback corrected error
Thank
missed Therefore I known solve Therefore I know solve X
Thanks
I believe example pumping lemma incorrect
You represent number followed number b That number followed number b
The wording may slightly ambiguous idea correct
The regular expression given would match input aaaabb whereas machine intended accept input consisting number followed number b
I believe express Kleene star
It common example pumping lemma problem
I got confused number followed number b would clearer number followed number b I agree
The wording ambiguous
I made change
I think example HTML bad one reader get illusion HTML checked Finite State Machine
But since HTML document infinite depth
I know pointed particular case still
I see point
I trying find way illustrate state machine used thing html
But I agree confusing
I try find different example
A SAX Parser finite state machine
If mind qualifying example using XHTML switching generic XML example illustrate want nicely
Ready startElement Parsing endElement Done Need add endElement input Parsing transition back I much ASCII It also nice example using state machine recursion since Parsing state invoke new instance capture child element
A SAX parser finite state machine capable accepting valid XHTML regular expression
What described stop working run memory
But yes practical purpose SAX parser finite state machine accepts subset document valid XHTML
You mistake deterministic translation FSM
The one accepts ACD input yet deterministic version requires least second C ACCD minimally
Adding transition v D would fix
Ah thank
I tried correct one error introduced another
How look
The state u extraneous
The loop following c u u loop following c v v instead mirroring state r side
I pretty sure I need u
Keep mind v final state
ac valid acc valid must followed
That u
It keep machine accepting
I go one well initially agreeing indeed Mark right
But take thought least untrained state mind My vote well followup article
Several statement post contradictory
The second sentence Finite State Machine state example start followed one occurrence letter b one occurrence letter c
The example valid string include ac zero occurrence b ad zero occurrence c
Zero occurrence one
The state diagram shown accept zero b c description state one Thank
I believe I fixed error
You fixed one first paragraph description state diagram
I bit confused
If know always number b state machine increment number ever come across
Or I thinking correctly
A state machine write anything
It finite number state
Once start writing number infinite number state infinite number
Tony question good one
As Mark said finite state machine write anything
Another machine could however remember context many encountered expect number b something called automaton
For information automaton basically add stack Finite State Machine
Mark Your article good one I enjoyed reading
Will intermediate machine way Turing Machines jump directly Turing Machines
I would love see description Automata Machines
Thats good suggestion
It would also interesting talk regular expression converted state machine combine state machine create union complement intersection accepted string
Then whole state minimization algorithm deterministic algorithm would interested get
Unfortunately topic would get away physical mechanical model I sure would interesting people read maybe experiment see people think
Thanks encouragement write
I might wrong seems like regular expression support valid string ac
No right
I corrected error one place forgot change
Thanks
I first say today well done article informative
Thanks
Thanks clear concise explanation
Would love read explanation Turing machine
Thanks
I hope write article Turing machine near future
Another vote Turing machine article
There demand Great article
Thanks
What good book pick learn
I good grasp programming weak understanding theoretical CS
Bob book used undergraduate course Automata Languages Computability Theory Complexity Theory excellent Introduction Theory Computation Michael Sipser
Your article well written despite grammatical error explanation finite state deterministic accurate easily understandable
My objection jumped finite state machine regular grammar directly Turing machine
The example actually context free grammar corresponding machine model pushdown automaton basically finite state machine stack attached model simpler lambda calculus example Turing machine
I see point
My goal really explain Turing machine introduce notion machine allow thing finite state machine
However correct state machine stack going better match parsing something like HTML I used example
Thanks input
This great article
Another vote Turing machine article
Well nice article
I confused comment though
Are theoretical scientist reading blog
I seen level constructive criticism I think ever maybe excepting science paper review In college I found Theory Computation bland topic
But way elucidated deserves plaudit
look forward article Thank article
I waiting Turing Machines one
Thanks easy consumable information I would appreciate detailed information
I always wandered State Machines Turing Machines
I flipped wikipedia several time never really understood wikipedia article bloated hard understand
Thanks lucid explanation
Just quick note using FSMs built using statecharts instead character sequence often intuitive teaching someone material first time c education
Fundamentally difference practice different flavor
In particular design pattern making robust GUIs code statechart fsm possible state like file file loading file active file changed file saving file closing callback handling state transition
As one people program every day without understanding underlying fundamental I appreciated article
It easy follow I came away bit I
Thank
Mark I appreciate taking task
It informative helpful
I looking forward Turing machine concept
I guess found people stuff little OCD typo LOT OCD
Thanks John Thanks
I appreciated everyone feedback
This type thing OCD confusing
I learned long time ago I wait publish article perfect never get posted I glad suggestion
People Found This When Looking For custard eating hobo flower dress What
Someone messing search return page bogus term added
They iterate search bogus term
I least I think happening
They may spoofing referrer header
Thanks article Mark
I found easy follow interesting
Excellent article informative someone CS degree
I hope see follow article Turing
I love phrase custard eating hobo flower dress although I think hyphen separate custard eating
But world
Is quote inside joke trick
I idea
Ah I remembered good old day college topic
I totally agree important understand thing work
For instance might never get write code assembly knowing assembly give understanding higher language like C work way become better programmer Thank article
I studying programming without basic computer science understanding
At least reading article I direction follow next
Turing machine useful programming one might think model computation let reason computable
If building turing machine program likely wrong
Far better follow FSM article something like article pushdown automaton Moore machine Mealy machine etc
Also manage miss I one truly wonderful thing FSMs simple representation
The alphabet set state set terminal state start state transition table simple way organize may end something quite complicated cover
If nothing else help drive home distinction data structure data especially programmer belief complicated data requires complicated data structure
Thanks
I would interested Turing Machine article
I like addition diagram description They definitely help conceptualize describing
Thanks article
I looking forward Turing Machine one
sir plz guide Construct deterministic Finite State Automata following Σ x
Language string second last symbol
b
Language string whose length odd number even
A nice article would read great pleasure
Probably regular expression
Your explanation really simple understand
What meen finite state machine regular expression functionally equivalent open incredibly interesting us regular expression come creating business rule changed without recompiling
I trying point anything want represent state machine business rule etc
also represented string regular expression
So something language execute string regular expression could use create business rule run time could executed using regular expression engine without needing recompile
At least I think I trying point I wrote
Great insight caused sort eureka moment
Thanks great article particular thanks specific example
Thank much writing article
I new concept finite state machine one I found Wikipedia giving Great article THANKS
I used design space electronics Hughes TRW Ball Aerospace
I found state machine article Christopher Claire Electronics magazine
Microprocessors pretty primitive needed something control space instrument provide timing control CCD camera nothing complicated
I found state machine ticket I could scribble flow chart run rest crew even manager could understand incorporate suggestion design SM flow chart MINUTES
I used counter decoder mux combinatorial logic create jump state jam force counter go another next sequencial state
Where microprocessor programmer would spend week getting code work I could pump SM design meeting
It great fun I taught young designer time
Ball Aerospace Boulder CO NASA place quick job space blast lot due lowly state machine
The image link broken
I need delete one letter domain appear
Otherwise article I would like share student
Thanks pointing
It work
Interesting article thanks
But one practicality puzzle deterministic chart v valid endpoint shown double circle since ac valid string
But endpoint also waypoint since acc acd valid well
So implement practical sense
If program waiting character serial interface example would implement kind timeout state v point would say ok look like getting c stop
Obviously depends input actually
If reading paper tape run paper stop looking
If application server someone connected maybe termination connection mean stop looking additional input
Alternatively statemachine may used determine action take place may process looking see statemachine accepted input determine allowed continue
For example statemachine might used determine submit button active web page
Why need u state deterministic state machine
And final state
Try remove u run sample string
You find handle without
There two ending state valid string end c way handle situation single end least I able find
Is correct say state machine really machine keeping track state algorithm computing answer
I need build workflow tracking app I expect I build finite state machine
I thinking show something maintains state time something computes answer like regular expression
To extent answer computed whether string accepted state machine yes
The thing interesting state machine accept reject arbitrarily long string without requiring type memory
Other type machine pushdown automaton instance operate long run memory
You use state machine represent stage workflow tracking app want history different state piece work raw state machine going work
A state machine tell end desired state tell path taken get state
This might want workflow app
You correct state machine computationally equivalent regular expression
Required field marked

In computer science state program defined condition regarding stored input
The term state used similarly used science whereas state object instance gas liquid solid show current physical makeup state computer program show current value content
The stored input computer program stored variable constant
In analyzing state program developer may go look value stored input
As program executed state may change variable change value stored memory also change
For example control variable variable used loop change state program iteration
Looking state program considered testing method way analyzing code base
Developers also talk different type state example contrasting two complementary state contradictory one another contrasting two different state resulting different operation

Root cause analysis approach drill deep identify basic reason root repeatedly asking question logical answer From Change analysis investigation technique involves precise specification single deviation change difference leading deviation may found comparison similar situation deviation occurred
This approach applicable situation performance shifted significantly
It explores change made people equipment information may contributed change performance

The method discovering root cause
Continuously asking help drive discovery reason error
The fundamental reason failure error root cause
Five technique used many time human interaction involved process problem error arose
For example patient died computer froze important ask happened
Why patient die
Because operation could continue
Why could operation continue
Because computer screen froze
Why computer screen freeze
Because computer powered many day use
Why machine powered
Because running surgery know computer needed shut faster simply hibernate machine
After determining root cause problem problem could solved someone designated power computer operation
Problem discovery healthcare system often complex previous example many cause found interact event
suggests involvement stakeholder interdisciplinary team important drilling cause
The team need answer happened happened happened done prevent reoccurrence
Teams rather individual become focus accreditation body thorough analysis root cause often avoid sanction particularly sentinel event one described patient died
Evidently Joint Commission formerly called JCAHO maintains database sentinel event tracking review
The JCAHO started endeavor continues today
Over event collected
What treasure trove database would medical data miner
focusing question
The question given shareholder
It wise find variable actually predict rather people think predict
In word team brainstorm collect information clinical note
Members might assume know cause feature selection sometimes point predictive relationship thought without statistical analysis
A number tutorial text contain feature selection analysis
provided thorough explanation fishbone process show fishbone diagram skeleton illustrating cause problem
The author also mentioned fishbone diagram turned positive exploring path opportunity increasing good outcome
In reverse fishbone item stated positively outcome value added
also used graphical understanding problem outcome
Decision tree generated using data could easily used searching root cause
demonstrated use decision tree finding best test patient considering cost involved see

The hospital deciding whether infection cause unintended death consider condition patient upon entering hospital
Certainly surgery undergo RCA
Exploring extra cost phlebotomy redraws may affect bottom line
Examining complication plastic surgery study abdominoplasty
One photograph article showed nasty infection patient described
The author pointed avoid possible necrotizing fasciitis paramount patient access qualified person surgeon least day
discus current trend people obtain medical care expensive surgery country
There always enough time infection control worked travel plan
reported RCA concerning patient died second kidney stone operation
The patient died bleeding day second operation see disseminated intravascular coagulation learn bleeding surgery
A CT scan revealed fractured kidney
This event brought investigation Sentinel Event

By using pinpoint cause contaminated sample lab lean team instituted standardized process urine collection along education critical care unit started approximately contaminated sample
Contaminated sample produce false positive increase time also expensive
The standardized process hospital instituted provided lab sample
This process change eliminated much lab rejecting sample hour old
With sample lab could work faster reject fewer
By end year contamination rate dropped

This statistical method compare topographic value superpixels time
It calculates probability value difference height value two time point caused chance alone
A high value would indicate high probability change caused chance low value would mean change occur chance
Topographic change analysis automatically done third scan obtained one baseline two scan
The analysis made raw topographic value independent disc contour delineation

The RNFL thickness longitudinal evaluation OCT explored recent study
Wollstein et al compared ability peripapillary RNFL measurement obtained OCT visual field clinical assessment detecting progression glaucoma suspect glaucoma patient
Investigators found greater likelihood glaucomatous progression identified OCT versus automated perimetry
Safety investigation also use TEM process effective tool
Triggered event safety investigator use TEM process conduct thorough analysis occurred
The initial step list threat error whether managed mismanaged
Also linking error threat many time identify latent systemic threat otherwise would overlooked
The fact threat mismanaged might indicate never properly identified strategy manage particular threat employed
This could help focus training improving skill area
The process would utilized error
A mismanaged threat often lead error mismanaged error lead event
Since error trapped either safety hardware policy put place Resist employee use CRM skill resolve analysis lead better corrective action
This type investigative analysis help identify needed change training safety hardware policy procedure human factor training
NTSB Board Member Robert Sumwalt stated presence company employee right thing even one watching
The LOSA TEM program integral part company Safety Management System SMS key element establishing safety culture
TEM process enables employee better identify manage threat error everyday life
By longer think rather establish safety core value
If action taken address root cause verified confirm corrective action taken effective entire investigation waste time resource
In today competitive environment company afford waste time resource therefore money door
More important completing verification effectiveness help company document proper investigation completed
In chapter review determine constitutes proper verification effectiveness verify corrective preventive action fact effective
We also review constitutes successful execution CAPA plan demonstrate corrective action effectively addressed mitigated root cause identified CAPA record
This chapter provide outline needed complete verification effectiveness VOE plan corrective action preventive action
This comprehensive troubleshooting guide type immunoassay
Instructions provided use chapter investigate improve unsatisfactory assay performance
Each type performance issue separate section list possible cause used starting point
For possible cause information provided allow reader dismiss unlikely cause immediately resulting shortlist possible cause consistent fact
Then suggested course action provides strategy identifying likely cause shortlist
Recognizing investigation many immunoassay problem involves user manufacturer working together checklist useful information provided user prepare efficient dialogue manufacturer
Finally case study type problem provided eventual solution
recommended Bayesian technique use learning model
This book allows researcher conduct research many way
Some may use huge data warehouse also developing learning model analysis
Others may use EBM data tailoring treatment individual patient predicting specific outcome
There doubt accrediting agency impact upon local research effort
We see potential effect building result recent legislation
The signed law President Obama March included new requirement accrediting agency
On June Supreme Court upheld law
The original document massive tedious read yet medical community read also understand document law affected much practitioner would paid
Two nine Obama bill directly related need book quality efficiency health access innovative medical
The author book hoped ACA law would move consumer become informed outcome related different medical treatment care health
In addition hoped law would insure doctor would reimbursed according patient outcome
In way doctor would become thinking
Ideally Medicare would reimburse excellence care data would become available transparent analyze outcome
As result law hoped see research quality treatment led good result
Ideally ACA would force accreditation organization revamp standard reflect requirement related law
In best case scenario law would support metric methodology associated modern accurate predictive analytics
Because standardization equates community trust accredited healthcare organization advertise recognized provider quality patient care
In Dr Mitchel Goldstein present The Joint Commission TJC detail
TJC recognized national accrediting organization
The TJC accredited healthcare entity throughout United States
On website Commission list accreditation standard Ambulatory health care Behavioral health care Critical access hospital Home care hospital Laboratory service care
The mission statement continuously improve health care public collaboration stakeholder evaluating health care organization inspiring excel providing safe effective care highest quality
As TJC make change publishes prepublication change
In listed prepublication statement Standard Vaccination Licensed Independent Practitioners Staff hospital link
The standard may purchased TJC website
Woven within standard requirement proof standard number hospital written description methodology used determine influenza vaccination When accreditation team arrives direction given method determining denominator numerator rate provided hospital
Obviously analytical process program like Six Sigma see would apply hospital attempt improve required quality standard
For example standard number state hospital includes infection control plan goal improving influenza vaccination

method used identifying fault problem
A factor considered root cause removal thereof prevents final undesirable outcome recurring whereas causal factor one affect event outcome root cause
Though removing causal factor benefit outcome prevent recurrence certainty
Essentially based four general principle extended throughout article RCA particularly useful world commercial aviation
Root cause may described point causal chain applying corrective action intervention would prevent problem occurring
RCA applied methodically identify correct root cause event rather simply address symptomatic result
Focusing correction root cause goal entirely preventing problem recurrence
Conversely RCFA Root Cause Failure Analysis recognizes complete prevention recurrence one corrective action always possible
RCA typically used reactive method identifying event cause revealing problem solving
Analysis done event occurred
Insights RCA make potentially useful preemptive method
In event RCA used predict probable event even occur
While one follows RCA completely separate process
For example imagine fictional segment student received poor testing score
After initial investigation verified student taking test final period school day got lower score
Further investigation revealed late day student lacked ability focus
Even investigation revealed reason lack focus hunger
So root cause poor testing score hunger remedied moving testing time soon lunch
As another example imagine investigation machine stopped overloaded little fuse blew
Investigation show machine overloaded bearing sufficiently lubricated
The investigation proceeds find automatic lubrication mechanism pump pumping sufficiently hence lack lubrication
Investigation pump show worn shaft
Investigation shaft worn discovers adequate mechanism prevent metal scrap getting pump
This enabled scrap get pump damage
The root cause problem therefore metal scrap contaminate lubrication system
Fixing problem ought prevent whole sequence event recurring
Compare investigation find root cause replacing fuse bearing lubrication pump probably allow machine go back operation
But risk problem simply recur root cause dealt
Rather one sharply defined methodology RCA comprises many different tool process philosophy
However several defined approach school identified basic approach field origin
Despite different approach among various school root cause analysis share common principle
Several general process performing RCA also defined
RCA step form critical part successful corrective action directing corrective action true root cause problem
Knowing root cause secondary goal prevention possible determine absolutely effective corrective action defined problem without knowing root cause

In series step easy root cause analysis process requires special training little effort lot common sense
By Documented management supported incident response process process response team well trained wo necessarily achieve ultimate objective preventing recurrence unless root cause identified
In series step easy root cause analysis process requires special training little effort lot common sense
In Part look constructing simple root cause diagram later analysis
Many organization even response team fail prevent recurrence unwanted event treat symptom instead underlying cause
For example payroll late switch failed many organization would simply look deal better switch failure
But switch failure may proximate cause root cause
For purpose I define proximate cause activity occurred spatially temporally immediately prior incident
The root cause often failed control process gap staff skill set caused earlier condition event
This earlier event set series cause effect leading proximate cause
In Figure example root cause condition activity occurred Event well proximate cause
The best way prevent recurrence change happened Event
In word making change process condition early chain event usually better managing proximate cause
In switch failure example organization might discover underlying problem missing broken change management process
Fixing root cause prevent switch failure recurrence
It would also help prevent unrelated failure well
There many way build root cause diagram
The popular approach pushed root cause trainer fishbone Ishakawa diagram
A simple fishbone shown Figure complicated analysis shown Figure
However u technical type prepared inclined spend time building complex framework
We need something straightforward something quickly get root cause get next user system issue arose worked one
The Five Why answer challenge
consists eight step lead incident managed resolution including root cause analysis recurrence prevention
Step root cause analysis simple approach
Ask five time able identify fundamental issue issue leading primary event
Although many practitioner actually graph answer I prefer
As discus Part picture often make easier see problem
Let step example shown Figure
In incident vendor supplied desktop computer controlled critical production system replaced
The production system immediately failed causing interruption critical process
The root cause analysis team formed following company AAR process ensuring complete objective recording event
To begin analysis facilitator asked first
Why incident happen
Two proximate cause identified
First replacement system configured properly
Second response user problem report effective
The team agreed two cause treated separately
They appear result different cause effect chain
For example focus caused bad system configuration
The facilitator continued asking second
Why system configured improperly
This continued answer three iteration
The assumption sufficient granularity identify root cause
But root cause sometimes apparent answering fifth
When happens team must step process looking activity condition might omitted first pas
Like AAR process root cause analysis must free
Every participant must understand participation result disciplinary action peer ridicule management must back assertion
We continue process identifying one root cause decide

This area data science public le familiar
This example involves small data simulation year old crowdsourcing
It attempt explain cause TWA Flight exploded near New York July
I raised possibility potential cause Malaysia Airlines flight went missing last week hit missile accidental
Likewise many people still believe TWA destroyed missile
However numerous investigation strongly debunk myth
Here I summarize data science concept used debunk missile theory TWA flight tragedy
Traces explosive found later attributed military investigator might accenditally contaminated wreckage AFTER investigation started
But clearly ruled based fracture burn human remains fireball caused bomb missile warhead
Intervews witness scattered area recorded
Witnesses answered question flight path sound time sound light streak sky including light sound intensity question
That crowdsourcing part crucial ruling missile theory explained next paragraph
Note data science involving data recording using right metric asking right question checking whether answer consistent across witness
Some criticized FBI asking question contained keyword missile create bias answer
Monte Carlo simulation data science technique used
After missile visibility test conducted April NTSB determined witness observed missile attack would seen light burning missile motor ascending rapidly steeply second light disappearing second upon missile striking aircraft igniting CWT another light moving considerably slowly laterally first second light descending simultaneously developing fireball falling toward ocean
None witness document described scenario
Note lot variance witness perception happened based location personal factor
There also lot variance missile hitting plane scenario could appear based launched missile factor
Reconciliating proving case witness report missile simulation totally incompatible matter slice various factor challenging data science task
Anyway reading I convinced caused missile
Do still believe missile theory
Maybe believe analysis wrong truth hidden
What recent Malaysia Airlines crash
Could missile

Contents The purpose root cause analysis strike root problem finding resolving
class problem solving method aimed identifying root cause problem event

The practice root cause analysis predicated belief problem best solved attempting opposed Our fundamental principle Accordingly root cause analysis first three main tool approach solving difficult social problem
The diagram explains three tool work together
A high quality root cause analysis ca done without using root cause oriented process turn ca done well without model based analysis
Tool thus magnifies power Tool magnifies power Tool
Most sustainability problem solver exactly definition caution
They merely addressing immediately obvious symptom
These absolutely work correct eliminate root Why root cause analysis powerful tool elegantly expressed Henry David Thoreau famous quote
Here full quote In word giving time money needy resolve root cause plight
It may even make problem worse
Here deepest penetrating insight entire website THE strategic reason popular solution sustainability problem failing resolve root cause
Given principle explanation possible seen million activist working problem forty year
Popular solution made small difference
Many small local success occurred
We even one international success solving stratospheric ozone layer problem
Overall however winning battle losing war
This insight hold type problem gone unsolved generation multitude solution strategy tried brilliant dedicated activist
Let examine insight explains problem solving behavior macro level
problem solving process used activist including organization working sustainability problem problem whose solution would benefit common good
The rest use
See three chapter three process
Since popular process Classic Activism let examine lens insight
Let see much understanding glean insight
When solution fails classic activist assume failed get truth across somehow
They inspire enough people reach enough people message bargain correctly stakeholder manage solution implementation correctly forth
So try type solution time somehow different better
They redouble effort find truth promote truth amplify truth
When fails classic activist idea next repeat strategy even vigor permutation gradually give
There however completely different way activist look problem solution
This requires stepping door new paradigm
This world complex social system
These system populated intelligent social agent goal constraint asset habit
At heart paradigm lie abstraction change resistance use root cause analysis
It took ten year solve stratospheric ozone hole problem
It took year solve woman suffrage problem Western nation
It took century solve slavery problem year solve subsequent civil right problem
The problem never solved environmental sustainability problem recurring war recession problem institutional poverty problem excessive income inequality problem
If change resistance high root cause analysis used solution invariably ca solve change resistance subproblem
Since ca solve ca solve subproblem people consider problem solve
For example environmental sustainability problem economic system improperly coupled environment
Their relationship unsustainable
It vital able think term root cause
To make easy productive helpful diagram Click diagram see present problem
Click hide chain
The chain run symptom
This universal chain
It everywhere system many causal chain determine behavior
The immense challenge facing problem solver seeing superficial layer
What superficial layer easy see
No analysis necessary find intermediate cause solution
But superficial go deep enough
They resolve root cause
To one must penetrate fundamental layer
This extremely difficult see requires analysis lead root cause resolving root cause
Thus solving problem requires seeing causal chain run fundamental solution root cause intermediate cause problem symptom
That root cause analysis work
O So solution
If cause solution obvious
It But worked
Because root cause resolved
What deeper cause much greenhouse gas emission
The standard answer externalized cost
This mean cheaper pollute
Why cheaper
Because law internalizing cost market transaction like emission limit carbon tax would
This explains great popularity emission limit carbon tax
But solution worked nation unable pas necessary legislation
The top two greenhouse gas emitter world China United States signed Protocol Treaty climate change
Most rest world dragging foot
The shocking result shown Emissions growth proven unstoppable
Why
Because popular solution addressing root cause
In word Those promoting popular solution hacking branch evil instead striking root
How strike root
With root cause analysis
Why world dragging foot
Because systemic
Until overcome modest progress adopting popular solution like mandatory limit carbon tax
That sustainability problem need subdivided subproblems important How overcome change resistance
The root cause change resistance need found fixed
Only system want accept solution like Kyoto Protocol climate change carbon tax
But environmental movement treating change resistance distinct separate problem solve
Instead using inspiration exhortation bargaining try get solution adopted
This step four
If classic activist switched process driven root cause analysis treated change resistance separate problem would long graph took pleasant turn downward
The analysis found four main root cause environmental sustainability problem
Finding took seven year due extreme difficulty problem need simultaneously develop suitable process
The divide one big problem three subproblems present difficult social problem How overcome change resistance achieve proper coupling avoid excessive model drift
The sustainability problem turned two proper coupling problem described
The root cause subproblem shown first gray row The content table demonstrate well conceived root cause analysis cut toughest problem reveal new insight lead novel solution considered
The hard part finding root cause
Everything else followed easily

Despite sincere effort fix problem Challenger loss seventeen year later almost identical management organizational factor cited Columbia Accident Investigation Board report
The Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated shortly landing killing seven crew member
These two isolated case
In major accident past year industry aerospace technical information prevent accident known often even implemented
But case potential engineering technical solution negated organizational managerial That hard fix root cause difficult social problem
This explains formal process fit sustainability problem required
Performing root cause analysis reliably efficiently includes solution working well long period time requires
Are concerned rise populust authoritarian like

These average minute
They give quick introduction Dueling Loops model explains tremendous change resistance solving sustainability problem
The article site since written December
More people contacted u easy read paper related Dueling Loops video anything else site
Do every wonder sustainability problem impossibly hard solve
It phenomenon change resistance
Why root cause several potential solution presented
The astonishing short read page site never heard
The memo written breaking problem smaller easier solve problem
Exactly done determines strength analysis
You see powerful technique used analysis missing mainstream environmentalism tried
This explains different outcome expected
The key technique
The analysis performed seven year period
The result summarized top shown Click table full table high level discussion analysis result
Popular approach solving sustainability problem see obvious black arrow
This lead using push resolve
Popular solution superficial fail see fundamental layer complete causal chain run
intuitively seems popular solution like renewable energy strong regulation solve sustainability problem
But ca resolve root cause
In analytical approach penetrates fundamental layer find well hidden Further analysis find developed create solves problem
For see glossary
First analysis divided sustainability problem Then subproblem individually analyzed
For overview see
This different ancient Romans
Subproblems like several order magnitude easier solve longer trying vain solve simultaneously without realizing
This strategy changed million problem insolvable solvable work
For example u impossible
But paper decomposing problem nine case time adding result change problem insolvable solvable
tendency system resist change even surprisingly large amount force applied
system resisting change none subproblems solvable
Therefore subproblem must solved first
Until solved effort solve three subproblems largely wasted effort
The successful change resistance appears Too many voter politician deceived thinking sustainability low priority need solved
The resolving root cause We need inoculate people deceptive false meme people infected falsehood hard change mind see truth
occurs two social life form working together harmony
In sustainability problem cooperating smoothly people
Instead many corporation dominating political decision making advantage shown strenuous opposition solving environmental sustainability problem
The appears The goal corporate life form maximization profit goal human life form optimization quality life living descendent
These two goal achieved system
One side win side lose
Guess side losing
The resolving root cause follows easily
If root cause corporation wrong goal high leverage point occurs problem evolves solution model keep
The model away needed keep problem solved
The solution model solving important problem like sustainability recurring war recurring recession excessive economic inequality institutional poverty drifted far unable solve problem
The appears Various step decision making process working properly resulting inability proactively solve many difficult problem
This indicates low decision making process maturity
The resolving root cause In subproblem economic system improperly coupled environment
Environmental impact economic system growth exceeded capacity environment recycle impact
This subproblem world see The analysis show false assumption however
The change resistance subproblem must solved first
The appears like air breath
This mean presently way manage common property efficiently enough sustainably
The resolving root cause order radically lower transaction cost
There must reason popular solution working
Given principle reason popular solution working year million people trying This fundamental insight
Using result analysis input Each resolve specific root cause thus solves one four subproblems shown Click table high level discussion solution element The solution see differ radically popular solution The right subproblems found earlier analysis step decomposed one big Gordian Knot problem
Everything change root cause resolution approach
Once analysis build model problem find root cause high leverage point solution developed push leverage point
Because solution aimed resolving specific known root cause ca miss
It like shooting target ten foot away
The bullseye root cause
That Root Cause Analysis fantastically powerful
Nine Sample Solution Elements The high leverage point overcoming change resistance We somehow fooled easily deceptive politician
This easy
Overcoming change resistance crux problem take nine solution element solve subproblem
The first key
In subproblem analysis found two social life form large corporation people conflicting goal
The high leverage point Since one causing problem right mean reengineer modern corporation right goal
Corporations never designed comprehensive manner serve people
They evolved
What today called It serf
What need instead This life form designed serve people rather
Its new role trusted servant whose goal providing good service needed optimize quality life people sustainable manner
Solution element drifted far decision making model government use decide
incapable solving sustainability problem
The high leverage point Like Corporation process never designed
It evolved
thus quite want
The solution work like Imagine would like politician rated quality decision
They would start competing see could improve quality life common good
That would lead pleasant world ever seen
Solution element Presently economic system improperly coupled environment
The high leverage point radically reduce cost managing sustainability problem
This done Each steward would goal sustainably managing portion sustainability problem
Like way corporation charge good service steward would charge ecosystem service use
The income go solving problem
Corporations gave u Industrial Revolution
That revolution incomplete steward give u Solution element This summarizes past ten year research

Corey Great stuff
This really go long way toward helping codify document root cause incident
Thanks much sharing insightful well written well thought post
Corey I interested knowing anything appeared shimcache data Harlan I wanted know thing I went back case post
I analysis January I first learned shim cache April Mandiant post came
The shim cache would useful since prefetch file show malware executing provide additional timestamps
Unfortunately thing I held onto case exploit timeline note
Hi Corey Very interesting stuff
How would compare VERIS work malware root cause analysis I http
anon Thanks comment took bit respond since I reading thing mentioned
First I really enjoy reading Microsoft security report provide wealth information
I missed report mentioned read I saw link
It good way
We talking issue different perspective
I think main difference report I talking
The report like Microsoft security report coming malware analysis perspective
Looking understnading malware already computer
Do get wrong malware analysis perspective needed I enjoy reading
However perspective coming malware forensics side house
Looking system find malware determine got
Your report even mention page actual method infection difficult determine without performing forensic work computer
The comment made reference MSRT detection point Compromise Root Cause Analysis Model
To help performing forensic work determine actual method infection
I never tried compare model others VERIS
Thinking I think comparable model
The model may helpful providing language describe security incident
To much help telling malware system came targetting Java malicious email attachment network share
This Root Cause Analysis Model come play help answer security incident occured
Hi Corey Great post
It seems like server mine got infected file dont match original one file marked malicious avast av window pc
tool use analyse linux server find entry point malware
pointing article regarding question also helpful
thanks

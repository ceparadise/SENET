In intentional stopping pausing place put place purpose
It also sometimes simply referred
More generally breakpoint mean acquiring knowledge program execution
During inspects test log etc
find whether program functioning expected
In practice breakpoint consists one condition determine program execution interrupted
Breakpoints commonly used interrupt running program immediately execution
This often referred
Other kind condition also used reading writing modification specific location area memory
This often referred
Breakpoints also used interrupt execution particular time upon keystroke etc
When breakpoint hit various tool used inspect state program alter
may used see chain call led paused instruction
A list allows one view value selected
There may also tool show content loaded program information
Many include support breakpoints typically instruction data breakpoints
As example instruction set architecture provides hardware support breakpoints
Such hardware may include limitation example allowing breakpoints instruction located
This kind limitation imposed processor varies processor processor
Without hardware support multitasking environment implement breakpoints software
For instruction breakpoints comparatively simple task replacing instruction location breakpoint either This technique may difficult implement multitasking system using shared program storage interrupt may occur different thread requiring resurrection original instruction thread
Also program resides protected memory overwriting instruction may prevented
Alternatively Some debugger allow register program variable memory modified resuming effectively allowing introduction temporary assignment test purpose
Similarly program instruction often skipped determine effect change program logic enabling question program execution answered direct way
without assumption guesswork
In many case may practical method testing obscure error subroutine rarely ever get executed without added risk leaving temporary source change
Manually changing resume location within paused program used enter otherwise rarely executed section code specific hardware condition handler
Implementing data breakpoints software however greatly reduce performance application debugged since using additional resource processor
However normally acceptable testing amount information available debugger restricted limitation debug data known hardware
For instance software implementation collect logical path data level considerably augment might stored particular hardware platform inspection
The instruction set simulation method considerably reduces overhead compared repeated instruction replacement method also reducing
Some programming language implementation debugging function use program
For example dialect statement originally intended act instruction breakpoint
implement debugger accessible Python program
These facility abused act like statement
Breakpoints invented one earliest digital computer programmer
Early mainframe computer console allowed breakpoints specific instruction storage address provided single cycle operation permitting content register memory observed directly console light
The advent multitasking limited use option since entire machine halted
Programmers used machine code patch implement single destructive breakpoints cause since early day computer
The core dump provided state register memory exact moment deliberate crash
The advent console allowed interactive debugging capability early arrival ubiquitous connected fully interactive full screen debugging multitasking environment became reality
This also permitted program execution true manner optional register memory alteration simultaneously displayed
Initially type animation level machine code later advanced source level animation

I came know breakpoints
I worked last year using Visual Studio I never used data breakpoints
Can someone throw light data breakpoints use use VS
As per understanding set data breakpoint want check change variable value
In case set data breakpoint condition variable value
Any example
Definition Data breakpoints allow break execution value stored specified memory location change
From MSDN From Debug Menu choose New Breakpoint click New Data Breakpoint Breakpoints window Menu click New dropdown choose New Data Breakpoint
The New Breakpoint dialog box appears
In Address box enter memory address expression evaluates memory address
For example foo break content variable foo change
In Byte Count box enter number byte want debugger watch
For example enter debugger watch four byte starting foo break byte change value
Click Good ol data breakpoint toss anecdote highlight useful us Any scenario know change little idea code changing life since otherwise could simply use conditional breakpoint
Specifically program crashing variable variable never code anywhere ever set variable
Put normal breakpoint code initializes hit set data breakpoint watch change
Somewhat common case memory released still pointer hanging around use data breakpoints find releasing memory
library bad nasty horrible thing data structure
You know happening trashing data obviously code perfect
But know
Sure could megabyte disassembled DLL bother set data breakpoint data sit back wait get trashed
similar impossible scenario go away watch closely normal breakpoints even conditional breakpoints useless
Timing sensitive logic particularly vulnerable sort thing
Since data breakpoints require debugger actually break assuming come memory location change elusive bug actually occurs use data breakpoints set trap Heisenbug catch
common old rotten code base global data accessed
Yeah could use plain ol conditional breakpoints need hundred
Data breakpoints make easy
So far got great definition bunch great theoretical explanation
Let concrete example
I currently working rather large convoluted codebase
I made small safe change one bit code started getting completely unrelated chunk codebase crash memory allocator
This generally sign something Very Wrong memory management either writing
Thankfully option turn debug memory manager check thing like
I turned immediately started reporting memory block guard violation mean something wrote bound
The problem report show memory deallocated essentially saying hey something broken
Hope figure
Unfortunately particular chunk memory point deallocation completely indistinguishable literally thousand chunk memory
Fortunately debug framework tag allocation consecutive ID memory got corrupted consistent ID curious
One quick breakpoint memory manager later I able find memory allocated
Which turned immediately helpful either
But point I several important component Given I could set data breakpoint specific byte hit go find corruption occured
Which I led error I process fixing
And concrete example data breakpoints useful
I believe data breakpoints breakpoints occur memory set certain value
For example set breakpoint typical loop stop iteration
You also watch change variable heap like wait member class modified

Breakpoints controlled processor request debugger known
Breakpoints controlled directly debugger known
Although term commonly used synonym term misleading
There two fundamental type breakpoints processor breakpoints controlled processor software breakpoints controlled debugger
Processor breakpoints usually set program data reason called data breakpoints also set executable code
Software breakpoints usually set executable code also set program data
Unfortunately common debugging literature refer processor breakpoints data breakpoints even set executable code
A processor breakpoint triggered specific memory location accessed
There four type processor breakpoints corresponding kind memory access trigger execute Triggered processor retrieves instruction specified address
Triggered processor read writes memory specified address
write Triggered processor writes memory specified address
Triggered port specified accessed
Each processor breakpoint size associated
For example write processor breakpoint could set address size four byte
This would monitor block address inclusive
If block memory written breakpoint triggered
It happen processor performs operation memory region overlap identical specified region
In example given preceding paragraph single write operation includes range write operation includes byte would overlapping operation
In situation whether breakpoint triggered
For detail situation handled specific processor consult processor archictecture manual look debug register debug control register
To take one specific processor type example processor read write breakpoint triggered whenever accessed range overlap breakpoint range
Similarly execute breakpoint set address instruction spanning address executed result
Again consult processor architecture manual detail
The processor distinguishes breakpoints set debugger breakpoints set debugger
A processor breakpoint affect process
A processor breakpoint might might affect process depending whether code using debug register state whether debugger attached
To apply current process existing data breakpoints different register context use command
On multiprocessor computer processor breakpoint applies processor
For example current processor use command put breakpoint processor processor executes address trigger breakpoint
This hold software breakpoints well
Software breakpoints unlike processor breakpoints controlled debugger
When debugger set software breakpoint location temporarily replaces content memory location break instruction
The debugger remembers original content location memory displayed debugger debugger show original content memory location break instruction
When target process executes code location break instruction cause process break debugger
After performed whatever action choose cause target resume execution execution resume instruction originally location
On Windows Server Service Pack computer us emulate processor breakpoints work execute option work write option
The option available debugging target computer running Windows XP later version Windows processor
Not data size used processor breakpoint type
The permitted size depend processor target computer
For detail see
It possible specify data address rather program address using bm command
However even data location specified command create software breakpoints processor breakpoints
When debugger place software breakpoint location temporarily replaces content memory location break instruction
This corrupt executable image debugger remembers original content location target process attempt execute code debugger respond appropriately
But software breakpoint set data location resulting overwrite lead data corruption
Therefore setting software breakpoint data location safe certain location used executable code
The command set software breakpoints replacing processor instruction break instruction
Therefore used code code overwritten
To set breakpoint code must use execute option
You create multiple processor breakpoints address differ command automatically executed breakpoint triggered
However create multiple breakpoints address differ restriction example create multiple breakpoints address using command different value option
The initial breakpoint process typically set function equivalent processor breakpoint
The number processor breakpoints supported depends target processor architecture
Software breakpoints created command
Processor breakpoints created command
Commands disable enable modify breakpoints apply kind breakpoints
Commands display list breakpoints include breakpoints indicate type
For listing command see
The WinDbg dialog box display breakpoints indicating processor breakpoints notation e r w followed size block
This dialog box used modify breakpoint
The text box dialog box used create type processor breakpoint desired begin input ba
For detail see
When set breakpoint using mouse WinDbg debugger creates unresolved software breakpoint
Processor breakpoints stored processor debug register
It possible set breakpoint manually editing debug register value strongly discouraged

There many programming language
To execute compiled interpreted
An IDE integrated development environment used write code test error translate program
process working program systematic way eliminate flaw glitch
A program usually included within
If section code give different result would expect try make section code work isolation
You may give value make work
If something find section code responsible make sure running expect
If something happening find section code make particular thing happen

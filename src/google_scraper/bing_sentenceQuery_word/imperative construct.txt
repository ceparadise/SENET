In us change program
In much way express command imperative program consists perform
Imperative programming focus describing program operates
The term often used contrast focus program accomplish without specifying program achieve result
type imperative programming program built one procedure also termed function
The term often used synonym use procedure dramatic effect imperative program appear constructed
programming change localized procedure restricted explicit argument return procedure form
From onwards structured programming general promoted technique improve overall quality imperative program
The concept behind attempt extend approach
Procedural programming could considered step towards declarative programming
A programmer often tell simply looking name argument return type procedure related comment particular procedure supposed without necessarily looking detail achieves result
At time complete program still imperative since statement executed order execution large extent
The hardware implementation almost computer imperative
Nearly computer hardware designed execute native computer written imperative style
From perspective program state defined content memory statement instruction native machine language computer
imperative language use complex statement still follow paradigm
process also familiar concept similar style imperative programming step instruction physical world hold state
Since basic idea imperative programming conceptually familiar directly embodied hardware computer language imperative style
imperative paradigm perform operation information located memory store result memory later use
imperative language addition permit complex may consist combination evaluation assignment resulting value memory
Looping statement allow sequence statement executed multiple time
Loops either execute statement contain predefined number time execute repeatedly condition change
statement allow sequence statement executed condition met
Otherwise statement skipped execution sequence continues statement following
Unconditional branching statement allow execution sequence transferred another part program
These include jump called many language subprogram procedure call usually return next statement call
Early development introduction enabled construction program group statement declaration could treated one statement
This alongside introduction enabled complex structure expressed hierarchical decomposition simpler procedural structure
Many imperative programming language
The earliest imperative language machine language original computer
In language instruction simple made hardware implementation easier hindered creation complex program
FORTRAN developed IBM starting first major programming language remove obstacle presented machine code creation complex program
FORTRAN allowed named variable complex expression subprogram many feature common imperative language
The next two decade saw development many major imperative programming language
In late developed order allow mathematical algorithm easily expressed even served target language computer
carried imperative paradigm logical extreme statement relying purely command even extent making IF ELSE command independent connected intrinsic variable named TEST
attempt make programming syntax look like English
In developed created working
Wirth went design
For need team began designing project define requirement language
The specification first published revision
The saw rapid growth interest
These language imperative style added feature support
The last two decade century saw development many language
originally conceived released Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
Drawing concept another considered world first developed designed language based
Design began first implementation completed
In late notable imperative language drawing concept released released included MFC released respectively released released Yukihiro Matz Matsumoto released
Microsoft imperative core main target language run however Microsoft functional language also run

I searching web looking definition declarative imperative programming would shed light
However language used resource I found daunting instance
Does one real world example could show might bring perspective subject perhaps C
Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
A great C example declarative imperative programming LINQ
With programming tell compiler want happen step step
For example let start collection choose odd number With imperative programming step decide want Here saying With programming hand write code describes want necessarily get declare desired result Here saying Give u everything odd Step collection
Check item odd add result collection
In many case code mixture design always
Declarative programming say want imperative language say get want
A simple example Python The first example declarative specify implementation detail building list
To tie C example generally using LINQ result declarative style saying obtain want saying want
You could say SQL
One benefit declarative programming allows compiler make decision might result better code might make hand
Running SQL example query like SQL compiler optimize query know indexed field maybe indexed case iterate entire data set anyway
Or maybe SQL engine know perfect time utilize core speedy parallel search
programmer concerned condition write code handle special case way
Declarative v
Imperative A fundamental style computer programming
There four main paradigm imperative declarative functional considered subset declarative paradigm
programming paradigm express logic computation What without describing control flow How
Some example declarative domain specific language DSLs include CSS regular expression subset SQL SELECT query example Many markup language HTML MXML XAML XSLT often declarative
The declarative programming try blur distinction program set instruction program assertion desired answer
programming paradigm describes computation term statement change program state
The declarative program dually viewed programming command mathematical assertion
Functional programming programming paradigm treat computation evaluation mathematical function avoids state mutable data
It emphasizes application function contrast imperative programming style emphasizes change state
In pure functional language Haskell function without side effect state change represented function transform state
The following example imperative programming loop number find even number
Both example yield result one neither better worse
The first example requires code code testable imperative approach give full control implementation detail
In second example code arguably readable however LINQ give control happens behind scene
You must trust LINQ provide requested result
I add another example rarely pop programming discussion User Interface
In C build UI using various technology
On imperative end could use DirectX OpenGL imperatively draw button checkboxes etc really triangle triangle
It say draw user interface
At declarative end WPF
You basically write XML yeah yeah XAML technically framework work
You say user interface look like
It system figure
Anyway another thing think
Just one language declarative imperative mean certain feature
Also one benefit declarative programming purpose usually easily understood reading code whereas imperative give finer control execution
The gist Declarative want done Imperative want done Imperative programming requires developer define step step code executed
To give direction imperative fashion say Street turn left onto Main drive two block turn right onto Maple stop third house The declarative version might sound something like One say something say need done
The declarative style two advantage imperative style Calvert C Kulkarni D
Essential LINQ
Addison Wesley

All answer online post mention following What told u
For part program declarative part must hide implementation detail code
In fact reason functional programming functional library declarative abstracted away loop list creation hiding implementation detail likely imperative code loop behind scene
In program always imperative declarative code aim hide code behind abstraction part program use
Finally although functional programming LINQ make program declarative always make even declarative providing abstraction
For example I liked explanation Cambridge course example In computer science declarative programming programming paradigm express logic computation without describing control flow
From nutshell declarative language simpler lack complexity control flow loop statement etc
A good comparison model
You declarative file imperative code file
I often find I I need declarative half script lot people follow done
Imperative programming telling computer explicitly like specifying order C Declarative tell computer really
Datalog Prolog first language come mind regard
Basically everything declarative
You ca really guarantee order
C much imperative programming language certain C feature declarative like Linq The thing could written imperatively example wikipedia Linq Stealing Two example Imperatively Declaratively Imperatively Declaratively Note imperative example involve creating new variable mutating returning new value make something happen whereas declarative example execute given input return new value based initial input want happen
The difference mostly overall level abstraction
With declarative point far away individual step program lot latitude regarding get result
You could look every piece instruction falling somewhere continuum Declarative Real World Example Imperative Real World Example Just add another example term mobile app development
In iOS Android Interface Builders define UI apps
The UI drawn using Builders declarative nature drag drop component
The actual draeing happens underneath performed framework system
But also draw whole component code imperative nature
Also new language like Angular JS focussing designing UIs declaratively may see lot language offering support
Like JAVA doesnot good declarative way draw native desktop apps JAVA swing JAVA FX near future might
A programming language requires programming discipline Java COBOL FORTRAN Perl JavaScript
Programmers writing language must develop proper order action order solve problem based knowledge data processing programming
A computer language require writing traditional programming logic Users concentrate defining input output rather program step required procedural programming language Java
Declarative programming example CSS HTML XML XSLT RegX
declarative program data universal imperative
plus specifying data hardcoded checked format simpler le specifying variant imperative algorithm directly
complex specification cant written directly DSL form
best freq used DSLs data structure set table
dependency
havent dependency freedom modify ease support
compare example module class module happy class fragile base class problem good declarativeness DSL follows immediately benefit data structure table set
another plus change implementation declarative language vm DSL abstract well designed
make parallel implementation example
port o etc
good specifed modular isolating interface protocol give freedom easyness support
minus guess right
generic parameterized DSL imperative implementation may slower memory hungry specific one
case
case rare forget let slow
frequient always extend case
somewhere slowing case sure
Frameworks DSL imperative
halfway solution combine deficiences benefit
safe AND fast look haskell halfway strong simple ML flexible metaprog Prolog monster
look Prolog Haskell
simple flexibility Haskell From understanding term root philosophy declarative imperative kind knowledge
Declarative knowledge assertion truth statement fact like math axiom
It tell something
Imperative procedural knowledge tell step step arrive something
That definition algorithm essentially
If would compare computer programming language English language
Declarative sentence state something
A boring example declarative way displaying whether two number equal Java Imperative sentence English hand give command make sort request
Imperative programming list command
Here imperative way displaying whether two number equal accepting user input Java Essentially declarative knowledge certain element form layer abstraction element
Declarative programming
I wonder one mentioned Attribute class declarative programming tool C
The popular answer page talked LINQ declarative programming tool
According Wikipedia Common declarative language include database query language SQL XQuery regular expression logic programming functional programming configuration management system
So LINQ functional syntax definitely declarative method Attribute class C configuration tool declarative

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
In Anthony Aaby section make following observation Much work semantics programming language motivated problem encountered trying construct understand imperative program assignment command
Since assignment command reassigns value variable assignment unexpected effect distant portion program
This strike remarkable admission allowing side effect would motivate major part work semantics
How existence programming language impact ability map program computational model
Are approach managing state improve process still allowing side effect
Building Charles answer main difficulty theory programming language natural notion equivalence program typically strict equality either straightforward mathematical semantics give underlying machine model
For example consider following bit code So program creates object name x creates second object named continues executing code
Now suppose programmer decides flip order allocation two object Now ask question refactoring change behavior program
On one hand underlying machine x allocated different location two run program
So sense program behaves differently
But language test reference equality order difference code
As result programmer expect reversing order make difference final answer compiler writer expect able perform reordering optimization basis
On hand language compare pointer ordering casting integer first reordering necessarily preserve observable behavior
One central question semantics answer question two program observably equivalent
Since notion observation depends feature programming language end definition like two program equivalent client program compute different answer based receiving program input
The quantification client program make question difficult seems like end say something possible client program say something two particular piece code
The trick denotational semantics give mathematical interpretation let avoid universal quantification say meaning piece code mathematical value compare checking see mathematically equal
This local ie compositional involve quantification possible client
You need show denotational semantics implies contextual equivalence sound course
When complete denotational equality exactly contextual equivalence say semantics fully abstract
But mean need ensure denotational semantics validates equivalence
So example wanted give denotational semantics language need ensure calling new take heap give back new heap object meaning program invariant permutation input heap
This involve quite complex mathematical structure eg case working category ensures everything work modulo suitable permutation group
There course way dealing effect denotational semantics
For example use idea idea also used design Haskell
One problem monad hard combine
suggested algebraic theory also called encompasses effect common effect algebraic state continuation
For comprehensive treatment see
I also mention local state developed Frank Oles sorry ca find better link stuff predates Moggi monad
They used category presheaves provide semantics language correctly modeled many aspect local state I think model allowed snapback maybe memory serf wrong
Matthias Felleisen presented compelling solution side effect problem semantics series Syntactic Theories Control State
That line work resulted CESK machine simple abstract machine framework capable concisely modeling functional imperative even logic language
The CESK framework handle side effect also complex control construct like exception continuation laziness even thread
The CESK machine operational semantics broadly de facto standard programming language theory two decade
In short CESK machine machine four component describe every machine state control string generalization program counter environment store also called heap current continuation
The environment map variable address store map address value
This make straightforward model mutable variable change value address
It also make easy model pointer dynamic allocation make store address value
In similar fashion continuation result making addressable value
It necessarily make difficult impose restriction way semantics larger expression constructed smaller one
It interact badly certain programming construct instance one want give denotational semantics language allowing assignment function global reference
It simply side effect like state cause trouble
Simple imperative language Dijkstra guarded command language kind side effect nice semantics
Trouble arises extension kind operational semantics expected programming language even absence side effect earliest Plotkin PCF given denotational model relatively early semantics fully abstract meaning denotational semantics overly general exactly corresponding operational semantics
PCF finally recieved fully abstract denotational semantics late game semantics like Scott semantics
Concurrency still received fully adequate denotational treatment
Many question importance kind semantics
We always provide kind operational semantics even semantics program source name machine compiled run program reason Strachey condemned operational semantics
But Plotkin structural operation semantics shown operational semantics separated machine model Pitt work shown semantics support similar reasoning program programming language denotational semantics
Thus operational semantics viable alternative denotational semantics applied success substantial number programming language Standard ML
To extent difficulty providing semantics correspond difficulty providing powerful programming language behave way one would expect
Pragmatically motivated design decision avoiding use global state together concurrency typically make easier provide semantics
By posting answer agree

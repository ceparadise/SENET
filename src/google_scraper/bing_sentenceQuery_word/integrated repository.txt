Subversion centralized system sharing information
At core repository central store data
The repository store information form typical hierarchy file directory
Any number connect repository read write file
By writing data client make information available others reading data client receives information others
So interesting
So far sound like definition typical file server
And indeed repository kind file server usual breed
What make Subversion repository special ever written change every file even change directory tree addition deletion rearrangement file directory
When client read data repository normally see latest version filesystem tree
But client also ability view state filesystem
For example client ask historical question What directory contain last Wednesday Who last person change file change make These sort question heart system designed track change data time

The book available
Other information available online recommendation good source welcome
The process getting started CVS may take bit time plan try CVS repository read online documentation get speed
Record keeping became necessary people wanted compare program current state point past
For example normal course implementing new feature developer may bring program thoroughly broken state probably remain feature mostly finished
Unfortunately time someone usually call report bug last publicly released version
To debug problem may also exist current version source program brought back useable state
Restoring state pose difficulty source code history kept CVS
The developer simply say effect Give program three week ago perhaps Give program time last public release
If never kind convenient access historical snapshot may surprised quickly come depend
Personally I always use revision control coding project saved many For collaboration CVS assumes developer equal status project provides ability check copy project modify check copy independently
At check CVS check file committed one currently repository case conflict alert developer conflict
When conflict second person committing resolve conflict repository accept new code
To create CVS repository departmental CVS server send request help asking creation personal CVS repository creation project repository related research group class department
Personal CVS repository created CVS server project repository created CVS server project name
After repository space created necessary initialize repository CVS
Login CVS server run cv repository directory init This create CVSROOT initialize file CVSROOT directory
If wish run multiple CVS repository CVS repository directory need run init command inside repository subdirectory

Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate


A database repository logical also sometimes physical grouping data related separate database
This usually done purpose data data item needed reside different database
In case repository necessary bring together discrete data item operate one
Database repository usually discussed implemented realm data warehousing business intelligence
This usually requires level aggregation data database simply provide thus necessitating creation structure
Consider case large bank
Such institution likely composed several different subsidiary physical sense rather functional sense
There traditional bank account division addition loan division forex treasury division investment banking division safe deposit division
All division run separate information system course implies separate database
However division must report financials back head office
The Chief Financial Officer CFO need aggregate financial data various division gauge profitability feed directly bank overall financial position
You see CFO office really concerned operational part various database really interested data deal financials
Another thing note relies completely division reporting inform decision take generate data
Enter data repository
This likely another system database distinct others directly access relevant data database aggregate meaningful information CFO
However important remember data information CFO looking may may physically located data repository
The repository may simply read direct database performance reason may store local copy data accessed others
The repository likely include ability show performance trend time compare contrast division target show deviation along period
Some goal clearly context Business Intelligence
Also since CFO mostly interseted reporting opposed data input generation data repository likely system one minimal writes addition aggregating data going back long period
This function start cross context Data Warehousing
A data repository thus logical aggregation data item separate database one centralized location specific purpose achieved using database

Computer simulation either small running almost instantly small device program run hour day group computer
The scale event simulated computer simulation far exceeded anything possible perhaps even imaginable using traditional mathematical modeling
Over year ago simulation one force invading another involved modeling tank truck vehicle simulated terrain around using multiple supercomputer High Performance Computer Modernization Program
Other example include model material deformation model complex organelle living organism complete simulation life cycle project Switzerland begun May create first computer simulation entire human brain right molecular level
Because computational cost simulation used perform inference
A algorithm equation used capture behavior system modeled
By contrast computer simulation actual running program contains equation algorithm
Simulation therefore process running model
Thus one would build simulation instead one would build model either run model equivalently run simulation
Computer simulation developed rapid growth computer following first deployment model process
It simulation using
Computer simulation often used adjunct substitute modeling system simple possible
There many type computer simulation common feature attempt generate sample representative scenario model complete enumeration possible state model would prohibitive impossible
The external data requirement simulation model vary widely
For input might number example simulation waveform AC electricity wire others might require terabyte information weather climate model
Input source also vary widely Lastly time data available varies Because variety diverse simulation system many common element large number specialized simulation language
The may sometimes called year proposed
There
Systems accept data external source must careful knowing receiving
While easy computer read value text binary file much harder knowing compared value
Often expressed error bar minimum maximum deviation value range within true value expected lie
Because digital computer mathematics perfect rounding truncation error multiply error useful perform error analysis confirm value output simulation still usefully accurate
Even small error original data accumulate substantial error later simulation
While computer analysis subject GIGO restriction especially true digital simulation
Indeed observation inherent cumulative error digital system main catalyst development
Computer model classified according several independent pair attribute including Another way categorizing model look underlying data structure
For simulation two main class Equations define relationship element modeled system attempt find state system equilibrium
Such model often used simulating physical system simpler modeling case dynamic simulation attempted
Formerly output data computer simulation sometimes presented table matrix showing data affected numerous change simulation

design simulation developed
Special care taken handle event situation simulation equation valid changed
The open project started develop reusable library simulation together complete graphical environment generates code based library
Computer simulation used wide variety practical context The reliability trust people put computer simulation depends simulation therefore crucial importance development computer simulation
Another important aspect computer simulation reproducibility result meaning simulation model provide different answer execution
Although might seem obvious special point attention random number actually number
An exception reproducibility simulation flight simulation
Here human part simulation thus influence outcome way hard impossible reproduce exactly
manufacturer make use computer simulation test safety feature new design
By building copy car physic simulation environment save hundred thousand dollar would otherwise required build test unique prototype

Furthermore simulation result often aggregated static image using various way
In debugging simulating program execution test rather executing natively detect far error hardware detect time log useful debugging information instruction trace memory alteration instruction count
This technique also detect similar hard detect error well produce performance information data

For example probabilistic risk analysis factor determining success oilfield exploration program involves combining sample variety statistical distribution using
If instance one key parameter net ratio stratum known one significant figure result simulation might precise one significant figure although might misleadingly presented four significant figure
The following three step used produce accurate simulation model calibration verification validation
Computer simulation good portraying comparing theoretical scenario order accurately model actual case study match actually happening today
A base model created calibrated match area studied
The calibrated model verified ensure model operating expected based input
Once model verified final step validate model comparing output historical data study area
This done using statistical technique ensuring adequate value
Unless technique employed simulation model created produce inaccurate result useful prediction tool
Model calibration achieved adjusting available parameter order adjust model operates simulates process
For example traffic simulation typical parameter include distance sensitivity discharge headway lost time
These parameter influence driver behavior long take driver change lane much distance driver leaf car car front quickly driver start accelerate intersection
Adjusting parameter direct effect amount traffic volume traverse modeled roadway network making driver le aggressive
These example calibration parameter match characteristic observed field study location
Most traffic model typical default value may need adjusted better match driver behavior specific location studied
Model verification achieved obtaining output data model comparing expected input data
For example traffic simulation traffic volume verified ensure actual volume throughput model reasonably close traffic volume input model
Ten percent typical threshold used traffic simulation determine output volume reasonably close input volume
Simulation model handle model input different way traffic enters network example may may reach desired destination
Additionally traffic want enter network may able congestion exists
This model verification important part modeling process
The final step validate model comparing result expected based historical data study area
Ideally model produce similar result happened historically
This typically verified nothing quoting statistic fit
This statistic measure fraction variability accounted model
A high value necessarily mean model fit data well
Another tool used validate model graphical residual analysis
If model output value drastically differ historical value probably mean error model
Before using model base produce additional model important verify different scenario ensure one accurate
If output reasonably match historic value validation process model reviewed updated produce result line expectation
It iterative process help produce realistic model
Validating traffic simulation model requires comparing traffic estimated model observed traffic roadway transit system
Initial comparison trip interchange quadrant sector large area interest
The next step compare traffic estimated model traffic count including transit ridership crossing contrived barrier study area
These typically called screenlines cutlines cordon line may imaginary actual physical barrier
Cordon line surround particular area city central business district major activity center
Transit ridership estimate commonly validated comparing actual patronage crossing cordon line around central business district
Three source error cause weak correlation calibration input error model error parameter error
In general input error parameter error adjusted easily user
Model error however caused methodology used model may easy fix
Simulation model typically built using several different modeling theory produce conflicting result
Some model generalized others detailed
If model error occurs result may necessary adjust model methodology make result consistent
In order produce good model used produce realistic result necessary step need taken order ensure simulation model functioning properly
Simulation model used tool verify engineering theory valid calibrated properly
Once satisfactory estimate parameter model obtained model must checked assure adequately perform intended function
The validation process establishes credibility model demonstrating ability replicate actual traffic pattern
The importance model validation underscore need careful planning thoroughness accuracy input data collection program purpose
Efforts made ensure collected data consistent expected value
For example traffic analysis typical traffic engineer perform site visit verify traffic count become familiar traffic pattern area
The resulting model forecast better data used model estimation validation

For digital information type stored computer data typically number stored binary code portrayed string zero one
In mathematics statement two quantity equal
In geometry equation often used determine shape curve surface
The power exponent one base number must multiplied produce another number
For instance base system must multiplied produce
So logarithm base system
In base logarithm would would
computing To try imitate condition function appearance something
Computer program referred
mathematics A letter used mathematical expression may take one different value
experiment A factor changed especially one allowed change scientific experiment
For instance measuring much insecticide might take kill fly researcher might change dose age insect exposed
Both dose age would variable experiment
Being almost like something
An object concept virtually real would almost true real quite
The term often used refer something modeled accomplished computer using number using part
So virtual motor would one could seen computer screen tested computer programming device made metal

As programming naturally encounter lot error
Causing understanding fixing error important part programming
Python best run anything tell run ca understand asking wo run program
All Python try tell little bit information went wrong order help try fix
Here two Python error
In first example forget use parenthesis required
Python understand trying
Here second example bug Python
In second example forget define variable
Python know want since defined error occurs
A happens Python ca understand saying
A happens Python understands saying run trouble following instruction
In English would like sentence The grammar sentence make sense
From perspective English grammar missing action
You understand asked
mean thing
In English would like sentence The sentence make sense grammatical perspective verb noun right place know asked
But encounter problem start trying eat piano except maybe termite
This called occurs program start running
We also talk end mean program run without crashing still produce wrong result
An example would This would logic error also open even though command make sense close back door actually accomplish goal keeping bug since still come front door
Here additional example syntax error occur Python
One general thing occur Python encounter special symbol place expect
Python say point exclamation point
The problem meaning Python
The syntax error would go away put instead Python would understand part text
Here another syntax error subtle
The problem special word Python
written instead class would fine
Click see list special keywords Python
If using quote around text forget second one using parenthesis forget second one get syntax error In error short nd f ine Python expected another line ended found
Similarly short nd f ile Python kept looking program file ended found
Sometimes two similar syntax error give two different error message
But every error message indeed trying tell something helpful
Here common error
Python able understand program say run problem actually performing instruction
You find way producing error learn Python
Your program might run without crashing syntax error still wrong thing
For example perhaps want program calculate two number average defined Why program work
The average program print instead
The error time order operation arithmetic
When write mathematical meaning
To fix problem third line program written make clear Python really want value add first divide afterwards
You logic error program incorrectly write code follows design correctly like example
Logic error difficult spot especially longer program get better writing code also get better avoiding logic error
Lesson give tip avoiding logic error
Now lesson complete three exercise fixing error program
You try spot error running program run first use Python response determine need fixing

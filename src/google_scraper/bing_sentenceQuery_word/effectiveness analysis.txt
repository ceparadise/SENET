Visualization method transformation data information image diagram animation
Concise Oxford Dictionary state visualization mean imagine remember actually seeing
Besides Webster Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defined visualization act process interpreting visual term putting visual form
In another word visualization communication information using graphical representation
There longer obstacle collecting data information though extracting necessary value collected information turned gradually complex complicated
Since early day written language formalized using picture communication visual imagery efficient way correspond tangible abstract idea
We human complex great vision system utilize rely everything daily basis speed analyzing text quite limited u sequential process reading
The main reason visualization convey explore analyze information
To specific visualization used present large amount information compactly various view point several level detail
Furthermore help u extract important information hidden within data
Visualization essential manage today world information computer satellite digitized system etc
Some data set naturally better represented visually since posse ability powerful human vision system
Graphical representation make easier analyzing data especially information relation segregated different color shape size
As today technology tremendously growing invention computer capability generate large data set visualization suited technology extract study information collected raw data
Some example visualization comprise mapping blogosphere web trend map detailed study current online trend hierarchical structure internet display connectivity managed
In addition visualization offer considerable financial advantage today competitive world
Computer simulation together visualization save product expense time required production
There terminology used represent visualization
Scientific visualization computer science field mean method graphically displaying real simulated data
It fundamental process innovative realization scientific idea basic visualization technique contain surface rendering volume rendering animation processing algorithm sensory presentation sound touch
Another phrase express visualization data visualization
Data visualization general compared scientific visualization data source involve business marketing financial data beyond science engineering field
Moreover consists statistical process standard data analysis technique
Information visualization used visualize abstract information abstract structure directory file computer hypertext document World Wide Web etc
It draw intellectual history several custom like computer graphic human computer interaction statistical graphic
Visualization classified based context data exists
Based data set technique visualization differed
Scientific visualization method used data exists three spatial coordinate time dimension whereas information visualization data higher dimensional abstract space
Scientific visualization information visualization overlap allied field
The relationship three different visualization found figure
Figure Types Visualization Figure illustrates step visualization process
The first step designing visualization analyzing data visualized
It necessary find whether data database file source simple complex able structured allows easy modification suit visualization
The designer need take note presentation visualization result information user wish extract enormous data set
Raw data transformed symbolic representation
Secondly data value data attribute mapped graphical object shape line color position size
The last component visualization process rendering graphic object computer onto display generation visualization user interpretation
Figure Visualization Process High Level View One fundamental question information visualization describe expressiveness effectiveness two mathematical measure visualization applied stage visualization process
Besides visualizing important parameter consider visualization symbol graphic feature eight visual variable
Jock Mackinlay American visualization expert state visualization expressive visualization encodes relevant information information
That denotes person may see information want examine without distraction
Therefore expressiveness measure concentration information
Perfect visualization mean ideal expressiveness tough achieve reality
Expressing much information lead interference interpreting essential information expressing le information miss important datasets need visualized
Effectiveness mean information presented clearly quickly cost effective manner
Hence effectiveness measure precise cost information awareness
Beshers Feiner scientist adapt two measure express potential expressiveness potential effectiveness
A visualization potentially expressive potential user control display essential information time
It potentially effective information presented sufficiently clear time
In visualization symbol create wide range new possibility visual effect
Symbols used connect many intention play valuable role information visualization
Visual object graphical symbol part visualization like arrow label dot etc
To discover relation pattern visualization Cleveland state two major step
The first step mapping graphic symbol represented data
Lastly finding pattern screen imply pattern data
Graphics represented three dimension
Every single point graphic construed relation two position x third variable value z
Graphics analyzed three main step
First perceive group object followed characterizing group cognitively
The final step examine special case group
To represent different aspect information choosing visual variable crucial affect perception understanding presented information
Thus essential understand graphic primitive variable
The eight visual variable
Position It important visual variable change x location
In visualization spatial arrangement first thing done
That reason positioning greatest impact display information
Shape Shapes mark refer point line area volume composition graphic primitive represent data
There infinite number shape used categorization
Size Size change area length volume
It influence way individual data representation display
Brightness Brightness luminance good large interval continuous data
However limitation distinguish among different level brightness
Color It change according two parameter hue saturation
It requires mapping data value individual color code
Orientation Orientation change alignment
It used mark
For example circle look even orientation change
Shapes natural single axis best apply orientation
Texture It combination many visual variable including mark color orientation
Motion Motion describes visual variable change time convey information
Visual perception mean ability interpret process information visible light surrounding environment
Not everyone perceives data exactly
Different viewer differently interpret identical visual representation
When designing visualization reduce confusion later designer need take account color usage graphical entity accurate measurement quantity distinct entity etc
Besides also need consider primitive human usually detect level accuracy perceive various primitive
Consequently visualize data basic requirement learn limit human perception since need factor limitation avoid producing image vague deceptive information
The human eye composed many part
They obtain visual image focus accurately send message brain
The main sensory component vision assembles light scattered object form two dimensional function photoreceptors small sensory device respond presence photon making light wave
Information related external object environment captured visual system
Light ray object enters outer part eye named cornea
It help eye focus make thing look sharp clear
Then light ray travel towards opening called pupil dark round circle middle colored part eye
The colored eye called iris pupil hole iris
The iris control amount light go eye
Besides eye also posse lens focus light ray
Light pass lens till back eye retina
It million tiny light sensitive cell sending message part brain optic nerve
A pair normal healthy human eye view degree horizontally approximately degree shared eye giving rise known binocular vision
It field view degree vertically
However get older value decrease
Both human eye positioned le front head common prey specie help increase animal total field view
Angular resolution refers minimum distance eye differentiate thing size shape
The typical set human eye angular resolution one minute arc
It mean object one degree apart distinguished
Therefore angular resolution useful need differentiate similar object
Nevertheless every human eye different angular resolution varies based eyesight strength eye shape age
The photoreceptor cell eye used perceive light information received relayed brain via optic nerve
Blind spot visual field lack light detecting photoreceptor cell optic disc retina
A small part field vision perceived cell detect light
Normally two eye brain interpolates blind spot based surrounding detail information eye blind spot would detected
However blind spot perceived easily one eye closed
Attention act critical role perceiving information
Perception attentive
Usually flow perceived information start low level towards high cognitive stage
Professor Treisman state perception performed le regarded
Initiating random location element display human eye normally take least
That determines attention particular situation information processed parallel human visual system
perception requires object posse unique feature color size
For attentive perception us short term memory selective
Attentive task convert premature image effect object
Attentive perception generally slower often signifies aggregate scene
When designing visualization designer take note pro con human visual system provide visuals viewer easy analysis
Thus order use visual feature effectively produce visual interference effect masking information display visualization creator aware attentive task visual feature like length width hue intensity lighting direction
The primary step visualization data visualise
It must explore examine characteristic data since many different kind source wide variety attribute feature
Data differentiated two main type ordinal numeric value nominal value
To specific ordinal value mean Binary value Discrete value integer value particular division Continuous real value Nominal value Categorical value list possibility Ranked categorical variable significant ordering Arbitrary infinite range value without significant ordering Scale another useful technique sorting data variable since graphical attribute raw data posse scale associated
There three attribute scale Ordering relation ranked nominal variable ordinal variable ordered manner Distance metric ordinal variable distance different record calculated Existence absolute zero variable fixed lowest value In reality real world data analyzed incomplete noisy incoherent cumulative
Those raw data need transformed somehow understandable format process transformation known data
Data greatly improve quality data visualization result
There different aspect data Metadata statistical Missing value data cleansing Normalization Segmentation Sampling Dimension reduction Mapping nominal dimension number Aggregation summarization Smoothing filtering Raster vector conversion For information data technique refer
Visualization technique differed different type data since comprise special characteristic
Main type data useful visualization method discussed section
Spatial attribute identify data multi dimension
Visualizing spatial data defined mapping spatial data spatial attribute screen
Techniques visualization data include histogram linear probe flow visualization vector field visualization slice plus isosurface isosurface plus glyph
Geospatial data geographic information classifies geographic location boundary real world
They include coordinate topology earth
Examples geospatial data consist climate environmental economical sociological credit card payment location
Visualization method data completed using dot map pixel map network map choropleth map cartograms
Multivariate data list table data arises one variable
It normally precise spatial attribute
Multivariate data visualized point based technique like force based method line based technique like graph parallel coordinate andrew curve radial axis technique region based technique bar chart histogram tabular display
Combination technique also applied sometimes
Bertin declares tree graph network visualization demonstrates relationship data recorded similarity among value attribute parent child node connectedness network country around world shared classification derivation
Space filling method non space filling method displaying arbitrary graph network node link graph method tree graph network visualization
map pixel map network map choropleth map cartograms
By applying suitable visualization technique valuable information obtained huge resource information digital library text file computer billion word thesis paper
Searching comparable pattern outlier within text document painful without visualization
Tag cloud word tree text arc arc diagram used visualizing single document
Visualization practice collection document self organizing map themescapes document card
John group clarify interaction within data visualization helpful structure transforming user see perceive
Interactions transform visualization image better smooth transition
Summary interaction technique discussed
Navigation It allows user adjust camera position scale vision
Examples include panning rotating zooming
Selection Selection refers categorizing object collection object
To precise grant user control region interest
Highlighting deleting modifying type selection
Filtering The size data mapped screen reduced filtering technique reducing omitting dataset dimension
Reconfiguring It change way analyzed data mapped visualization graphical attribute like reordering data layout order provide diverse way viewing data
Encoding Users permitted control graphical attribute point size line color discover different feature visualization
Connecting Connecting mean linking different view object
Abstracting Elaborating It modify level detail
Hybrid Hybrid defines combining technique together
In fact visualization implemented designer larger risk ineffective effective
It simple build effective visualization user satisfy many chance data distorted lost mapping process data presented confusing complex user interpret
A successful effective visualization efficiently accurately transmits preferred information viewer
Therefore designer take consideration targeted user really want observe result able visualize effectively
Ed Chi explains essential consider importance data semantics context user
To avoid misinterpretation designer able predict user expectation
Choosing mapping provides user mental model significantly support interpretation
The designer take note compatibility scale data graphic attribute screen
Besides utilize human ability correlate position screen medium position real world
It obvious one view hardly satisfactory express information enclosed dataset
Expecting view modification useful user one major factor developing effective visualization
Common view operation follows
Scrolling Zooming Operations This operation come handy dataset huge presented one whole resolution viewer want
Color Map Control It allows user make change individual attribute color entire palette
Mapping Control Mapping control help viewer toggle among different way visualizing data discover distinct feature might hidden
Scale Control The user focus specific data subset applying scale control modify range distribution value
The designer decision verify much information display play important role effective visualization representation
Alexandru point little information present best display result text
Conversely data much information present might cause confusion lose essential information within data face obscurity interpretation
In case user permitted disable enable different component presentation
Most visualization ineffective lack useful supported information aid
Keys label legend therefore helpful
Examples include caption mapping used grid mark unit ax key symbol color bar etc
Color add significant visual appeal visualization also significantly decrease effectiveness communication process
Usage color context dependent characteristic dataset influence color noticeable
The designer forget might color blind user well
Visuals informative pleasing eye known best representation
If visualization aesthetically pleasant attracts viewer analyze greater detail
Some useful guideline attractive visualization design
Focus The user attention drawn towards vital part visualization
Balance Balancing screen space another aspect take note designing pleasing visualization
The important component placed center
Simplicity Representing much information confuse viewer
The designer get rid feature removed without losing information wanted pas since best simple possible

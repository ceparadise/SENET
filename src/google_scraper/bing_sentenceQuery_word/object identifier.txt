An important distinction programming language difference language language
A language usually considered includes basic capability object identity property attribute
A language considered also capability inheritance
Polymorphism refers ability overload name function multiple behavior based object passed
Conventional message passing discriminates first object considers sending message object
However OOP language CLOS enable discriminating first parameter function
Inheritance ability subclass object class create new class subclass existing one inherits data constraint behavior parent also add new change one
programming approach designing modular reusable software system
The approach evolution good design practice go back beginning computer programming
simply logical extension older technique
An object abstract data type addition
Rather structure program code data system integrates two using concept object
An object state data behavior code
Objects correspond thing found real world
So example graphic program object
An online shopping system object
The shopping system support behavior
The object designed class hierarchy
So example shopping system might high level class
There may refinement example etc
These class subclass correspond set subset mathematical logic
An important concept object
A design pattern provides reusable template address common problem
The following object description example common design pattern object
The approach programming model
It used equally well distributed system
The object distributed computing model tend larger grained longer lasting programming object
A standard method package distributed object via Interface Definition Language IDL
An IDL shield client detail distributed server object
Details computer object resides us platform specific issue
The IDL also usually part distributed environment provides service transaction persistence object uniform manner
Two popular standard distributed object standard DCOM
In addition distributed object number extension basic concept object proposed enable distributed computing Some extension term special type ordinary object used certain context
Others abandon usual case object resides single location time apply concept group entity replica might span across multiple location might weakly consistent state whose membership might dynamically change
The essentially distributed object framework
Two key technology Semantic Web OWL RDF
RDF provides capability define basic property attribute accessible via Internet
OWL add richer object model based set theory provides additional modeling capability multiple inheritance
OWL object like standard large grained accessed via Interface Definition Language
Such approach would appropriate Internet Internet constantly evolving standardization one set interface difficult achieve
OWL object tend similar kind object used define application domain model programming language Java
However important distinction OWL object traditional programming object
Where traditional object get compiled static hierarchy usually single inheritance OWL object dynamic
An OWL object change structure run time become instance new different class
Another critical difference way model treat information currently system
Programming object database system use
If fact known system fact assumed false
Semantic Web object use statement considered false actual relevant information false otherwise assumed unknown neither true false
OWL object actually like object artificial intelligence Loom
The following table contrast traditional object programming language Java Semantic Web Objects

Identifier Definition An identifier simply name program name variable within program used identify relevant
Typically identifier must start letter must space
Search Identifier UK US Search Identifier rest Computing Students

In reference Object Identifier tree
What expect subject standard
Make
b
Where tree would new format new product placed
Here answer question
A
As per ASN Oid tree given subject matter would related ISO Member body come ISO Member body
Solution clearly explains example identifying OID Object Identifier Tree represented

An identifies label either unique object unique object object class may idea physical countable object class thereof physical noncountable substance class thereof
The abbreviation often refers identity identification process identifying identifier identification
An identifier may word number letter symbol combination
The word number letter symbol may follow wherein letter digit word symbol represent idea longer name may simply arbitrary
When identifier follows encoding system often referred
Identifiers follow encoding scheme often said arbitrarily assigned greater meaning
Sometimes identifier called code even actually arbitrary whether speaker belief deeper meaning simply speaking casually imprecisely
The identifier refers one particular object universe
A identifier needed identify part design
Thus Model T identifies automobile Ford comprises whereas Model T Serial Number identifies one specific member one particular Model T car owned one specific person
The concept equal term thus denotatively always synonymous often connotatively distinguished name sense traditional naming
For example employee number identifier specific human normal connotation may consider Jamie Zawinski name identifier whereas considers Netscape employee number identifier name
This indistinction rather one
In label sign token uniquely identifies object within
The suffix also used naming
ID code may inherently carry along
For example know food package front identifier data also metadata tell packaged September UTC manufactured Licensed Vendor Number Peoria IL USA plant Building package line shift inspected Inspector Number
Arbitrary identifier might lack metadata
For example food package say ID may tell anything except date manufacturer name production sequence rank inspector number
In case arbitrary identifier sequential serial number leak information

Opaque designed avoid leaking even small amount really
In name
Identifiers used extensively virtually
Identifying entity make possible refer essential kind symbolic processing
In identifier also called name language entity
Some kind entity identifier might denote include
Which character sequence constitute identifier depends language
A common rule sequence underscore also allowed condition begin digit simplify lexing avoiding confusing allowed definition used earlier version Python many language
Later version language along many modern language support almost character identifier
However common restriction permit whitespace character language operator simplifies tokenization making
For example forbidding identifier due use binary operation mean tokenized allowed would identifier addition
Whitespace identifier particularly problematic space allowed identifier clause legal identifier tokenizing requires phrasal context condition clause
Some language allow space identifier however ALGOL variant example following valid statement could entered keywords represented boldface concretely via
In ALGOL possible keywords syntactically differentiated risk collision ambiguity space eliminated phase source processed via lexing could
In language character sequence lexical form identifier known example frequently keyword clause lexically form namely sequence letter
This overlap handled various way may forbidden identifier simplifies tokenization parsing case may allowed distinguished way via stropping keyword sequence may allowed identifier sense determined context requires lexer
may also reserved word forbidden identifier particularly case word may become keyword future
In language distinction clear
The scope accessibility within program identifier either local global
A global identifier declared outside function available throughout program
A local identifier declared within specific function available within function
For implementation programming language using identifier often entity
That compiled program contains reference memory address offset rather textual identifier token memory address offset assigned compiler identifier
In language support interactive evaluation source code using interpreter incremental compiler identifier also runtime entity sometimes even freely manipulated evaluated
In called
Compilers interpreter usually assign semantic meaning identifier based actual character sequence used
However exception
For example In language Go identifier uniqueness based spelling visibility
In identifier one possible
It unique within document
Many resource may carry multiple identifier
Typical example The inverse also possible multiple resource represented identifier discussed

language help manage complexity large program
Objects package data operation operation publicly accessible internal detail data structure hidden
This information hiding made programming easier allowing programmer think part program isolation
In addition object may derived general one inheriting capability
Such object made possible define specialized object without repeating general one
programming began Simula language added information hiding

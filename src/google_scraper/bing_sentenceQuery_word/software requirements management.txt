process documenting agreeing requirement controlling change communicating relevant stakeholder
It continuous process throughout project
A requirement capability project outcome product service conform
The purpose requirement management ensure organization document verifies meet need expectation customer internal external stakeholder
Requirements management begin analysis elicitation objective constraint organization
Requirements management includes supporting planning requirement integrating requirement organization working attribute requirement well relationship information delivering requirement change
The traceability thus established used managing requirement report back fulfilment company stakeholder interest term compliance completeness coverage consistency
Traceabilities also support change management part requirement management understanding impact change requirement related element functional impact relation functional architecture facilitating introducing change
Requirements management involves communication project team member stakeholder adjustment requirement change throughout course project
To prevent one class requirement overriding another constant communication among member development team critical
For example software development internal application business strong need may ignore user requirement believe creating user requirement taken care
Requirements traceability concerned documenting life requirement
It possible trace back origin requirement every change made requirement therefore documented order achieve traceability
Even use requirement implemented deployed used traceable
Requirements come different source like business person ordering product marketing manager actual user
These people different requirement product
Using requirement traceability implemented feature traced back person group wanted
This example used development process prioritize requirement determining valuable requirement specific user
It also used deployment user study show feature used see required first place
At stage key requirement management activity method
To illustrate consider standard development process Investigation Feasibility Design Construction Test Release stage
In Investigation first three gathered user business development team
In area similar question asked goal constraint current tool process place
Only requirement well understood developed
In common case requirement fully defined beginning project
Some requirement change either simply extracted internal external force work affect project
The deliverable Investigation stage requirement document approved member team
Later thick development document critical preventing unnecessary change
As system develops new feature open world new possibility requirement specification anchor team original vision permit controlled discussion scope change
While many organization still use document manage requirement others manage requirement baseline using software tool
These tool allow requirement managed database usually function automate traceability allowing electronic link created parent child requirement test case requirement electronic baseline creation version control change management
Usually tool contain export function allows specification document created exporting requirement data standard document application
In Feasibility stage cost requirement determined
For user requirement current cost work compared future projected cost new system place
Questions asked What data entry error costing u Or What cost scrap due operator error current interface Actually need new tool often recognized question come attention financial people organization
Business cost would include What department budget What expected rate return new product marketplace What internal rate return reducing cost training support make new system Technical cost related software development cost hardware cost
Do right people create tool Do need new equipment support expanded software role This last question important type
The team must inquire whether newest automated tool add sufficient processing power shift burden user system order save people time
The question also point fundamental point requirement management
A human tool form system realization especially important tool computer new application computer
The human mind excels parallel processing interpretation trend insufficient data
The CPU excels serial processing accurate mathematical computation
The overarching goal requirement management effort software project would thus make sure work automated get assigned proper processor
For instance Don make human remember interface
Make interface report human location system Or Don make human enter data two screen
Make system store data fill second screen The deliverable Feasibility stage schedule project
Assuming cost accurately determined benefit gained sufficiently large project proceed Design stage
In Design main requirement management activity comparing result design requirement document make sure work staying scope
Again flexibility paramount success
Here classic story scope change actually worked well
Ford auto designer early expecting gasoline price hit per gallon end decade
Midway design Ford Taurus price centered around gallon
The design team decided could build larger comfortable powerful car gas price stayed low redesigned car
The Taurus launch set nationwide sale record new car came primarily roomy comfortable drive
In case however departing original requirement degree work
So requirement document becomes critical tool help team make decision design change
In construction testing stage main activity requirement management make sure work cost stay within schedule budget emerging tool fact meet requirement
A main tool used stage prototype construction iterative testing
For software application user interface created paper tested potential user framework software built
Results test recorded user interface design guide handed design team ready develop interface
This save time make job much easier
Hardly would software development project completed without change asked project
The change stem change environment finished product envisaged used business change regulation change error original definition requirement limitation technology change security environment
The activity requirement change management include receiving change request stakeholder recording received change request analyzing determining desirability process implementation implementation change request quality assurance implementation closing change request
Then data change request compiled analyzed appropriate metric derived dovetailed organizational knowledge repository
Requirements management end product release
From point data coming application acceptability gathered fed Investigation phase next generation release
Thus process begin
Acquiring tool support requirement management trivial matter need undertaken part broader process improvement initiative
It long perception tool acquired installed project address requirement need
However purchase development tool support requirement management costly decision
Organizations may get burdened expensive support contract disproportionate effort get misdirected towards learning use tool configuring address particular need inappropriate use lead erroneous decision
Organizations follow incremental process make decision tool support particular need within wider context development process tooling
The tool presented

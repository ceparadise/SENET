In system particular point time
The term coined analogy
It refer state system capability provided certain system
A full large data set may take long time complete
On may writes data backed
This prevents backup introduces may result
For example user move file directory already backed file would completely missing since backup operation already taken place addition file
Version skew may also cause corruption file change size content underfoot read
One safely backing live data temporarily disable write access data backup either stopping accessing application using provided operating system enforce exclusive read access
This tolerable system desktop computer small workgroup server regular acceptable
system however bear service stoppage
To avoid downtime system may instead perform backup copy data set frozen allow application continue writing data
Most snapshot implementation efficient create snapshot
In word time needed create snapshot increase size data set contrast time required direct backup proportional size data set
In system initial snapshot taken data set subsequent snapshot copy changed data use system pointer reference initial snapshot
This method snapshot consumes le disk capacity data set repeatedly cloned
Some Unix system
These implement entire copying changed overwritten within parent storage thus preserving past image block device
Filesystems snapshot image later mounted medium
Some volume manager also allow creation snapshot extending approach disassociating block modified within snapshot parent block original volume
Such scheme could also described performing additional operation triggered writes snapshot
On Linux LVM allows creation snapshot
Writable snapshot introduced LVM version
Some file system internally track old version file make snapshot available special
Others like provide operating system accessing file history
In access snapshot provided Volume Service VSS
provides snapshot via VSS interface shared storage
Snapshots also available NSS file system since version recently platform product
EMC Isilon OneFS clustered storage platform implement single scalable file system support snapshot file directory level
Any file directory within file system snapshotted system implement snapshot dynamically based method determined optimal system
On Linux file system support creating snapshot cloning individual file
Additionally Btrfs also support creation snapshot subvolumes
On AIX also support snapshot
hybrid implementation track snapshot block level make branched file set nameable user application clone
included snapshotting scheme incremental backup service merely watch mounted volume change copy changed file periodically volume using

A snapshot backup type backup copy used create entire architectural application disk system
It used backup process restore system disk particular device specific time
A snapshot backup also referred image backup
Snapshot backup primarily used restore system virtual machine disk drive operational state serve system restore point snapshot taken
It equivalent backup copy store data defines data stored organized
Typically snapshot created using imaging system restoration recovery software
However backup software also take snapshot backup restore system using snapshot

Discuss difference locking
detailed answer Hallokindly find attached answer let know need assistance Running Head SNAPSHOT ISOLATION LEVELS Snapshot Isolation Levels Name Name Course Title Date SNAPSHOT ISOLATION LEVELS Snapshot isolation level In discussion Smith argues Snapshot Isolation Level used since introduction SQL server back
Although feature popular since increase performance consideration ought taken using
The word reflective
It explains fact query requested view similar version database based database state moment transaction commences
In snapshot transaction lock gained underlying data row data page well
This ensures transaction performed without blocking previous uncompleted transaction
The snapshot isolation level ensures transaction responsible modification data block transaction charged reading data block modify data
This would case reading committed isolation level SQL server
This reduces case deadlock much complex transaction
White argues using snapshot transaction must enabled setting database option
Doing ensure row version stored temporary database

Each snapshot us virtual hard disk store change made another virtual disk
This VHD intercept future write operation leaf original data unaltered state
Snapshots relationship form
Each snapshot taken creates another branch tree
Snapshots generally created also used testing software
A storage snapshot used information lost due human error
There several type storage snapshot
store location original data without copying snapshot created
These snapshot created almost instantly little performance impact system taking snapshot
This enables rapid recovery data case disk write error corrupted file malfunction
Data snapshot consistent exact time snapshot taken hence name
However previous snapshot must available complete recovery data network storage medium required
Every process requires one read two writes data need read written different location overwritten
reference data set mirrored drive
Each time run snapshot created entire new updated data
This make possible access data offline simplifies process recovering duplicating archiving data drive
This slower process storage snapshot requires much storage space original data
take snapshot data operation us background process copy data snapshot storage location
This process creates original data considered hybrid
similar writes redirected provisioned snapshot eliminating need two writes
snapshot write changed data instead copy original data
When snapshot deleted data need copied made consistent original volume
Creation storage snapshot complicates original data access along snapshot data
create allow user go back point time
Incremental snapshot generated faster frequently type storage snapshot
And use much storage space original data kept longer
Each time incremental snapshot generated original snapshot updated
copy restore virtual machine specific point time failure occurs
used VMware virtual environment often deleted within hour
VMware administrator take multiple snapshot VM creating multiple restore point
When VMware snapshot taken writeable data becomes
Snapshots exact replacement traditional storage backup offer advantage
Continuous data protection us snapshot back system way allows user recover instance data
While storage snapshot typically scheduled predetermined point CDP back data time change made
This allows user recover data recent change included whereas update may lost regular storage snapshot taken system failed
CDP also keep record every change occurs always possible recover recent clean copy data
There number benefit using storage snapshot part larger strategy
Snapshots provide quicker easier access data leveraged backup application enable feature like
But storage snapshot technology helpful supplement backup plan considered full replacement traditional backup
Relying stored snapshot backup take storage space seriously impact performance storage snapshot instance full copy data
Snapshots dependent data lost snapshot gone well

I bit confused meaning Maven Snapshot build one
A snapshot version Maven one released
The idea release release done exists
That version
It basically development
This might real release pretty far right release example
The difference real version snapshot version snapshot might get update
That mean downloading today might give different file downloading yesterday tomorrow
Usually snapshot dependency exist development released version
dependency snapshot version
The three others answer provide good vision version
I wanted add information regarding behavior Maven find dependency
When build application Maven search dependency repository
If stable version found search remote repository defined retrieve dependency
Then copy local repository make available next build
For example library considered version Maven find local repository use one current build
Now need library Maven know version stable subject change
That Maven try find newer version remote repository even version library found local repository
However check made per day
That mean
library generated local repository run Maven build day Maven check repository newer version
Maven provides way change update policy repository definition model found The SNAPSHOT term mean build snapshot code given time
It usually mean version version still heavy development
When come time release code want change version listed pom
So instead SNAPSHOT would something like
For help versioning check
A release final build version change
A snapshot build replaced another build name
It implies build could change time still active development
You different artifact different build based code

might one debugging one without
One Java one Java
Generally simpler one build everything need
This snapshot look like repository case enabled mean repository referred stable need update
Another case would mean Maven look update repository
You also specify interval update tag
usually maven two type build Snapshot build Release build snapshot build SNAPSHOT special version indicate current deployment copy like regular version maven check version every build remote repository snapshot build nothing maintainance build
Release build Release mean removing SNAPSHOT version build regular build version
Maven version contain string literal SNAPSHOT signify project currently active development
For example project version deploy artifact Maven repository Maven would expand version deploy release PM February UTC
In word deploy snapshot making release software component releasing snapshot component specific time
So mainly snapshot version used project active development
If project depends software component active development depend snapshot release Maven periodically attempt download latest snapshot repository run build
Similarly next release system going version project would version formally released
For example following dependency would always download latest development JAR spring An example maven release process By posting answer agree

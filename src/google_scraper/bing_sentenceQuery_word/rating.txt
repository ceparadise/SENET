Computer science began established distinct academic discipline early
The world first computer science degree program began
The first computer science degree program United States formed
Since practical computer became available many application computing become distinct area study right
Although many initially believed impossible computer could actually scientific field study late fifty gradually became accepted among greater academic population
It brand formed part computer science revolution time

Formal method best described application fairly broad variety fundamental particular calculus also problem software hardware specification verification
Computer architecture digital computer organization conceptual design fundamental operational structure computer system
It focus largely way central processing unit performs internally access address memory
The field often involves discipline computer engineering electrical engineering selecting interconnecting hardware component create computer meet functional performance cost goal
Computer performance analysis study work flowing computer general goal improving controlling using resource efficiently eliminating predicting performance anticipated peak load
Concurrency property system several computation executing simultaneously potentially interacting
A number mathematical model developed general concurrent computation including model
A distributed system extends idea concurrency onto multiple computer connected network
Computers within distributed system private memory information often exchanged among achieve common goal
This branch computer science aim manage network computer worldwide
Computer security branch computer technology whose objective includes protection information unauthorized access disruption modification maintaining accessibility usability system intended user
Cryptography practice study hiding encryption therefore deciphering decryption information
Modern cryptography largely related computer science many encryption decryption algorithm based computational complexity
A database intended organize store retrieve large amount data easily
Digital database managed using database management system store create maintain search data
Computer graphic study digital visual content involves synthesis manipulation image data
The study connected many field computer science including heavily applied field special effect
Research develops theory principle guideline user interface designer create satisfactory user experience desktop laptop mobile device
field study concerned constructing technique using computer analyze solve problem
In practical use typically application form problem various scientific discipline
Artificial intelligence AI aim required synthesize process environmental adaptation learning communication found human animal
From origin artificial intelligence research necessarily drawing area expertise
AI associated popular mind main field practical application embedded component area require computational understanding
The late question Can computer think
question remains effectively unanswered although still used ass computer output scale human intelligence
But automation evaluative predictive task increasingly successful substitute human monitoring intervention domain computer application involving complex data
Software engineering study designing implementing modifying software order ensure high quality affordable maintainable fast build
It systematic approach software design involving application engineering practice software
Software engineering deal organizing analyzing deal creation manufacture new software internal maintenance arrangement
Both computer application software engineer computer system software engineer projected among fastest growing occupation
The philosopher computing noted three Conferences important event computer science research
During conference researcher public private sector present recent work meet
Unlike academic field computer science prestige greater journal publication
One proposed explanation quick development relatively new field requires rapid review distribution result task better handled conference journal
Since computer science relatively new field widely taught school university academic subject
For example estimated percent high school United States offered computer science education
A report Association Computing Machinery ACM Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA revealed state adopted significant education standard high school computer science
However computer science education growing
Some country Israel New Zealand South Korea already included computer science respective national secondary education curriculum
Several country following suit
In country significant gender gap computer science education
For example US computer science degree conferred woman
This gender gap also exists Western country
However part world gap small nonexistent
In approximately half computer science degree conferred woman
In woman made computer science graduate

A binary digit bit smallest unit information computer
It used storing information value
An individual bit value either generally used store data implement instruction group byte
A computer often classified number bit process one time number bit memory address
Many system use four byte form word
The value bit typically stored allocated level electrical charge within capacitor inside memory module
For device use positive logic value true value high positive voltage relative electrical ground value false value low voltage
The value also may inferred logical value like activation state
The two value represent two stable state The technology reading storing two state referred binary technology
The number system us two state binary number system
The binary number system counting calculation computer
All number letter also changed binary code stored computer
For example counting zero binary look like There also binary code uppercase lowercase letter Storing single character requires eight bit
One byte eight bit produce distinctive combination number letter symbol character
It take four byte form word
The length binary number sometimes referred bit length
Many system use either length form word length form
There many unit information contain multiple bit
These include Internet connection speed downloading uploading often referred data transfer rate bit rate
Bit rate usually measured bit per second bps
Data transfer rate also measured byte per second Bps

used based two possible state usually symbolized
Whereas decimal system employ digit digit position represents etc
binary system digit position represents power etc
A binary code signal series electrical pulse represent number character operation performed
A device called clock sends regular pulse component switch pas block pulse
In binary code decimal number represented set four binary digit
The four fundamental arithmetic operation addition subtraction multiplication division reduced combination fundamental operation binary number
table decimal number represented binary
class device capable solving problem processing information discrete form
It operates data including magnitude letter symbol expressed binary using two digit
By counting comparing manipulating digit mathematics positional numeral system employing base requiring two different symbol digit instead usual different symbol needed decimal system
The number thus binary semiconductor device amplifying controlling generating electrical signal
Transistors active component integrated circuit microchip often contain billion minuscule device etched shiny surface
Deeply embedded almost everything electronic transistor become nerve cell Information Age
There communication information theory unit information equivalent result choice two possible alternative binary number system generally used digital computer
The term shortened word binary It also applied symbolic system mathematical logic represents relationship idea object
The basic rule system formulated George Boole England subsequently refined mathematician applied set theory
Today Boolean algebra significance We welcome suggested improvement article
You make easier u review hopefully publish contribution keeping point mind

All computer data represented using binary number system us
Binary digit grouped together byte
There two popular method converting binary denary
Computers use digit store data
A binary digit smallest unit data computing
It represented eg binary number
The circuit computer processor made billion
A transistor tiny switch activated electronic signal receives

Computer program set instruction
Each instruction translated simple binary code activate
Programmers write computer code converted binary instruction processor
All music document information processed computer also stored using binary
Everything computer represented stream binary number

These number encoded different data format give meaning eg pattern could number character colour image
Encoding format standardised help compatibility across different platform
For example The bit used pattern combination value become available
This larger number combination used represent many thing eg greater number different symbol colour picture
In early day computing way enter data computer flicking switch feeding punched card punched paper tape
Since computer work using binary data represented switch punched hole easily able reflect two state represent represent hole represent hole represent
Charles Babbage Analytical Machine used Second World War operated using punched card tape
Modern computer still read data binary form much faster convenient read microchip magnetic optical disk

Do computer actually speak English
Do store information sentence could understand
No
Computers transmit store information encoding combination digit two choice per spot
Most people think choice zero one like movie The Matrix
In reality information encoded many way
Hard Disk Drives image use combination magnetic positive magnetic negative
CDs DVDs Image use laser light either reflects reflect back
Other storage device may use option method still binary Computers today use binary system represent information
It called binary two different digit used
It also known base two human normally use base
Each zero one called bit binary digit
A bit usually represented computer main memory transistor switched capacitor charged discharged
Image When data must transmitted telephone line radio link high tone used one zero
On gnetic disk floppy disk hard disk tape bit represented direction magnetic field coated surface either
Image Audio CDs DVDs store bit part surface corresponding bit either reflect light
Image One bit represent much usually grouped together group eight represent number
A group eight bit called byte
The speed computer depends number bit process
For example computer process number one operation computer must break number smaller piece making slower
Ultimately bit byte computer us store transmit number text information
Now need binary clear time practice encoding simple data like letter
Image To boost confidence main activity let u read encoded letter see figure decoded character using ASCII Encoder Card
Choose letter form ASCII Encoder Card
In example K chosen Key color One Off non color zero On Image Two example Image Next Image Sample Expanded ASCII Table Image Answers

A used describe system much higher level used produce executable code system
Specification language generally directly executed
They meant describe
Indeed considered error requirement specification cluttered unnecessary implementation detail
A common fundamental assumption many specification approach program modelled structure include collection data value together set
This level abstraction coincides view correctness behaviour program take precedence property
In approach specification taken
specification program consist mainly logical usually equality prominent role describing property function required satisfy often interrelationship
This contrast framework like consist simple realization required behaviour
Specifications must subject process implementation detail actually implemented
The result refinement process executable algorithm either formulated programming language executable subset specification language hand
For example properly applied may considered specification directly executable
Another example specific application content must executable
An important use specification language enabling creation

In mathematically based technique whose purpose help implementation system software
They used describe system analyze behavior aid design verifying key property interest rigorous effective reasoning tool
These specification sense syntax semantics fall within one domain able used infer useful information
In passing decade computer system become increasingly powerful result become impactful society
Because better technique needed assist design implementation reliable software
Established engineering discipline use mathematical analysis foundation creating validating product design
Formal specification one way achieve software engineering reliability predicted
Other method commonly used enhance code quality
Given possible use technique demonstrate system design correct respect specification
This allows incorrect system design revised major investment made actual implementation
Another approach use probably correct step transform specification design ultimately transformed implementation
It important note formal specification implementation rather may used develop
Formal specification describe system system
A good specification must following attribute adequate internally consistent unambiguous complete satisfied minimal A good specification One main reason interest formal specification provide ability perform proof software implementation
These proof may used validate specification verify correctness design prove program satisfies specification
A design implementation ever declared correct
It ever correct respect given specification
Whether formal specification correctly describes problem solved separate issue
It also difficult issue address since ultimately concern problem constructing abstracted formal representation informal concrete abstraction step amenable formal proof
However possible specification proving challenge concerning property specification expected exhibit
If correct theorem reinforce specifier understanding specification relationship underlying problem domain
If specification probably need changed better reflect domain understanding involved producing implementing specification
Formal method software development widely used industry
Most company consider apply software development process
This may variety reason Other limitation Formal specification technique existed various domain various scale quite time
Implementations formal specification differ depending kind system attempting model applied point software life cycle introduced
These type model categorized following specification paradigm In addition paradigm way apply certain heuristic help improve creation specification
The paper referenced best discus heuristic use designing specification
They applying approach
The example leading formal
Others include Specification Language AMN
In area formal specification often used describe property Web service

There distinct difference requirement specification
A requirement condition needed user solve problem achieve objective
A specification document specifies complete precise verifiable manner requirement design behavior characteristic system often procedure determining whether provision satisfied
For example requirement car could maximum speed least
The specification requirement would include technical information specific design aspect
Another term commonly seen book paper requirement specification document specifies requirement system component
It includes functional requirement performance requirement interface requirement design requirement developement standard
So requirement specification simply requirement written paper
The first step toward developing accurate complete specification establish correct requirement
As easy sound establishing correct requirement extremely difficult art science
There different step one take toward establishing correct requirement
Although suggestion sound fairly obvious actually puttting practice may easy sound
The first step negotiate common understanding
There quote John von Neumann state There sense exact something even know talking
Communication designer customer vital
There point trying establish exact specification designer customer even agree requirement
Problem stem ambiguity stating requirement
For example say requirement state want create mean would transport group people Boston Washington Possible interpretation requirement includes building bus train airplane among possibility
Although transportation device satisfy requirement certainly different
Ambiguous requirement caused missing requirement ambiguous word introduced element
The requirement state fast people transported Boston Washington
Taking airplane would certainly faster riding bus train
These also missing requirement
group people requirement example ambiguous word
What exactly group imply
A group consist people people people etc
The requirement state create mean design transportation device
This example introduced element incorrect meaning slipped discussion
It important eliminate least reduce ambiguity early possible cost increase progress development life cycle
Often problem one establishing correct requirement get started
One important thing getting started ask question
question question posed early project obtain information global property design problem potential solution
Examples question include client reason solving problem environment product likely encounter time value
These question force side designer customer look higher issue
Also since question appropriate project prepared advance
Another important point get right people involved
There point discussing requirement appropriate people involved discussion
Related getting right people involved making meeting work
Having effective meeting easy sound
However since play central role establishing requirement essential know make meeting work
There important point keep mind creating effective meeting include creating culture safety participant keeping meeting appropriate size point
Exploring possibility another important step toward generating correct requirement
Ideas essential establishing correct requirement important people get together generate idea
Every project also encounter conflict
Conflicts occur personality clash people get along intergroup prejudice technical people marketing people level difference
It important facilitator present help resolve conflict
In establishing requirement important specifically establish function attribute constraint preference expectation product
Usually process gaining information function first one defined
Functions describe product going accomplish
It also important determine attribute product
Attributes characteristic desired client product similar function competely different attribute
After attribute clarified attached function must determine constraint atrributes
Preferences desirable optional condition placed attribute also defined addition constraint
Finally must determine client expectation
This largely determine success product
Testing final step road establishing correct requirement
There several testing method used listed
Establishing good requirement requires people technical communication skill
Technical skill required embedded system highly complex may require knowledge different engineering discipline electrical engineering mechanical engineering
Communication skill necessary lot exchange information customer designer
Without either two skill requirement unclear inaccurate
It essential requirement safety critical embedded system clear accurate complete
The problem requirement often weak system
In dependable system important specify system suppose specfiy system suppose
These system even greater urgency requirement complete dependable know exactly system certain state action perform
Requirements ambiguity also make system dependable
Extra requirement usually required developing dependable embedded system
For example developing dependable system people extra requirement specified make system safe even exceptional abusive situation
Systems exist everywhere universe live
The universe considered system atom
A system loosely defined considered following definition
The conceptual system design first stage system design life cycle example system definition requirement process shown Figure
Each individual box explain
Figure Example system requirement definition process In establishing system requirement first step define need
This need based want desire
Usually individual organization identifies need item function new modified system developed fulfill requirement
After need defined feasibility study conducted evaluate various technical approach taken
The system operational requirement also defined
This includes definition system operating characteristic maintenance support concept system identification specific design criterion
In particular system operational requirement include following element
Usually defining system requirement tendency cover area related performance opposed area related support
However mean emphasis placed part system whole system
It essential take consideration entire system defining system requirement
The system maintenance concept basically describes overall support environment product supposed exist
After system operational requirement system maintenance concept defined preliminary system analysis performed determine approach system development adopted
The following process usually applied
Figure Program documentation Finally conceptual design review also performed conceptual design stage
It usually occurs early system engineering development life cycle operational requirement maintenance concept defined
It important verify requirement correctly implemented design
This done requirement traceability usually refered ability follow life requirement forward backwards direction
origin development specification subsequent deployment use period refinement iteration phase
Requirements traceability capture relationship requirement specification design
Standards system development one Department Defense standard require requirement traceability used
Although requirments traceability around decade consensus kind information used part traceability scheme
The problem definition traceability differs taken different point view system
view system different customer project manager test engineer etc
Each organization different purpose methodology requirement tracing
While purpose paper dwell long discussion requirement traceability short example methodology used one organization given
The project typically involved Abbott Laboratories Diagnostics Division embedded vitro diagnostic instrument approaching line code
They found traceability aid project manager verification cost reduction accountability change management
Traceability help verifying software requirement satisfied design process tested verification process
Traceability allows allocation product requirement early development cycle thereby reducing cost correcting defect due untraceable component integration system test phase
Providing quantitative traceability analysis also allows accountability making sure project milestone approved deliverable verified customer satisfied
The documentation traceability also keep information organized change staff management
A specific vitro diagnostic instrument contained approximately line source code approximately software requirement needed traced
While division also automated traceability system ATS allowed automate many task process tool led success
The main purpose traceability program identify link determine link complete accurate
The traceability analysis consists aspect forward requirement analysis reverse requirement trace forward test analysis reverse test trace
These step used trace software requirement design element test trace
The ATS used design documentation matrix test matrix used perform different analysis required
The ATS also able give feedback design component yet implemented life cycle
In test phase ATS give input requirement covered test case
There many requirement specification standard
They mostly military standard opposed commercial standard
In addition standard system engineering area particular deal software aspect
A good reference many standard Standards Guidelines Examples System Software Requirements Engineering IEEE Computer Society Press
This book compilation international requirement standard military standard
There also section requirement analysis methodology example
Listed several relevant standard list mean exhaustive
There also exists requirement simulation tool
Foresight produced Nu Thena Systems allows designer capture system requirement design graphical executable system model
These model analyzed simulated ensure requirement correctness
Nu The SES workbench simulation software tool focus behavioral performance modeling
Rational Rose visual modeling tool among feature allows UML modeling
The trend towards executable requirement simulation
The Unified Modeling Language UML modeling language specification complex system
UML represents large effort number methodologists construct common mean describing complex system using object orientation
It specification language development process detail given feature link together system development
UML relatively new language still going debate feasibility using embedded system
The main concern using object oriented language embedded system speed size application
Some point support programming embedded system object effecient developer write larger system fewer defect le time using OO method instead structured method OO implemented language including assembly language
Other people also stated argument using UML embedded system
In particular restriction architectural modeling cited one shortfall
For example predefined node stereotype help improve standardization lack predefined stereotype mean capability capture information depth fully describe operational property system
Another shortfall deal deficiency concurrency modeling schedulability
However UML still relatively new time tell effective specification development embedded system
It would also helpful technique assist structured development correct accurate requirement
In particular Quality Function Deployment QFD method structured product planning development enables development team specify clearly customer want need evaluate proposed product service capability systematically term impact meeting need
QFD based matrix show relationship example customer need feature system
Figure show example matrix give relationship row column
For example say row defines customer want car
Lets say A car look cool B car never break
The column specific feature car
Lets say good gas mileage b aerodynamic styling
Each box represents relationship customer want feature car
A car good gas mileage related car looking cool relation
However car aerodynamic styling would look cool strong relation
Similarly car never break possible relation good gas relation much relation aerodynamic styling
Figure Example matrix used QFD

A used produce various kind
Programming language generally consist
Programming language used create implement specific
The earliest known programmable machine preceded automatic flute player described century
From early program used direct behavior machine
Thousands different programming language created mainly computer field many still created every year
Many programming language require computation specified form sequence operation perform language use form program specification form
desired result specified achieve
The description programming language usually split two component form meaning
Some language defined specification document example programming language specified Standard language dominant treated
Some language basic language defined standard extension taken dominant implementation common
A programming language notation writing specification computation
Some author restrict term programming language language express possible algorithm
Traits often considered important constitutes programming language include like define usually considered programming language
Programming language may however share syntax markup language computational semantics defined
example XML dialect
Moreover mostly used structuring document also contains Turing complete subset
The term sometimes used interchangeably programming language
However usage term varies among author including exact scope
One usage describes programming language subset computer language
In vein language used computing different goal expressing computer program generically designated computer language
For instance markup language sometimes referred computer language emphasize meant used programming
Another usage regard programming language theoretical construct programming abstract machine computer language subset thereof run physical computer finite hardware resource
emphasizes language much programming language language intended execution
He also argues textual even graphical input format affect behavior computer programming language despite fact commonly remark ignorance programming language concept reason many flaw input format
The earliest computer often programmed without help programming language writing program absolute
The program decimal binary form read toggled switch computer
Absolute machine language later termed
The next step development still closely tied specific computer
These served make program much relieved programmer tedious address calculation
The first written
An early programming language designed computer developed German
However implemented
proposed one first language ever developed
Unlike Short Code statement represented mathematical expression understandable form
However program translated every time ran making process much slower running equivalent
At developed early
A used automatically convert language machine code
The first code compiler developed computer University Manchester considered first programming language
The second autocode developed Mark called Mark Autocode
Brooker also developed autocode conjunction University Manchester
The version devised
Known EDSAC Autocode straight development Mercury Autocode adapted local circumstance noted object code optimisation diagnostics advanced time
A contemporary separate thread development developed University Manchester machine
In invented IBM
It first widely used functional implementation opposed design paper
It still popular language used program benchmark rank world
Another early programming language devised US called
It developed period
Hopper found business data processing customer uncomfortable mathematical notation early team wrote specification programming language implemented prototype
The compiler became publicly available early substantially complete
major influence design since direct descendant actual use time
The increased use language introduced requirement
These language varying degree provide facility assembly language language used perform task require direct access hardware facility still provide control structure
The period late brought development major language paradigm use Each language spawned descendant modern programming language count least one ancestry
The also saw considerable debate merit whether programming language designed support
famous letter published argued statement eliminated higher level programming language
The year relative consolidation
combined system programming
The United States government standardized system programming language derived intended use defense contractor
In Japan elsewhere vast sum spent investigating incorporated logic programming construct
The functional language community moved standardize Lisp
Rather inventing new paradigm movement elaborated upon idea invented previous decade
One important trend language design programming system increased focus use organizational unit code
Ada ML developed notable module system often wedded construct
The rapid growth created opportunity new language
originally Unix scripting tool first released became common dynamic
came used programming bytecode virtual machine became popular commercial setting promise popular time early
These development fundamentally novel rather refinement many existing language paradigm although syntax often based C family programming language
Programming language evolution continues industry research
Current direction include security reliability verification new kind modularity database integration Microsoft
computer programming language aim provide higher level abstraction internal computer hardware detail
programming language based solving problem using constraint given program rather using written programmer
All programming language building block description data process transformation applied like addition two number selection item collection
These primitive defined syntactic semantic rule describe structure meaning respectively
A programming language surface form known
Most programming language purely textual use sequence text including word number punctuation much like written natural language
On hand programming language nature using visual relationship symbol specify program
The syntax language describes possible combination symbol form syntactically correct program
The meaning given combination symbol handled semantics either
Since language textual article discus textual syntax
Programming language syntax usually defined using combination structure structure
Below simple grammar based This grammar specifies following The following example token sequence grammar
Not syntactically correct program semantically correct
Many syntactically correct program nonetheless per language rule may depending language specification soundness implementation result error translation execution
In case program may exhibit
Even program within language may still meaning intended person wrote
Using example may possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may false The following fragment syntactically correct performs operation semantically defined operation meaning value complex type defined value If first line omitted program would trigger error compilation variable p would defined
But program would still syntactically correct since type declaration provide semantic information
The grammar needed specify programming language classified position
The syntax programming language specified using grammar
Some language including Perl Lisp contain construct allow execution parsing phase
Languages construct allow programmer alter behavior parser make syntax analysis generally blur distinction parsing execution
In contrast Perl block may contain general computation C macro merely string replacement require code execution
The term refers meaning language opposed form
The static semantics defines restriction structure valid text hard impossible express standard syntactic formalism
For compiled language static semantics essentially include semantic rule checked compile time
Examples include checking every declared used language require declaration label arm distinct
Many important restriction type like checking identifier used appropriate context
adding integer function name call appropriate number type argument enforced defining rule called
Other form like may also part static semantics
Newer programming language like form data flow analysis part static semantics
Once data specified machine must instructed perform operation data
For example semantics may define expression evaluated value manner conditionally execute
The also known language defines various construct language produce program behavior
There many way defining execution semantics
Natural language often used specify execution semantics language commonly used practice
A significant amount academic research went allow execution semantics specified formal manner
Results field research seen limited application programming language design implementation outside academia
A type system defines programming language classifies value expression manipulate type interact
The goal type system verify usually enforce certain level correctness program written language detecting certain incorrect operation
Any type system involves reject many incorrect program also prohibit correct albeit unusual program
In order bypass downside number language usually unchecked may used programmer explicitly allow normally disallowed operation different type
In typed language type system used program number language usually functional one relieving programmer need write type annotation
The formal design study type system known
A language specification every operation defines type data operation applicable implication applicable type
For example data represented many programming language dividing number string meaning rejected compiler
The invalid operation may detected program compiled static type checking rejected compiler compilation error message may detected program run dynamic type checking resulting
Many language allow function called exception handler written handle exception example always return result
A special case typed language language
These often scripting markup language one data commonly character string used symbolic numeric data
In contrast allows operation performed data generally considered sequence bit various length
language untyped include variety
In practice language considered typed point view verifying rejecting operation modern language offer degree typing
Many production language provide mean bypass subvert type system trading finer control program execution see
In expression type determined prior program executed typically
For example integer expression passed function expects string stored variable defined hold date
Statically typed language either
In first case programmer must explicitly write type certain textual position example variable
In second case compiler type expression declaration based context
Most mainstream statically typed language manifestly typed
Complete type inference traditionally associated le mainstream language
However many manifestly typed language support partial type inference example infer type certain limited case
Additionally programming language allow type automatically converted type example int used program expects float
also called determines operation run time word type associated rather
As language dynamically typed language require programmer write explicit type annotation expression
Among thing may permit single variable refer value different type different point program execution
However type automatically detected piece code actually executed potentially making difficult
example dynamically typed language
allows value one type treated another example treating number
This occasionally useful also allow kind program fault go undetected even
prevents
An attempt perform operation wrong type value raise error
Strongly typed language often termed
An alternative definition weakly typed refers language permit large number implicit type conversion
In JavaScript example expression implicitly convert number conversion succeeds even string letter
Such implicit conversion often useful mask programming error
generally considered orthogonal concept usage literature differs
Some use term mean even confusingly mean simply
Thus called strongly typed weakly statically typed
It may seem odd professional programmer C could weakly statically typed
However notice use generic pointer pointer allow casting pointer pointer without needing explicit cast
This extremely similar somehow casting array byte kind datatype C without using explicit cast
Most programming language associated core sometimes known library especially included part published language standard conventionally made available implementation language
Core library typically include definition commonly used algorithm data structure mechanism input output
The line language core library differs language language
In case language designer may treat library separate entity language
However language core library often treated part language user language specification even require library made available implementation
Indeed language designed meaning certain syntactic construct even described without referring core library
For example string literal defined instance class similarly expression block construct instance library class
Conversely contains multiple coherent subset suffice construct rest language library macro language designer even bother say portion language must implemented language construct must implemented part library
Programming language share property natural language related purpose vehicle communication syntactic form separate semantics showing related language branching one another
But artificial construct also differ fundamental way language evolved usage
A significant difference programming language fully described studied entirety since precise finite definition
By contrast natural language changing meaning given user different community
While also artificial language designed ground specific purpose lack precise complete semantic definition programming language
Many programming language designed scratch altered meet new need combined language
Many eventually fallen disuse
Although attempt design one universal programming language serf purpose failed generally accepted filling role
The need diverse programming language arises diversity context language used One common trend development programming language add ability solve problem using higher level
The earliest programming language tied closely underlying hardware computer
As new programming language developed feature added let programmer express idea remote simple translation underlying hardware instruction
Because programmer le tied complexity computer program computing le effort programmer
This let write functionality per time unit
proposed way eliminate need specialized language programming
However goal remains distant benefit open debate
took position use formal language essential prevent introduction meaningless construct dismissed foolish
similarly dismissive idea
Hybrid approach taken
A language designer user must construct number artifact govern enable practice programming
The important artifact language
The specification programming language artifact language use agree upon whether piece valid language behavior shall
A programming language specification take several form including following An programming language provides way write program language execute one configuration hardware software
There broadly two approach programming language implementation
It generally possible implement language using either technique
The output may executed hardware program called interpreter
In implementation make use interpreter approach distinct boundary compiling interpreting
For instance implementation compile execute source line time
Programs executed directly hardware usually run several order magnitude faster interpreted software
One technique improving performance interpreted program
Here execution translates block going used machine code direct execution hardware
Although commonly used programming language fully open specification implementation many programming language exist proprietary programming language implementation available single vendor may claim proprietary language intellectual property
Proprietary programming language commonly internal single product proprietary language used internally within vendor others available external user
Some programming language exist border proprietary open example asserts proprietary right aspect programming language open implementation part system also CLR closed environment
Many proprietary language widely used spite proprietary nature example include
Some language may make transition closed open example originally Ericsson internal programming language
Thousands different programming language created mainly computing field
Software commonly built programming language
Programming language differ form human expression require greater degree precision completeness
When using natural language communicate people human author speaker ambiguous make small error still expect intent understood
However figuratively speaking computer exactly told understand code programmer intended write
The combination language definition program program input must fully specify external behavior occurs program executed within domain control program
On hand idea algorithm communicated human without precision required execution using interleaf natural language code written programming language
A programming language provides structured mechanism defining piece data operation transformation may carried automatically data
A us present language represent concept involved computation
These concept represented collection simplest element available called
process programmer combine primitive compose new program adapt existing one new us changing environment
Programs computer might without human interaction user might type
In case command simply program whose execution chained together
When language run command interpreter without compiling called
It difficult determine programming language widely used usage mean varies context
One language may occupy greater number programmer hour different one line code third may consume CPU time
Some language popular particular kind application
For example still strong corporate data center often large scientific engineering application aerospace transportation military embedded application embedded application operating system
Other language regularly used write many different kind application
Various method measuring language popularity subject different bias measured proposed Combining averaging information various internet site claim ten popular programming language descending order overall popularity
There overarching classification scheme programming language
A given programming language usually single ancestor language
Languages commonly arise combining element several predecessor language new idea circulation time
Ideas originate one language diffuse throughout family related language leap suddenly across familial gap appear entirely different family
The task complicated fact language classified along multiple ax
For example Java language encourages organization concurrent language contains construct running multiple parallel

In broad stroke programming language divide classification distinguished
Traditionally programming language regarded describing computation term imperative sentence
issuing command
These generally called language
A great deal research programming language aimed blurring distinction program set instruction program assertion desired answer main feature
More refined paradigm include language hybrid paradigm
An much paradigm direct model underlying machine architecture
By purpose programming language might considered general purpose scripting language language language combination
Some general purpose language designed largely educational goal
A programming language may also classified factor unrelated programming paradigm
For instance programming language use keywords
Other language may classified

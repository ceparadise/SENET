Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
Being completely self taught programmer I would like I could better computer science course taught typical CS grad
Finding different resource internet easy course Coursera course Stanford university
There numerous open resource scattered around Internet good book repeatedly recommended
I learning lot study heavily fragmented really bug
I would love If somewhere I could find path I follow stack I limit I sure part computer science I studied systematically approach I
The problem Wikipedia tell essential insists complete reference
Computer science Electrical Engg
huge list course also telling course essential optional per person
I found mention order one study different subject
What I would love create list I follow like dummy one As clearly see I little idea specific subject computer science consists
It would hugely helpful even someone pointed essential course MIT Course ware essential subject present MIT OCW recommended order study
I list Posts I already went I get I looking top answer say worth studying cse point MIT OCW Please edit question limit specific problem enough detail identify adequate answer
Avoid asking multiple distinct question
See page help clarifying question
I seen course material MIT
They teaching material required bunch implicit global variable passing colour Blue instead ARGB let alone float sort thing
I would trust curriculum code come university
My CS degree university top UK CS consisted First year Second year Third year As notice pretty much everything basic something almost nothing covered useful depth
The stuff actually worth essential The stuff worth optionally Stuff essential I cover anyway The rest complete waste time
Unfortunately nine point I either already knew picked useful part elsewhere
If read thing like rapidly becomes apparent actually need know much top fortunate since degree many material I seen online degree really teach much
Open Course ware list course made available
If want know student would taken swing MIT non OCW website look actual program
They list required considered prereq
Try Computer Science curriculum recommendation linked along CS update
Page report handy chart underline core knowledge still list elective
An undergraduate program would time cover even course considered core recommendation lump category together let student pick amongst eg Operating Systems Programming Languages Software Engineering get lumped Software student pick track
You find required coursework CS department website pretty much school version
If I may I like suggest joining learning process
Then search around code real world application interested clone work code get know eventually start submit patch back source project line working open source project vested interest
And course get familiar git better
Thank interest question
Because attracted spam answer removed posting answer requires site
Would like answer one instead

discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

learn share knowledge build career
I colleague insists code need comment self documenting
I reviewed code clearer code I seen others produce I still disagree code complete useful well commented documented code
Help understand point view
Maybe limitation I see good practice
This meant argument please bring reason well commented documented code high priority many resource showing convincing peer
I believe I need fully understand perspective convince otherwise
Start new question must argue
Also arguing self documenting code primarily help understand perspective ie positive aspect code evangelist
I expect others downvote stay topic
As currently stand question good fit Q A format
We expect answer supported fact reference expertise question likely solicit debate argument polling extended discussion
If feel question improved possibly reopened guidance
In opinion code
In good code explain every single line every identifier variable method class clear name
Having comment necessary actually make harder
read code colleague code documentation fine opinion
Note code mean comment unnecessary comment
The thing however reading code including comment documentation comment yield immediate understanding code
If code take longer understand commented code really
Well since comment code let look actual code
Compare typical code To code show done And documented code better explains done And final version zero comment needed Here example poor commenting style In last example comment used variable descriptively named instead result operation summarized clearly see operation
I would prefer second example day perhaps friend talking say code
I would say depends context
To code probably sufficient case comment detailing methodology behind behind done example equation also useful
The code always going explanation code opinion hard explain vital aspect comment
If written properly already know code need know
Someone said Only write comment code hard understand
Try write code hard understand
The idea behind code actual program logic code trivially clear enough explain anyone reading code code
In opinion idea true code myth
The code tell logic behind happening ca explain done certain way particularly one way solve problem
For reason alone never replace code
I think relevant question whether particular line code end understand structure function slice code time comment going help
Take example amdfan slice code This code fine following equally informative modern software system explicitly recognizes using Newtonian calculation choice may altered physical paradigm appropriate In personal experience normal coding situation absolutely need comment
How often end rolling algorithm example
Basically everything else matter structuring system coder comprehend structure use choice drove system use particular structure
I forget I got Every comment program like apology reader
I sorry code opaque ca understand looking
We accept perfect strive perfect go right apologizing need
code good practice done properly easily convey meaning code without reading many comment
especially situation domain well understood everyone team
Having said comment helpful new comer tester generate file
code necessary comment go long way towards helping people across team
First good hear colleague code fact clearer code seen
It mean probably using excuse lazy comment code
code code require comment informed reader understand
For example piece code Now idea informed reader subjective situational
If anyone else trouble following colleague code well idea informed reader
Some level familiarity language library used must assumed order call code
The best argument I seen writing code avoids problem commentary agreeing code written
The best criticism code describe explain something done certain way
code good example DRY Do Repeat Yourself
Do duplicate information comment code
Rather explain variable used rename variable
Rather explain short snippet code extract method give descriptive name perhaps shortened version comment text
Rather explain complicated test extract method give good name
Etc
After end code require much explanation explains delete comment merely repeat information code
This mean comment information ca put code information intent
In ideal case code comment complement adding unique explanatory value without duplicating information
In order It important note however truly code take lot
You learn program declaratively humble avoid clever code favor code obvious seems like anyone could written
For one consider following snippet In example line comment per line code
Even worse comment add anything ca see reading code
If method like get blindness notice one method deviate pattern
If course better version would Still trivial code I prefer comment
The intent overall organization better explained separate document outside code
When read code see always guess particular way
There ton constraint like business logic security user demand etc
When maintenance backgorund information become important
Just pinch salt One thing may wish point colleague matter code alternate approach considered discarded information get lost unless comment code information
Sometimes important know alternative considered decided code comment likely survive time
Have heard Donald Knuth WEB project implement concept
It code like documentation compiled executed code
I know much used today though
The difference
In company I worked one programmer following stuck top monitor
Document code like person maintains homocidal maniac know live
The point view code self documenting drive crazy
A particular line code sub algorithm may indeed self documenting purpose greater picutre simply
I got frustrated month two ago I wrote entire blog post describing point view

code normally us variable name match exactly code easy understand going However code never replace comment
Sometimes code complex code enough especially way maintainability
I professor firm believer theory In fact best thing I ever remember saying Comments sissy It took u surprise first make sense
However situation even though may able understand going code someone le experienced may come behind understand going
This comment become important
I know many time believe important case comment unnecessary
I surprised nobody brought technique developed Donald Knuth TeX The Art Computer Programming fame
The premise simple since code understood human comment simply thrown away compiler give everyone thing need full textual description intent code unfettered programming language requirement human reader pure code compiler
Literate Programming tool giving special markup document tell tool part source text
The program later rip source code part document assembles code file
I found example web HTML version If find Knuth book library Donald Knuth Literate Programming Stanford California Center Study Language Information CSLI Lecture Notes

read
code complete reasoning
Even make nice document Everything else well written comment I would like offer one perspective many valid answer What source code
What programming language
The machine need source code
They happy running assembly
Programming language benefit
We want write assembly
We need understand writing
Programming writing code
Should able read write
Source code written human language
It tried example FORTRAN completely successful
Source code ca ambiguity
That put structure text
Text work context take granted use text
Context source code always explisit
Think using C
Most programming language redundancy compiler catch u coherent
Other language use inference try eliminate redundancy
Type name method name variable name needed computer
They used u referencing
The compiler understand semantics u use
Programming language linguistic bridge man machine
It writable u readable
Secondary demand readable u
If good semantics allowed good structuring code source code easy read even u
The best code need comment
But complexity lurks every project always decide put complexity camel swallow
Those place use comment
Self documenting code easy opt problem time code comment documentation diverge
And disciplining factor write clear code strict
For rule I try follow This mean three mean documenting code live close together therefore likely changed code change overlap express
The real problem code conveys actually
While comment may help someone understand code better algorithm step etc
degree redundant I doubt would convince peer
However really important documentation stuff directly evident code underlying intent assumption impact limitation etc
Being able determine code X quick glance way easier able determine code Y
He document Y You could show example code look well obvious actually cover base input example see find
I think code good replacement commenting
If require comment explain code way function variable name modified explanatory
It coder whether make shortfall comment renaming variable function refactoring code though
It ca really replace documentation though documentation give others explain use system rather thing
Edit I probably everyone else probably provision Digital Signal Processing DSP app well commented
That mainly DSP apps essentially loop fed array value said value change program change value one array need couple comment say case When writing mathematical code I sometimes found useful write long comment explaining math notational convention code us fit together
We talking hundred line documentation
I try make code possible I come back work month I really need read explanation keep making hash
Now course kind extreme measure necessary case
I think moral story different code requires different amount documentation
Some code written clearly need comment write clearly use comment
But lot code need comment make sense write clearly possible use many comment need
I would argue many truly self documenting code need show form intent
But I surprised nobody mentioned BDD yet
Part idea automated test code explaining intent code difficult make obvious otherwise
My view written post Excerpt Instead writing lot comment explain subtle behavior program restructure logic
Instead documenting method choose clear name method
Instead tagging code indicate unfinished work throw NotImplementedException
Instead worrying whether comment sound polite enough bos colleague anyone reading code stop worrying writing
The clearer code easier maintain extend work future edition
The le ordorous code le need comment
The comment higher maintanence cost
A couple reason extra comment addition code might clearer Its going team value documentation
I would suggest documenting instead important always captured self documenting code
obvious calculation retrieval etc something expressed
Also aware difference team comming different nationality
Differences diction creap naming method BisectionSearch BinarySearch BinaryChop These three method contributed developer trained different continent thing
Only reading comment described algorithm able identify duplication library
For reading code need comment like reading text language I know
I see statement I understand I look comment
I read phrase I need look dictionary understand mean
It usually easy write code
To tell comment suitable even code better
If understand system every level abstraction try organizing code like Where method name reflects intent method body explains achieve goal
You anyway tell entire book title main abstraction system still documented well complex algorithm method contract artifact
If code colleague produc really lucky
If think colleague code need comment need
Just open place read see understood everything
If code
If ask colleague question give answer ask answer documented comment code beforehand
He claim code smart person anyway respect team member task require understanding code code explain everything need understand need comment

As concern electrical engineering consideration microprocessor function designed optimized data communicated among electronic component integrated system electronic component designed operate process instruction expressed software software written compiled optimized specific hardware platform
Therefore computer engineer electrical engineer specialize software design hardware design system design integrates
Computer Science study data instruction processed stored communicated computing device
A modern descendant Applied Mathematics Electrical Engineering Computer Science deal algorithm processing data symbolic representation data instruction design instruction language processing data technique writing software process data variety computing platform protocol communicating data reliably securely across network organization data database various type scale emulation human intelligence learning computer algorithm statistical modeling data large database support inference trend technique protecting content authenticity data
Therefore computer scientist scientist mathematician develop way process interpret store communicate secure data
Because Computer Engineers Computer Scientists ultimately work data attempt ultimately harness meaning significant overlap coursework student two field take well career pursue
This minimize distinctive nature two discipline
It simply acknowledges fact type computer professional find context purpose similar kind project different aspect kind project
Both Computer Engineers Computer Scientists advance computing technology solve problem using computing technology
If consider computing technology term scale Computer Engineers operate often microscopic macroscopic end spectrum whereas Computer Scientists work middle part spectrum
More specifically Computer Engineers deal physic semiconductor electronics may design hardware integrated circuit level small well integration hardware software optimized run realize complete computing system large
Computer Scientists write software design database devise algorithm format communication secure data processed hardware make integrated system function
Consider iPhone
Apple employ Computer Scientists Computer Engineers design new version iPhone
Computer Engineers Electrical Engineers designed chip house integrated circuit make iPhone various component cell radio screen control memory microprocessor function figured get various component work
That involves looking device microscopic level integrated system level
Computer Scientists wrote operating system manages memory concurrently running application apps app store run top operating system packing unpacking data packet network communication encrypting data prying eye see
The computer scientist provide glue piece bring turn computer engineer beginning product component design computer engineer end product device people text browse web play Angry Birds
From example easy imagine much dependence function realizing finished product significant overlap coursework Computer Engineers Computer Scientists take career opportunity pursue
I found website provides particularly helpful description Computer Engineering identifies kind job Computer Engineers work company hire salary earn

I think article may explaining American view
In Spain degree time I called Computer Science Engineering literally translated lasted year
Actually amount work year degree number Credits standardized EU
They teach math quite bit database software hardware
I think equivalent Degree Master US
Now education Spain changed programme I date I know issued kind lightweight degree year
Later go buy master without knowing nearly much knew degree fundamental
What business built top education
I find bit shame actually
But give older engineer competitive advantage opinion
Greetings everyone I Computer Engineering Computer Science
The simplest way I think explain difference BSCE BSCS considering two degree following A BSCE degree include coursework also required BSEE electrical engineering degree
This prepare graduate work company develop product consisting software directly control hardware
Some example Motorola Nokia texas instrument
A BSCE degree include little hardware electrical engineering course required BSCE degree
Instead computer science coursework operating system design compiler theory advanced algorithm design taken instead
This best degree working company google amazon Citrix
Which best depends interest want work
In experience many company need kind
While engineer Citrix never need interface hardware develop window kernel mode device driver
good luck

technique two work together one workstation
One writes line code typed
The two programmer switch role frequently
While reviewing observer also considers strategic direction work coming idea improvement likely future problem address
This free driver focus attention tactical aspect completing current task using observer safety net guide
Pair programming increase required deliver code compared programmer working individually
Experiments yielded diverse result suggesting increase
However resulting code fewer defect
Along code development time factor like field support cost quality assurance also figure return investment
Pair programming might theoretically offset expense reducing defect program
A system two programmer posse greater potential generation diverse solution problem three reason In attempt share goal plan programmer must overtly negotiate shared course action conflict arises
In consider larger number way solving problem single programmer alone might
This significantly improves design quality program reduces chance selecting poor method
In online survey pair programmer stated enjoyed work programmed alone said confident solution pair programmed
Knowledge constantly shared pair programmer whether industry classroom many source suggest student show higher confidence programming pair many learn whether tip programming language rule overall design skill
In promiscuous pairing programmer communicates work programmer team rather pairing one partner cause knowledge system spread throughout whole team
Pair programming allows programmer examine partner code provide feedback necessary increase ability develop monitoring mechanism learning activity
Pair programming allows team member share problem solution quickly making le likely hidden agenda
This help pair programmer learn communicate easily
This raise communication bandwidth frequency within project increasing overall information flow within There empirical study pair programming
The empirical study tend examine level productivity quality code may focus bias introduced process testing publishing
A found pair typically consider design alternative programmer working alone arrive simpler maintainable design catch design defect earlier
However raised concern finding may influenced sign among published study pair programming
It concluded pair programming uniformly beneficial effective
Although pair programmer may complete task faster solo programmer total number increase
A manager would balance faster completion work reduced testing debugging time higher cost coding
The relative weight factor vary project task
The benefit pairing greatest task programmer fully understand begin challenging task call creativity sophistication novice compared expert
Pair programming could helpful attaining high quality correctness complex programming task would also increase development effort cost significantly
On simple task pair already fully understands pairing result net drop productivity
It may reduce code development time also risk reducing quality program
Productivity also drop pairing used without sufficient availability mentor coach
There indicator pair performing well also known pair programming two programmer different location working via shared desktop remote pair programming plugin
Remote pairing introduces difficulty present pairing extra delay coordination depending heavyweight tool instead lightweight one like index card loss verbal communication resulting confusion conflict thing keyboard

Stack Exchange network consists Q A community including largest trusted online community developer learn share knowledge build career
I lately started allowing encouraging
paired programming going well
The kid enjoy appear learning material le pain
Not everyone done yet however
This I beginning sense trouble
I difficult major programming lab coming soon student psyched work together
I know many want try pairing I worry odd number I sure handle three student desire work together without destroying benefit model provide
Is way extend model driver navigator trio
My current intention group create product splitting work
One monitor two student
Driver navigator
These good responsible kid usually find quite productive grouping though I problem stepping assist I see thing headed poor direction
tl dr This sort situation
You lot option structuring exercise
There lot possibility work best depends specific situation
Do lose track fact goal educational however code production
If student learn much code get produced still success depending parameter
Since I going try cover lot option something IFTTT answer
For case might best one triple one solo rest pair
It probably work better learning situation say triple rest paired three single
You get better picture pairing differs option
A day prior exercise let student make written bid whether want pair
Have give reason preference
Let know preference may able honored
Look bid decide based reason judgement would serve everyone best
It possible actually need practice lab give person different task perhaps resource remaining pair answering question prompting helping watch flock
Someone need answer question arise anyway might opportunity person learn meta level
If superstar expressed interest teaching eventually might additional payoff person
Likewise language lawyer might help dig deep knowledge fly
You could put triple others terribly far advanced person state
In case prepared fourth member team help keep situation moving process easy friendly
Do let struggler avoid programmer role
Your choice team might depend personal quality
Do put arrogant monster
This one bit riskier youngster work fine professional
Choose team way suit see let process run half hour one hour
It need long enough switching role happened time
Then change team
Note people move team new code yet seen risk factor
At switch point current driver stay code navigator find new seat
The current driver code continues break new navigator spend time catching
If person solo triple one iteration pair next
In many way realistic scenario match pairing done organization
The advantage classroom student learn read understand new code useful skill
However may need map advance segment
Each student caries card listing worked want peer evaluation mark end thought effective partner
If work least five others I would ask mark two effective partner
Do ask criticism partner contributed
Make sure know advance happen encourage good behavior
A elaborate peer evaluation also ask marked people effective
Do neglect set aside time end next session retrospective project process
You could also ask written assessment student worked
Do lose track purpose benefit pairing
The driver take tactical microscopic view code produced navigator take strategic macroscopic view
Work keep concept going well possible
It essence
If poll student preference suggested even conjunction different option would good announce decision day advance ca meet desire
This give chance explain privately choice could honored
I really need And clear mind let student know main goal exercise
Is project important learning something process
When make compromise goal mind
An extension I come appreciate one driver keeper
This last role might considerably difficult depending lab
The idea someone keep track
This mean start lab student start keeper dedicate bit time read online design pattern language using
It important delve deep
Just general idea design pattern mean
Then begin working
Two three work usual workflow
The third mind design program
As regular student switch role every
In case trio obviously cycle
If student lab trio additional navigator remember design pattern
It made clear primary task would definitely help debugging maintaining code
The added bonus extension pair programming student exposed design pattern
Seeing sometimes complicated matter starting tackle better done sooner later
I found solution quite useful lab subject OOP complex system important SOLID principle become
By posting answer agree

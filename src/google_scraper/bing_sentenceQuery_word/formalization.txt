I need work optimizer language whose operator second order function
They well known one filter map reduce fold foreach etc
etc
I need formalize much possible language
I mean I would like end description Filter function domain codomain property condition also property hold Can suggest work least partially done
You may able completely specify formally tractable way semantics function depending
But work even incompletely may help significantly optimizing program since may enough establish whatever property needed optimization
The first thing want type function
For probably want kind polymorphic typing see ML CAML using type variable base type operate left open
Most function take several argument following discussion comment Jake may want consider would convenient order point whether want
For example note type list element type define function function two argument first function second list returning list
function one argument function return specialized mapping function map list list specified argument
The latter curried version former
They give computing power curried one may convenient optimization intuition decomposes structure
Then kind information may need may depend kind optimization intend implement
Many type optimization typical example may require knowing algebraic property function
But may also depend algebraic property type type constructor used existence identity element respect operation empty list
I doubt problem restricted second order function
Typically relation may useful optimization
trivially denote empty list
I recall literature issue
But may want look abstract data type formal algebra algebraic technique used optimization
There probably property le algebraic may interested defining using
An important aspect also whether function purely functional whether side effect
A map function could possibly destroy list given argument result reusing memory location
You may want look
Its type system allows express type functional language
function much
You easily add arbitrary property
Here definition taken The first part usual definition last line express interesting feature

There several equivalent computation model capable simulating
For example lambda calculus SKI calculus based rewriting Cardelli object calculus Hoare communicating sequential process course universal Turing machine formally defined
I understand though possibly different way building quantum computer way build today equivalent model computation
My question anyone formalized mathematical computation model quantum computer
As model I assume could used programming language
I understand possible answer would quantum mechanic exactly I looking Just Turing machine widely used model computation quantum Turning machine wildly used model quantum computation
Instead popular
Quantum circuit defined obvious way reversible transformation quantum mechanical analog register
Yes
The mathematical formalization computation model quantum computer
See also
working programming language quantum computing long time
He one working field course I believe work accessible largely accepted enough fit bill
What essentially developed typed lambda calculus quantum computation
I believe best place start chapter textbook written Valiron available
I believe list reference chapter quite authoritative
If looking concrete formalization look Quipper language embedded Haskell
The well probably best place start
If looking general discussion introduction topic look

set theory opposed axiomatic set theory widely used computer science central part underlying mathematical language
Here example many undergraduate student computer science come across
Data structure thought implementation set particular focus efficient implementation set operation
In database theory notion relational database seeing database relation set
In formal language theory set string study operation language central
Some usual set operation intersection union complement others particular set string language concatenation Kleene star operation language
In programming language semantics semantic domain set structure typically complete partial order
And algorithm solving set constraint useful
study type inference programming language
Axiomatic set theory becomes useful certain part computability theory study logic computer science kind topic undergraduate student likely encounter
In SOOOOO many way
Databases root application
Databases built process data Sets application use negotiates databaes gessed set
Many algorithm work set
In machine learning use group result model derive statistic attempt use algoritm world
Statistics ALL ABOUT THAT DATA stats provide mathematical description set data
There mathematics around processing set partitioning theory descrete mathematics set theory IS real thing Understanding different algorithm process set information called notation describes well different algorithm process data
It computer scientist determine algoritms
Understanding set CRITICAL computer science
You wont get first year without introduced
Let give sorry
particularly set theory variation one approach foundational theory mathematics
An alternative approach alternative closely related commonly used foundation various computer science discipline
So certainly indirect application set theory computer science exactly foundational theory
ADDENDUM See also observation comment
He point math CS still ultimately derived set theory I agree
Also point formalization automaton including Turing machine term set
So I wanted point formal CS built set theory I made clearer neither built type theory even le fact
Still question

This post part series produced HuffPost Mentorship Program
discus issue affecting woman science technology engineering math
Transitioning sophomore year summer given lot time think reflect upon experience towards majoring Computer Science
I feel extremely different way commonly portrayed medium even I expected
So six reality computer science major Personally brother one encouraged take computer science class
I tried learn code unsuccessful I could even set development environment
Even though dropped intro CS class told I could field needed woman engineer like
Through faith I took web development course jumped intro CS track Stanford stuck CS train ever since
The number one thing attracts CS major fact I build stuff stay around forever said internet written ink bad deal
b accessible many people c like teaching really stupid baby something
Mehran Sahami really famous one awesome CS professor told u first day class computer really dumb really good following instruction
Almost good point everything letter
If talk computer language make want golden
My problem solving skill become immensely better becoming computer science major
In fact everything I think problem
Running late morning
I break problem going take time I effectively cut corner avoid wasting time
My parent often rely fix anything technologically related television phone name
I approach every issue software problem could wrong
Look symptom problem see show
Understand system could causing
And usually I get solution
It easy give say oh care someone else code
Another one awesome CS Professors Eric Roberts showed u first day second introductory class even Stanford graduated student CS major Valley hired still need people fill job
It surprising software job even working eBay talent one thing company aggressively looking
You give could
Maybe could code next app Learning CS involves experimentation
You mess around code really get
Sometimes mean break something already working
But great thing return get learn something new sometimes something even documented fixed
This definitely happens work everyday
Sometimes I feel like taking lazy approach going back old way thing trust definitely lot better play around
Being CS major hard probably many people
You doubt everyday whether meant want give
You see kid since two year old think Damn I even bother trying
You fail programming ponder question personal experience
The truth one talk hard want think
Even year later I still doubting decision major CS software engineering
I doubt day I set foot first second third CS class every exam I took first day internship day I push code Github
But truth OK doubt long hold back
You think best
Of course
Do afraid wo get anywhere unless try
So someone contemplating computer science someone afraid stop
Forget boy tell ca forget hater jealous zeal
Code
If broken get segmentation fault Java exception go fix
Chances assume meant never able feel thrill getting something work even Hello World stopping
Sometimes one stopping answer let go

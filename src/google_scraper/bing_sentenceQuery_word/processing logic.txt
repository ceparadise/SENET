cover overlap field
The topic essentially divided three main area Logic play fundamental role computer science
Some key area logic particularly significant formerly called recursion theory
The based concept defined logician mathematician
Church first showed existence algorithmically unsolvable problem using notion
Turing gave first compelling analysis called mechanical procedure asserted found Turing analysis perfect
In addition major area theoretical overlap logic computer science One first application use term Logic Theorist system developed Shaw
One thing logician take set statement logic deduce conclusion additional statement must true law logic
For example If given logical system state All human mortal Socrates human valid conclusion Socrates mortal
Of course trivial example
In actual logical system statement numerous complex
It realized early kind analysis could significantly aided use computer
The Logic Theorist validated theoretical work influential work mathematical logic called
In addition subsequent system utilized logician validate discover new logical theorem proof
There always strong influence mathematical logic field
From beginning field realized technology automate logical inference could great potential solve problem draw conclusion fact
Ron Brachman described FOL metric AI knowledge representation formalism evaluated
There general powerful known method describing analyzing information FOL
The reason FOL simply used computer language actually expressive sense FOL easily express statement computer matter powerful could ever solve
For reason every form knowledge representation sense trade expressivity computability
The expressive language closer FOL likely slower prone infinite loop
For example IF THEN rule used limited subset FOL
Rather arbitrary formula full range logical operator starting point simply logician refer
As result computability quite good especially take advantage optimization algorithm compilation
Another major area research logical theory software engineering
Research project Programmer Apprentice program applied logical theory validate correctness software specification
They also used transform specification efficient code diverse platform prove equivalence implementation specification
This formal transformation driven approach often far effort traditional software development
However specific domain appropriate formalism reusable template approach proven viable commercial product
The appropriate domain usually weapon system security system real time financial system failure system excessively high human financial cost
An example domain process designing chip used CPU critical component digital device
An error chip catastrophic
Unlike software chip ca patched updated
As result commercial justification using formal method prove implementation corresponds specification
Another important application logic computer technology area automatic classifier
rigid semantics
Definitions directly mapped set theory predicate calculus
This allows specialized theorem provers called classifier analyze various declaration set subset relation given model
In way model validated inconsistent definition flagged
The classifier also infer new information example define new set based existing information change definition existing set based new data
The level flexibility ideal handling ever changing world Internet
Classifier technology built top language allow logical semantic level existing Internet
This layer called

Logic concerned form reasoning
Since reasoning involved intellectual activity logic relevant broad range pursuit
The study logic essential student computer science
It also valuable mathematics student others make use mathematical proof instance linguistics student
In process reasoning one make inference
In inference one us collection statement premise order justify another statement conclusion
The reliable type inference deductive inference conclusion must true premise
Recall elementary geometry Assuming postulate true prove statement Pythagorean Theorem must also true
Geometric proof mathematical proof typically use many deductive inference
Most logic course include precise analysis characteristic deductive inference
These course introduce special symbol called formal language logic symbol manipulation
The course teach general concept method useful independently formal language
Students learn construct proof English well formal language concept method learned used variety context
One even learns prove theorem formal language especially important computer science linguistics branch mathematics
The idea general purpose computer Turing Machine invented course research logic
Computer program written special symbolic language Lisp Prolog
These language contain feature logical symbolism Lisp Prolog derived formal language logic
Through connection study logic help one design program
Other mathematical technique covered PHL recursive definition widely used program
The set theory covered PHL used modern database design
But computer science programming
It includes logical mathematical analysis program
With analysis one prove correctness procedure estimate number step required execute specified program
Modern logic used work incorporated program help construct proof result
Logic also role design new programming language necessary work artificial intelligence cognitive science
Some part logic used engineer circuit design
An understanding subject taught PHL required successful computer science major calculus used engineering course basic logic set theory used many computer science course

Upper division CS course programming drill course cover general principle require mathematical proof principle
PHL teach basic principle method constructing assessing proof
Mathematicians reason abstract concept example continuous function algebraic system ring topological space
Most math student learn write proof thing following example class
This part learning math slow often lead confusion
Math major study logic find help mathematical thinking
It helpful avoiding confusion helpful constructing clear convincing proof
The study logic essential work foundation mathematics largely concerned nature mathematical truth justifying proof mathematical object integer complex number infinite set
Math major UT required take logic course almost always report interesting useful
PHL introduction logic elementary set theory foundation number theory us induction recursion
It requires serious study cover interesting useful material

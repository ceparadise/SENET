aimed improving clarity quality development time making extensive use contrast using simple test jump statement could lead difficult follow maintain
It emerged late appearance programming language latter including support block structure
Contributing factor popularity widespread acceptance first academia later among practitioner include discovery known publication influential open letter Dutch computer scientist coined term structured programming
Structured programming frequently used deviation allow clearer program particular case performed
Following program seen composed callable unit procedure function method subprogram used allow sequence referred single statement
used enable group statement treated one statement
language syntax enclosing structure formal way bracketed code section bracketed indentation curly brace
It possible structured programming programming language though preferable use something like
Some language initially used structured programming include new procedural programming language since time included feature encourage structured programming sometimes deliberately left feature notably GOTO effort make difficult
sometimes known modular programming enforces logical structure program written make efficient easier understand modify
The provides theoretical basis structured programming
It state three way combining selection sufficient express
This observation originate structured programming movement structure sufficient describe well operation
Therefore processor always executing structured program sense even instruction read memory part structured program
However author usually credit result paper BÃ¶hm Jacopini possibly cited paper
The structured program theorem address write analyze usefully structured program
These issue addressed late early major contribution
structured programming described reaction structured program theorem accepted principle program must written provability mind disagreed still disagrees abolishing GOTO statement
In paper Structured Programming Goto Statements gave example believed direct jump lead clearer efficient code without sacrificing provability
Knuth proposed looser structural constraint It possible draw program forward branch left backward branch right branch crossing
Many knowledgeable advocated allowing
Structured programming theorist gained major ally researcher applied interpretation structured programming theory development indexing system research file
The project great engineering success manager company cited support adopting structured programming although Dijkstra criticized way Mills interpretation differed published work
As late still possible raise question structured programming computer science journal
Frank Rubin year open letter titled GOTO considered harmful considered harmful
Numerous objection followed including response Dijkstra sharply criticized Rubin concession writer made responding
By end century nearly computer scientist convinced useful learn apply concept structured programming
programming language originally lacked programming structure
While goto largely replaced structured construct selection repetition language purely structured
The common deviation found many language use early exit subroutine
This result multiple exit point instead single exit point required structured programming
There construction handle case awkward purely structured programming
The common deviation structured programming early exit function loop
At level function statement
At level loop statement terminate loop statement terminate current iteration proceed next iteration
In structured programming replicated adding additional branch test return nested code add significant complexity
early prominent example construct
Some newer language also labeled break allow breaking innermost loop
Exceptions also allow early exit consequence thus treated
Multiple exit arise variety reason often either subroutine work returning value completed calculation encountered exceptional circumstance prevent continuing hence needing exception handling
The common problem early exit cleanup final statement executed example allocated memory deallocated open file closed causing
These must done return site brittle easily result bug
For instance later development return statement could overlooked developer action performed end subroutine statement might performed case
Languages without return statement standard problem
Most modern language provide support prevent leak see detailed discussion
Most commonly done via unwind protection ensures certain code guaranteed run execution exit block structured alternative cleanup block
This often known considered part
Various technique exist encapsulate resource management
An alternative approach found primarily us normal stack unwinding variable deallocation function exit call destructors local variable deallocate resource
argued book nested conditionals may harder understand certain type flatter structure using multiple exit predicated
Their book flatly state one exit point really useful rule
Clarity key principle If method clearer one exit point use one exit point otherwise
They offer cookbook solution transforming function consisting nested conditionals sequence guarded return throw statement followed single unguarded block intended contain code common case guarded statement supposed deal le common one error
also argue tip book point obsolete requirement
In textbook writes control flow often desirable
Using Tennent framework notion Watt uniformly describes control flow construct found contemporary programming language attempt explain certain type sequencer preferable others context control flow
Watt writes unrestricted gotos jump sequencer bad destination jump reader program reader find examines actual label address target jump
In contrast Watt argues conceptual intent return sequencer clear context without examine destination
Watt writes class sequencer known defined sequencer terminates execution textually enclosing command procedure encompasses break loop including break return statement
Watt also note jump sequencer gotos somewhat restricted language like C target must inside local block encompassing outer block restriction alone sufficient make intent gotos C still produce
Watt also examines exception sequencer differ escape jump sequencer explained next section article
In contrast wrote textbook instruction like old sheep clothing strongly advised use
Based coding error software developer Jim Bonang argues exception thrown function violate paradigm proposes exception forbidden
In syntax done declaring function signature since
Bonang proposes conforming written along line Peter Ritchie also note principle even single right function constitutes violation principle argues Dijkstra rule written time exception handling became paradigm programming language proposes allow number throw point addition single return point
He note solution wrap exception sake creating higher nesting depth thus difficult comprehend even accuses propose apply solution programming language support exception engaging thinking
David Watt also analyzes exception handling framework sequencer introduced article previous section early exit
Watt note abnormal situation generally exemplified arithmetic overflow failure like file found kind error detected program unit handler naturally located program unit
For example program might contain several call read file action perform file found depends meaning purpose file question program thus handling routine abnormal situation located system code
Watts note introducing status flag testing caller structured programming even return sequencer would entail result situation application code tends get cluttered test status flag programmer might forgetfully lazily omit test status flag
In fact abnormal situation represented status flag default ignored
He note contrast status flag testing exception opposite causing program terminate unless programmer explicitly deal exception way possibly adding code willfully ignore
Based argument Watt concludes jump sequencer escape sequencer discussed previous section suitable dedicated exception sequencer semantics discussed
The textbook Louden Lambert emphasizes exception handling differs structured programming construct like loop transfer control set different point program actual transfer take place
At point transfer actually occurs may syntactic indication control fact transferred
Computer science professor Arvind Kumar Bansal also note language implement exception handling even control structure like property absence exception longer presence exception exception prematurely cause early exit part control structure instance throw exception usual exit point check reached
Citing multiple prior study others result Westley Weimer wrote significant problem exception create hidden path difficult programmer reason
The necessity limit code point appears contemporary programming environment focused parallel computing
The various parallel construct OpenMP like allow early exit inside outside parallel construct restriction includes manner exit exception permitted inside parallel construct jump target also inside
More rarely subprogram allow multiple This commonly subprogram yield control possibly value resumed left
There number programming notably particularly state machine concurrency
From code execution point view yielding coroutine closer structured programming returning subroutine subprogram actually terminated continue called early exit
However coroutines mean multiple subprogram execution state rather single call stack subroutine thus introduce different form complexity
It rare subprogram allow entry arbitrary position subprogram case program state variable value uninitialized ambiguous similar goto
Some program particularly number follow way easily reduced basic structure programmer implement jump new state
This type often used Linux kernel
However possible structure system making separate subprogram using variable indicate active state see
Alternatively implemented via coroutines dispense trampoline

In particular way organizing storing computer accessed modified
More precisely data structure collection data value relationship among function operation applied data
Data structure implement one particular ADT specify operation performed data structure operation
In comparison data structure concrete implementation space provided ADT
Different kind data structure suited different kind application highly specialized specific task
For example relational database commonly use index data retrieval implementation usually use look identifier
Data structure provide mean manage large amount data efficiently us large
Usually efficient data structure key designing efficient
Some formal design method emphasize data structure rather algorithm key organizing factor software design
Data structure used organize storage retrieval information stored
Data structure generally based ability computer fetch store data place memory specified bit string representing stored memory manipulated program
Thus data structure based computing address data item based storing address data item within structure
Many data structure use principle sometimes combined way
The implementation data structure usually requires writing set create manipulate instance structure
The efficiency data structure analyzed separately operation
This observation motivates theoretical concept data structure defined indirectly operation may performed mathematical property operation including space time cost
There numerous type data structure generally built upon simpler Most language Basic Combined Programming Language lack support data structure
On hand many assembly language special syntax support certain data structure record array
For example direct descendant BCPL language support record respectively addition vector array
Most programming language feature sort mechanism allows data structure implementation reused different program
Modern language usually come standard library implement common data structure
Examples
Modern language also generally support separation library module implementation
Some provide allow client hide implementation detail
typically use purpose
Many known data structure version allow multiple computing thread access single concrete instance data structure simultaneously

suggested antidote unstructured programming existed decade Structured programming invented
An unstructured program procedural program statement executed sequence written
But type programming us goto statement
A goto statement allows control passed place program
When goto statement executed sequence continues target goto
Thus understand program work pretend execute
This mean often difficult understand logic program
Some program compiler goto connects making practical rapidly navigate source code
However common practice programming language use variable association goto go making automated indexing impractical
There similar problem structured programming language foreign language view implemented permit many people view computer data human language
This contrast idea using form abstraction understand program work structured programming
For reason suggested Dijkstra goto statement banned
In one view avoids using dangerous goto statement
This prevents potentially confusing transfer control
Many structured programming language support goto statement used structured manner
For example exit end routine return beginning loop
In another view structured programming confines using control structure one entry point one exit point
The important structure sequence selection repetition
Yet another view structured program program written way understood easily using abstraction
Abstraction mean able understand overall purpose code without understanding detail
A prime mechanism abstraction procedure method
But structure also help using abstraction
Structured programming made possible language package related program could flow charted software diagramming technique understandable
A computer scientist responsible discovering idea Structured Programming communicating notion world programmer
Structured programming first embodied ALGOL Algorithmic Language language became first language used system programming Burroughs MCP OS designed Bob Barton later professor University Utah influenced student Alan Kay invented GUI window one developer Smalltalk
In turn ALGOL became basis Simula first language
ALGOL based language design formalism called BNF Form originator John Backus Peter Naur
The landmark book technique Structured Programming Academic Press contained three section Notes Structured Programming Edsger Dijkstra Notes Data Structuring
Hoare Hierarchical Program Structures Dahl Hoare
The last section introduced Simula concurrency feature
Edsgar Djikstra also wrote book A Discipline Programming Prentice Hall
Another luminary structured programming world Donald Knuth wrote The Art Computer Programming
Later book called Structured Design written Ed Yourdon Larry Constantine many consider structured programming
This graphical technique extremely tedious practice although mostly abandoned successor approach UML
The technique outlined Structured Design Structured Programming different confused share word Structured

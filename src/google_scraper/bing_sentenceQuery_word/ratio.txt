also known term used quantify reduction size produced data compression algorithm
The data compression ratio analogous physical used measure physical compression substance
Data compression ratio defined ratio Thus representation compress MB file MB compression ratio often notated explicit ratio read five one implicit ratio
Note formulation applies equally compression uncompressed size original decompression uncompressed size reproduction
Sometimes given instead defined reduction size relative uncompressed size Thus representation compress file would yield space saving often notated percentage
For signal indefinite size video compression ratio defined term uncompressed compressed instead data size instead space saving one speaks defined reduction relative uncompressed data rate For example uncompressed song CD format data rate x channel x kHz whereas file iPod typically compressed yielding compression ratio saving
When uncompressed data rate known compression ratio inferred compressed data rate
digitized data video digitized film audio preserve information generally achieve compression ratio much better intrinsic data
Compression algorithm provide higher ratio either incur large overhead work specific data sequence
compressing file mostly zero
In contrast
image audio achieve much higher compression ratio cost decrease quality Bluetooth audio streaming visual audio compression artifact loss important information introduced
A compression ratio least needed get video
The data compression ratio serve measure data set signal particular used approximate

Consider array A element occupies word
A word cache used divided word block
What hit ratio following statement
Assume one block read cache case miss array element word cache block size word load word cache
When program try read A first time miss
Hence brought memory also A
Next A hit
So like So hit ratio
Am I wrong anywhere
I also one doubt
First try access A miss
And brings A cache CPU try access A considered hit
Like If correct Hit ratio
Any help regarding appreciated
Since word block element stay one block
Now notice element refered twice one read one write operation
So block element refered read miss hence block copied cache
Now reference element hit well reference element also ne hit sience block element
So reference miss hit one block
Gets repeated every block
So hit miss Since line size word consecutive element loaded cache per miss
Now notice element accessed twice read write
So every even th element first read miss hence corresponding cache line containing element read cache
Now write element hit well reference element
So every reference miss hit
Thus hit rate miss rate

become popular introduction recursion Computer Science student strong argument persist within nature
For reason many u familiar
They also exist within Computer Science elsewhere surprisingly efficient data structure algorithm based upon sequence
There two main example come mind Is special property number give advantage numerical sequence
Is spatial quality
What possible application could
It seems strange many natural number sequence occur recursive problem I never seen heap
The Fibonacci number sort really nice mathematical property make excellent computer science
Here I sure reason I sure reason main factor
Hope help
another magic see many magic
But Fibonacci number easy calculate also specific name
For example natural number many logic prime within sum computable one produce one one take care One important thing I forgot important impact real life example like wide monitor If algorithm successfully explained simple concise mannor understandable example CS nature better teaching tool could someone come
Fibonacci sequence indeed found everywhere
They useful modeling growth animal population plant cell growth snowflake shape plant shape cryptography course computer science
I heard referred DNA pattern nature
Fibonacci heap already mentioned number child node heap log n
Also subtree starting node child least th fibonacci number
Torrent like protocol use system node supernodes use fibonacci decide new super node needed many subnodes manage
They node management based fibonacci spiral golden ratio
See photo node partitioned one large square smaller one vice versa
See photo I think definitive answer one possibility operation dividing set S two partition one divided one size likely approach many algorithm sometimes numerically described Fibonacci sequence
Let add another data structure Fibonacci tree
They interesting calculation next position tree done mere addition previous node It tie well discussion templatetypedef AVL tree worst fibonacci structure
I also seen buffer extended rather power two case
Just add trivia Fibonacci number describe breading rabbit
You start two rabbit population grows exponentially
Their computation power matrix considered primitive problem Operational Research sort like Prisoner Dilemma primitive problem Game Theory

Last week friend wrote demographic race gender within Computer Science concentration Harvard
I currently studying Computer Science Stanford Winnie post got wondering anywhere online I could find data school
Particularly since I Hispanic I wanted see percentage Computer Science major Stanford belong demographic
Based experience going lecture office hour clear number low
Only Computer Science concentrators Harvard Hispanic
I tried demographic data Google I able find number I looking
I decided follow Winnie lead try hand collecting demographic data Computer Science major Stanford
I think important make demographic data readily available Stanford Computer Science Department among top world Stanford Computer Science student track record helping shape trajectory Silicon Valley tech industry whole
As people start realize cultural diversity bring many benefit student faculty employer alike may interested developing better understanding gender racial breakdown Computer Science major Stanford
Before I proceed explain I collected gender race demographic data post important note finding officially verified endorsed Stanford
This small personal project I decided undertake sheer curiosity nonetheless I hope others find insightful
I obtained current list Computer Science undergraduate major Stanford Computer Science Department online student directory
As posting Computer Science major total Class
The online student directory provide gender race data student I figure way collect organize information
I sorted student gender male female race White Asian Black Hispanic
The two gender category male female four race category White Asian Black Hispanic selected category commonly used industry diversity report
To allow comparison made Harvard data Winnie post I also note distinction South Asian East Asian
Similarly I counted Middle Eastern student family name origin west Iran inclusive White I counted South East Asians Vietnamese Pacific Islanders Filipinos East Asian
In case mixed race student I deduced either personal interaction student combination analyzing physical trait family name origin particular type mix I assigned half student mix one group remaining half
For example potentially mixed student I assigned White category Asian category
To collect gender race demographic data I went list student name name looked person Facebook searched origin family name using
Since many Computer Science student either friend friend friend people I taken class past I access lot information form Facebook profile picture status post hometown name addition I knew interacting individual school help infer student gender race
In inferring gender I limited information I could gather student Facebook profile picture
I used conventional least standard visual characteristic cisgender male cisgender female infer gender
In instance approach sufficient classify student male female I looked gender pronoun used timeline post help make final decision
In inferring race I tried make decision based combination person Facebook profile picture family name origin
Looking someone Facebook profile picture may enough case example many Hispanics Argentinian decent Caucasian feature
Looking origin someone family name may also suffice example many Filipinos family name may considered Hispanic origin
Taking profile picture family name origin account help accurately classify people
Someone Asian feature Hispanic family name popular Philippines instance accurately identified Filipino sorted East Asian category
There student profile picture profile picture show face picture particularly cute one Facebook account
For student I turn alternative source find profile picture Google Image Search LinkedIn profile
A student required additional level analysis beyond profile picture family name origin
For student I looked information hometown language used status post picture family member parent grandparent help infer race
Overall I best remain consistent I made sorting decision classify student accurately possible
The following finding accompanied graph I created Google Sheets using data I collected If look gender overall see many male Computer Science major female one
There male student compared female student
Considering Stanford undergraduate student body male female Computer gender ratio severely imbalanced
And yet male female ratio still improvement Computer Science major woman yes year ago
How ratio compare major tech company Silicon Valley
Well imbalanced Stanford ratio situation tech giant Google Facebook even severe
For instance June Google revealed tech employee woman
Similarly June Facebook revealed tech workforce consisted woman
What I wonder number least little bit closer Stanford
After Stanford one largest largest feeder school company
This discrepancy appears suggest woman receiving Computer Science degree either tech company hiring woman choosing work elsewhere
Whatever reason may whether established hiring system failing identify existing female talent whether company falling short providing environment woman feel welcome something definitely demand attention
Focusing race see Stanford Computer Science major Asian followed White Hispanic Black
For reference Stanford undergraduate student body whole Asian White Hispanic Black
This add remaining portion consists Native American Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander student declined state race ethnicity International student ask International listed race ethnicity simply statistic presented
While figure Hispanic Black Computer Science major Stanford slightly better average peer institution respectively according conducted finding part consistent widely known fact Silicon Valley workforce primarily made White Asian men
In sense finding surprising
What surprising Hispanic Black rate Stanford much higher rate demographic major tech company
At Google tech workforce Hispanic Black Facebook tech workforce Hispanic Black
Just observed analyzing data woman appears significant disparity number Hispanics Blacks pursuing Computer Science degree number Hispanics Blacks getting hired choosing stay major Silicon Valley tech company
I found ratio best among Asians followed Blacks Whites Hispanics
It interesting see among two best ratio group Asians underrepresented group Blacks among two worst ratio also group Whites underrepresented group Hispanics
I would expected two racial group also two best gender ratio
Anyway break Asian category East Asian South Asian see South Asians female male edge East Asians female male term gender balance
Looking breakdown race within gender see number Asian White male roughly equal male Asian East Asian South Asian male White
Trailing behind male Hispanic Black
Shifting focus female Computer Science major see Asians far outnumber group
Of female astounding Asian consisting East Asian South Asian White Black Hispanic
The large number Asian female majoring Computer Science Stanford contributes significantly Asians racial group overall
If interested seeing raw number demographic group stack check chart
Once data reflects dominance Asian White male Computer Science field accompanied significantly lower number woman Hispanics Blacks Computer Science major Stanford Asian Male White Male Asian Female White Female Hispanic Male Black Male Hispanic Female Black Female
While race gender demographic data I obtained Computer Science major Stanford appears slightly balanced compared peer institution number still reflect notable disparity field along racial gender line
Moreover disparity grows even larger start looking demographic data major Silicon Valley tech company Google Facebook
Also worth pointing I record data student I browsing Facebook profile searching race gender data I noticed many Hispanic Black Computer Science major international student
It would interesting see percentage Hispanic Black Computer Science major Stanford United States compared come abroad
Furthermore college student I think would also valuable obtain data many Computer Science major college student come family
I strong feeling number low hypothesis difficult verify given family financial information educational information publicly available
I hope learned something new informal study I encourage student school also follow Winnie lead collect race gender demographic data Computer Science major respective home institution
The data better equipped bring positive change tech industry
Gathering data report creating graph typing everything Medium took one day work I think Stanford probably near upper bound term number Computer Science major single school something done pretty easily potential valuable insightful
If decide conduct demographic study school want share others social medium use CSAtMySchool hashtag easy find
I think would really interesting see race gender demographic compare across different school
Lastly passive bystander educate educate others play active role bringing positive change
Encourage sister brother study Computer Science continue support throughout journey
Start community
If professor make offhand joke comparing programming language C one student may struggling parental drug abuse home
If work tech company assume female coworker met Hispanic coworker facility repair guy Black coworker security guard
If interning tech company summer employee looking impactful break work playing ping pong Xbox try work recruiting team organize outreach event connect woman underrepresented minority opportunity exist company interning Google summer instance I helping organize visit making stride area
There still lot work done build welcoming inclusive tech community going take combined effort u student professor intern employee employer alike

My reasoning number hit miss actually number access hit miss actual formula would hit hit miss So miss ratio would If reasoning correct right
What hit miss latency
Because I need calculate using hit miss ratio hit miss latency cycle
Yes
The fraction access hit
The fraction access miss
It hold miss rate hit rate The latency AKA access time time take fetch data case

University student around country packing car making annual pilgrimage dorm room apartment kick school year
They pounding concrete Ikea bathroom accessory hugging parent goodbye fall break
The university experience prepares young adult future career
It teach required skill introduces peer may one day become coworkers
For one field particular class future look similar fraternity house line college town street
Computer science boy club
Women earn
At top research university number according Anita Borg Institute
What startling number represent progress
In woman earned undergraduate degree
Three decade later computer science become much vital gateway job chance influence future society
Yet vastly men woman stepping
Computer science science engineering mathematics number woman receiving bachelor degree decreased since showed modest increase recent year
The number female degree earner last three year starting inch rising faster men Linda Sax education professor UCLA researching woman underrepresented computer science
The number student go computer science fluctuated relative perceived career opportunity gender gap tends widen period That computer science viewed lucrative people men woman choose pursue
In year though ratio men woman increase
One reason woman historically yet fulfilling job like teaching journalism whereas male counterpart sometimes considered family provider choose career like computer science engineering
The advent home personal computer may contributed historic gender gap
In PC became standard home appliance mostly men used
According National Science Foundation study found men substantially likely use computer use hour woman adult woman reported using computer typical week compared It man Apple homemaker appliance woman run business household
Other contributing factor according academic expert I interviewed include culture encourages young woman play doll rather robot pursue traditionally female career well stereotype programmer white male
Sometimes woman feel like belong technical world dominated men
Those stereotype based reality according data released largest tech company
Among including Facebook Google Twitter Apple workforce male
In technical role disparity even greater
At Twitter instance female
Telle Whitney president CEO Anita Borg Institute working change number
The organization founded computer scientist Anita Borg aim equalize ratio men woman technology field
Whitney know firsthand challenging woman pursuing degree computer science
I PhD Caltech time I woman Whitney told interview
I know quite going feeling isolation like I necessarily belong pretty The gender disparity tech start young
student took Advanced Placement Computer science exam high school last year
Less
But AP exam necessarily predict success student college particular interest
So drive participation computer science class many college university working make computer science appealing woman
At Harvey Mudd College private liberal art college near Los Angeles initiative underway make department welcoming
As result student woman
Harvey Mudd still working ensure woman feel welcome capable male computer science peer
These strategy like Oh turned everything pink Colleen Lewis assistant professor computer science Harvey Mudd said interview
These best practice getting student broad range interest interested computer Harvey Mudd split introduction computer science course three different track instead student different level complete course
Essentially course broken beginning intermediate advanced level student study learn peer similar experience overwhelmed student coding since elementary school
By addressing level individually prevents student programming experience deterred field competing expert
The college also brings number student conference hosted Anita Borg Institute largest gathering female technologist world
The conference give student opportunity meet woman career tech provides role model new student still discovering computer science
This year Lewis five faculty member bringing student event
Harvey Mudd alone effort
In June Carnegie Mellon University announced incoming major female
The university attribute achievement increasing networking event mentoring opportunity community building
At University California Berkeley woman outnumbered men year first time university introductory course
The newly redesigned course geared specifically towards woman professor Dan Garcia lecture introduced exercise including talking popular technology news beginning every class
Notably Berkeley changed name course Introduction Symbolic Programming The Beauty Joy Computing moniker class
However class brimming woman technical course still fall short
Berkeley robotics professor Ruzena Bajcsy teacher year
In last year say noticed significant increase number woman class
I seen woman classroom Bajcsy said interview
Maybe woman two three Feeling isolated ostracized common frustration among woman technology
Especially investor CEOs technology leader implicitly biased woman
Tech accelerator Y Combinator founder Paul Graham bias told New York Times I tricked anyone look like Mark Graham also widely criticized God know would get girl interested computer
I would stop think Female engineer computer scientist frequently find alone room men
They also deal peer people male counterpart consider role model
GeekFeminism keep sexist incidence tech community
A recent obstacle growth brogrammer shorthand term macho culture imported college campus startup office
When I undergraduate Berkeley brogrammer identity exist Lewis said
There growth new identity explicitly masculine problematic interesting brogrammer identity predominant one pop culture right Universities work equalize ratio woman technology without significant culture idea white male twentysomethings make best still discriminated workforce
Pop culture could help scrub identity help woman find role model medium
For instance HBO startup parody cast
Google part improve representation girl hacker Hollywood
The stereotype unfortunately reflective reality startup pay lot attention culture word workplace fun drinking human resource
One woman worked GitHub community similar dystopian novel Whitney say order encourage woman pursue tech stay career culture need change
The Anita Borg Institute work lot organization create culture woman thrive said
If graduate people organizational culture go macho going want Silicon Valley YouTube launched handy new page last night aggregate video institution higher education around US

Even growth vast majority computer science job pursued filled men
As industry whole add million job coming year continues notable absence woman field
This trend begin well entering job market girl account half Advanced Placement AP yet boy computer science exam
In Mississippi Montana Wyoming single girl took AP Computer Science examination
There clear disconnect computer science industry message girl receive ability succeed tech organization
This guide examines history behind disparity educator parent employer computer scientist reverse trend
Before advent home computer early substantially woman undertook computer science degree
According academic year woman accounted nearly computer science undergraduate student
This number steadily dropped widespread use home computer became common
A everyday usage personal computer within home found men far likely use computer use hour per week woman
Only men reported using computer weekly basis compared female surveyed
As woman made computer science student
Much attention devoted studying reason drop female computer science major
The central conclusion first personal computer essentially early gaming system firmly catered male
While early word processing tool also available told story new device met need men
As male began purchasing computer personal use nerdy programmer classification began take hold professional world computer science
By percentage woman studying computer science postsecondary level
Though woman represent workforce compared engineer female
Furthermore percentage woman working computer profession steadily declined since dropping last year
According number possible step towards reversing trend encouraging female student undertake computer science
By fostering interest scientific topic early age working remove negative connotation barrier educator parent work together help girl maintain confidence curiosity STEM subject
For professional already field woman offer role model mentor men take stand sexist prejudiced behavior workplace
Due marketing strategy last three decade many woman developed misconception computer science
While notion geek coder alive well many young woman may unaware myriad job available opportunity make palpable difference
The University California Berkeley experienced revolution introductory computer science class changing marketed course
What used known Introduction Symbolic Programming called The Beauty Joy Computing
The
For first time woman class outnumbered men
A recent Deloitte found woman choice account buying decision nationwide
In addition impactful career offered computer science one field woman opportunity earn salary male counterpart
According discrepancy overall pay rate remained stalled last decade
Even woman make cent dollar compared men position however incongruity far le pronounced perhaps even within field computer science
As Smithsonian Magazine survey conducted AAUW recent graduate found one year graduation male female programmer earning salary
The absence gender shift within pay scale also held true traditionally industry including math physical science occupation
A recent Deloitte found woman choice account buying decision nationwide
Furthermore diversity opinion integral innovation
Though still commonplace find board project team without sole female member integration woman field naturally lead holistic understanding consumer marketplace
In addition reason mentioned many tech computer science company forefront progressive workplace policy
Some innovative tech company benefit include In report researcher found woman working tech company particularly much likely healthy balance
Many tech company supportive professional procedure working home employing videoconferencing technology
Furthermore many company also flexible hour allowing employee work best suit provided project completed time
While average length maternity leave America salaried employee six week many technology company recognize key component keeping female employee providing substantial fair policy new mother
Some parental leave policy include Whether new father mother adoptive parent Facebook employee receive four month paid leave addition baby cash assist unexpected cost
Furthermore company set breastfeeding room office
Expectant mother given total week work including four week delivery
Fathers adoptive parent provided six week paid leave
Additionally Apple Facebook offer assistance adoption fertility treatment including freezing egg
This massive tech company offer variety provision
All biological mother receive week paid leave number extending complication arise
All new parent receive week paid leave primary caregiver eligible seven week
Aside generous time company also offer assistance program help new parent find childcare discount agency place nanny towards supply new child special room mother breastfeed
Consistently best place work parent SAS go beyond come serving woman family
In addition generous paid leave program company offer variety benefit child growing
A subsidized onsite child care center mean parent visit kid throughout day company cafeteria includes special menu appealing younger crowd think hot dog
The company also instills spirit trust employee allowing step away office whenever necessary long work completed time
Now historical reasoning misconception overturned time think taking step toward involving woman industry
Keep reading learn fostering passion computer science young girl
With number female studying computer science near low clear action need taken
Understanding root problem start early age essential rectifying
According recent coverage child indicate interest science however enter middle school percentage interested girl fall dramatically
By high school many girl previously took advanced scientific course drop study
child indicate interest science however enter middle school percentage interested girl fall dramatically
The summary offered corroborated extended conducted researcher Florida Gulf Coast University The University Colorado cite numerous reason drop female interest education progress
In secondary school le emphasis placed developing girl computer science skill compared boy
Even go study topic college often report feeling lag behind male counterpart due dearth attention high school level
Furthermore female student lack relatable role model inspiration given many leader field men
Lastly historic marketing perception scientific field catered largely male student
While characterization permeated last decade still belief profession often narrow impersonal unsuited wish make difference human level
Beginning number woman studying computer science similar field fell steep decline
In recent year number leveled establishing baseline assessing success newly implemented educational initiative
Some innovative way educator parent work increase girl interest computer science subject include While boy tend verbal class educator engage female student bring learning initiative discussion
This increase likelihood girl engaging subject matter better prepare plan study one topic collegiate level
Girls entering field computer science likely face resistance subject area heavily populated female
Adults bolster resolve providing example strong successful female thriving career
Whether creating mentorship program secondary postsecondary level bringing speaker using female leader case study educator parent instill sense confidence girl interested pursuing historically male dominated field giving role model
As discussed previous section number woman computer science related degree dropped sharply response message home computer mostly men
In interim year woman shifted subject typically referred humanity liberal art evidenced A June report featured Harvey Mudd College effort counter trend
Rather pure programming introductory computer science course reworked focus solving wealth opportunity within field
The school also lessened intimidation factor splitting course two section based incoming student prior programming experience
The result
Within four year college went woman electing major subject
As push encourage girl interest computer science gain momentum number program created help foster interest
Some innovative include Whether operating middle school high school collegiate level group pivotal encouraging sustaining girl pursuit topic
Outside organization mentioned number initiative engage girl computer science
Whether competition summer camp science fair MOOC governmental program resource help parent educator think outside box come encouraging girl scientific pursuit
This organization host computer science technology competition middle school girl develop project solve social problem

The program seek make STEM topic interesting accessible crucial time research proven girl interest subject tends drop
The Chevron Center STEM Education Career Development host number program aimed encouraging girl pursue STEM topic including This weeklong summer camp designed help girl see STEM subject fun meaningful starting young age
According coverage one primary challenge facing STEM field involves engaging enough student topic
Because career industry well publicized student frequently preconceived notion type work available graduating
MOOCs Massive Open Online Courses free abbreviated online course provide introductory curriculum material student across world
High school often take advantage specifically area may teacher available
By engaging student course material still high school hope stay course come time pick postsecondary major
Some interesting computer science MOOCs available include Whether local state federal level Government enacted many initiative engage girl young woman topic including computer science
In addition national program campaign many state created initiative engage local middle high school girl
A number innovative program exist throughout nation including In report researcher found high school girl considering STEM degree want learn mentorship opportunity motivational program nearly female pursuing scientific degree mentor
A entitled Why So Few American Association University woman verified number noting mentorship pivotal measure instilling interest confidence pursue field especially historically involved like young woman
In next section review college throughout America highest percentage woman computer science graduate take deeper look program attracting retaining female student
Parents educator student seeking mentorship program computer science education career check following pioneering initiative These school ranking based latest data pulled Institute Education Sciences regarding male female graduate computer science program

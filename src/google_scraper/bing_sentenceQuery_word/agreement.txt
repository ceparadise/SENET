Find pick best Computer Science Program Menu Whether already familiar term clickwrap agreement countless time
A staple modern internet software professional service industry proper terminology contract one party agrees another party term condition making use software professional service
It also used describe arrangement similar acknowledgment take place prior processing financial transaction trade
When purchasing installing software online source user often subjected two clickwrap agreement minimum one prior payment processed another software installed used
Related resource These agreement sometimes called clickwrap license clickthrough They notorious frequency go unread prior user simply checking provided box acknowledging acceptance term
So would company use clickwrap agreement
Most avenue offering downloadable software online service general public online storefront payment management service offer capacity form clickthrough agreement
One prominent example PayPal allows use service sell online include term condition invoice
By simple notice client informed making payment invoice considered legally binding acceptance term presented
Whether using PayPal similar service setting agreement provider easily create modify agreement ensuring prospective user take advantage service perform certain transaction without acknowledging
The name form contract developed contract common early day software industry
A user purchased software packaged form would told act opening package removing literal constituted acceptance developer term use
Today idea allows company establish binding contract large number user without individually negotiate term one
Despite apparent complexity many company term use agreement usually far le complicated worked two specific party individual transaction
Despite developed purpose application clickwrap license allows owner modify term condition needed requiring notify existing user establish consent new agreement
As result company able cover broad range concern within scope function single evolving agreement
This enables accommodate issue concern might obvious time agreement originally authored
The clickwrap agreement devoid
For example consumer advocate noted average internet user assuming average reading speed would spend time reading comprehending agreement relevant actually available
Thanks convenience general acceptance overall effectiveness contract however unlikely going replaced time soon

A fundamental problem achieve overall system reliability presence number faulty process
This often requires process agree data value needed computation
Examples application include whether commit transaction database agreeing identity
The real world application include opinion formation others
The consensus problem requires agreement among number process agent single data value
Some process agent may fail unreliable way consensus protocol must resilient
The process must somehow put forth candidate value communicate one another agree single consensus value
The consensus problem fundamental problem control system
One approach generating consensus process agent agree majority value
In context majority requires least one half available vote process given vote
However one faulty process may skew resultant outcome consensus may reached reached incorrectly
Protocols solve consensus problem designed deal limited number faulty
These protocol must satisfy number requirement useful
For instance trivial protocol could process output binary value
This useful thus requirement modified output must somehow depend input
That output value consensus protocol must input value process
Another requirement process may decide upon output value decision irrevocable
A process called correct execution experience failure
A consensus protocol tolerating halting failure must satisfy following property
A protocol correctly guarantee consensus amongst n process fail said
In evaluating performance consensus protocol two factor interest running time message complexity
Running time given number round message exchange function input parameter typically number process size input domain
Message complexity refers amount message traffic generated protocol
Other factor may include memory usage size message
There two type failure process may undergo crash failure
A crash failure occurs process abruptly stop resume
Byzantine failure failure absolutely condition imposed
For example may occur result malicious action adversary
A process experience Byzantine failure may send contradictory conflicting data process may sleep resume activity lengthy delay
Of two type failure Byzantine failure far disruptive
Thus consensus protocol tolerating Byzantine failure must resilient every possible error occur
A stronger version consensus tolerating Byzantine failure given Varying model computation may define consensus problem
Some model may deal fully connected graph others may deal ring tree
Asynchronous versus synchronous model message passing may considered
In model message authentication allowed whereas others process completely anonymous
Shared memory model process communicate accessing object shared memory also important area research
A special case consensus problem called binary consensus restricts input hence output domain single binary digit
When input domain large relative number process instance input set natural number shown consensus impossible synchronous message passing model
While real world communication often inherently asynchronous practical useful model synchronous system
In fully asynchronous distributed system one process may halting failure proved consensus impossible
However impossibility result derives scenario process schedule highly unlikely
In reality process scheduling degree randomness
In asynchronous model form failure handled synchronous consensus protocol
For instance loss communication link may modeled process suffered Byzantine failure
In synchronous system assumed communication proceed round
In one round process may send message requires receiving message process
In manner message one round may influence message sent within round
Three agreement problem interest follows
A collection process numbered communicate sending message one another
Process must transmit value process It also known The General Problem
Formal requirement consensus protocol may include For process partially synchronous system system alternate good bad period synchrony process chooses private value
The process communicate round determine public value generate consensus vector following requirement It shown variation problem equivalent solution problem one type model may solution another problem another type model
For example solution Weak Byzantine General problem synchronous authenticated message passing model lead solution Weak Interactive Consistency
An interactive consistency algorithm solve consensus problem process choose majority value consensus vector consensus value
There anonymous synchronous protocol solves Weak Byzantine Generals case number failure n number process
For system processor one Byzantine solution consensus problem synchronous message passing model binary input In fully asynchronous system consensus solution tolerate one crash failure even requiring non triviality property
This result sometimes called FLP impossibility proof named author awarded significant work
The FLP result state consensus never reached merely model assumption algorithm always reach consensus bounded time
In practice highly unlikely occur
An example polynomial time binary consensus protocol tolerates Byzantine failure Phase King algorithm Garay Berman
The algorithm solves consensus synchronous message passing model process failure provided
In phase king algorithm phase round per phase
Each process keep track preferred output initially equal process input value
In first round phase process broadcast preferred value process
It receives value process determines value majority value count
In second round phase process whose id match current phase number designated king phase
The king broadcast majority value observed first round serf tie breaker
Each process update preferred value follows
If count majority value process observed first round greater process change preference majority value otherwise us phase king value
At end phase process output preferred value
Google implemented library called
Chubby maintains lock information small file stored replicated database achieve high availability face failure
The database implemented top log layer based
In scheme Chubby client communicate Paxos order replicated log file
us maintain consensus network
Nodes bitcoin network attempt solve cryptographic problem probability finding solution proportional computational effort hash per second expended node solves problem version block transaction added distributed timestamp server accepted node
As node network attempt solve problem becomes unfeasible unless attacker computational resource network
Many online game use modified consensus protocol order manage game state player game
Each game action result game state delta broadcast player game along hash total game state
Each player validates change applying delta game state comparing game state hash
If hash agree vote cast player whose game state minority disconnected removed game known desync
Another approach called algorithm used widely computer science control theory
To solve consensus problem system concurrent object must introduced
A concurrent object shared object data structure help concurrent process communicate reach agreement
There two main method design concurrent object
Traditionally designer use solve problem mean one process allowed visit concurrent object time others must wait process exit critical section
This method straightforward easy implement
However system critical section face risk crashing process dy inside critical section sleep intolerably long time
Another implementation concurrent object called implementation guarantee consensus finite number step
Is given kind object powerful enough solve consensus problem
Maurice Herlihy gave Impossibility Universality Hierarchy
Consensus number hierarchy mean maximum number process system reach consensus given object
Objects higher consensus number implemented object lower consensus number
According hierarchy register solve consensus even
Data structure like stack queue solve consensus two process
Why object solve consensus among process
An efficient way prove take advantage bivalence
Assume output binary state bivalent two output possible output reachable state state called
The basic idea make contradiction executing operation get state
However concurrent object universal mean solve consensus among number process simulate object
The way simulate object universal object build operation sequence concurrent object

Recently item added Product Backlog product owner say When I go login page x page I see error
I want error removed
It seems use case PBI Product Backlog Item
However I discussed scrum master told user story PBIs PBI could bug report task user story anything literally item addressed first
I sure
Also I ca find good definition PBI
So question sort get Product Backlog item
Does product backlog item map user story
Are
Does product backlog item map user story
Are
Not necessarily general
Like scrum master said thing product backlog item
However depends SCRUM work
Some team separate bug backlog taken consideration sprint well others keep thing product backlog
Two separate log make difficult product owner prioritize task two log taken consideration next sprint
But offer better oversight prioritized separately
So question sort thing get Product Backlog item
This anything part product vision journey product want create
It mostly contains requirement user story also contain action technical thing directly belong product
Buy new server dev team Create advertisement product
The backlog avoid uncessary detail try micromanage technical thing
The product backlog contain anything delivers value product
There one true Scrum
Sometimes separate backlog better way manage product sometimes way
Find work best
When working bug add backlog call
By adding bug fix te backlog way clear bug fix
We add task make sure automated test written verification done
It also make explicit DoD followed
We never used term PBI even though backlog tool call always simply
It mainly team choice terminology long clear really matter
Falcon explained well
One page formal definition What described placed product backlog according discription least
There common misunderstanding user story allowed Product Backlog
By contrast Scrum neutral requirement technique

Should developer direct communication stakeholder Product Backlog Items implementation clarification
Or communication go Product Owner
On Scrum Guide read following On one hand Product Owner The Product Owner sole person responsible managing Product Backlog
Product Backlog management includes Clearly expressing Product Backlog item
But hand The Product Owner may work Development Team
However Product Owner remains accountable
So theoretically Development Team may communicate stakeholder clarification PBI
But good practice
I always think Product Owner single entry point requirement
I see option situation Developers may clarify PBIs stakeholder implementation
But case risk stakeholder view PBI may different Product Owner view example stakeholder may want make scope bigger thay may different view aPBI even among
The Product Owner may lose control PBIs scope
Developers may clarify PBI Product Owner
This way I always work
But one case I know Product Owner physically time enough work
What shall case
Ask developer take initiative resolve issue sole discretion
Force define PBI well taking Sprint taken forbid developer ask question joke real situation
I read
Unfortunately Russian believe described situation real case
Maybe exist better solution described
Excellent question To answer question directly yes developer talk customer possible
As pointed though logistics difficult
Something rising use directly address Product Owner Team also known agile business team agile customer team
This direct recognition product owner often able single owner
Whether lack knowledge many cook kitchen large enterprise company PO rarely get final decision
A POT build team around PO product Backlog
The POT job make sure backlog well ordered well defined meet definition ready story able picked run development team without work
The POT made PO technical architect QA representative potentially customer support operation even customer
The technical architect role either senior person technical business knowledge common larger company actual representative development team
This allows story fully explored ever get Sprint Planning meeting
The POT way I recommend engaging customer Product Backlog Items
As Scrum Master I encourage team member talk stakeholder
But I suggest either presence Product Owner brief Product Owner soon possible conversation finished
The Product Owner see big picture
What sound like perfectly reasonable request developer might actually bad idea context conversation stakeholder
This critisism developer
They simply time continually bounce idea stakeholder build understanding market product
The Product Owner role full time demanding
The developer look support Product Owner every opportunity never bypass

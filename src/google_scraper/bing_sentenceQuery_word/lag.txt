New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio city investing million establish computer science instruction every public school city
This announcement impressive hardly surprising u watching computer science education landscape evolve rapidly last eight year
Interest computer science CS university level declined bust came back vengeance
Since student enrollment computer science increasing
As professor computer science worked extensively improve CS education undergraduate graduate level I know many want go field computer science
The number female student racial minority remain distressingly low
But often student preparation encouragement succeed work
So challenge expanding computer science education public school system
The start new millennium saw many ups down area computer science
Enrollment computer science computer engineering degree peaked height That year survey university computing department conducted Computing Research Association reported undergraduate major institution
But soon bust number new major dropped rapidly
By Taulbee survey reported undergraduate institution
Despite tech downturn following bust computing industry grew rapidly throughout
So computing industry sounding alarm dire shortage trained computing professional
Indeed year Bureau Labor Statistics predicted computing would professional sector projected growth rate
Starting u academia started notice student class lot
In spring I undergraduate program director UMBC CS program held emergency meeting decide handle fact section required discrete math class waiting list
We debated whether start real trend blip
Within year two every computer science professor country knew blip
As scrambled hire faculty increase class size try find way accommodate increasingly long waiting list student kept coming
In recent Taulbee survey reported nearly major computer science computer engineering another information science category reported earlier Taulbee survey increase remarkable seven year since enrollment low
But face many challenge
Often student want major computer science computational thinking mathematical preparation succeed coursework
We also enough broaden interest computing percentage female computer science CS major remains low several racial minority also significantly underrepresented African Americans representing estimated major Hispanics representing around
According nonprofit focused expanding access computing education school state permit computer science class count toward high school graduation usually math science technology education credit compared nine state
No state however actually require computer science class graduation
As result vast majority student take even single computer science course throughout education principal report school offer CS course includes programming high school certified offer AP computer science fewer student took AP CS exam representing fewer AP exam student leave high school little knowledge computational thinking design
The good news many state moving rapidly expand instruction computing education
In Chicago announced comprehensive plan establish computer science instruction every public school starting elementary school
Since San Francisco New York City joined rank
Arkansas recently became first state announce offer computer science class
Even state fully adopted statewide universal computer science education
On average state adopted recommended learning standard developed Computer Science Teachers Association CSTA premier professional organization computing education
Although state adopted elementary school standard grade nearly half state adopted high school standard grade
Moreover standard adopted state focus skill abstract computational concept therefore prepare student well advanced computing course
An additional concern broadening computing education challenge finding qualified teacher
Arkansas example scrambling hire train enough qualified teacher
As Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson stated time new mandate became law high school teacher across entire state actually prepared teach computer science
This gap desire computer science class availability prepared teacher exists across country
Standards teaching computer science also either lacking consistent across state boundary
A Association Computing Machinery ACM CSTA state two state District Columbia specifically require CS certification teach computer science class
An additional seven state require CS certification teach Advanced Placement computer science
In state teaching certification computer science CS offered mandated state certification system ineffective program offered information readily available requirement complex understood met teacher incentive obtain CS certification order teach CS class
Moreover demand computer science class increase teacher field little computer science background tapped teach class
The computer science education community working develop consistent standard across state boundary
In meantime concern emerging
For example requiring certification exacerbate teacher shortage problem many computer science course currently taught teacher without computer science certification
There also real growing concern attracting keeping highly qualified teacher since teacher also get hired industry
While great deal progress since still long way go

Lag slang term noticeable decrease application speed due extreme network congestion insufficient processing power
When traffic heavier network capacity network requires program wait sending receiving data
In application like game lag refers application failure respond input timely manner
Lag commonly used describe time delay player action game reaction input
This may caused lack processing power case game running computer console
Online video game also experience lag period network congestion insufficient processing power
Lag especially noticeable playing online game via connection
Lag primarily occurs data requires certain amount travel time application compounded data application processing time
Specific type lag include Techopedia Terms Copyright Techopedia

In noticeable delay action player reaction server
The tolerance lag depends heavily type game
For instance low pace may high threshold even mostly unaffected high delay whereas game considerably higher pace may require significantly lower delay able provide satisfying gameplay
However specific characteristic game matter
For example game fast action may tolerate high lag
Also twitch game designed event impact outcome game introduce lag allowing fast local response time
While maintains main game state local machine requires maintained central server order avoid inconsistency individual client
As client direct control central game state may send change request server update local game state receiving update server
This need communicate cause delay client server fundamental cause behind lag
While may numerous underlying reason player experience lag summarized insufficient hardware either client server poor connection client server
Hardware related issue cause lag due fundamental structure game architecture
Generally game consist looped sequence state frame
During frame game accepts user input performs necessary calculation AI graphic etc
When processing finished game update game state produce output new image screen packet sent server
The frequency frame generated often referred
As central game state located server updated information must sent client server order take effect
In addition client must receive necessary information server order fully update state
Generating packet send server processing received packet done often client able update local state
Although packet could theoretically generated sent faster would result sending redundant data game state updated packet
A low frame rate would therefore make game le responsive update may force skip outdated data
Conversely hold true server
The frame rate tick rate server determines often process data client send update
This type problem difficult predict compensate
Apart enforcing minimum hardware requirement attempting optimize game better performance feasible way deal
Perhaps common type lag caused problem
outdated packet effect loss may cause problem problem relatively rare network sufficient little
Instead latency involved transmitting data client server play significant role
Latency varies depending number factor physical distance longer distance mean additional transmission length required therefore higher latency
Routing may extremely indirect resulting far transmission length consequent latency direct route although cloud gaming service developed solution issue establishing relationship multiple Internet Service Providers choosing optimal route server user
In addition insufficient bandwidth congestion even severe enough cause loss may cause additional delay regardless distance
As hardware issue packet arrive slowly make client server unable update game state timely manner
Online game system utilizing may subject significant lag depending architecture wireless network local impacting network
Although air faster light optical fiber wireless system often shared among many user may suffer latency incurred due due introduce latency
Additionally cause transmitted packet lost requiring retransmission incurs latency
The noticeable effect lag vary depending exact cause also technique lag compensation game may implement described
As client experience delay implementing method minimize effect player important smooth gameplay
Lag cause numerous problem issue accurate rendering game state hit detection
In many game lag often frowned upon disrupts normal gameplay
The severity lag depends type game inherent tolerance lag
Some game slower pace tolerate significant delay without need compensate whereas others faster pace considerably sensitive requires extensive use compensation playable shooter genre
Due various problem lag cause player insufficiently fast Internet connection sometimes permitted discouraged playing player server distant server host high latency one another
Extreme case lag may result extensive desynchronization game state
Lag due insufficient update rate client server cause problem generally limited client
Other player may notice jerky movement similar problem player associated affected client real problem lie client
If client update game state quick enough pace player may shown outdated rendition game turn cause various problem collision detection
If low update rate caused low frame rate opposed setting client game allow problem usually overshadowed numerous problem related processing
Both display control sluggish unresponsive
While may increase perceived lag important note different kind delay
In comparison problem server may cause significant problem client involved
If server unable unwilling accept packet client fast enough process timely manner client action may never registered
When server sends update client may experience freezing unresponsive game depending type lag compensation game us
Lag due network delay contrast often le problem
Though common actual effect generally smaller possible compensate type delay
Without form lag compensation client notice game responds short time action performed
This especially problematic shooter enemy likely move player attempt shoot margin error often small
There various method reducing disguising delay though many drawback may applicable case
If synchronization possible game client may able choose play server geographical proximity order reduce latency server may simply opt drop client high latency order avoid deal resulting problem
However hardly optimal solution
Instead game often designed lag compensation mind
Many problem solved simply allowing client keep track state send absolute state server directly client
For example client state exactly position player character character shot
This solution work eliminate problem related lag
Unfortunately also relies assumption client honest
There nothing prevents player modifying data send directly client indirectly via proxy order ensure always hit target
In online game risk cheating may make solution unfeasible client limited sending relative state
vector moved shot
As client normally allowed define main game state rather receive server main task compensation render virtual world accurately possible
As update come delay may even dropped sometimes necessary client predict flow game
Since state updated discrete step client must able estimate movement based available sample
Two basic method used accomplish
Extrapolation attempt estimate future game state
As soon packet server received position object updated new position
Awaiting next update next position extrapolated based current position movement time update
Essentially client assume moving object continue direction
When new packet received position may corrected slightly
Interpolation work essentially buffering game state rendering game state player slight constant delay
When packet server arrives instead updating position object immediately client start interpolate position starting last known position
Over interpolation interval object rendered moving smoothly two position
Ideally interval exactly match delay packet due loss variable delay rarely case
Both method advantage drawback
Often order allow smooth gameplay client allowed soft change game state
While server may ultimately keep track ammunition health position client may allowed predict new game state based player action allowing player start moving server responded command
These change generally accepted normal condition make delay mostly transparent
Problems arise case high delay loss client prediction noticeably undone server
Sometimes case minor difference server may even allow incorrect change state based update client
Unlike client server know exact current game state prediction unnecessary
The main purpose lag compensation instead provide accurate effect client action
This important time player command arrived time moved world longer state player saw issuing command
A explicit example hit detection weapon fired shooter margin small potentially cause significant problem properly handled
Another way address issue store past game state certain length time rewind player location processing command
The server us latency player including inherent delay due interpolation see rewind time appropriate amount order determine shooting client saw time shot fired
This usually result server seeing client firing target old position thus hitting
In worst case player far behind server run historic data start leading target
This solution allows player aim directly seeing
But price aggravation effect latency player fire latency play part attacker
In many situation noticeable player taken cover notice carry receiving message server longer latency justify
This lead often false impression shot cover entirely inaccurate impression laggy
One design issue arises rewinding whether stop rewinding dead player lagged command soon die server continue running catch time death
Cutting compensation immediately prevents victim posthumously attacking killer meet expectation preserve natural advantage moving player round corner acquire target kill le time round trip stationary victim client
Rewinding criticised allowing high latency one player negatively affect experience player
Servers lag compensation sometimes reduce length player history stored enforce ping limit reduce problem
It possible client tell server server trust data receives
This method avoided possible due susceptibility simple matter route network data second computer insert fabricated hit message modifies existing one technique detected tool
However sheer scale game make computationally expensive solution like impossible
In example hybrid hit detection system used client tell server hit server performs vague test plausibility accepting claim
Trusting client result otherwise advantage disadvantage
A le common lag solution nothing server client extrapolate see cover latency
This produce incorrect result unless remote player maintain constant velocity granting advantage dodge back forth simply moving
Extended extrapolation also result remote player becoming visible though vulnerable example remote player sprint corner stop abruptly edge client render sprinting onward open duration latency
On side problem client give remote player started moving extra burst speed order push predicted location
It possible reduce perception lag
Techniques include playing animation action took place immediately timer host machine using camera transition hide warping
type online gaming entire game hosted game server data center user running locally forward action upstream game server
The game server render next frame game video compressed using sent downstream decompressed thin client
For cloud gaming experience acceptable lag element cloud gaming system thin client Internet LAN connection game server game execution game server video audio compression decompression display video must low enough user perception game running locally
Because tight lag requirement distance consideration come play currently limiting distance user cloud gaming game server approximately mile according company thus far operating cloud gaming service
There also much controversy lag associated cloud gaming
In multiplayer game using network architecture player computer render game graphic locally information player action sent server
For example player press button character instantly performs corresponding action
However consequence action enemy killed seen short delay due time taken action reach server
This acceptable long response player input fast enough
When using cloud gaming input player lead short delay response seen
Inputs must first transmitted remote server server must start rendering graphic action performed stream video back player network taking additional time
Thus player experience noticeable delay pressing button seeing something happen
Depending skill experience player cause disorientation confusion similar hamper navigation aiming game world
When rapidly inputting long combination move character synchronized button press
This usually cause severe confusion player resulting failure combination move
The extra input lag also make difficult play certain single player game
For example enemy take swing player player expected block time player screen show enemy commenced attacking enemy would already struck killed player server

Link aggregation LAG used describe various method using multiple parallel network connection increase throughput beyond limit one link one connection achieve
For link aggregation physical port must reside single switch
Split Trunking SMLT RSMLT remove limitation physical port allowed two switch
This term also known Trunking MLT Link Bundling Bonding NIC teaming
Link aggregation technique used network enable fast inexpensive transmission bulk data
The best feature link aggregation ability enhance increase network capacity maintaining fast transmission speed changing hardware device thus reducing cost
LAG common technique establishing new network infrastructure using extra cabling current requirement
Labor cost much cost cabling
Thus network extension required extra cable used without incurring additional labor
However done extra port available
This best feature LAG
A communication system keep working even link fails
In situation link capacity reduced data flow interrupted
Formerly many technique used networking IEEE standard always preferred
LAG support network load balancing
Different load balancing algorithm set network engineer administrator
Furthermore network speed increased small increment saving resource cost
With kind implementation link piece hardware standardized engineered affect network efficiency link speed
Additionally kind port broadcast etc
must reside single switch logical switch

The Internet Things IoT environment object animal people assigned unique identifier given ability transfer data network without requiring interaction
Latency delay input system desired outcome term understood slightly differently various context latency issue also vary one system another
Latency greatly affect usable enjoyable electronic mechanical device well communication
Latency communication demonstrated live transmission various point earth communication ground transmitter satellite satellite receiver take time
People connecting distance live event seen wait response
This latency wait time introduced signal travelling geographical distance well various piece communication equipment
Even limited speed light refractive index cable repeater amplifier along length introduce delay
expression much time take data get one designated point another
In environment example AT T latency measured sending returned sender time considered latency
Ideally latency close zero possible
The contributor network latency include special case network latency Internet large network
The factor determine latency Internet
However distance transmission medium number hop equipment server greater smaller network
Internet latency measurement would generally start exit network end return requested data Internet resource
length time take computer act signal telling stop decide response event
important factor determining Internet latency
A WAN busy directing traffic produce delay whether resource requested server another computer network elsewhere Internet
LAN user also experience delay WAN busy
In either example delay would still exist even rest hop including server desired data located entirely free traffic congestion

The represents amount time required data travel sender receiver
While computer network posse inherent amount latency amount varies suddenly increase various reason
People perceive unexpected time delay
No network traffic travel faster speed light
On home distance device small light speed matter Internet connection becomes factor
Under perfect condition light requires roughly m travel mile kilometer
Furthermore Internet traffic travel cable carry signal fast light due principle physic called
Data fiber optic cable example requires least m travel mile
Besides limit physic additional network latency caused traffic routed Internet server device
The typical latency Internet connection also varies depending type
The study Measuring Broadband America February reported typical Internet connection latency common form broadband service The latency Internet connection fluctuate small amount one minute next additional lag even small increase becomes noticeable surfing Web running online application
The following common source Internet lag Spikes Internet utilization peak usage time day often cause lag
The nature lag varies service provider person geographic location
Unfortunately moving location changing Internet service individual user avoid kind lag
Multiplayer online game Web site application utilize shared Internet server
If server become overloaded activity client experience lag
Satellite wireless Internet connection particularly susceptible signal interference rain
Wireless interference cause network data corrupted transit causing lag delay
Some people play online game install device called local network
A lag switch specially designed intercept network signal introduce significant delay flow data back gamers connected live session
You little solve kind lag problem avoiding playing use lag switch fortunately relatively uncommon
Sources network lag also exist inside home network follows Any network eventually bog many active client using time
Network among multiple client mean sometimes waiting request processed causing lag
A person replace router powerful model add another router network help alleviate problem
Similarly network contention occurs residence modem connection Internet provider saturated traffic Depending try avoid many simultaneous Internet downloads online session minimize lag
PCs client device also become source network lag unable process network data quickly enough
While modern computer sufficiently powerful situation slow significantly many application running simultaneously
Even running application generate network traffic introduce lag example misbehaving program consume percent available CPU utilization device delay computer processing network traffic application
A hijack computer network interface cause perform sluggishly similar overloaded
Running network device help detect worm
Enthusiast online gamers example often prefer run device wired instead home Ethernet support lower latency
While saving typically millisecond practice wired connection also avoid risk wireless interference result significant lag occurs
The impact lag depends person network degree level network performance grown accustomed
Users expect long latency tend notice temporary lag additional m
Dedicated online gamers hand strongly prefer network connection run le m latency quickly notice lag level
In general online application perform best network latency stay m additional lag noticeable user

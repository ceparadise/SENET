QA defined procedure set procedure intended ensure product service development work complete opposed afterwards meet specified requirement
QA sometimes expressed together QC single expression quality assurance control
In order implement effective QC program enterprise must first decide specific product service must meet
Then extent QC action must determined example percentage unit tested lot
Next data must collected example percentage unit fail result reported management personnel
After corrective action must decided upon taken example defective unit must repaired rejected poor service repeated charge customer satisfied
If many unit failure instance poor service occur plan must devised improve production service process plan must put action

When item could crucial securing conviction appears court judge jury want sure really relevant crime
The way fulfilling requirement make concept quality central everything forensic investigator evidence collecting presenting court
This striving quality confined found industry pharmaceutical aerospace
The underlying goal offer product service public safe effective
In forensic science quality evidence important evidence submitted court guilty may go unpunished equally innocent person may lose liberty
The term quality control QC quality assurance QA often used interchangeably
What meaning may differ place place different kind activity
Put simply QC cover different activity done fulfill quality requirement product service
In forensic science might cover need run analysis keep record exactly done microscopic examination hair sample
The term QA broader one covering overall system dealing evidence includes issue staff training qualification laboratory environment
A disorganized laboratory clear chain command reasonably said providing good QA
In article term used cover aspect quality forensic investigation
The idea quality began medieval craftsman organized guild dedicated making product high standard
Products reached quality standard inspecting committee would receive special quality mark
Master craftsman began add quality mark product guard reputation standard
Customers bought product bearing inspection master craftsman mark assured quality purchase
It twentieth century concept quality broadened include many product service including forensic science
The medieval quality mark evolved general idea standard procedure metric measurement behavior whatever needed particular activity guarantee quality output
Standards vary place place need kind international reference
After result DNA vary depending country laboratory done
If defense order second opinion merely confuses matter second lab follows different procedure first one
The ISO International Organization Standardization series set international standard quality management established constantly updated revised
A lab dedicated forensic investigation registered ISO standard give proof quality work
Another important idea improvement quality benchmarking
This involves search benchmark example best practice best way something comparing current practice benchmark
Quality evolving concept organization individual continually challenged reach standard
In science method equipment changing time laboratory personnel must keep adapt
For crime investigation good thing mean enhancing court confidence evidence presented
In context forensic investigation cover scientific legal ethical aspect work laboratory scientist police officer
Forensic science involves many different discipline chemistry engineering
Whatever nature evidence however preservation deterioration contamination paramount
particular vulnerable respect
Protective clothing scene restricted access help preserve evidence present
After proper securing packaging essential
Once laboratory evidence must correctly stored may involve refrigeration protection moisture must never left unattended unsecured case tampering theft
When come laboratory investigation evidence Standard Operating Procedures SOPs Standard Methods SMs must followed
These written instruction carry given task using properly tried tested method
These SOPs SMs change time new method equipment
evidence emerge
A court would rightly impressed discover forensic laboratory still carrying example analysis according method
A wide range equipment including spectrometer gas chromatographs used forensic laboratory
An important part ensuring equipment properly used staff received correct training
The equipment must also properly regularly calibrated run reference sample ensure correct operation
It must also regularly maintained replaced upgraded fault occur
Quality standard apply much people working forensic laboratory equipment method use
First person must appropriate scientific qualification job
Requirements may vary person written job description including responsibility duty skill required
The manager laboratory several year experience forensic work
Technicians qualification appropriate type work carrying
Everyone work need supervised audited internally externally
Because forensic science rapidly evolving discipline essential provision continuing education everyone employed laboratory
This might include opportunity take higher degree certainly involve taking course learn new technique time time keeping professional literature increase awareness development
In addition important part forensic science professional prepared testify court
This may involve fierce individual must objective confident enough defend work well making principle detail involved accessible judge jury
Everyone working forensic laboratory must take scientific objective approach work one would laboratory setting
This mean unbiased prepared repeat experiment using control reference sample keeping accurate record procedure carried result obtained
Over special requirement forensic investigator relating ethical legal aspect work
Perhaps important requirement awareness importance evidence
This mean must clear court exactly happened evidence moment collection presentation courtroom
Everyone handled evidence way must sign record
Only unbroken chain evidence judge jury sure relevance evidence crime investigation
Not must evidence properly handled accounted time careful record must also kept operation carried
At one time would hand written
Now however many computerized laboratory information handling system
The forensic laboratory using recognized acceptable system personnel trained correct use
People choose work forensic science generally keen interest subject motivated help solve crime see justice done
However unknown forensic investigator maybe stress workload maybe sinister reason lose destroy evidence make mistake even falsify result
The system allow rapid detection correction kind incident
Laboratories forensic work apply accreditation independent third party also seen important part
In accreditation carried American Society Crime Laboratory Directors Laboratory Accreditation Board
A satisfactory evaluation inspection organization staffing facility laboratory lead accreditation
After full carried every five year
Many laboratory United States accredited way similar scheme apply part world
Forensic science stand still come quality discipline must always striving improve

Historically structure classification terminology attribute metric applicable derived extracted subsequent ISO quality model also known SQuaRE
Based model CISQ defined five major desirable structural characteristic needed piece software provide Reliability Efficiency Security Maintainability adequate Size
Software quality measurement quantifies extent software program system rate along five dimension
An aggregated measure software quality computed qualitative quantitative scoring scheme mix weighting system reflecting priority
This view software quality positioned linear continuum supplemented analysis critical programming error specific circumstance lead catastrophic outage performance degradation make given system unsuitable use regardless rating based aggregated measurement
Such programming error found system level represent production issue whilst even far numerous programming error account le production issue

Critical Programming Errors specific architectural coding bad practice result highest immediate long term business disruption risk
These quite often depend heavily context business objective risk
Some may consider respect naming convention others preparing ground knowledge transfer example consider absolutely critical
Critical Programming Errors also classified per CISQ Characteristics
Basic example Newer proposal quality model Quamoco propagate direct integration definition quality attribute measurement
